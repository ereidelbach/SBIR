        "abstract": "In this program, we will develop a breakthrough technology that will enable wafer-scale epitaxial lift-off (ELO) of GaN power device heterostructures from low-dislocation-density bulk GaN substrates. This technology will be used to provide a low-cost vertical junction field effect transistors (VJFETs) with high breakdown voltage (greater than 1,200 V) and high current capability (greater than 100 A).   Despite the recent commercial success of GaN-based optical and electronic devices, the high dislocation density resulting from the use of mismatched substrates leads to fundamental performance, reliability, and thermal conductivity limitations in vertical power device applications. Bulk GaN substrates with low dislocation density (less than 10^5 cm-2) are under development in small diameters (1 inch - 2 inch) but at high cost.   MicroLink is an industry leader in the commercialization of ELO and in the reuse of GaAs and InP substrates for multi-junction solar cells. MicroLink is also a leading producer of GaAs VJFETs and HBTs. The proposed principal investigator carried out pioneering work on photoelectrochemical wet etching of GaN materials. We will leverage this expertise to develop a new ELO-based layer transfer technology using reusable bulk GaN templates for epitaxial growth to enable high quality GaN materials at dramatically lower cost. We will demonstrate the viability of this technology using a novel vertical junction FET device, which leverages our experience in producing GaAs VJFETs. We have assembled a team of world-class partners with expertise on GaN epitaxial growth, bulk GaN substrates, modeling,  power device design, and device testing.\n",

        "abstract": "A chemical threat agent mode of action is often initiated through a selective interaction with a biological molecule or structure. The agent binding mimics normal cellular processes, but then overruns natural control mechanisms leading to toxic and lethal effects. The binding is used as a basis for sensing the agent. We are exploiting the native binding mechanism, designing and producing prototypes of sensing elements that provide benefits over conventional antibody - based systems. First, the direct detection in portable field applicable prototype eliminates bulky and unstable antibodies. Our custom developed interfaces allow for higher loading of the recognition molecules on the transducer, increasing its sensitivity and dynamic range. Additionally, extended stability of our tranducer provides sufficient storage and operation lifetimes for field application. Another advantage gained by using the native interaction mechanism for detection combined with the transducer design reduces  false - positives  and increases reliability. Only the active agent binds its native target molecule unlike antibody based detection where similar cross - reacting biomolecules or denatured agent actuate a signal. The concept limits interferences and efforts that may attempt to mask or mimic chemical threats. The Phase II project focuses on transition of the proven concept into portable integrated fully functional prototype of the detector.",

It is not uncommon for the garments to be torn or punctured in the field during critical mission operations.   This compromises the protection and safety of the Soldier. Typical field repair methods involve patching the tear in the field, which is temporary, ineffective and time consuming, further limiting mission capability.

Mainstream evaluated micro-sensors for monitoring temperature, humidity, CO2, and O2 for breath monitoring for the self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). Advanced CO2 separating technology combined with micro-sensors and controls allows for optimal control over system components, eliminates heat-generating CO2 scrubbers, and regulates humidity and air quality. We fabricated, characterized, and demonstrated several devices and measured the rate of CO2 removal from exhaled breath mixtures over a range of temperatures. Based on the device performance, the rate of CO2 removal was 1.10 L/m2min, which would require a 7.1\" x 9.1\" x 6.5\" cell to remove 2 L/min CO2. The CO2 removal system will weigh 5.7 lb. An inline micro-sensor array with microcontroller was designed as a modular, drop-in attachment for existing systems. The pack-mounted microcontroller would be 133 cm3, weigh 1.5 lb, and consume 50 mW. Further development of the enhanced SCBA system in the Phase II will optimize the performance of the CO2 removal system and transition the technology into a functional prototype, which will be evaluated for product development.",

        "abstract": "In this Phase II program, improved performance SWIR sensors with extended wavelength response to 2.5 microns will be developed using two disruptive technologies, which Amethyst has successfully demonstrated in the Phase I program: unipolar barrier (e.g., nBn) detector structures, and defect passivation via hydrogenation. This two-pronged approach addresses the main performance limitation of extended SWIR sensors: defects in the crystalline InGaAs material. Defect concentrations are high in extended wavelength InGaAs because, in order to achieve the wider spectral response, it is necessary to use a material composition that is mismatched to the InP substrate (contrary to the case of conventional SWIR InGaAs). The approach for conventional SWIR does not work well when applied to extended wavelength SWIR, because the large defect concentrations produce large dark current and noise. In the Amethyst approach of this program, an advanced detector architecture is used, which is more defect tolerant than conventional photodiodes, and the defects in the InGaAs materials will be passivated with a proprietary hydrogenation process. The result will be an order of magnitude decrease in dark current in extended wavelength SWIR sensors. Amethyst has partnered with FLIR systems to ensure rapid insertion of this technology into high value TRL systems.",

        "abstract": "Elevated levels of human butyrylcholinesterase (hBuChE) confer protection from chemical warfare nerve agents and other organophosphorous chemicals.  As a prophylactic, the key to enabling this protection is the ability to maintain elevated concentrations of hBuChE in the plasma for days or weeks.  Thus far, plasma-derived hBuChE and PEGylated recombinant forms of BuChE (rBuChE) have been tested in humans.  However, both have fallen short of providing cost-effective protection in scenarios where repeated intravenous administration by a health care worker is impractical.  Qrono proposes to meet the need for an organophosphorous prophylaxis with custom developed, injectable microparticles that will sustain hBuChE delivery for 10 days.  In Phase I, Qrono optimized the design of hBuChE-containing microparticles using its proprietary formulation design software, validated their in vitro release and simulated their pharmacokinetics for animal models and humans.  Qronos unique computational approach to formulation development provides greater efficiency and accuracy in the design of depot medications than the industry standard experiment driven methods.  In Phases II and III, Qrono will test the pharmacokinetics and prophylactic capabilities of its hBuChE formulation with nerve agent challenge studies in animal models and then pursue commercialization through clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "We propose an Acousto-Optic Tunable Filter (AOTF) Spectropolarimetric Imaging System for Enhanced Standoff Chemical Detection at Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) wavelengths.  This work entails development of suitable LWIR material, design of the LWIR AOTF, and design of the hyperspectral imaging sensor using a focal plane array. Currently, there is no technologically mature, commercially available material at reasonable price for AOTF imaging in the LWIR wavelength range. We have been actively researching suitable materials for LWIR AOTF imaging systems for some time, and we also develop AOTF products commercially.  We propose using mercurous halide crystals to fabricate the AOTF. The AOTF component has no moving parts, making it a rugged and reliable device, and it provides polarimetric imaging capabilities. Polarization analysis adds a valuable signature feature to imaging data, allowing a wide variety of targets to be detected with greatly enhanced contrast.  The proposed hyperspectral polarimetric imaging system will have discrimination capabilities comparable to existing hyperspectral imaging chemical/biological sensors. The sensor will be able to passively detect small chemical plumes (25 meters or smaller) of a chemical agent such as sarin at relevant concentrations (less than 10 ppmv) at a distance of 5 kilometers or more under ambient conditions.",

The SWIR imager will provide high dynamic range and high speed images simultaneously, without sacrificing spatial resolution or field of view.

        "abstract": "Currently, the United States Military encounters many scenarios where soldiers must enter hazardous areas, while maintaining isolation from contaminants such as chemical and biological agents as well as hazardous material exposure. This requires that the soldiers respiratory tract be isolated to prevent exposure to these contaminants. In order to accomplish this, the soldiers wear protective suits and/or masks which include a respiratory isolation system, more commonly called a rebreather.  Inherently, current rebreather technologies fall short in several areas creating both discomfort and unsafe conditions for the soldier.  Lynntech proposes a safe and novel solution to address these concerns by developing a scrubber based off a high surface area macroporous ionic resin with advanced grafting techniques using amines to create a fully regenerable sorbent to be used for carbon dioxide capture within the self contained breathing apparatus. This sorbent eliminates dusting, operates at a much more neutral pH value, has potential for increased carbon dioxide capacity, and is more tolerant of high levels of humidity. Additionally, the sorbent eliminates ice packs by creating no noticeable heat of reaction and thus reduces the overall weight and lifetime costs of the rebreather apparatus ($/unit carbon dioxide absorbed).",

The proposed exoskeleton will allow the soldier to perform dynamic movements such as running at 10mph for 30 minutes, extended long jumps, and traversing over large objects, with a reduced metabolic cost.  This system will significantly extend and contribute to the state of the art in exoskeleton design.  In conjunction with our teammates, we will use the latest passive energy storage, actuation, and controls technology to develop a lightweight fully functional untethered lower body exoskeleton at a Technology Readiness Level 6.  We also offer an option to extend the lower body development into the upper body, by developing tethered arms that are tightly coupled to the existing Mark II suit and have the ability to lift 100 pounds, perform gravity compensation of the suit, and add augmented arm strength.

        "abstract": "Traditional design approaches to developing exoskeleton systems are not capable of demonstrating the performance improvements currently envisioned by TALOS. At the masses currently envisioned for TALOS, no anthropomorphic exoskeleton device has been demonstrated that can improve dynamic human capabilities. Some are able to improve slow tasks such as peak lifting capabilities, but in all cases these devices have hindered the agility and performance of the operator. However, these dynamic tasks are critical to the everyday function of the SOF warfighter and accordingly critical to the design performance of the device. It points to a major technical limitation towards reaching the programs goals: how do we add enough power to a human such that it overcomes the weight of the exoskeleton and ultimately the load of armor added to the warfighter.  To this end, we are focusing on the development of a TALOS device and seeking to develop a limited armor mobile exoskeleton for performance augmentation. Specifically, the design will initially be tailored towards augmenting the user's peak performance capabilities for dynamic tasks. The primary insight motivating this work is that the development of ultra-light exoskeletons with high specific power actuators would provide the best opportunity to develop such a system.",

Current approaches to management of chronic pain, especially the use of opiates, are fraught with drawbacks and risks to military patients and cannot be deployed easily in the military theatre&#894; therefore, new technologies that simplify treatment protocols and improve outcomes would be highly advantageous. Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves can yield therapeutic benefit if applied properly&#894; however, state-of-the-art devices are suboptimal. We propose herein a suite of implantable, tunable, and fully bioresorbable electronic devices for transient, peripheral nerve stimulation for the management of chronic pain. The devices are made entirely of materials of predictable and controllable degradation that circumvent the technical limitations of state-of-the-art devices by enabling device biodegradation after the completion of treatment and eliminating the need for repeated surgeries. The output of the proposed work will be the demonstration of function, efficacy and bioresporption of a fully transient implantable nerve stimulation (TINS) device. At the end of the Phase II period a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 will be achieved for the described transient electronic system.",

        "abstract": "The increasing sophistication of missile defense technologies has resulted in the equally increasing sophistication of defense mitigating technologies. Whereas first generation systems concentrated on early detection, early boost phase, and/or terminal phase intercepts (i.e. low-altitudes), the current paradigm is to create systems that address all areas of the threat trajectory, increasingly in the high altitude late-boost and mid-course phases. Within these high-altitude phases, unique transient propulsive events can occur, such as staging, thrust termination, maneuvering, and detonation. Other more benign transient events, such as debris field discrimination, can also occur. Consequently, any attempt to simulate these phenomena for system identification, targeting, and/or discrimination have to take into account the transient and continuum/rarefied nature of the flow. Adding to this complexity, gas-particle interactions and chemical kinetic effects need to be included for accurate modeling. The problem to be addressed within the present effort is the accurate modeling of high altitude transient phenomena associated with short duration propulsive and/or detonative events that contain both continuum and rarefied regions while taking into account all the aforementioned modeling concerns and leveraging our existing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technologies to minimize development effort.",

Improper handling of e-waste results in vast amounts of toxic waste being sent to landfill and leaching into the water supply. Due to these concerns, e-waste recycling is a rapidly growing industry. Unfortunately, most current e-waste recycling processes rely on either manual hand sorting or differential density sorting methods. Manual hand sorting is expensive in the United States and has been associated with major environmental damage overseas. Differential density sorting is expensive and is not very effective for sorting rare earth materials.When properly sorted, there are a significant amount of valuable recyclable materials in e-waste. Recycling rates for e-waste currently are low in part because e-waste recyclers charge a fee for recycling in order to make a profit. Legislative action in many states may increase this rate, but the long-term viability of e?waste recycling depends upon economical approaches to recovering these valuable materials. E-waste contains a significant amount of rare earth elements, particularly neodymium and dysprosium, which are valuable and expected to increase in importance in the coming years.\n \nThe objective of the proposed Phase II research is to complete development of the technology successfully tested in the Phase I research. NRT has obtained commitments from two e-waste processors who are interested in participating in providing Phase III funding and hosting a Phase II prototype sorting unit.\n \nA significantincrease in the anticipated amount of e-waste has been observed over the last few years and is expected to continue as the time between introduction and obsolescence becomes continually smaller.

        "abstract": "The environmental impact of wood coatings has become a pressing issue as the manufacturing of wooden products such as flooring, cabinetry, furniture and doors moves back to the United States amidst rising labor costs overseas. For 30 years, the bulk of these products have been painted in countries with lax environmental regulations, allowing the use of inexpensive but environmentally hazardous oil-based alkyd coatings.Wood furniture manufacturers in the United States generally use polyurethane coatings with low volatile organic components (VOCs). In fact, this niche portion of the wood furniture coatings market is the largest use for polyurethane coatings. But they are too expensive for use on most wood furniture and are also based on toxic and unsustainable chemistry. Ideal would a low cost and sustainable, oil-based polymer system that had no VOCs, could clean up with water, and offered the wear and stain resistance of polyurethane coatings. It would help manufacturers compete for the bulk wood products business while also motivate them to replace environmentally toxic polyurethane with a green coatings technology.Ironically, the best source for inexpensive, high performance oil-based polymer is nanotechnology. Instrumental Polymer Technologies has developed a unique evolution polymerization process to produce high molecular weight dendrimers at low cost and with sustainable raw materials. Dendrimers are spherical polymers that branch out from their center, resulting in a specific core and surface, like a cell. In Phase I, the company demonstrated the synthesis of high molecular weight dendrimers with a core of tough polycarbonate and with soy methyl ester, otherwise known as common biodiesel, attached to the dendrimer\u2019s surface. Amino acids were bound to the core to achieve water dispersibility. With viscosity only slightly higher than oil, the dendrimers had the unique property of being able to be applied as 100 percent solids, but easily dispersed in water for easy cleanup. Air dried films had properties nearing that of polyurethane coatings. They also were found to create a uniquely smooth, high gloss finish that will reduce sanding and buffing steps.\n \nIn Phase II, Instrumental Polymer Technologies will develop the concept into a marketable product which is cheaper than alkyds but with performance equivalent to that of polyurethane coatings. The resulting dendrimers will marketed as a raw material to wood coatings producers through the current distribution network. Several coatings manufacturers have already shown interest in sampling the technology. Production will use reactors currently usedfor polycarbonate polyol production.",

Under the EPA Phase I SBIR, IST has successfully demonstrated a prototype combining UV-A light emitting Plasma-shells with TiO2 coated bars and its efficiency in the decomposition of methylene blue. The proposed research incorporated the efficiency and speed advantages of a photocatalysis purification system while eliminating its major draw backs.This research will result in the replacement of fragile bulky UV quartz tubes in standard water purification systems with a rugged pack of lightweight Plasma-shells. In the proposed configuration, the UV producing surface area will be increased by several orders of magnitude making the TiO2-Plasma-shell system potentially much more powerful than current purification systems.

        "abstract": "There are approximately 7,000 flares in operation at industrial facilities across the United States. Flares are one of the largest volatile organic compounds (VOC) and air toxics emission sources. Based on a special emission inventory required by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality in 2007, highly reactive VOC emissions from 28 flares located in Harris County, Texas were 1469.5 tons in a year, which accounts for 60 percent of emissions from these facilities. Currently, there are no practical methods available to measure emission rate or control efficiency of flares. For air emissions inventories, flares are assumed to have an efficiency of 98 percent when their operations meet conditions codified in federal regulations (40 CFR\u00a760.18). Many studies have shown that this 98 percent efficiency assumption may not be valid, even when flares meet these regulatory requirements. If actual flare efficiency varies, it can cause large errors in emission inventories, affecting air quality planning, compliance, health impact assessments, and associated decisionmaking.\n\nThe proposed Flare Efficiency Monitoring System (FEMS) uses a 9-band \u201cstaring\u201d multi-spectral infrared (IR) imager to determine relative concentrations of CO2, CO, and hydrocarbons (HC) in the flare plume, then calculate flare combustion efficiency (CE) in real-time. The successful Phase I proof of concept demonstrated that this method is technically feasible. The experiments performed during Phase I established a very strong correlation (r2=0.9852) between known CE values and CE values measured with the FEMS technology. In addition to calculating flareCE in real-time, Phase I work also demonstrated that the FEMS technology can calculate CE and temperature at the pixel level, thereby producing a complete CE and temperature map of the flare plume. This feature can be valuable to flare operators and combustion engineers for analysis of spatial variability and temporal dynamics in flare combustion.\n\nIn Phase II, Providence will produce a working prototype of the FEMS and a calibration device. The prototype will be field tested on a large-scale industrial flare alongside other (less practical) methods of measuring flare CE (e.g., extractive method, PFTIR). The FEMS prototype will be capable of measuring flare CE at the pixel level and performing spatial and temporal averaging to provide an overall representation of flare CE in real-time. The real-time flare CE can then be supplied to a flare operator or control device through an industrial interface, providing a method to optimize flare operation and reduce overall emissions from flaring activities.",

        "abstract": "A team at EP Purification has performed research for the development and commercialization of low-cost microchannel plasma reactor modules capable of efficiently producing ozone for water treatment and other environmental applications in a slim form factor and size. The conservation of water resources for human consumption is a growing national priority. Ozone is a unique purification agent as it is the strongest oxidant and disinfectant available commercially. It is known to be extremely effective for neutralizing pathogens and the dissociation of toxic organic chemicals, making it ideal for the disinfection of water. Also, ozonation is generally regarded as being superior to traditional disinfection or cleaning methodologies (through a combination of chemical and thermal treatment processes) because the latter requires significant energy consumption to be effective (for heating water), and leaves a number of byproducts and chemical wastes after the process. The primary drawback of ozonation for utility and consumer applications at present is high cost (capital and operating), size and power consumption.In Phase I, EP Purification has developed and demonstrated a series of low cost and yet robust ozone generators based on massively-parallel plasmachemical processing of air or oxygen gases in large arrays of microchannel plasmas. Prototype modules have been realized that produce ozone at a rate of 10 g/hour and with an efficiency comparable to, or higher than, commercially available ozone generators. Furthermore, the size of the module is, at least a factor of 3 smaller than conventional units, and the reduction in production costs is expected be as much as a factor of two. EP Purification designed and fabricated basic modules (in the range of 10 g/h), including the pulse-power supply optimized for this unit, and modules can be combined to obtain the desired ozone production capacity. Currently, for example a ~100 g/hr ozone generation system has been designed by\u201cstacking\u201d basic modules. Additionally, an optimized power supply design was built and is being evaluated in field tests.\n \nIn Phase II, EP Purification will develop and commercialize a system capable of ozone production at a rate higher than 100 g/hour. Designed for treating water in small/medium system applications, this system will be considerably smaller, more efficient, and more cost effective from both capital and operating perspectives than existing technologies. Also, EP Purification has identified immediate markets of this technology and intends to commercialize this product in point-of-use applications, such as commercial laundries and food preservation during this Phase II program.",

        "abstract": "Plastics and petroleum-based foams are a conventional solution for the material needs of many industries. Today these non-biodegradable, fossil fuel derived products compose 13 percent of all municipal solid waste streams, as opposed to 1 percent in 1960. This waste stream is associated with a number of environmental concerns, including greenhouse gas generation from incineration, as well as land and water contamination through land filling. In addition, this waste stream has human health implications, as studies have shown bioaccumulation of toxins in the body. The constituents of these toxins are primarily used to produce plastics, and their accumulation results in negative effects on health and reproduction. Finally, the market costs for plastics are subject to the increasingly limited and expensive petroleum supply.Under the Phase I initiative, Ecovative developed a new material manufacturing process that harnesses fungi?s tendency to fill a void space with a homogenous mycological biopolymer. This research resulted in a 100 percent bio-based and home compostable material that is completely composed of fungal mycelium (the vegetative tissue of a fungus) and has elastomeric properties similar to the commonly used foam ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). The proposed Phase II initiative seeks to continue scaled development of this cost-competitive process for producing a high-performance replacement for expanded plastics, which will allow for commercialization of the product. This research will be focused around cost reduction, scaled manufacturing and pilot production of the mycological polymer.\n \nEcovative, an award-winning sustainable materials company, will leverage its expertise and current intellectual property in mycelium-based materials during this undertaking. Ecovative has scaled previous technologyand proven the economics of the mushroom material business by commercializing the MycoFoamTM platform in the protective packaging industry through a licensing partnership. The proposed mycological material to be scaled in the Phase II initiative is poised to replace EVA and expanded foams not addressable via the MycoFoamTM platform technology, as it exists today. There is industry demand for alternatives to EVA as shoe midsoles and baby play mats, as shown by letters of support. These applications will serve as a point of entry into commercial implementation of this new material while leveraging Ecovative?s pilot facility for scaled production of the mycological biopolymer. The outcome of this research will be a novel bio-product, as well as a commercial platform for the proposed bio-product to transform material production, use and disposal in numerous high-volume industries that wouldotherwise consume significant amounts of plastic.",

        "abstract": "Solvents are valuable processing tools in the chemical and related industries used to enhance mass transfer, heat transfer and processing aids not used in the final product. Solvents are very valuable but cause significant problems with volatility and associated emissions. Manufacturing processes that utilize green technology or solvents for process improvement and reduced emissions are very desirable. This program addresses a family of green solvents that are superior to conventional solvents and have low volatility, resulting in fewer emissions problems.Compact Membrane Systems has developed an amorphous perfluoro membrane to enhance the use of these desirable green solvents. Recent developments allow working with green amorphous perfluoropolymers, specifically, the elimination of perfluoro octanoic acids (PFOA) in the synthesis of these 15 directly responsive to the EPA\u2019s directive to eliminate PFOA surfactants.\n \nIn Phase I, Compact Membrane Systems demonstrated in laboratory scale the concept of efficiently drying ionic liquids (ILs) for reuse using a perfluorinated composite membrane as well as the economic advantage. Ionic liquids are potentially advantageous in the processing/extraction of sugars from cellulosic biomass. Sugar recovery requires mixing the IL with water. The wet ionic liquid must be dehydrated for reuse. Efficient water removal from the ionic liquid was observed despite the low driving force for water permeation. The water permeance was approximately constant over a wide range of water concentration and temperature. Permeation of the IL through the membrane is negligible, resulting in extremely high water/IL separation factors. This leads to quantitative recovery of the IL, which is critical for low-cost pretreatment of biomass.In Phase II, Compact Membrane Systems will scale up the membrane system and build a pilot test unit to demonstrate the concept in pilot scale. The membrane system and process conditions to achieve IL dehydration for recycle will be optimized. Through a long-term test, the company will demonstratesystem performance stability and resistance to process upsets such as daily startups and shutdowns. Using the pilot scale data, Compact Membrane Systems will conduct an engineering and economic analysis to highlight the economic advantage of the proposed concept versus conventional technologies suchas evaporation and will verify that the IL can still pre-treat cellulosic biomass after multiple membrane dehydration cycles.\n \nSeveral organizations, including pioneers in the development and use of ionic liquids for processing biomass, are interested in partnering with Compact Membrane Systems regarding the development and implementation of methods for dewatering ionic liquids.",

        "abstract": "There is unmet need for rapid, cost effective in vitro methods to identify chemicals that pose a hazard to the human brain. A number of in vitro assays utilizing primary cells have been tested in an effort to devise effective models to prioritize chemicals for further in depth toxicity studies. However, isolation of primary human neural tissue is cost and labor intensive, and cannot be produced in the quantities required for high throughput screening (HTS) and high content imaging (HCI). In addition, current systems do not include astrocytes which have a significant role in maintaining the health and function of the central nervous system. In Phase I, ArunA Biomedical (ArunA) addressed this deficit by developing hPSC derived neuron and glia co-culture system, containing progenitor cell derived neurons (hN2TM) and astrocytes (hAstroPro\u2122), which more faithfully recapitulates early neural development. The use of progenitor cells to produce these cells enables scalable, HCI-amenable formats for toxicant screening. During Phase I, we successfully optimized the production of assay-ready neurons and astrocytes, developed protocols for cryopreservation and plating of co-culture systems, and demonstrated the feasibility of co-culturing astrocytes and neurons at assay-optimized ratios. ArunA showed that the co-culture system could be used to document the toxic effects of neurotoxins on neurite outgrowth, a neuro-developmentally relevant endpoint. Phase I studies reinforced the need for a more representative system by demonstrating that known neurotoxins do indeed evoke different neuronal responses in the presence of astrocytes.\n\nIn Phase II, ArunA will develop protocols for human multi-cellular HCI &amp; HTS neurotox assays in a ready-to-use kit format. ArunA outlines objectives aimed at optimizing scale-up production of astrocytes from its proprietary progenitor stem cells, and implementing further improvements to the assay system so that our novel co-culture system can be adopted for diverse use to address a broader market. Importantly, by providing a neuron and glia co-culture system, ArunA will solve the problem of more faithful representation of human neural tissue. For example, in the long term, ArunA\u2019s multi-functional neural assays will enable electrophysiological multi-electrode array recordings which require a more physiologically representative environment that includes neurons and astrocytes. Moreover, developing products in which the end user can alter the ratio of neurons to astrocytes, will provide a unique system to examine the effects of compounds in a measured and more exacting system than the uncontrolled ratios of cells associated with all other commercially available systems.",

During blooms, many cyanotoxins in freshwater are known to cause damage to liver or damage to nerve axons and synapses. Though not strictly regulated, the EPA recommends the level of microcystins, cylindrospermopsins and anatoxins in drinking water not to exceed 1 ppb. Currently, cyanotoxin levels are monitored by collecting the samples are in the field and bringing them back to the laboratory for analysis. Compared with laboratory based methods, HJ Science &amp; Technology\u2019s portable onsite platform offers several important advantages, including reduction in time and cost, real-time data for better and more timely decision making, and reduction in reagent consumption. The heart of our innovation is a novel microfluidic device, consisting of novel microvalves and micropumps, with complete end-to-end assay automation capabilities. The proposed technology is inexpensive, easy to use, and designed to perform rapid cyanotoxin detections with sensitivity and specificity that are only currently achievable with laboratory-based instruments.\n \nIn Phase I, HJ Science &amp; Technology established the technical feasibility of the proposed technology by successfully fabricating microfluidic devices and performing automated immunoassay for microcystin in water samples. Specifically, microcystin standard curves with a limit of detection of 0.16 ppb were generated. The results are in excellent agreement with the manually prepared commercial ELISA kit.During the Phase II effort, HJ Science &amp; Technology will design and build a field-deployable portable instrument with microfluidic automation capable of performing onsite monitoring and detection of microcystin and other cyanotoxins. During the Phase II commercialization option, the company will deploy its instrument for field testing at Pinto Lake Pinto Lake, a nearby popular recreational spot, which has been plagued with seasonal algal blooms that release microcystin and other deadly toxins. As such, the field deployable instrument will be specifically designed and constructed to meet the challenging requirement of onsite environmental monitoring. In Phase III, HJ Science &amp; Technology will begin manufacturing for the commercial market.

Damage is inherently calculated in a PD analysis without special procedures, making progressive failure analysis more practical.

There are, however, a significant number of people in the U.S. whose literacy deficits\neffectively prohibit opportunities for written self expression, including millions with cognitive disabilities. In this project we will design, develop and evaluate a universally designed multimedia compositioning tool, called Digital Storyteller (DST). In Phase I a limited prototype of DST was developed and evaluated in a pilot study with 17 study participants with intellectual\ndisabilities. The results of the Phase I project demonstrated the technical merit and feasibility of the DST approach for providing a platform for individuals with intellectual disabilities to more independently create multimedia compositions when compared to two leading mainstream compositing tools. In Phase II we will expand the system to develop and test specialized\nmodules of the system that will be optimized for specific outputs, such as Book Report, Short Answer, Essay, Activity Reporting, Therapy Journal, Diary Keeping, Web Log, Storytelling or Memoir modules, and evaluate the usability and efficacy of the system for increasing literary output.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will have immediate value for the pharmaceutical industry by accelerating research and discovery of new drugs, and also increasing production efficiency and safety. The technology also is applicable in many other sectors; e.g., monitoring natural polymers, such as dissolution of gelatin used in food or pharmaceutical applications, flocculation of impurities by water purification polymers, entrapment of oil by surfactants and other agents used in combating oil spills, and more. The quantitative kinetics of molecular weight changes during all these processes will allow deeper understanding of the fundamental physical and chemical forces that drive them. Therefore, many commercial and scientific opportunities exist for the proposed technology, yielding the potential for significant impact across multiple industries. With demonstrated feasibility on applications in protein therapeutics and early adoption by several key users, the initial market for this technology and instrumentation could expand quickly, and sales could reach $10M within several years of delivering a commercial product. The overall market for the technology will increase in time as other application sectors are developed. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a new technology for monitoring aggregation in therapeutic protein solutions, which will have wide-ranging impact in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Protein aggregation is a major problem across these sectors engaged in developing new protein pharmaceuticals. Protein aggregation can elicit immune responses against the protein itself, severely reduce bioavailability, and is a significant hurdle in the drug development pipeline. This new technology can simultaneously and quantitatively monitor the stability of many independent protein formulations for hours, days, months, or longer, all under the control of a single instrument and without any significant human intervention. Because the technology is based on laser light scattering, it provides a rigorous means of monitoring the protein aggregation process. It is based on fundamental laws of physics, and not on empirical or inferential means. The implementation and use of this technology could revolutionize drug discovery, formulation, and quality control dimensions and accelerate development of new drugs while making existing ones safer and more efficiently produced. The technology can be used wherever proteins are under development for fighting diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer&#039;s, diabetes, and various forms of cardiovascular disease.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide enhanced vision for patients after cataract surgery. Current devices, called intraocular lenses (IOLs), can correct certain vision problems. However, commercially available IOLs do not provide the same restoration of capabilities as other surgeries, such as hip replacements. In particular, current IOLs do not address the problems of presbyopia which is the continual degradation of the ability to change focus from far to near object which eventually results in the need for reading glasses. Devices that attempt to address presbyopia, but fail, represent a $500MM current market. This project has a novel approach to the problem and the opportunity to positively affect the lives of the 3 million people each year that are undergoing cataract surgery. The proposed project will continue to push the bounds of our understanding of the mechanisms of human vision control. Previous work done to measure the forces in the eye used to change vision from near to far objects, will be utilized in the design and testing of an IOL that can truly provide changes in vision like the normal lens of a 30 year old human. Several iterations of design will be tested in a rhesus monkey model to determine the best way to capture the forces in the eye, the optimal design of the shape of the device and materials used, the choice of optic material, and the procedures to insert and activate the IOL. All with the objective to turn currently available forces in the eye into refractive changes in eyesight. The ultimate goal of this project is to have a design that can be used for an FDA application for human clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a cost-effective replacement to x-ray-based imaging devices currently used in dentistry. Several peer-reviewed scientific studies have suggested a link between pediatric exposure to x-rays and subsequent development of head tumors. The recent introduction of CT-based dental imaging systems has actually increased x-ray exposure, going against the long-established public health policy of reducing exposure to levels as low as reasonably acceptable (ALARA). This project will provide a cost-effective alternative to dental x-rays (and hence reduce pediatric radiation exposure). The device will also improve the depiction of root disease, which is currently poorly described with x-ray-based systems. The ability to describe both hard and soft tissues with the instrument is valuable to oral surgeons, who must consider the cosmetic results of reconstructive surgery as well as the functional aspects. Commercial impact is demonstrated by the fact that a chain of 2,500 dental clinics, intrigued by the ability of the system to guide oral surgery, has already offered to invest in the project. The proposed project involves the development of several novel and important research activities that address critical requirements of dental imaging: speed, spatial resolution, avoidance of imaging artifacts due to oral hardware, safety, spatial footprint, cost, and energy budget. The first three of these requirements are addressed through the use of MRI gradient pulses that are hundreds of times faster and stronger than are conventionally used. Safety, energy and spatial footprint, and cost are addressed with novel coil manufacturing techniques that reduce fabrication time from months to days. Energy costs are addressed with novel regenerative schemes similar to those used in hybrid cars. By the end of the project, a working MRI dental system will have been constructed, with demonstrations of its effectiveness (on animal specimens). These steps will ready the product for subsequent human studies that will be required for approval by the FDA. Follow-on applications of the technology to non-dental uses (e.g., trauma, cancer detection) are anticipated.",

In the US, ethylene and propylene are the most commonly produced light olefins with annual production exceeding 25 million tons for ethylene and 16 million tons for propylene. It is estimated that over 120 trillion Btu of energy per year is consumed by the current distillation processes for the separation of ethylene/ethane and propylene/propane mixtures in the United States alone. The proposed work could lead to the development of novel membrane separation technology with the potential for significant energy and cost savings in the production of commodity chemicals such as ethylene and propylene. There is strong commercial market interest in technology that facilitates cost-effective olefin/paraffin separation compared to incumbent technologies. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to develop and commercialize a robust, cost-effective, olefin/paraffin membrane separation technology with high permeability and selectivity, as well as excellent operating stability. Bettergy has shown in the Phase I program that their unique composite membrane can separate propylene/propane gas mixture with propylene/propane selectivity of ~ 120, and propylene permeance up to 1.5\u00d710-8 mol/m2.s.Pa. More importantly, the membrane has demonstrated over 1500 hours of stable operation. In the Phase II program, the major focus will be placed on membrane optimization, scale-up process development and commercialization. Once fully developed, this membrane technology could be an attractive alternative to the highly energy-intensive cryogenic distillation process currently used.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in removing sulfur compounds from various fuels such as diesel, gasoline and mixture of refined fuels known as transmix. It is critically important to reduce sulfur levels below 10 ppm as the emissions from transportation vehicles can cause acid rain and associated undesired effects. Sulfur removal from fuels is even more critical for implementation of fuel cell technologies due to fuel reformer catalyst poisoning at sulfur levels as low as 1 ppm or below. Finally, there is a need for sulfur-tolerant catalysts and sulfur removal processes in value added chemical production using bio-derived and fossil derived fuels. The global market for hydro-desulfurization catalysts in the transportation fuel segment is estimated at over $1B and growing fast. The company&#039;s proposed catalyst could address a market size of $150-200M/yr or more. It may find additional applications in commercial markets in ultra-low sulfur diesel, fuel reformer technology and sulfur tolerant catalysts. The development of a scalable manufacturing method for advanced materials undertaken in this project will contribute to U.S. competitiveness and strengthen Cleantech and energy sectors in the state of KY. This project addresses the development of high performance catalysts needed for the removal of sulfur from hydrocarbon fuels. However, sulfur removal at concentrations below 50 ppm is difficult due to the presence of hetero-cyclic thiophenic species. During Phase I, the company developed a catalyst product and demonstrated its performance in terms of ultra-deep hydrodesulfurization activity, reducing sulfur levels from 200 ppm to much lower than 1 ppm in a variety of fuels. Phase II studies will allow optimization of the catalysts for hydrodesulfurization activity and mechanical properties. Catalysts with bi-functional activity toward aromatics hydrogenation and hydrodesulfurization will reduce several process steps, thereby reducing the costs involved in hydroprocessing of fuels. Phase II studies will enable development of a process for scalable production of nanowires. The fundamental insight from the performance can be extended toward designing various high performance catalysts using nanowire supports. Some beneficial effects using nanowire supports include unique active metal/support interactions; single crystal surfaces for uniform morphologies for active metals and their alloys and management of active sites. Specifically, in the case of hydrodesulfurization, nanowire supports provided an easier diffusion pathway for sulfur transfer to maintain active metal sites for desulfurization activity.",

The technology of the proposed project has the potential to make a broader impact by decreasing the risk of performing the bone graft harvesting procedure compared to current methods and consequently increase the number of surgeons who choose to collect a patient?s own bone graft in lieu of using inferior bone graft alternatives/substitutes. Furthermore, whereas fewer new, inexperienced surgeons are currently being trained to utilize the patient?s own bone graft because of the risks of current harvesting methods, these surgeons may be encouraged to perform the harvesting procedure with the introduction of the proposed concept. The increase in use of the patient?s own bone will benefit patients because of the widely accepted clinical benefits of autogenous bone graft compared to synthetic or exogenous alternative solutions. The proposed technology may also have a significant commercial impact to hospitals because of potential decreases in operating room time and post-operative patient hospitalization time (compared to the standard harvesting procedure) as well as decreased per-procedure product costs (compared to substitute bone graft products). The proposed project addresses the important unmet clinical need of enabling orthopaedic surgeons to collect bone graft from the patient?s pelvic bone in a minimally invasive manner without the patient morbidity and added surgical time intrinsic to the current standard bone graft harvesting methods. The research objectives of the proposed project are to explore various design enhancements to the minimum viable product and assess the impact of these changes on the value proposition; and to explore adjustments to the minimum viable product and assess their fit for use in additional surgical procedures not accessible by the minimum viable product. These objectives will be completed by investigating various new product features and manufacturing processes as well as testing these concepts in various pre-clinical settings. This project has strong intellectual merit because this transformative technological concept has the potential to disrupt the current methods that surgeons employ for harvesting bone graft by introducing a novel solution that improves patient outcomes, surgical time, and hospital costs.",

By providing significantly clearer brain signals, tEEG will resolve conventional EEG?s major drawback of poor signal quality that clinicians and researchers have been struggling with for decades. tEEG can advance diagnosis and fill unmet clinical and research needs such as detection of biomarkers to quantify various neurological disorders. Second, commercially, tEEG can transform the market landscape and set a new standard for EEG equipment. The fundamental improvement promised by tEEG and its non-invasive nature are particularly appealing. tEEG could greatly simplify and advance the diagnosis of a wide spectrum of neurological disorders (epilepsy, sleep disorders, stroke, Parkinson?s, Alzheimer?s, etc.) and more effectively guide neurosurgical and other medical procedures. Third, the fundamental improvement in spatial resolution and artifacts rejection in EEG signals will help advance the understanding of brain activity, leading to new discoveries in the research of various brain diseases and neurological disorders. The proposed project aims to develop a portable tripolar concentric ring electrode (TCRE) electroencephalography (tEEG) recording system and perform a comprehensive clinical evaluation to demonstrate that tEEG can detect certain important brain EEG signals better than conventional EEG. EEG is the primary diagnostic tool for epilepsy, the most common serious brain disorder worldwide, but misdiagnosis occurs in up to 50% of the patients. Artifact contamination seriously hinders the effectiveness of EEG and is a root cause of misdiagnosis. tEEG automatically suppresses artifacts and increases the interpretability of EEG through two inventions: (1) a transformative electrode configuration - the TCRE; and (2) the proprietary tEEG Interface and digitizer. The TCRE, tEEG Interface, and digitizer together comprise a complete, Portable tEEG system with the data stored and displayed on a laptop. In this project, clinicians will evaluate tEEG against conventional EEG in areas such as usability, ability to suppress artifacts, and superiority in seizure detection. If successful, tEEG would generate intense interest in the field because of the significant clinical and research impact. We expect that comparing tEEG and EEG in a clinical setting will demonstrate the superiority of tEEG for diagnosing epilepsy.",

SWIR fluorophores produce no autofluorescence background while simultaneously enhancing tissue penetration depth and efficiency by factors of 10 or more. InView?s imaging platform can build large markets by the development of specialized image processing and analytical methods for specific applications in pharmaceutical manufacturing, food safety, solar panel and semiconductor inspection, machine vision, and navigation. InView?s camera platform embodies the revolutionary new sampling theory of compressive sensing, a field whose applications in information processing have grown exponentially. The innovative architecture and the state-of-the-art software already embedded in the camera and user interface can enhance and possibly transform lab and clinical modalities in dynamic multi-fluorescence imaging, in vivo functional imaging, tissue viability and pathology studies, and advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will result in an operational low-cost, multi-color shortwave infrared (SWIR) camera that can be directly mounted on microscopes for supporting compelling micro-imaging applications in scientific, industrial and biomedical imaging. The electro-optical, opto-mechanical, and processing software architecture of the camera is based on Compressive Sensing, a new sampling technique that reduces data collection requirements for high resolution imaging to well below Nyquist limits. This design does not use expensive sensor arrays or complicated spectrometers. Instead, high-resolution pictures are computationally constructed from single-detector measurements. The ?single-pixel camera? architecture was commercialized by InView as a monochromatic SWIR imager. In Phase 1, InView successfully demonstrated that only simple modifications to its monochromatic camera design can produce full color imaging.

Plastic bags are an environmental eyesore that pollute waterways and kill wildlife. Local governments are now passing laws to ban the use of plastic bags in efforts to hinder the spread of pollution. The U.S. plastic bag market was over $10.6 billion in 2013. While society and government have placed more emphasis on diverting compostable waste (25% to 40% of garbage) from landfills, the average American throws away 1,500 pounds of garbage every year. Lignin output is expected to increase in the ensuing years due to an increase in lignin extraction plants coming on-line. These modified lignin resins range in lignin concentration depending on the application. Utilizing compostable lignin resins eliminates plastic waste and makes composting easier. Using compostable bags and liners removes the risk of plastic contamination. The objectives for this project include the determination of ideal production conditions for modified lignins and the creation of formulations for a variety of applications. The commercialization of these modified lignins will help to alleviate the plastic waste problems that are impacting municipalities across the country. The objectives of this research are to optimize production of chemically modified lignin and thermoplastics, develop quality control methods for raw lignin and modified lignin, and create more proprietary formulations to expand lignin applications. Modified lignins were successfully produced in large scale during the Phase I project. Phase II will continue to improve and expand the modified lignin production by optimizing for physical properties and cost. The variables selected for this optimization include reaction time, reagent quantity, and reaction temperature. Developing a continuous process is also an objective for this effort. Compounding of modified lignin with other thermoplastics will also be optimized for physical properties and cost. The variables for this portion include screw design, screw speed, and temperature. Quality control methods for raw lignin and modified lignin will be developed using existing analytical methods tailored to the specifics of raw lignin and modified lignin. In addition, formulations will be expanded to tailor blends to specific applications. Strength, elongation, modulus, and cost are a few of the factors that determine what formulation should be used for a particular application. The anticipated results of this Phase II project are to optimize the production process and produce consistent modified lignin.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to significantly enhance reliability and security of critical network infrastructure, and ease network management tasks. Through multiple pilot deployments on live networks, a prototype version of the company&#039;s software tool has found a number of serious errors and vulnerabilities that were missed by existing state-of-the-art auditing techniques and monitoring tools, and was able to perform real-time network-wide verification within as little as one millisecond. When more fully developed under this project, the company&#039;s technology will help ensure highly available networking infrastructures. To this end the company will work with Urbana-Champaign Big Broadband (UC2B), a community network expected to provide gigabit fiber-to-the-premise to 2700 under-served residences and 350 community anchor institutions. The company will also work with the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI), which is building a collaborative network environment to catalyze groundbreaking discoveries and innovation in emerging global networks. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue the development and commercialization of a new approach to analyzing and protecting computer networks. Every aspect of our society, from business, to government, to medicine and the sciences, is now tightly intertwined with the functioning of computer networks such as the Internet. However, modern networks are extremely complex, leading to a rich variety of failure modes and outages. These errors can result in very high costs for businesses, including lost revenue from SLAs, lost customers and contracts, fines for violating regulations such as HIPAA, leaks of sensitive information, and decline in corporate image. To address this challenge, the company is building a system that automatically verifies security and correctness of computer networks in real-time, discovers vulnerabilities, and assists network operators in determining their cause. The technology functions by scanning a network, constructing a formal model of the network&#039;s behavior, and using custom formal logic algorithms to automatically determine whether the network contains faults. It can vet networks continuously as the network state evolves, detect transient errors and signal immediate alarms, and scale to large and highly dynamic environments. It is intended to provide immediate practical assistance to network operators.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project extends to wherever headphones are used to listen to sound. The first commercial markets targeted by the technology being developed are gaming, virtual reality and consumer entertainment. These are areas in which the US has strong market and technology leads. By the end of the project, the company intends to have developed software that can be licensed to major players in these areas, reaching tens of millions of users. Beyond these markets, there are many applications for spatial audio in human-computer interfaces to deliver spatial information along with the intended semantic message. Several niche markets also exist, such as data presentation/exploration via sonification and specifically designed auditory interfaces for vision-impaired users. Overall it is expected that the proposed R &amp; D work will advance the state of the art in science and technology and will be of substantial value to society as a whole due to high usability, fidelity, naturalness, and portability of the developed spatial audio solutions. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop highly realistic and computationally efficient software for synthesis of personalized spatial audio, for applications that include virtual reality, gaming, and prostheses for the blind. Current algorithms are either perceptually unsatisfactory or have very high computational load. Approximate modeling of sound propagation, reverberation, and diffusion, along with tradeoffs between complexity and quality, will be explored using perceptual distortion metrics combined with the skills of professional listeners. The software will be optimized for use on mobile, console and embedded platforms. Additionally, a method to personalize the software to individual listeners, which was previously developed and tested in laboratory conditions, will be further refined and ruggedized for use in realistic environments. The expected outcomes will include a high-quality and efficient audio rendering library, a portable personalization apparatus, and several demonstrations that highlight the capabilities of the technology.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project will research the algorithms for automatic discovery of topics of interest for a user based on existing written content such as news and blogs. These topics can then be used to dynamically create a personalized content reader with high quality synthesized audio. Applications created from this cloud-based project will enable a car driver to get instant and relevant information without taking her eyes off the road, a must for today&#039;s lengthy commutes and in-car safety. Other applications will allow the same audio access to Internet news and blogs via a smartphone for those who are vision-impaired or vision-busy with exercising, gardening, etc. This project has a societal impact among the blind, aging eyes that have difficulty reading small print and small screens, and the car driver, since it provides the ability to find contextual news and blogs in an &quot;eyes-free&quot; manner and with an easy listening experience. The fundamental research components from this project can be re-applied to other content and similar fields of research. This project&#039;s applications have the potential to generate a revenue stream which will in turn create jobs and have an overall impact on the economy. The goal of the research is to determine whether topic information extracted from a large corpus of unrelated documents using unsupervised machine-learning can be used for content discovery, improving the quality of synthesized speech, and discovering user preferences for a recommendation system. The research uses topic-modeling, a machine learning algorithm, to uncover topics across thousands of RSS feeds, and natural language processing to improve the quality of synthesized speech. Retrieval of specific RSS channels per user&#039;s topic preferences is then possible by using the probability of mappings between topics and RSS channels. Since content scanning by listening is a slower process than visually scanning for relevant responses, the current research proposal will improve this process by combining user preference with information retrieval for a better user experience. The topic discovery research will include three key components: discovering multiple levels of subtopics to create topic hierarchies for easier browsing, a method for identifying trending topics, and determining current and relevant topics for automation of audio content. Once this project is shown to produce effective results, the same techniques can be applied across other document collections.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in significantly increasing the ways supercapacitors and lithium ion batteries are used today. Supercapacitors offer very high power capabilities and high energy efficiency and have been used in many renewable energy applications such as hybrid buses and wind turbines. Currently, their use is limited due to high cost and low energy density relative to Li-ion batteries. Coulometrics has developed a proprietary process that can modify low cost activated carbon materials into supercapacitor grade carbons with 25% higher energy density and twice the current lifespan of existing materials. These critical developments will lower the overall system cost and improve cell life allowing for more widespread use of supercapacitors in renewable energy applications. Coulometrics has also shown that a very similar process can be used to convert natural graphite to lithium ion grade anode materials with higher energy density and significantly lower cost. This process will also enable a Northern American company to become the first producer of graphite for lithium ion batteries on the continent which can significantly reduce lithium ion battery cost for applications such as electric vehicles. Both projects will have additional environmental benefits including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, less burning of fossil fuels, and help protect the environment. The project seeks to break through a significant barrier that has kept ultracapacitor voltage and energy density stagnant for over a decade and significantly reduce costs of lithium ion battery carbon materials. Supercapacitor companies all produce products with different carbons, electrolytes, cell construction, etc. and yet are all confined to the same performance specifications. We believe that this is related to oxidation/reduction reactions that occur on the carbon surface; a fairly intuitive hypothesis; however attempts at solutions have been futile. The surface treatment we developed in Phase I has resulted in a reduction of these oxidation/reduction currents by more than 50%. This technology will lead to the largest performance gains in the ultracapacitor industry in over 10 years. Additionally, one of the most challenging factors limiting market growth for ultracapacitors is their high cost, of which activated carbon accounts for 27%. Coulometrics&#039; treatment applied to inexpensive water filtration carbon, also developed in Phase I, has shown very similar performance enhancements, and will cost up to 95% less than commercial activated carbon materials. The surface modification process for graphitic carbons will enable the low cost and high quality production of carbon anode materials for lithium ion batteries based on natural graphite. This breakthrough can significantly reduce lithium ion battery cost which is a key element for more wide spread adoption of electric vehicles which will help reduce our nation&#039;s dependence on the need to import foreign oil.",

The in-situ measurement/prediction of composition, phase transformation and manufacturing defect using the proposed spectroscopic sensor may also allow for the fabrication of near net shape and property (NNSP) components with heterogeneous structures and complex geometries for additive manufacturing industry. The project&#039;s vision is to achieve &quot;zero-scrap&quot; materials processing and metal manufacturing operations, enabling dramatically reduced post-processing to identify composition, microstructure and manufacturing qualities. The project would provide sensing and process control to reduce waste and save time during welding and additive manufacturing processes. These savings would directly convert to dollars for the manufacturer, so there is strong motivation for adoption. Thus the proposed smart optical monitoring sensor will significantly contribute to the much needed transformation of the U.S. manufacturing industries. The key innovation is to use optical emission spectroscopy of plasma to dramatically improve welding and additive manufacturing processes. The innovation actually goes far beyond sensing to categorize defects and predict composition and phase transformations. Its success relies heavily on signal processing and understanding the physical mechanisms of the manufacturing processes being monitored. The sensor and associated algorithms will lead to much more efficient manufacturing because of improved feedback control afforded by the process information provided. The key challenges lie in demonstrating on the shop floor 1) in-situ monitoring and control of phase transformation and composition by systematic diagnosis of the laser induced plasma, and 2) ability to detect and categorize manufacturing defects through understanding the effects of different defects on plasma and designing effective algorithms to interpret plasma signals. Phase II activities are directed towards meeting those challenges and establish the sensor?s reliability for its earliest possible commercialization. The project will contribute to the competitive advantage for American metal manufacturing industry with &quot;Certify as You Build&quot; capability with its spectroscopic sensor called, minimize material wastage and lost labor time, and increase long-term product quality.",

Currently, data embedded in financial text are extracted manually by hundreds of people working for data warehouses. This manual effort takes on the order of weeks making the bulk of the data unavailable in easily computer-usable form in real time. The benefits of this project will be focused in three areas: (i) algorithmic trading programs will be able to use all data published worldwide immediately after the data is published; (ii) financial data warehouses will be able to provide an order of magnitude larger set of data concepts (from&lt;200 to&gt;3000); (iii) there will be increased transparency in the financial markets as financial information embedded in text becomes computer-readable. In 2012 algorithmic trading was estimated to exceed $5 Trillion in value with 750 Billion shares traded, generating a profit of over $600 Million. Financial transparency is an intangible benefit that will improve financial market efficiency. This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop automated methods to extract and tag relevant financial concepts from the free text of financial documents such as an annual reports, press releases and analyst reports.

DNA cloning is an everyday practice in the course of both industrial- and university-based research. Cloning technology has remained largely unchanged for the last 20 years. As a consequence, researchers consume a significant amount of time and money designing and constructing DNA, rather than on designing and conducting experiments. Over the past few years, standardized experimental DNA construction methods have been developed that lend themselves well to automation and rapid assembly of DNA. Process automation is progressing from luxury to necessity, as target applications demand the fabrication of large combinatorial DNA libraries in the search for better antibodies, faster enzymes, and more productive microbial strains. The proposed technology will allow rapid forward engineered biological libraries of recombinant DNA. The commercial availability of this technology will provide a low cost alternative to current methods. This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a bioCAD/CAM (Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing) technology that enables rapid DNA assembly for synthetic biology. Wedding recent advances in DNA assembly methods, and the software algorithms used to design those DNA assemblies, the proposed research will result in a platform technology for facilitating an optimized combination of direct synthesis and DNA assembly to make large combinatorial libraries. After the construction of the DNA libraries, screening for constructs with the desired activity remains a major scale-limiting bottleneck, both in terms of cost and time. The proposed technology will allow rapid prototyping and characterization of forward engineered biological libraries of recombinant DNA, proteins, or whole cells. The goal is to commercialize an easy-to-use platform for assembling complex constructs onto vector backbones, transfecting them into host microbes, and doing a rapid assessment of product yield.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an ultra-light, modular wind turbine for use in buoyant airborne wind energy systems. Reduced turbine weight has a cascading effect on total airborne system mass, allowing a significantly smaller, lower cost buoyant structure to be used to access high altitude winds. At heights up to 2,000 feet winds are strong and consistent, allowing for the production of low-cost, reliable power at a broad array of sites. High altitude winds have over five times the energy potential of ground winds accessed by tower-mounted turbines, opening the potential for a major new renewable energy resource to be harnessed. In addition, the containerized deployment of airborne wind turbines has the potential to expand wind development to sites that are not feasible today, including sites that are remote or have weak ground-level winds. Overall, the technology holds the potential to significantly lower energy costs and improve reliability for remote industrial, community, and military customers and represents a major step forward in unlocking the abundant high-altitude wind resource to help in the global pursuit of greater adoption of renewable energy sources. This SBIR Phase II project will focus on reducing the total weight of the wind turbine system. Turbine weight is one of the most critical cost drivers of buoyant airborne wind energy systems. For each kilogram removed from the turbine, an additional kilogram can be removed from the inflatable shell and tethers, resulting in a significantly smaller and lower cost system. The lightest commercially available small- to medium-sized wind turbine weighs 31.1 kilograms per kilowatt of capacity, which is too heavy for an economically-viable airborne turbine. By incorporating a compact, modular architecture, a lightweight permanent magnet direct-drive (PMDD) generator and high-strength composite materials, the proposed Phase II research effort aims to double the power density of traditional medium size turbines, making the proposed system suitable for use in an airborne application, while maintaining a high level of reliability and cost performance.",

This will drive jobs growth in the US, reduce supply chain risk, improve national security by reducing reliance on foreign sole sources for critical materials, and enable greater energy efficiency nationwide. Nanofoundry&#039;s carbide-based nanostructured magnet material represents the first major innovation in permanent magnetic materials since the early 1980&#039;s. In combination with an innovative manufacturing method, Nanofoundry expects to produce a large range of high value nanoparticle materials at low cost at industrial volumes. The permanent magnet market is $14 billion and is growing at nearly 9% annually.

This project will break through historical barriers in two areas: launching a new product technology to the magnet market-the first transformational innovation in three decades-and developing a commercially-viable manufacturing capability to produce high-quality magnetic nanoparticle material at industrial scales. The specific focus of this project is to develop a scalable chemical production process to manufacture magnetic Cobalt Carbide nanoparticle material, and to prototype the use of the material in an end-use application. Several key innovations of this program include (1) the optimization of a class of cobalt carbide nanoparticles for use as a permanent magnet material, (2) the application of continuous flow microreactor wet chemical process technology to the manufacturing of high quality nanoparticle carbides at large scale, and (3) the use of supercritical solvents for efficiency and environmentally-friendly processing.",

The proposed technology could drastically improve the overall effectiveness of pest management programs in various agricultural industries. The proposed system not only eliminates one of the most laborious and dreaded activities of manually inspecting insect traps, but also provides unprecedented access to accurate, real-time insect population information to make more effective pest management decisions. This leads to reduced, spatially-restricted pesticide applications, better understanding of insect pest behaviors, and enhanced biological control. The automated trap?s ability to monitor more than one species of insect not only achieves a higher level of efficiency in pest monitoring but also multiplies the technology?s value to the end users. The potential market for the proposed technology is quite broad. In fact, the technology can benefit any industry that requires regular monitoring of insect populations. Furthermore, the proposed technology could be used for various state and federal pest monitoring programs, such as the Slow the Spread (STS) Project administered by USDA to monitor gypsy moths. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project proposes to develop a multi-modal sensor platform for robust detection and classification of multiple insect pest species for automated monitoring of insect populations in production agriculture. The main goal of this project is two-fold: First is to demonstrate that bio-impedance sensor alone provides useful data to classify multiple insect species. A linear support vector machine classifier using mel-frequency cepstral coefficients extracted from bio-impedance data will be implemented on an embedded platform for detection and classification of two insect pest species. These bio-impedance based electronic traps will undergo large-scale field trials and be prepared for full commercialization. The second objective is to develop a multi-modal electronic trap with ultrasound, infrared and bio-impedance sensors that can simultaneously monitor four or more insect pest species. Measurement signals generated by the sensors will be analyzed to determine a set distinct features that can be computed on an embedded platform for real-time processing. These features will then be used in multi-modal sensor fusion algorithms for robust detection and classification. Different sensor fusion strategies will be investigated and the performance of each fusion algorithm will be evaluated both in controlled and field conditions.",

This project will create a separation device to recover rare cells, including circulating tumor cells (CTC) from cancer, which can be analyzed for genetic mutations. In the long term, this information could direct cancer therapy for each patient. Currently available CTC tests only count rare cancer cells, which is of limited value to doctors. This SBIR project will produce an automated system to capture cancer cells from blood, and recover live cells for analysis. Through a small sample of blood, a cancer patient&#039;s tumor may be genotyped, which may enable custom therapy in the future. The platform has many research and clinical uses for any type of rare cell capture and analysis. The proposed automated cell separation device will enable the translation of basic research to clinical application by simplifying the rare cell isolation process. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop an improved device for the detection and analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) shed into the blood from cancer sites. CTCs are part of the process of spreading cancer, and early detection is key to improved treatment. Detection, quantification, and characterization of CTCs has the potential to transform oncology, yet isolation under routine conditions of these rare, one-in-a-billion cells, remains problematic. The proposed CTC sample preparation technology under development is low-cost, rapid, and potentially may provide a highly informative analysis of captured cells. It promises to enable a new generation of cancer diagnostics that impact patient care. During this Phase II project, the goal is to design and produce the separation device, a fluidic workstation, and supply kit; then, evaluate its ability to capture and recover CTCs from the blood of cancer patients. The Phase I data demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. The results of this study will evaluate alternative means of capturing and recovering CTCs, with the goal of&gt;90% recovery of cells in a procedure requiring 60 minutes or less.

Having such models is useful in a number of applications. However, the existing approaches for the construction of such models are labor intensive and require highly trained people and expensive equipment, which make the entire process prohibitively expensive for most applications. The proposed system will significantly reduce the cost of construction of such models by using only video input and automating most of the process. The proposed system could be used to relatively inexpensively construct detailed, photo-realistic 3D models of interiors and exteriors of: real estate properties, restaurants, sport clubs, museums, historic buildings, architectural sites, touristic sites, university campuses, amusement parks, water parks, zoos, apartment complexes, resorts, hotels, hospitals, shopping malls, etc. The constructed 3D models can then be explored online using computers, smartphones and tablets. Furthermore, the system can be used for mapping or exploring buildings in situations where it is dangerous or impractical for people to enter, which is often the case in rescue and law-enforcement applications. Given the wide range of potential customers, the proposed system has the potential to generate both one-time earnings as well as recurring income streams. The objective of the project is to develop a system for inexpensive generation of photo-realistic 3D models of building interiors and exteriors and provide an on-line interactive visualization interface for the viewing of the 3D models. The proposed system is based on a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a wireless camera that can semi-autonomously fly inside and around the building, video record all the interior and exterior structures, and send the video and other recorded information to the base station where the 3D model is constructed using computer vision techniques. The proposed system requires the development of two innovative technologies: (1) semi-automated construction of texture-mapped 3D models of structures video recorded from a flying vehicle, and (2) semi-autonomous flying of an UAV inside and around a building based on the video stream from the UAV&#039;s camera. While 3D scanning is an existing technology and small UAVs have already been developed, this proposal will combine these technologies and enhance their capabilities to deliver new value. In addition, computer, smartphone and tablet software for interactive visualization and exploration of the constructed 3D models will be developed along with a user-friendly interface.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a full-scale working prototype of manufacturing equipment to produce a novel environmentally sustainable masonry unit. Conventional concrete masonry unit (CMU) manufacture relies on ordinary Portland cement (OPC) for strength and durability. OPC is energy-intensive and is the most expensive ingredient in conventional masonry. In contrast, this project proposes a manufacturing process that transforms naturally occurring soil elements called aluminosilicates into strong and durable masonry products through a chemical process called geopolymerization. The broader impacts of the proposed activity include societal benefits in the form of human health, enhanced scientific and technological understanding, and commercial considerations. The adoption of geopolymer masonry blocks by the construction industry will have the following benefits: i) a dramatic reduction of the 14 million metric tons of CO2 emitted annually by domestic CMU manufacturers ii) a decrease in the energy required to process aggregates as a result of a fine particle constituent to be used in the formulation, and iii) the elimination of the requirement of aggregate washing, which will enable widespread use of recycled aggregates. The proposed activity will increase domestic construction material manufacturing capabilities, and create skilled jobs for the US economy. The results of Phase I demonstrated the scientific feasibility of using a proprietary manufacturing process to create geopolymer-based masonry specimens with performance comparable to OPC-based specimens. During Phase II, this knowledge will be applied to develop equipment capable of producing cost-effective geopolymer masonry block to meet the steadily increasing demand for sustainable masonry materials in domestic and global markets. Geopolymer masonry is a disruptive product that has the potential to dramatically improve the environmental profile of one of the most common construction materials on the planet. The Phase II work will include the design and construction of a full-scale working prototype for the production of geopolymer masonry at a cost comparable to conventional OPC-based masonry products, evaluations of mechanical properties of the resulting geopolymer masonry blocks to verify their performance against laboratory specimens and ASTM standards governing masonry materials, and research to address outstanding issues related to performance by incorporating water-repelling admixtures and hydrophobic additives into geopolymer mix designs.",

This technology will allow architects, engineers, artists, and school children to create compelling 3D experiences directly from their drawings without extensive training. Furthermore, it will accelerate the creation of interactive 3D content and significantly reduce the time, cost and expertise currently required to create it. By bridging the gap between traditional drawings and 3D modeling, this project will provide the unique ability to reuse and &quot;reproject&quot; drawn strokes, thus enabling the creation of expressive 3D drawings with minimal effort. The technology developed in this project will help lower the barrier and generate new business opportunities in content creation for electronic publishing and for other creative professionals, such as architects, designers, and ad-agency art directors. Finally, this project includes specific outreach activities, through collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History, that will provide unique educational services to the local community, while simultaneously introducing this new technology to the world. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on making the creation of this new type of graphical media as intuitive and fluid as paper and pencil. This Phase II project will support system improvements - including user-interface improvements - to simplify 3D navigation for the consumers of this media. This will be needed for using this media in digital children&#039;s picture books, which have already been identified as early adopters of this technology as well as an important market. Another technical objective will be to develop a hybrid vector-raster representation, which will provide a wider range of artistic expression, while improving rendering performance of large scenes. A third objective is to develop stroke deformation algorithms to support direct manipulation of objects and characters to provide sketch-driven animation capabilities.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase (SBIR) II project is to help detect whether pharmaceuticals about to be administered to patients have been damaged during shipment or storage by exposure to very cold temperatures close to or below the freezing temperature of water. Many pharmaceuticals, especially vaccines, lose their potency if exposed to near-freezing conditions. In light of tightening regulations with respect to the temperature-controlled storage and distribution of pharmaceuticals and changing distribution models (increase in direct-to-patient shipments), there is a critical need to demonstrate with greater reliability and in a cost-effective manner whether pharmaceuticals lose their potency due to exposure to harmful temperatures. The result of this SBIR II project will be an indicator that will provide workers along the pharmaceutical supply chain information about whether a pharmaceutical encountered harmful temperatures and the duration of such an encounter. Both harmful temperature and duration of exposure are critical pieces of data required to determine whether a pharmaceutical has been compromised. Technologies do exist that indicate whether an exposure to a harmful temperature has occurred, however, the indication of time of exposure is muddled and difficult to discern. The proposed research in this Phase II SBIR program, if successful, will offer a reliable alternative to costly electronic devices. The benefits of this device include preventing damaged product from reaching patients, helping companies remain in compliance with regulations in a cost-effective manner and reducing pharmaceutical waste. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to develop Time Temperature Indicators (TTIs) that reliably indicate exposure of pharmaceutical shipments to harmful cold temperatures near the freezing point of water. This technology will be the first chemical-based technology capable of indicating the duration of such exposures. If a harmful exposure occurs, the combination of time and temperature data provided by these indicators can be used by the shipper to evaluate whether a pharmaceutical was truly compromised. As a result, pharmaceuticals that have been truly compromised are discarded and not administered to the patient. The patented indicators utilize a specially formulated polymer hydrogel that undergoes a volume transition from a swollen to a collapsed state upon cooling. The kinetics and the temperature dependence of the transition are highly tunable. The objectives of this Phase II project include refining formulations and synthesis methods to prepare polymer gels with highly reliable swollen-shrunken transitions. These gels will then be incorporated into specially designed housings to obtain TTI prototypes. Simple manual-driven machines will be designed to prepare the TTI prototypes. The performance of these TTIs will be validated: the company will demonstrate that these TTIs meet a minimum quality requirement. Thereafter the project will test the stability of the TTIs by measuring performance after accelerated storage and the proposed TTI prototypes will be subjected to standard transit tests. As the reliability of these indicators is a key product attribute, this project will identify the synthesis and process steps that introduce variability and address them accordingly.",

The company?s proprietary tunable acoustic gradient lens technology provides versatile solutions for unmet market needs across multiple sectors, including health, security, and manufacturing. While valuable as an add-on to existing systems for imaging and processing applications, its use can be extended to other applications such as point of care medical diagnostic imaging and consumer optics/electronics. The proposed second generation lens is expected to grow the existing market for variable focus optical lens by a factor of 5 to 10 and help transform this small business into a major original equipment components manufacturer and supplier. This project seeks to engineer a high volume manufacturing process that will increase product yield, reproducibility, and reliability for a novel ultra-high-speed variable focus device. The company?s patented tunable acoustic gradient lens technology uses sound to shape light, which enables the change of focal position without any moving parts at rates that are 3 orders of magnitude faster than competing technologies. The innovation is based on propagation of sound waves that can be controlled by the modification of the index of refraction by piezoelectric elements within the liquid lens. Phase II plan is focused on engineering and optimizing new lens designs that preserve the fundamental functionality and benefits of the first generation lens while also capturing the unique and industry leading benefits of the company&#039;s core technology. It also includes semi-automated prototype fabrication, careful system optimization, analysis and testing that pave the path to a next generation product that can be scaled up for mass-production.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to increase the competitiveness of U.S. semiconductor industry by improving the quality of A/MS design verification, improving first pass design success and reducing time-to-market. Today, current analog verification methods and tools often fail to catch design mistakes, especially due to unforeseen interactions across chip subsystems, and these mistakes are a frequent cause of costly delays in bringing products to market even on chips where analog is only a small portion of the overall design ? a $63 billion market. The costs and lost profit potential related to multiple design versions can quickly run to millions of dollars and easily dwarfs the cost of providing designers access to the appropriate design tools. Using two different market analyses, the first using a digital verification market analogy and the second considering worldwide new (not slight derivatives) designs in just the AMS IC market, leads to an estimation of total available market for new analog verification solutions of $300 million annual revenue. Further extending the verification solutions with analytics and collaboration tools can potentially increase the market by a further 50% to $450 million annual revenue. Understanding A/MS verification coverage is a key component of this opportunity. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project proposes a verification coverage system for analog/mixed-signal (A/MS) integrated circuit development. Verification of today?s complex integrated circuits and systems is widely acknowledged as a critical challenge to improving design productivity. Part of the verification challenge revolves around understanding what portion of the operating space has been examined; i.e., ?covered?. Today well-accepted formal and simulation-based techniques exist to capture and measure test coverage for digital integrated circuits, but there is no corresponding commercial capability for analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Analog designers frequently spend too much time analyzing and over-testing system behavior for a small set of well understood usage scenarios while leaving significant portions of the state-space completely untested. The design exploration problem for A/MS circuits presents a critical challenge for implementing such systems due to the inherently large design space associated with these types of circuits. Key objectives for the project include productizing and extending key components demonstrated in the Phase 1 prototype. This project will deliver a commercial product to provide A/MS verification coverage data that is actionable and facilitates collaboration between design and verification teams. The resulting product will have scalability and performance to handle large complex designs.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is the sustainable production of high-value lipids (oils, waxes and fatty acids) from abundant and inexpensive feedstocks. The process is based on a unique lipid- accumulating microorganism found in Yellowstone National Park that is capable of directly converting a wide range of feedstocks such as wheat straw, corn stover, and industrial by-products (e.g. molasses, glycerol) to valuable lipid products such as Omega-7 fatty acids and high-melting temperature waxes. Renewable oils, waxes and fatty acids have significant demand in a wide range of industries (e.g. neutraceuticals, biolubricants, cosmetics, candles and soaps). Consumers will clearly benefit from this technology through the reduction of our dependence on petroleum-based products while generating a market for agricultural wastes and by-products. Since few companies and research groups are investigating fungal lipid production directly from lignocellulosic biomass for higher- value products, both industry and the scientific community will benefit from the knowledge gained by this research. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project describes a simple, novel and cost-effective process for converting lignocellulosic and other waste feedstocks to high- value lipids using a microorganism isolated from Yellowstone National Park, which is capable of withstanding extreme acidic conditions and producing powerful enzymes for degrading cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose. The organism accumulates high concentrations of valuable lipids in a cost-effective ?one-step? process. The produced lipids based on renewable resources creates a market for waste agricultural materials. The primary objective of this SBIR project is to further develop the process for commercial production of lipid products from waste organic feedstocks. Phase II efforts will focus on optimizing the process with a bench pilot-scale system, performing process flow design and techno-economic analysis of commercial production systems, analyzing lipid products in detail, and targeting appropriate markets/customers for the produced lipid products. Coming out of the Phase II program, the goal is to have a pilot- level demonstration system designed to produce economically viable yields of high-value lipids from a variety of substrates for defined target markets and customers.",

        "abstract": "From the 19th century until today, we have seen an almost tenfold increase in the ocular injury rate on the battlefield. Compounding this problem is that there are very few eye doctors deployed in field hospitals. With ocular injuries accounting for up to 32% of injuries in disaster scenarios, limited access to eye doctors is not just a military problem. A portable eye examination system is needed that can help trained medical personnel diagnose eye injuries either on site, or remotely via telemedicine if they are not deployed to a given field hospital. This system should be easy to use for an untrained medic but also capable enough so that an optometrist, ophthalmologist or ophthalmic surgeons would find it useful. To address this need, SA Photonics has developed the \"Eye Phone\" concept, a hybrid slitlamp /ophthalmoscope that clips on to a smart phone.   In our Phase I effort, we completed the conceptual design of the system, including the optical, mechanical and electrical design.  We also prototyped the ophthalmoscope as well as the slitlamp breadboards to prove out our concept.

These vision systems provide the user with imagery from helmet-mounted sensors that can be augmented through fusion and /or overlay from video delivered from aircraft mounted sensors, synthetic imagery, and metadata. Vision systems based on previous processor technology have been unable to perform the required low-latency and high throughput processing needed to ingest video from multiple high resolution sensors, but recent advances in integrated circuit (IC) process technology and small form-factor printed circuit board (PCB) design have opened up new opportunities. Toyon plans to exploit these technology advances to dramatically improve HMD processing capabilities. Toyon proposes to develop a high-performance, SWaP-optimized helmet vision processor (HVP) based on the latest in 20-nm Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)/System-on-a-Chip (SoC) process technology. To achieve the highest level of performance in the smallest possible SWaP package, Toyon will utilize advanced high-level synthesis tools to obtain accurate estimates of the hardware resources required by the multi-channel, low-latency image processing algorithm chain. Toyon will also employ the latest in high-density, small form-factor part selection and PCB design and fabrication practices to ensure that the overall system design meets SWaP requirements.  BENEFIT:  At the end of the Phase II effort Toyon will have developed a complete VPHS Reference Design (RD) capable of meeting performance requirements. All firmware will be developed using the AXI interface protocol standard to enable portability across different hardware platforms (e.g. FPGAs and ASICs).    At the successful completion of this Phase II effort Toyon will provide AFRL with a VPHS RD that will be competitive with currently used night vision goggle (NVG) technology. The modular architecture of the VPHS RD will enable AFRL and other third-party developers such as sensor and display manufacturers to perform carry-on development. Toyon will provide AFRL with a complete reference design for the VPHS RD including PCB CAD design files, BOMs, all source code, IP, and hardware. Such a system would provide high utility not only to AFRL for internal test and development towards a Phase III VPHS, but also as a testbed for third party system and component manufacturers.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  With the tremendously successful Phase I effort, Third Dimension Technologies (TDT), in collaboration with Lockheed Martin, Rickard Consulting Group and APTUS, plans in Phase II to create, test and evaluate a gaming-based training and rehearsal environment known as the W3DGE (Warfighter 3D Gaming Environment). The Air Force has a need for a lower-cost, more deployable tactical training and rehearsal environment for fifth-generation multi-role fighters. To address this need, TDT proposes the W3DGE as a stand-alone/networked (individual/teams) gaming environment that can travel anywhere and be assembled in hours. W3DGE integrates TDTs advanced Holographic Angular Slice 3D Display (HAS3D) with Lockheeds Prepar3D, a game-based professional training and simulation environment. HAS3D reproduces all human visual cuesincluding head motion parallax and vergence-accommodation cuesand will provide W3DGE with true 3D, high acuity visuals. Lockheeds Prepar3D with its new SimDirector tool will allow Air Force training and operations personnel to create scenarios to simulate, train and analyze classified fifth-generation missions and tactics. TDT plans in Phase II to demonstrate and deliver a fully functional hardware and software W3DGE prototype that offers the Air Force a sustainable architecture to enhance fidelity and maintain concurrency as needed.  BENEFIT:  TDT sees significant commercialization potential for the products resulting from Phase II. TDTs first planned product will be the W3DGE, a low-cost, high fidelity, game-based, deployable F -35 Lightning II mission training and rehearsal simulator. Potential customers include the Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, eight international partner nations and twenty-three other allied countries. TDT has also identified important commercialization potential for TDTs HAS3D display technology, which will be integrated with W3DGE. In particular, Lockheed Martin has expressed interest in TDTs display technology for simulator applications (particularly cross-cockpit configurations), and other prospective strategic partners have shown interest in the technology for collaborative environments, oil & gas reservoir management and robotic surgery. TDT has identified future opportunities in geospatial intelligence analysis, diagnostic radiology, medical training, satellite tracking, computer-aided design and command and control applications. Phase II will allow TDT to showcase its 3D display capability and secure funding for development of the W3DGE and 3D display products.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  For decades, very low frequency (VLF) links have been an important part of Air Forces worldwide logistics infrastructure and response-coordination capability. With an increasingly-global proliferation of nuclear capability, Air Force faces an urgent need to update legacy VLF equipment to reliably support scenarios where its applicability is vital, including the nuclear command control and communications (NC3) environment using the Emergency Action Message (EAM) network. Simultaneously, the proliferation of modern technologies with both intentional and unintentional VLF radiation (including switching power electronics and their VLF-radiating magnetic cores) has created an electromagnetic interference (EMI) environment for VLF reception that has never been worse  especially in modern airborne environments. In response to these demands, there is an urgent need to update legacy VLF systems to support a more comprehensive set of foreseeable battlefield scenarios, like those set forth in the Common VLF Receiver vision.  During Phase I, FIRST RF built and tested prototypes of each of the key components of our proposed interference-mitigation antenna system. Through this hardware-based approach, we have proven the feasibility of our concept, and have established a low-risk path for the proposed Phase II effort that will culminate in a hardware demonstration and delivery of a prototype antenna system.      BENEFIT:  As a result of this SBIR, FIRST RFs technology will enable robust EMI mitigation in a highly-sensitive VLF receive antenna.  The beamforming technology will have applicability to a variety of military and civilian applications, including improved emergency-beacon tracking/geolocation (especially in high-EMI environments), emergency low-data-rate/local communications.  The antenna miniaturization techniques will afford applicability of this VLF antenna system to smaller payloads, including Class 1 UAVs, opening a whole new realm of applications, especially for emergency-beacon geolocation. Finally, demonstration of our novel noise-detection device will not only augment the capability of this interference-mitigation system, but also have relevance and commercial potential in other testing and RF compatibility applications.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  High speed communication channels and tactical data links are becoming increasingly important for both military and commercial applications.  The need for high speed inter-flight communication and data transfer is validated by the existence of the Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL) for the F-22 and the Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) for the F-35.  Antennas for these two links are unique, and the two links are not interoperable. This is a problem for not only legacy, but for next generation aircraft, as well.    The FIRST RF solution is significantly advantageous in that it breaks from traditional, timeworn technology approaches in order to offer a lower cost, modular, scalable design; all while maintaining conformance to the platform outer mold line (OML) and LPI/LPD functions.  The baseline approach during Phase II will develop affordable MADL-compatible apertures for both traditional and low observable (LO) platforms, with an objective of an antenna system compatible with both IFDL and MADL communications that will be valid for next generation aircraft  offering inter-flight communication between any mixed aircraft fleet.    BENEFIT:  The greatest benefit to the Air Force will be the enabling of inter-aircraft communication and data transfer between any mixed aircraft fleet.  The FIRST RF technology and developmental plan offers a lower cost, modular approach that enables a much quicker design cycle.  This results in hardware that may be validated on-platform sooner and at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods.  The technology approach with this design will also allow for simple, scalability solution for various platform requirements (i.e. gain, beamwidth, G/T, EIRP, SWAP).  FIRST RF has identified additional commercial and military applications for this technology enabling GB/s data rates for extended range communications.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The vulnerability of satellite assets to enemy jamming has led to an increased urgency to develop SATCOM payloads capable of maintaining high aggregate throughput even in challenged environments.  As the size, cost, and power consumption of digital signal processing platforms continue to drop and their performance improves, incorporating digital beamformer (DBF) designs into future SATCOM satellite payloads has become an increasingly attractive solution to this challenge.  The flexibility of digital beamforming permits the creation of multiple independent antenna patterns that can be designed for wideband systems.  In response to the Air Force solicitation, MaXentric is developing an adaptive digital beamforming system codenamed SABER (Satellite Adaptive Beamforming aRray).  MaXentrics Phase I focused on simulating critical adaptive beamforming algorithms while reviewing the system trade space.  The proposed Phase II effort will focus on constructing a hardware test platform for algorithm implementation and testing.  BENEFIT:  SABER Phase 2 HW prototype provides a fully functional HW implementation of the SABER architecture envisioned in Phase 1.  It will enable MaXentric to implement the various flexible, power efficient algorithms for beam-forming and channel equalization developed and analyzed in Phase 1.  MaXentric Phase 2 approach emphasizes the need for commercializing the SABER platform by building a Phase II prototype that has enough flexibility and functionality to be utilized in many other government and private sector applications such as phased array radars and sensing, MIMO transceivers targeted for SIGINT or wireless/cellular communications and general purpose DSP boards used for complex and demanding wide-band signal processing tasks.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:In this Phase II program, Numerica will lead the transition of two software packages for resolving uncorrelated tracks (UCTs) in space, namely AFRL's Constrained Admissible Region Multiple Hypothesis Filter (CAR-MHF) and Numerica's Multiple Frame Assignment Multiple Hypothesis Tracker (MFA-MHT), to the Space Situational Awareness Laboratory and to the Distributed Space Command and Command Center at Dahlgren (DSC2-D). The work will entail (i) conversion of the CAR-MHF and MFA-MHT codebases to a production-level real-time computing language to improve runtime performance and comply with DSC2-D's software requirements; (ii) providing uninterrupted support for testing and data processing activities throughout the duration of the program and making software enhancements to improve runtime and performance based on these activities; (iii) upgrading the CAR-MHF and MFA-MHT user interfaces to allow ease-of-use by the Dahlgren operators; and (iv) providing documentation and project support including user's manuals of CAR-MHF and MFA-MHT that meet DSC2-D's documentation requirements. The envisioned end result would be the provision of two independent UCT processing tools, deployed in the operational environment of DSC2-D, that would advance the U.S.'s space superiority through improved UCT resolution and maintaining custody of all objects in space.BENEFIT:A next-generation operational system for space surveillance will need to leverage data from all sensors, especially in the GEO regime of space, to support DSC2-D (i.e., Dahlgren) and the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) in providing more automated UCT processing, better prediction capabilities especially for high area-to-mass ratio objects, and ultimately a more comprehensive space catalog containing smaller, dimmer, deep-space, and hard-to-acquire objects. The two software packages that will be transitioned to DS2C-2 under this Phase II, namely CAR-MHF and MFA-MHT, would enhance military capability for UCT resolution operations in support of the GEO Odyssey program and the needs described above. A secondary transition under consideration, subject to the limitations of funding, is the third increment of the JSpOC Mission System (JMS) through the Advanced Research, Collaboration, and Application Development Environment (ARCADE).",

therapies  a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids  Our goal is aligned with NIDAandapos s intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction  We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines  and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction  The platform we propose to use will help identify  evaluate  and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction  We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia  industry and government  Although there are two first line  varenicline and bupropion  and two second line  clonidine and notriptyline  approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking  about     of smokers are unable to remain abstinent  As an explanation for such low success rate  it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states  which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy  One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity  Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors  either cognitive or emotional  that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse  The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity  potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts  During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on    consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse

predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence  Finally  this platform  battery  database and computational tools  will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership  created to maintain  support  further develop and publicize the platform  The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA approved gold standards  the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery  the creation of a knowledge database  and the management of the final platform by a private public consortium to ensure maximal quality  value and access  We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery Predictive Smoking

and more effective  smoking cessation medications  We propose to compare effective smoking cessation medications against ineffective medications in a comprehensive preclinical test battery to capture those features that best separate the two drug sets  We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery  We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti  smoking medications using the novel screening battery  Using bioinformatics methods we will compare these promising compounds against the set of efficacious FDA approved compounds and assign them a predictive score that represents the likelihood that such compounds will be effective in the clinic  We will further prioritize compounds that show additional positive features such as pro cognitive or anxiolytic effects  If successful

Kutta leverages this knowledge and its experience with multiple unmanned Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) resupply programs and UASs to create an autonomous system for critical item resupply and casualty evacuation (CASEVAC). Kutta has successfully demonstrated an innovative solution for control of a UAS simulating a CASEVAC scenario during Phase I of the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) project; and, proposes to build on this experience by optimizing the hardware and software of the system to allow for a fully integrated system available to all components of the CASEVAC System (air vehicles (AVs), field users, military treatment facilities, and military operation bases). The proposed Phase II effort culminates with the integration of an Autonomous CASEVAC System into multiple AV platform simulations for a proof of concept demonstration of Kuttas UAS-agnostic solution.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this project to develop and demonstrate the value of a remediation-oriented cohort builder which enables the rapid translation of new population-based research results into patient-specific, actionable information for MHS clinicians, nurses and QA personnel at the point of care.  Electronic delivery of patient-specific alerts, based on temporal analysis of the full medical record, has the potential of greater impact on medical practice than generalized guidelines and warnings.  Further, electronic capture of the patient-specific follow-up that results from these alerts can support better monitoring and assessment of QI efforts.  In Phase I, Commonwealth identified a specific unmet need in the MHS for the proposed remediation-oriented cohort builder, whose focus will be on improving patient care through the identification and active management of cohorts of patients with potentially problematic treatment patterns.  In Phase II Commonwealth will develop a software prototype (with working name RemCB) and pilot it in the targeted dissemination of drug safety information to healthcare providers through collaboration with the Army Pharmacovigilance Center and with MHS healthcare delivery teams. Throughout the project, we will work closely with MHS capabilities management to ensure alignment with MHS strategy and a smooth integration of RemCB into the MHS.",

        "abstract": "Phase 2 involves the continued development of the F-MIRE FAES system.   The FAES system insertion loss measurements utilize a sub-miniature MEMS microphone mounted in the ear canal of the HPD wearer.  An ultra-thin flat flexible cable connects the microphone to a signal conditioning unit and power supply.  The microphone is mounted in a foam ear dam to protect the microphone and the sensitive ear canal.  A custom software interface will run the automated F-MIRE test, perform 1/3 octave band analysis and data storage.  Variable stimulus levels are required since the range of attenuation is large and test subject exposure must be monitored carefully.  Test fixture verification tests have demonstrated that the F-MIRE measurements using the FFC and MEMS microphone are accurate to within about 1 dB for muff-type devices and to within about 2 dB for insert-type devices.  Challenges include consistent placement of the microphone in the ear canal and consistent headphone placement for insert-type measurements. Besides further development, phase 2 will include extensive human subject studies comparing the FAES system to standardized methods.  The proposed FAES system will be compatible with all HPD types and will meet all of the objectives set forth in the original project solicitation.",

More recently, CDC scientists have demonstrated enhanced immunogenicity of IRV using an innovative microneedle patch technology, achieving comparable antibody titers with a 1/10th of the antigen dose compared to those induced by a full IM dose of vaccine. Microneedles provide a simple and painless method to administer vaccines without using hypodermic needles. They are inexpensive to manufacture and may not require a cold chain for storage and transport, a major advantage for immunization campaigns in the developing world. With the establishment of proof of concept for IM and skin immunization in animals, CDC has entered an agreement with Meridian Life Science (MLS) to produce a master virus bank (MVB) under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions at the MLS facilities in Memphis, Tennessee.  Based on the results and progress from the Phase I SBIR contract, the phase II contract will focus on preparation of inactivated rotavirus vaccine pilot lots for phase I clinical trials. ",

RSI has worked with both the Navy and the Air Force on warhead designs intended for multipoint applications in the past. Common problems with this approach include high cost, large space requirements and high energy requirements. Simultaneity of the firing pulses can also be difficult to achieve. From an Insensitive Munitions (IM) standpoint each of the initiator points employs secondary explosives which have been shown to fail IM testing under some circumstances.      For this Phase II effort RSI is proposing the further engineering development and qualification of a Digital Detonator system useable for multipoint applications, plane wave generators and other areas at a significantly lower cost. The Digital Detonator also offers a lower profile and significantly decreased energy requirements, which would be capable of meeting the IM requirement goals the Navy has set.",

        "abstract": "The cargo and personnel handling system in the C-2 Greyhound is functionally behind most cargo capable aircraft in the U.S. military. The current cargo and personnel handling system utilized on the C-2 requires enormous manpower efforts to load/unload cargo. Depending on the size of cargo, passenger seating must be removed in order to load the aircraft, and then reinstalled for passenger use. Except for extremely heavy packages, cargo is hand carried into the aircraft, which has resulted in numerous back injuries. Safe, Inc. has developed a prototype of an innovative seating system incorporating feedback from operators within VRC-30. When the seat backs are folded down the new seating system provides a conveyor surface to facilitate the hand loading/unloading of cargo by reducing operator-lifted weight, and eliminating the need to remove the seats. The seating system can be stowed against the aircraft cabin wall in less than 30 seconds, and can also be stowed on the aircraft floor in approximately  the floor space as the existing seating system, providing additional cargo volume when needed. The Phase II program will finalize the design of the system and accomplish limited qualification testing to prepare the system for fielding.",

Furthermore, its chemical structure will be resistant not only to rubidium vapor, but also to its oxides and hydroxides.  Computer modeling of the layered structure will be performed to study its light transmission properties.  During Phase I, the efficacy of our approach was demonstrated by coating sapphire substrates used in Diode Pumped Alkali Laser Systems (DPALS).

Silica-cloth phenolic and carbon-cloth phenolic are the go-to legacy insulator materials of choice.  However, these materials have limited temperature use; mechanical degradation with decomposition of the matrix; and high thermal conductivity in the charred state.  At present, burn durations, flame temperatures and inter-pulse delays are constrained to avoid overheating.  The objective a Phase II investigation is to develop and evaluate a low cost, high payoff ceramic-based laminar composite.  Results of material property studies will provide input for trade studies to investigate the benefits and payoff of this technology in multiple propulsion systems.  Favorable insulator designs will be evaluated in sub-scale test motors.  Approved for Public Release 14-MDA-7739 (18 March 14).",

        "abstract": "Thermal injury is common in military conflicts due primarily to the widespread use of explosive devices. Though scar formation is a natural process of wound healing, burns can produce scars that are excessive, physically debilitating and functionally damaging. Synedgen has demonstrated the efficacy of a safe topical treatment to reduce inflammation, prevent infection in, improve the healing rate of and reduce the magnitude of scar formation in burns. Synedgen uses a derivative of a natural biopolymer to prevent the initial stages of inflammation due to damage and necrotic tissue. Consequently, the burn healing process shifts to a regenerative phase earlier and is stimulated to heal, without the complications of unmitigated inflammation. This product can be used alone or in combination with other products to provide better management of burn wounds. This Phase II proposal will accelerate the development of this product into the clinic by completing studies of preclinical efficacy in animal models, complete the molecular validation of the polymer active ingredient and provide detailed steps and timelines for bringing this product to clinical trials.",

During the Phase I effort, EAI developed and demonstrated a system and approach for the integration of distributed wearable sensors capable of providing real-time center of gravity (COG) and center of pressure (COP) for an ambulatory human. Phase II proposes continuing  the effort,  focusing on developing a versatile sensor backbone design and sensor fusion algorithm that can, in real time, use combinations of different sensors to determine both the state, COP and COG of the wearer with minimal latency.

Applications include target illumination and detection, electronic warfare, terrain/object/building mapping, construction, surveillance, industrial process control, and free-space optical communications. Existing, commercially available direct diode lasers have some of the most desirable attributes: highest efficiency, greatest compactness (small size, weight, and power or SWaP), and wavelength selectability from the ultraviolet to the long-wavelength-infrared bands. The main disadvantage is poor output beam quality.

The ability to quickly and safely launch aircraft can become a key limitation for an aircraft carrier when trying to deliver the maximum amount of warfighter capability. Currently, the wheel bearings on the launch gear shuttle require scheduled maintenance, wear out prematurely, and need to be frequently replaced. Our goal for this project is to develop an advanced wheel bearing for the launch gear equipment on U.S. Navy carriers that does not require maintenance and can withstand up to 25,000 launch cycles between replacement intervals. In Phase I, we demonstrated that novel materials alone cannot solve the problems of the existing wheel bearing and developed a conceptual design of a Phase II prototype bearing.

The proposed 3D ladar system is capable of 10s of Hz frame-rate for a mosaic-tiled ladar system, providing near-diffraction limited performance over a FOV of up to 5 x 5 degrees, and is compatible with a rodamap for integration in typical EO/IR sensor pod. Detailed study and simulation models in Phase 1 were developed for laser beam-steering and imaging (receive-path) taking into account realistic optical characteristics of liquid-crystal optical components. A representative 1.5-um liquid crystal component was also verified. In addition a detialed 3D Imaging Ladar model is used to simulate the time-domain and imaging (spatial) performance of such system. This feasibility study and detialed modeling and simulation provides quantitative metrics for performance evaluation of the prototype 3D Imaging Ladar hardware proposed for the SBIR Phase 2 program.  BENEFIT:  (1) Enables new CONOPS for 3D Ladar based ISR   (2) Enables lightweight and low-power EO/IR sensor pod  (3) Potential to eliminate gimbals used in EO sensor pod  (4) Optical beam-steering for lasercom application  (5) Enables lightweight beam-directors for high-energy-laser application  (6) Amenable to space platform/environment due to inherent radiation hardness and low SWaP",

We have developed two thin film technologies that are capable of revolutionizing solar collection technology by capturing additional light without the need for the additional expenses associated with mechanical tracking systems. The research uses two sets of thin film layers acting in concert to increase the amount of light reaching the solar cells. The first thin film improves light collection using Holographic Optical Elements. The second thin film layer is shifts the frequency of the incoming solar radiation from the UV of the spectrum into visible regions where the solar cells generate are more efficient. Our Phase I program demonstrated that the technologies were scalable to 600mmx300mm sizes and capable of generating approximately 60W/m2.

These coatings are applied by a plasma spray process, and the patented technology has reduced the cost of ownership for the U.S. Navy by reducing down time of submarines for replacement of failed connectors from cathodic or corrosion related mechanisms. In spite of the outstanding performance of the original Bond-Coat system, the application is limited to flat or cylindrical surface geometries due to the need for uniform coating thickness. Numerous nonsymmetrical outboard connector types are currently used in Navy Submarines that cannot be coated using the current technology. The Phase I effort demonstrated a second generation NCC system that will permit application to complex surface geometries. The technology developed is capable of coating, with uniform thickness, surfaces with 90 degree angles. The process also enables coating of connector inside diameters. TRI/Austin is working with a major underwater connector manufacturer to transition the developed NCC materials which can be processed using conventional application equipment and procedures.",

The innovation is based on a strategic combination of active noise reduction (ANR) and passive treatment elements in a pillow style arrangement. Two performance objectives to be demonstrated include laboratory testing by attenuating a 106dB pink noise field to 80dBA at the patients ears and flight testing in a representative MEDEVAC helicopter with 15dBA attenuation.  A sophisticated FE model of the active pillow and rotorcraft interior will be developed in conjunction with Genetic Algorithms to determine an optimal active pillow design for maximum performance.  A prototype will be constructed and tested under laboratory protocols referenced to the ANSI S12.42-2010 standard and flight testing programs. Practical product design aspects related to the size, weight, power consumption and integration into the MEDEVAC rotorcraft interior will be developed and implemented.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Lumir is developing the Predicting, Analyzing, and Tracking Training Readiness and Needs (PATTRN) system, a comprehensive multi-format capable data collection, processing, tagging, and storage system which enables users to predict the most effective future training situation(s) for a trainee based on their past performance and their current and future proficiency profile.  PATTRN will be capable of identifying which skills are decaying and when they will fall below an acceptable threshold, and informing how scenarios and training exercises can be best constructed and where the most efficient training can occur. The PATTRN system is designed and architected for implicit integration with enterprise systems such as AFRLs ongoing Learning Management System Advanced Technology Development (LMS ATD) project to maximize the benefits derived from existing systems.  An underlying component of PATTRN is the Common Data Acquisition system (CoDA), which is a completed Lumir Phase II SBIR that is currently being used within the AFRL DMO testbed. Lumir will leverage CoDAs extensive capabilities to process, translate, tag, and store data from multiple native formats as the backbone of the PATTRN system. Advanced query capabilities will also provide the ability to examine scenario objects such as the effectiveness of formations and tactics against opposing forces.    BENEFIT:  At the conclusion of Phase II PATTRN will be a powerful data processing and storage system that will provide much-needed capabilities that will increase training effectiveness while at the same time decreasing training costs.  PATTRN will provide the following benefits:   Integration of previously isolated multiple data sources that will provide a robust, detailed representation of pilot proficiency.    Advanced query capabilities that will enable users to address higher order research questions and adapt to changing needs, priorities, and capabilities.   Detailed mappings of component metrics to a comprehensive set of skills that will enable automated compilation, analysis, and representation.   Predictive modeling of skill decay that will inform instructors of current and future training needs, facilitating scenario selection, scheduling, and allocation of training resources for individual pilots as well as pilot groups.    Measures of latency training that will increase the accuracy of skill decay models as well as inform the extent to which non-formal training activities impact skill decay and guide latency training based on pilot needs.   Mapping of training activities to proficiency constructs which will enable PATTRN to recommend training scenarios and activities based on the intersection of individual or group needs.  PATTRNs capabilities also position it to be successfully applied in commercial settings.  While its expansion into other areas of the U.S. Armed forces is a natural next step, being especially ready to be applied to multiple platforms in the USAF, PATTRN also fits the needs of education, law enforcement, and public safety.  In education, changes in teacher licensure requirements indicate the educational system is moving towards a more intentional, high-stakes training system for teachers, and a more authentic, longitudinal growth model for students.   Both of these cases fit into PATTRNs ability to predict when skills need to be trained and represent levels of proficiency from multiple sources.  In law enforcement and public safety, missteps and misconduct cost governments hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars annually, and a large portion of this can be reasonably attributed to skill decay.  PATTRNs ability to help individual manage the changing risks associated with skill decay can improve effectiveness and significantly reduce costs.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Continuing the Phase I research involving VOC Odor Signature modeling, Toyon Research Corporation and North Carolina State University proposes to develop two products of the Phase II effort: VOCScenario and VOCSourceSeek.    VOCScenario will provide a simulation environment for supporting the development emerging e-nose sensors for Volatile Organic Chemicals (VOCs). The solution relies on the ability to predict the spatio-temporal distribution of signatures formed by mixtures of VOCs at the appropriate resolution necessary to support further studies, over a range of applications that includes indoor and outdoor environments, and a variety of sources. Features include data visualization, pre-defined scenarios, and a sensor modeling capability to emaulate actual sensor results. The architecture supports honest evaluation of source localization algorithms.    VOCSourceSeek is intended to quickly identify the source using handheld sensors. The envisioned solution relies on localization algorithms that use a mixture of environmental knowledge and real-time sensor data to estimate the position and strength of a source. The Phase II effort will consider two proposed algorithms: one based on a gradient-based search, and the other using Bayesian inference techniques. The Phase II effort involves assessing each algorithm in simulation and with a Proof-of-Concept test that implements a prototype VOCSourceSeek concept.  BENEFIT:  VOCScenario provides AFRL with a robust means of establishing sensor requirements investigating new ConOps, assessing localization algorithms, and determining the time and length scales of interest for a wide spectrum of applications. The results will mitigate the technical risk associated with new sensing technologies by enabling researchers to conduct trade studies and analyses with a synthetic dataset that has much more fidelity and resolution than could ever be affordably measured in a test environment.    Potential uses for the localization architecture and algorithms that are part of VOCSourceSeek can be found in many applications, including leak detection, explosive detection, victim search and rescue, tracking individuals, and indoor air quality surveys.",

The synergy between different sensor platforms will provide enhanced battlefield awareness as well as enhanced net-centric, collaborative targeting.  Until now, the upgrade cost and complexity has prevented the Air Force from fielding a long-term, adequate solution.  FIRST RF proposes an innovative multi-band antenna system that provides a rapid response to the Air Forces needs by utilizing existing antenna mounting locations. Furthermore, FIRST RFs solution will supplement, not remove the existing antenna functionality.  The additional antenna bands provided can then enable a solution that is tailored to the current situations demands.  The Phase II program will demonstrate FIRST RFs unique ability to develop a solution without sacrificing cost or schedule.  BENEFIT:  The multi-band antenna system proposed by FIRST RF will enable rapid communication between various C2ISR aircraft.  The synergy between different sensor platforms will provide enhanced battlefield awareness as well as enhanced net-centric, collaborative targeting.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  High performance, low cost diplexers in compact form factors are a crucial element in the Geodesic Dome Phase Array Antenna (GDPAA), now at TRL6. One diplexer for SGLS transmit/receive and one for USB transmit/receive are used in each Transmit/Receive module. The current coaxial ceramic diplexers are a major cost and size driver with an impact on the physical configuration of the GDPAA. In quantity the proposed Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) diplexers would be about 6 times less expensive and have a volume and weight of about 1/50 that of the coaxial ceramic diplexers. BAW filters have grown from research to recent commercialization in millions of units in the PCS market. The commercial frequencies do not align with the GDPAA, however, and COTS solutions are not available. We propose designing BAW filters and combining circuits for the specific GDPAA bands and rejection needs with a process that can be replicated for other challenges in the increasingly crowded 1-10 GHz spectrum.  BENEFIT:  The frequencies associated with the GDPAA fall within the total spectrum of cell phone technology. In fact the fabrication of the Transmit/Receive Module developed to TRL6 was dependent on the active components that were associated with this sector of frequency spectrum. Since the spectrum is getting very crowded, bandpass filters using BAW technology will find direct use in some of the current phone systems, especially where high dynamic range, low distortion and high rejections are required. The proposed process of designing BAW filters for transmission and for interference rejection can be replicated for commercial applications as well as military applications",

Inventors have developed new types of tourniquets, including the Abdominal Aortic Tourniquet (AAT) and the Combat Ready Clamp (CRoC) to address these abdominal and pelvic injuries. While these hemorrhage control technologies have been developed, validated, and approved for use, training systems that teach and refresh skills related to these technologies have not yet been developed. These training systems are vital because these skills can be difficult to train and are infrequently used. To address these needs, we are developing Tourniquet Master Training (TMT), a scenario-based training system featuring (1) a reconfigurable sensor system linked to a software-based virtual mentor that provides objective assessment during training, and (2) a mobile mentor that provides refresher training.

        "abstract": "Despite heavy vehicles representing a small portion of vehicles on the roads, they have significant influences on pavement, safety, environment, energy consumption, and the performance of traffic system. Weigh-In-Motion (WIM) has been employed as a major technology to collect heavy vehicle data on freeways. Because WIM systems are costly and sophisticated, how to effectively utilize the valuable WIM data, monitor WIM stations' performance, and identify out of calibration stations are especially important. In the Phase I study, we had successfully demonstrated an innovative and yet practical approach for heavy vehicle tracking that combined the use of both WIM and inductive loop signature data. In this Phase II project, we propose to develop a Commercial Vehicle Tracking System (CVTS), which tracks heavy/commercial vehicles across WIM stations, Continuous Counting Stations (CCSs) and Continuous Vehicle Classification (CVC) stations in the freeway network. The integration of the inductive loop signature and WIM technologies offers a low-cost solution to monitor the performance of WIM stations, to identify out-of-calibration stations, and to collect truck movement data. The proposed CVTS can be used for various transportation applications such as emission estimations, freight management, planning and modeling, and performance monitoring of the national freight network required by MAP-21.",

However, in most instances only a small fraction of the functionality included in a particular software component is needed. Not only is there a performance cost, but the prevalence of security vulnerabilities suggests that even unused functionality in binaries and shared libraries can be dangerous.  We propose to build a new tool, called Reopt, that is capable of optimizing compiled binaries to a particular target platform. As part of this effort, Galois will develop a binary disassembler capable of generating LLVM bytecode from binary machine code. This will allow us to use LLVM-based optimizers to recompile the binary program. In addition, Galois will be working with SRI International as a subcontractor. SRI has developed a prototype tool, Occam, that optimizes binaries through aggressive inlining and partial evaluation. Also as part of this effort, Galois will be working with Zephyr Software on a tool to integrate portions of the original binary with the newly optimized code to create a new optimized binary.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Next generation liquid rocket systems, envision novel designs for cryogenic turbopumps that exhibit high suction performance with low inlet pressures, operate at high tip speeds to reduce size and weight, and can be throttled over a wide range of low, off-design flow conditions where the inlet flow quality is poor with large backflow.  These are extremely demanding flow regimes which make the inducer susceptible to a range of cavitation instabilities that can lead to performance loss and potentially catastrophic damage due to large dynamic pressure loads.  To mitigate these instabilities design strategies that employ cavitation suppression devices have to be explored to achieve robust performance over a wide operating range.  The innovation proposed here is the development of a novel cavitation suppression concept that will be tested and the test data used to validate and mature the simulation framework, CRUNCH CFD as a design support tool.  The resulting products at the end of the Phase II effort will be both a practical cavitation suppression device that is demonstrated to function for the flow regimes of interest, and a well-validated analysis tool, CRUNCH CFD, that can be used to predict performance and optimize designs of these devices.  BENEFIT:  This framework can be used as a design support tool for upper stage engines in the Next Generation Engine (NGE) program and would help reduce design cycle times.  It would also support technology development efforts for NASAs SLS program where new boosters that have a heavy lift capability will be designed.  It is anticipated that this product will be of interest as a design support tool to the aerospace industry. In addition, a broader market exists, comprising industrial pump designers who would be interested in using this product for designing high-energy systems such as boiler feed pumps and fuel injection pumps.  In these applications, the pumps are required to perform at off-design conditions over extended time periods.  They typically are required to be certified for a specified durable life operation (e.g. 40,000 hours) and have stringent vibration level requirements, making it critical that cavitation effects be eliminated or mitigated.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  CIRRUS is an innovative marriage of cloud computing and state-of-the-art compression methods to develop a secure cloud computing environment for providing Infrared (IR) space surveillance data to warfighters via a high bandwidth constrained channel (56k). CIRRUS works by partitioning images and distributing the resulting segments, known as chips throughout the high performance portions of the cloud.  This allows us to perform processing tasks such as compression and encryption at the data node optimally.  Downloads start with the first available chip, further reducing time to retrieve any particular image. In addition, CIRRUS incorporates several novel algorithms including: 1) a method to find images with important features without downloading the entire image set, 2) an approach to better match the operational need and reduce overall bandwidth requirements, and 3) a method that can reduce the required bandwidth by identifying which parts of an image could be provided as lossy. These algorithms will serve to facilitate faster data downloads and provide an example of how the architecture can be extended with future image processing features.  These capabilities will be integrated in a CIRRUS prototype to demonstrate the performance, security, feasibility and failover capabilities of a cloud computing architecture.  BENEFIT:  CIRRUS solves the topics IR compression and standards/security compliance problem with cost-effective, proven technologies.  It is applicable to similar needs across myriad government and commercial organizations.  CIRRUS has enormous benefits any time a small portion of a massive image dataset is needed for rapid, on-the-fly application in the field. Analysis and visualization can be provided to a bandwidth constrained device and could help: precision agriculture, construction, the medical community and first responders, and telecommunications just to name a few. The general explosion in cloud computing market growth will result in more target platforms on which to run CIRRUS and more target applications that could use CIRRUS services.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Welkin Sciences proposes to develop, build, test, and demonstrate Legacy Modem Data Converters (LMDC) to enable the Department of Defenses (DoD) traditional L-band analog SATCOM modems to operate with future SATCOM terminals utilizing Digital IF architectures. The LMDC will be designed to be compliant with the Army Future Advanced SATCOM Terminal (FAST) Open Standard Digital Interface (OSDI) specification.  BENEFIT:  Implementation of the LMDC will allow the DoD continued use of their large inventory of legacy analog modems as Digital IF technology evolves and deploys in new SATCOM terminals throughout the world. The LMDC facilitates the DoDs transition to Digital IF technology while avoiding costly new equipment purchase and potential impacts to schedule due to new equipment deployment. Two primary reasons for integrating Digital IF technology into future SATCOM terminals are to improve fidelity for L-band signal transmission within the terminal and to allow more flexible signal switching and routing. Digital IF allows signal transport over long distances without loss of signal integrity as often happens with transmission of analog L-band signals. A recognized problem in existing terminals is the loss of signal fidelity when signals are transmitted over analog-fiber, a common means for signal transport over modest distances. The loss of fidelity over analog cabling is typically not critical for receive signals on the downlink, but can be an issue for transmit signals. When Digital IF is used for signal transport over digital optical fiber, loss of signal fidelity on inter-facility cables need no longer be a consideration for antenna placement. The Digital IF advantage even opens up the possibility of inter-terminal signal transport, over Defense Information Systems Network (DISN), which is currently not practical.",

The most critical obstacle to seamless HIE is the translation from a proprietary medical terminology to a universal reference language (e.g., universal standards).      Our system, called MediBridge, addresses this challenge through three primary techniques.  First, we employ a novel approach to terminology mapping by exploiting feedback gathered from a community of domain and subdomain experts.  Second, we will enhance mapping accuracy by pairing these community contributions with a committee of complementary&quot;expert&quot;evidence sources.  Finally, we will incorporate an active learning module to recognize when ambiguity resolution by a human-in-the-loop can have a cascading effect throughout the automated mapping process and thereby prioritize user operations that can profitably constrain/direct the process with little effort.  We established the feasibility of our approach by prototyping custom task-centered user interfaces within a semiautomatic terminology-mapping workflow in order to create more comprehensive and precise mappings without imposing upon individual users.  Phase I proved the concept and has set the stage for full implementation of MediBridge in Phase II.",

The work herein uses unique capabilities of dense package optical modulator with high-extinction ratio and high bandwidth along with a communication and control system that allow for instrument scalability to serve many classes of optical and RF testing.  BENEFIT:  The need for active laser sensor/seeker testing is a persistent challenge for DoD applications. Within the specific context of this effort; hardware-in-the-loop test and evaluation is a critical element of DoD research and development and electronics systems comprise a majority of these efforts. As such, the need for highly capable test instrumentation has always been critical to our ability to remain in the lead. These simulation systems provide incredible cost and performance benefits in the fielded systems that cannot be achieved any other way. Challenges exist now in the ability of the test instruments to provide adequate simulation for emerging system. These systems include complex platforms consisting of high-fidelity, multi-spectral sensors, their targeting and discrimination processors, and the guidance subsystems. MDA, AFRL, the Army, and the Navy are all investing in HWIL T &amp; E in an effort to provide sufficient capability. Hyper-Computing clusters, new projectors, and injectors are being developed but methods of integrating them remain highly customized and woefully inadequate. This Phase II effort will provide the capability for laboratory data communications with more than 100x the current bandwidth, integrate the key components for dense optical modulation packaging and drive electronics, and integrate the instrument into the Eglin KHILS facility to address customer needs and demonstrate the end-to-end capability of the concept. DoD programs will directly benefit with reduced cost for test and evaluation while simultaneously improving the quality, scalability, and relevance of testing.

(GNI) has successfully demonstrated that directed energy, in the correct spectra and power level combinations, is an effective alternative to chemical treatment for floral disruption and as part of an overall integrated pest management strategy. It can be implemented as part of an overall integrated pest management strategy that can be employed at Edwards Air Force Base and other USAF/DoD locations.    In previous work observed control includes leaf chlorophyll loss, leaf desiccation, outer bark damage, biomass loss and no re-greening or re-growth. Outcomes equal to that of conventional chemical applications have been achieved and with these additional advantages: easy-to-use, non-chemical, and safe; easily adapted to mobile and remote use; environmentally neutral; and able to integrate with other maintenance operations and equipment.    The proposed Phase II Program will develop and demonstrate an affordable and user-ready full-scale Directed Energy Floral Disruptor Platform system based upon our Phase I results. The under-lying technique is range-independent and will be shown suitable for both near-contact and longer-range stand-off situations.    BENEFIT:  Military facilities must abate and control the spread and growth of unwanted plants or weeds. Similar requirements exist for forestry service, agriculture, public green space, construction sites, and private users.  The proposed device will provide a viable and cost effect alternative to traditional chemical or mechanical weed control techniques in both established facilities and new forward locations; reducing handling and logistics costs while also meeting emerging domestic and global environmental impact reduction needs.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  It is a goal of the United States Air Force (USAF) to maintain its fleet of aircraft in a maximum state of readiness.  The use of oil analysis as a means of continuous surveillance of the state of these fleets is a well-established practice which has been employed by the USAF and supported by their major equipment suppliers for decades.  The United States Air Force has identified a need for review and analysis of the current practices and equipment associated with the Air Force Oil Analysis Program (AFOAP).  Modifications to program schedule, processes, data and equipment may help create a more efficient effective oil analysis program.  This SBIR will develop a more modern approach to oil analysis that provides a more effective process leading to improved budget efficiencies and improved safety and maintenance practices that are better aligned with USAF Condition Based Maintenance policies. Statistical justification for implementing the new approach will be stressed through continuing data analysis and validation, testing of alternative monitoring tools, and providing a plan to progress towards a more efficient paradigm.  BENEFIT:  An improved Air Force Oil Analysis program may yield significant budget efficiencies, and also lead to improved safety and maintenance practices that are better aligned with USAF Condition Based Maintenance policies.  The review and analysis process for evaluating the current effectiveness of the AFOAP program and resulting recommendations developed from this SBIR are directly applicable to improvement of other DOD oil analysis programs as well as commercial oil analysis programs. Worldwide, there are millions of complex, oil-wetted mechanical systems operated by thousands of customers. These customers often maintain their machinery using outdated, isolated laboratory or monitoring techniques that have carried over from legacy equipment and methodologies, hence there is a substantial potential for the application of the concepts developed under this SBIR program to modernize/optimize other oil analysis programs",

This allows ADEC to rapidly detect multiple classes of counterfeits, including aged/recycled parts, upmarked/mismarked components, etc. as anything that alters the internal circuitry results in a change in emission phenomenology.  ADEC has been matured for complex Integrated Circuits (ICs) such as microprocessors, microcontrollers, memory, and programmable logic devices, but only limited analyses have been performed on other device classes (analog devices, passives, and non-silicon based electronics).  Under this effort, Nokomis will expand ADEC to cover these device classes and consequently provide a single system that is able to screen for all classes of counterfeit electronics.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Aeroelastic stability or flutter testing has been and will continue to be a critical part of the development of any new aircraft system or configuration expansion to ensure that it is free of any excessive and possibly destructive aeroelastic interactions. In Phase I, novel identification techniques were combined into a toolset capable of performing real-time identification of aeroelastic modal frequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes directly from output-only flight test data, and present these data in a clear manner via prototype displays. In addition to validation with flight test data, real-time simulations were performed using an aeroelastic high speed fighter aircraft model and a live pilot to demonstrate the capabilities. Phase II will build on these successes by iterating upon and improving the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of each of these identification algorithms and displays. Comprehensive validation will be performed with abundant flight test data and live piloted simulations and will address poor sensor readings, loss of telemetry and other failures. The result of Phase II will be a validated toolset: Modal Identification Software Toolbox (MIST), an IADS-based control room tool used to identify aircraft modal frequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes in real-time using live telemetry data.  BENEFIT:  The benefits of the resulting MIST software are twofold: increased confidence in the safety of the aircraft and reduced flight test costs. By better informing the control room of the status of the aircraft, in particular its proximity to a potential flutter region (determined by examining the modal damping values), a more informed assessment of the state of the aircraft can be made. With this knowledge, potentially dangerous flutter regions can be avoided and known stable regions more confidently established, increasing flight safety for the pilot. In addition, decisions to expand the test envelope can be made in flight rather than requiring extensive evaluations post flight before the next round of testing. This ability to test more points more confidently in one flight can also reduce costs by minimizing the required flight test time dedicated to these evaluations and the additional costs associated with supporting the control room and staff.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The ability to extract structure mode shapes, accurate system frequency/damping and to predict the onset of flutter/LCO in a real-time capacity from flight/wind tunnel test data are some of the toughest challenges facing control room engineers today.  In Phase I, ZONA Technology successfully developed prototype IADS ActiveX controls (i.e., the ZAMS+ Toolset) towards meeting these challenges.  In Phase II we propose to mature and extend the ZAMS+ Toolset to establish a simple-to-use, user-friendly, commercially-viable software for the entire IADS flight test community.  First, a Windows pre-processing program will be developed to provide a fast and parametrical graphical approach to setup the ZAMS+ 3D surface panel models and all required input for mode shape visualization.  Second, the system identification capability of ZAMS+ OMS will be extended with a broadened CDSS method and innovative Physical Modes Selection Algorithm to support real-time flutter predictor capability.  The new ZAMS+ OMS will provide both a full user-interactive and automated \"hands free\" approaches towards system identification and flutter prediction.  Third, to support Ground Vibration Test (GVT) derived modes, a new data loader will be added for loading and display of GVT derived modes to supplement the current analytical mode capability used for overlaid mode shape correlation.  BENEFIT:  The proposed research and development effort will enhance flight test control room personnel's capability to obtain: (1) overlaid mode shape correlation of flight test system extracted modes versus analytical or GVT derived modes on 3D surface panel models, (2) the modal participation of the natural modes to the aircraft's aeroelastic response, (3) accurate aeroelastic system frequency and damping to gauge aircraft stability, and (4) flutter/LCO prediction via two flutter prediction approaches.    The mode shape correlation display, in conjunction with the aircraft aeroelastic response displayed in the existing ZAMS tool, will help engineers identify how the structure modes interact with the aerodynamics throughout all flight conditions.    The commercial potential for ZAMS+ Toolset is great as real-time mode shape identification, accurate system frequency/damping, and flutter prediction capability are crucial data to obtain for all wind tunnel and flight tests.    The resulting ZAMS+ toolset will also provide valuable insight into the aero-structure interaction phenomenon that can lead to reduced flight testing.  Mode shape correlation can also alleviate costs and burden associated with GVT.  Users of these tools will include IADS customers, such as, Edwards AFB, Eglin AFB, Naval Air Weapons Center, Korean Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney, Israeli Air Force, Singapore Air Force, Cessna, Bell Helicopter, Northrop Grumman, Alenia/Italy, General Atomics, Boeing, Gulfstream, Holloman AFB, Raytheon, Hill AFB, and Lockheed.",

Continuously refreshing the target system to a new virtual instance with a known trusted state and random service\nattributes, this limited-time-use virtual instance is comprised of a single application and OS combination and reduces system complexity.\nDuring Phase II, Endeavor will develop an application that will build on our successful Phase I MESS prototype.

Today, web security products detect and block attacks by enforcing acceptable use policies, and analyzing\nweb traffic, content, etc. Powered by MESS allows multi-layer protections by deploying public interface obfuscation and live service migration\ntechnique. It conceals the public interface from adversaries and enables web services to self-defend and self-recover. application is a game-changing\ncyber defense system, not by detecting, but by concealing; not by blocking, but by cleaning.\nBy Phase II completion, application will handle high traffic volume and multiple simultaneous connections, and be ready for the pilot/field test.\nEndeavor will work with clients and partners like DHS, Air Force, and McAfee to outline a pilot/field test plan.

More specifically, final hardware deliverables for this project include three (3) tested hybrid modules that integrate a 1024x1024 24-micron pitch SWIR LED emitter array with a matching 1024x1024 CMOS RIIC chip. These hybrids will provide laboratory capability to stimulate prototype or imaging SWIR sensors, thus enabling urgently needed development of SWIR sensor capability. Our emitter technology is based on GaInAsSb quaternary semiconductor LED arrays hybridized to CMOS read-in integrated circuits (RIIC).  BENEFIT:  Infrared LED (IRLED) arrays represent a potentially game changing technology for presenting infrared images in sensor ground test environments offering high frame rate and high temperature simulation, while achieving superior manufacturing yield and uniformity than competing resistor array technology. The proposed work offers a significant opportunity for achieving near-term breakthrough results in making effective IRLED scene projectors by developing areas of IRLED technology that have not been previously addressed.",

The ability to operate in linear mode is a significant advancement over Geiger mode APDs due to the reduced complexity and bias circuitry required to support those devices.

In Phase I, POC conclusively demonstrated the feasibility of the iSCAD system by validating the system and sensor concept through system design, analysis, pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and simulations, assembly and testing of a proof-of-concept prototype. The Phase I project has eliminated the initial risk and created a clear path for the engineering development of the technology in Phase II, which will focus on optimization, engineering risk reduction and testing.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The objective of this sequential Phase II SBIR is to deliver a Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL-6) airborne HF, VHF and UHF RF direction finding system that is suitable for integration with SUAS and to demonstrate it in a realistic airborne environment against representative signals.  This proposed effort leverages the completed Army Phase I SBIR that demonstrated accurate DF in field tests, and outperformed the incumbent system in all DF performance metrics. The field test scenarios were for man-borne, on-the-go, DF in the HF, VHF and UHF bands and used realistic geometries and radios. The antenna assembly of the ASI system was 1/26th the volume of the incumbent system. The incumbent was only capable of DF on VHF and UHF communications.  Tactical RF Sensing at HF, VHF and UHF frequencies to detect, identify, characterize and locate emitters is a technology gap across all services for a broad range of applications. Delivering the objective of this sequential Phase II SBIR demonstrates the closure of that gap and has the potential to drive significant strategic and commercial value.  BENEFIT:  Airborne RF sensing depends on antennas that can be integrated into aircraft. Airborne antennas for HF, VHF and UH frequencies are a technology portfolio gap due to their size. Traditional antennas are typically 1/4 wavelength long, configured either in arrays or mechanically rotated and must be located outside the metal airframe. At VHF (100MHz) and HF (10MHz) frequencies, typical antennas are 2ft and 20ft. These sizes are challenging to integrate into aircraft and payload structures, particularly for small and/or expendable UAS. At higher frequencies (L, X and K bands) the antennas are smaller and the challenges of integrating them into airframes are substantially relaxed.  The objective of this Phase II SBIR is to deliver and demonstrate small form factor HF, VHF and UHF RF DF systems suitable for integration with SUAS (e.g. Puma AE, Silver Fox) to locate RF emitters, including radar and communication equipment.  Future roadmap developments can enable this technology to operate on the full spectrum emitters: RF operating bands can be increased to higher frequencies; operating range can be increased from close-in SUAS tactical ranges to stand-off range RF sensing; and, the addition of RF emitter functions can enable radar spoofing.  These combinations of features drive significant strategic and commercial value.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  ISR analysts are faced with severe challenges due to the volume of data, the speed at which it arrives, and the variety in sensor signatures and scene content. FMV and WAMI analysts face a fire hose of pixel data. Kitware has developed significant capabilities for ISR video exploitation, with a focus on   understanding the function of objects and regions in the scene. These function-based exploitation tools can provide significant help in the automation of both real-time and forensic ISR video exploitation. We plan to leverage and enhance these capabilities to help further advance the state of the art in exploitation technologies. The development and transition of these technologies to operational use could significantly improve the quality of intelligence derived from video streams as well as reduce the resources, both time and personnel, necessary to extract critical intelligence. In terms of commercial opportunities, there are large system integrators who provide FMV exploitation workstations, including Leidos&quot;AIMES system and General Dynamics MAAS systems to the government. Kitware has already received a Phase III SBIR to start transition of our FMV capabilities into the AIMES system.  BENEFIT:  The primary benefit of the proposed work is a solution to the ISR analyst data-workload challenge. ISR analysts are faced with severe challenges due to the volume of data, the speed at which it arrives, and the variety in sensor signatures and scene content. There are not enoughWAMI analysts to view and exploit all the pixels currently produced by the sensor, even in forensic exploitation. The proposed technology will benefit military analysts on the ground who are responsible for gathering, analyzing, and acting on intelligence, a critical component of almost every mission, though the use of automatic, function-based object detection. The proposed technology will reduce analyst workload while simultaneously increasing the amount of data that can be analyzed, improving security and intelligence gathering. Additionally, there are commercial applications of the technology that provide public benefit and commercial opportunities. These opportunities include the integration of the technology with unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in the commercial sector to benefit precision agriculture; security and monitoring for public safety; exploration, aid efforts, and disaster recovery; and environmental monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Optical fibers are extensively used in military aircraft, both as interconnects in electronic cards and in aircraft frames. Fiber ribbons, manufactured primarily by W.L. Gore, used in computer cards suffer significant breakage failures, usually close to the exit point of the MT connectors and at points where they have been tacked to prevent movement. Fiber cables, primarily manufactured by OFS, suffer maintenance induced breaks when, for example, a heavy object falls on them or they are bent sharply at an anchor point. Both these situations would benefit from development of a rugged, durable optical replacement fiber. Ideally, it should be a drop-in replacement for currently used fiber.  There is significant handling associated with the bonding of optical transceivers to circuit cards which can result in broken or cracked fibers that later become failure points. Optical cables used in aircraft frames, such as JSF and F-18, are manufactured by OFS, Tensolite and General Cable. A cable made by using a LCP buffer layer, as proposed by Linden, is likely to be both hermetic and strong. Programs such as JSF may benefit from development of such cables.  Linden fabricated and tested an optical fiber consisting of commercial polyimide buffered fiber surrounded by a dual extruded layer of LCP and fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP). These can be applied to bend insensitive fiber already available commercially from OFS, DRAKA, Corning and Sumitomo. This is attractive since it takes COTS fiber and makes it kink and bend insensitive, moisture resistance, chemical resistant and exhibit high tensile strength. The cable has been tested to be impact resistant, kink resistant, and passes temperature cycling test.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  QuinStar Technology proposes to develop an efficient, solid-state power amplifier (SSPA), operating over the 71 to 76 GHz band, for use in high data rate satellite transmitters. The goals of an efficient >35 watt, power amplifier at these frequencies will be met by employing a combination of state-of-the-art (SOA) wide-bandgap gallium nitride (GaN) HEMT device technology and innovative power combining techniques. Existing programs have focused on developing higher power MMIC amplifiers. However, efficient high power devices have not been realized to date. To achieve the power and efficiency goals QuinStar proposes use low loss high order combining networks to power combine a large number of smaller high efficiency MMIC amplifier blocks.  BENEFIT:  Future warfighters will require increased SATCOM capacity for improved situational awareness. Current SATCOM bands are already overly congested indicating the need to exploit nontraditional frequency spectra, such as the E-band up and down links at 81-86 GHz and 71-76 GHz, respectively. This proposal addresses the downlink requirement by proposing a >35 W high-efficiency power amplifier for the transmitter. High efficiency is required to reduce the prime power requirements and to reduce self-heating. This, in turn, will increase the amplifiers reliability or lifetime (MTTF). In addition to SATCOM UAV applications, this linear, high-efficiency SSPA technology can be utilized in space-based applications including broadband RF cross-link communications in satellite constellations and the Air Forces V/W-band communications system. Specific examples include the Joint Arial Layered Network (JALN) and AISR architectures. Furthermore, this high-efficiency power MMIC technology can be readily applied to other military/NASA missions in the adjacent frequency bands, V and W. QuinStar, as a merchant supplier of high-rel microwave and millimeter-wave components, is uniquely positioned in the marketplace to capitalize on this opportunity to become a major supplier of high-rel, high-efficiency SSPAs for airborne, space and broadband point-to-point communications transceivers.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The ultimate goal of this effort is to develop a distributed, intelligent, cooperative AFSCN mission planning and scheduling system (DICAMPSS) to implement an improved scheduling process and greater sharing and availability of information and knowledge.  Such a distributed intelligent communications resource scheduling capability will provide better quality schedules; faster scheduling and quicker response to real-time changes and events; handle larger, more complex sets of requests; and handle additional AFSCN system capabilities.  Important components of automating the entire AFSCN scheduling/deconfliction process are automatic abnormal RTS signal detection/prediction, far-future and contingency scheduling/planning, and intelligent, intuitive user interfaces for the SOCs, RTSs, 22 SOPS, and the JSpOC and 22 SOPS crew commanders.      The goals of the proposed research are to develop the full-scale DICAMPSS and show superior performance and capabilities on AFSCN scheduling, deconfliction, and negotiation both during the deconfliction period and in real-time; improve and enhance ABNet to increase its level of automation, greatly decrease the amount of manpower required, incorporate additional inputs, and provide reasoning over its outputs for intuitive, concise display to end-users; allow appropriate far-future and contingency planning; provide intelligent, user-friendly interfaces for a diversity of personnel; and integrate with existing required software and prepare to integrate with JMS.      BENEFIT:  The most direct target for the results of this effort is the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN).  By both demonstrating significantly improved performance during Phase II and ensuring that the ultimate results can be integrated into Air Force operations, the Air Force will have a strong incentive to operationalize the Phase II development of the proposed DICAMPSS.  Additionally NASA has the space communications networks, which can utilize this software (Deep Space Network (DSN), Space Network (SN), and Ground Network (GN)).  We are already marketing Aurora, our general intelligent planning and scheduling framework, and customizing it for a variety of domains.  The additional capabilities developed for distributed, cooperative communication scheduling can be synergistically marketed to the same clients.  We anticipate that this effort will result in additional scheduling algorithms that we will be able to incorporate into our existing scheduling products, thus increasing the benefits they provide and their value.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Current Separable Thermal Mechanical Interfaces (STMIs) found in advanced digital processing electronics are unable to efficiently remove dissipated heat, limiting performance far below their capability.  The standard approach produces high contact resistance (~1.0C-in./W) with local variations in excess of 25%, severely limiting allowable electronic power levels.  During this program, we will develop an innovative STMI that increases contact pressure, minimizes interface separation found in current approaches, and results in an order of magnitude decrease in contact resistance.  During Phase I, we:  (1) demonstrated the feasibility of our concept by developing a Creare Card Lock (CCL) that achieved a thermal contact resistance of 0.25C-in./W, well below the Phase I goal; (2) verified that our performance predictions for the Phase I STMI matched the experimental results; and (3) using the CCL as a baseline card lock, determined that with minor, end user-approved chassis modifications, an advanced STMI can achieve a contact resistance of 0.11C-in./W.  During the Phase II project, we will complete the design, fabrication, testing, prequalification, and production planning of the prototype STMI to enable rapid technology transition and commercialization.  BENEFIT:  Creares STMI will reduce thermal contact resistance in slice-based plug and play electronic card cage applications by a factor of ten (10).  This will enable higher power density electronic architectures for satellites, computers, and high-power lasers with no configuration changes.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  NanoSonic has successfully transitioned our high-strength-to-weight ratio, flexible, yet high strength, aramid-based, noble metal nanoparticle modified metamaterials into EM tailored Thoraeus Rubber&#61652; (TR) composites.  During Phase I, NanoSonic demonstrated ultra-low mass density (0.58 g/cc) Metal Rubber-Kevlar Veil (MR-KV) composites with uniform transmission loss (up to 100 dB loss at 2  18 GHz) that maintain EM properties under mechanical strain down to -50 C, upon extreme heat (blow torch exposure), and at low frequency post irradiation under a 60Co source.   These tough composites resist damaging chemicals, are nickel-free to mitigate galvanic corrosion, and shall be transitioned onto Satellite Communication (SATCOM) systems as a simple and cost effective material solution to assure electronics protection (EP) on space-based Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) against harsh natural or manmade EM environments.  NanoSonic has partnered with Lockheed Martin (LM) to verify survivability under intense EM and radiation threats.  LM shall assist with qualifying TR materials using MIL-STD techniques (e.g. MIL-STD-188-146) to verify shielding effectiveness performance against a variety of radiating EM sources to confirm that it can be utilized with existing aeronautical equipment that requires high levels of EM shielding.  BENEFIT:  NanoSonic would primarily develop its Metal Rubber modified Kevlar based composites as part of the Thoraeus Rubber (TR) family of materials as a super lightweight shielding alternative to heavy metal containers, metal foils, and other heavy attached shielding structures.  The innovative lightweight TR nanocomposites would be primarily transitioned to protect sensors/circuits within space vehicles and aircraft against harsh EM environments.  Our unique TR composites shall serve a broad range of military and civilian applications including avionic and communication systems on board commercial aircraft from low energy personal electronic devices to higher onboard stray radar energy.  Dual-use military applications for various forms of TR nanocomposites include highly mechanically robust EMI and radiation shielding appliques. Additional applications include lightning strike protection and RF shielding for large area structures and sensors.      Additional dual-use civil applications for TR include civilian electronic shielding applications such as cellular phones, sensitive electronics in electronically noisy environments, and sensor systems which may require above average lightweight shielding materials.  Additional civil and homeland security applications include garments for the U.S. warfighter, first responders to environments with radiation dispersal devices or dirty bombs, and medical physicians/patients that may be exposed to radiation.  Conceptually similar multifunctional nanocomposites are being developed for other applications by NanoSonic based on our Metal Rubber and HybridSil Family of materials, in the electronics, aerospace and defense and biomedical engineering areas.  Metal Rubber based materials and textiles are available for sale through our website, www.nanosonic.com, in limited sizes and shapes and with a limited number of properties; and in scaled amounts with custom properties tailored for each customer via contracting.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  If awarded a SBIR Phase II contract, ThermoDynamic Films, LLC, together with the University of New Mexico (UNM) will build a first-generation optical cryocooler. They will add a calibrated load to the device and characterize its efficiency and its cooling speed. Solid-state cryocoolers, which are compact and produce no vibrations, are ideal for many space-born and terrestrial electronics and sensor applications. Currently, the dominant solid-state cooling technology is thermoelectric cooling, which uses the electrical Peltier effect. Despite decades of effort, the lowest achievable temperature for multi-stage thermoelectric coolers (TECs) is around 170 K. The TDF/UNM team is developing an alternative approach to solid-state cooling technology: optical cryocooling. To date, this collaboration has used this technology to cool from room temperature to 93 K with about 1% efficiency. This is the world record cooling for optical refrigeration - or any solid-state cooling technology.  BENEFIT:  In many areas of national defense, scientific and laboratory analytic instruments, medicine and high performance electronics, it is necessary to cool instruments and devices to cryogenic temperatures (below -150Celsius). Cryocoolers are essential components in the infrared (IR) systems that are used for space-born defense applications such as surveillance and ballistic missile guidance. Cryocoolers are an important part of the U.S. governments priority of heightened homeland and international military security. Cryocoolers are also needed to cool superconductors in a host of medical and geological applications. With no moving parts, the optical cryocoolers being developed by ThermoDynamic Films, LLC would not be subject to wear. Additionally, they do not utilize any fluids, which can leak and generally need replenishing. Additional advantages include the compactness of these refrigerators, total lack of vibrations, agility, high temperature stability, the absence of electromagnetic interference (EMI) and rapid cool down.",

If the utility of microsatellites is ever to expand to include high performance mid-wave infrared (MWIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) sensors, significant advancement in the state of art of small cryocooler systems is required.  The proposed effort for the Microsat Cryocooler System (MCS) is to deliver a qualified cryocooler system for cubesat applications that includes a high reliability tactical cryocooler and a miniature set of Low Cost Cryocooler Electronics (mLCCE).  This program will increase the Technology Readiness Level of the current mini-Low Cost Cryocooler Electronics (mLCCE) to support both near term spaceborne and airborne platforms.      BENEFIT:  Advanced component technologies and new electronic architectures will be employed to develop a miniature (nominally 25W) version of the Low Cost Cryocooler Electronics (LCCE).  As with LCCE, the developed mini-LCCE (mLCCE) will support a wide range of mechanical cryocooler solutions, making it the ideal solution to meet the Governments wide range of intended CubeSat and microsat missions and orbits.  Types of space applications include environmental sensing, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, missile warning, planetary exploration and other low cost spaceflight applications.  In addition to serving the space community, the Microsat Cryocooler System is also an ideal fit for tactical airborne Unmanned Aerial Vehicles aiming to increase performance of optical infrared sensors by means of using cryocooler systems.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  There is the growing demand for user terminals for mobile satellite telecommunication (SATCOM) applications including K/Ka dual-band SATCOM for unmanned and manned aircraft platforms. Nuvotronics is pleased to propose a two-year SBIR program to the Air Force for the development of a fully-electronically steerable array capable of scanning beams from zenith to near the horizon to replace a mechanically steerable dish antenna traditionally installed on UAVs. During the first year we will design, fabricate and test all key components of the proposed SATCOM antenna system for UAV including conformal dual K/Ka band dual-CP radiating aperture and beam control elements. In Year 2, Nuvotronics will work with the development, implementation and measurement of a dual K/Ka band dual-CP demonstration array with beam steering capabilities that will be composed of several key parts developed during Year 1. This hardware prototype will demonstrate notional functionality of the proposed SATCOM antenna system for UAV platforms and will be delivered to the government for evaluation.  BENEFIT:  Military and commercial requirements are driving the need for increasing numbers of airborne terminals for SATCOM applications.  Broadband-level connectivity is driving migration to Ka-band and higher frequencies.  The current solutions at Ka-band frequencies are either mechanically-scanned antennas or flat-panel planar arrays--both have drawbacks.  Electronically scanned SATCOM antennas are lower-profile than mechanically-scanned systems.  This is important for aerodynamics of a given platform.  This is also important as increased ISR functionality is placed on smaller UAV platforms, as smaller antennas are required.  A SATCOM antenna replacement for the Predator UAV is an initial target application.  The proposed approach has size and weight advantages compared to currently available systems.",

In our Phase I work we showed the feasibility of modifying the protein quality of several alternate protein sources, specifically animal byproduct meals, and its potential significant impacts on marine fish production.  The next step in our Phase II is to continue this work focused upon fishmeal-free aquafeeds using specifically rendered and formulated ingredients made as complete diets in our new feedmill for feed testing and commercial production.  Furthermore our work suggests that processing of specific feed ingredients destroys or modifies essential micronutrients resulting in poorer performances under commercial aquaculture conditions and we will work with modifications of these ingredient exposed to modified processes to formulate and manufacture fish meal free production diets and conducting extensive feeding trials with representative marine, brackish and freshwater aquaculture species, thereby correlating the presence of absence of these nutrients back to production performance.  These feeds will be tested and sold to U.S. aquaculture producers targeting feed development toward marine and freshwater species for expected international and domestic adoption based on analysis of the economic variables and marketing of the final aquafeeds.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Information fusion and knowledge conflict detection are required for many mission-critical intelligence analysis tasks. Using knowledge extracted from various sources, including entities, relations, and events, intelligence analysts identify relevant documents, integrate facts into summaries about current situation, and augment existing knowledge with inferred information.  To deal with large amount of data, analysts require automated solutions to link events, entities and related knowledge across multiple sources.  Aptima proposes to develop a system for Detecting Relation, Entity, and Attribute Misinformation (DREAM) to support processing of data with redundant, erroneous, and deceptive information. Our solution utilizes information extracted from text to find normal, conflicting and erroneous knowledge. When fully developed, DREAM will provide intelligence analysts with a powerful analysis tool that (1) automatically constructs knowledge graphs from raw text input; (2) finds conflicting knowledge fragments; (3) learns normally occurring knowledge; and (4) helps analysts understand the source of the conflicts in the data.    BENEFIT:  DREAM will allow intelligence analysts and commercial users to reduce the uncertainty in their knowledge bases and detect conflicting and anomalous patterns across multiple documents. For DoD applications, DREAM will support new PCPAD workflow by focusing the analysts on most critical data to reduce the analysis time and increase detection of hostile activities. For commercial applications, DREAM will enable faster and more accurate detection of deception in social media, online fraud, and social engineering activities.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  As unmanned aerial vehicles have become equipped with high-quality cameras, the warfighter has gained access to large quantities of video and motion imagery with both wider areas of coverage and finer resolutions.  For these data to be truly useful, the warfighter needs to be able to precisely geo-locate any pixel in the imagery.  As no geo-location algorithm will be perfect, the warfighter also needs an accurate measure of the confidence in the geo-location solution.    Under this effort we will build on our Phase 1 approach for modeling errors in image-based geo-location algorithms that enables more accurate estimates of precision. We will develop an integrated model for accurately capturing uncertainties in multiple, related error sources of image processing-based geo-location algorithms, resulting in unified framework for estimating the geo-location uncertainty. We will implement real-time algorithms for estimating the model parameters, and evaluate the model against the current state-of-the-art in terms of the accuracy of the uncertainty estimates. The resulting modeling and inference approach will enable real-time, accurate estimates of image-based geo-location and its uncertainty.    BENEFIT:  As the military employs geo-registration across a number of applications, such as image-based navigation and targeting, the technology developed on this program will benefit a wide range of programs. The accurate characterization of geo-location uncertainty will provide a measure of confidence in the results from geo-registration algorithms, enabling the fusion of geo-location information with other sensors. Specifically, for image-aided navigation, this geo-registration information can be fused to enable accurate navigation in GPS-denied environments.  Because the approach builds on existing computer vision algorithms, it has direct commercial application to virtually any autonomous robotic deployment scenario, like emergency search and rescue and remote exploration.",

        "abstract": "In previous work for NASA, Ultramet and ARA Ablatives Laboratory developed and demonstrated advanced foam-reinforced carbon/phenolic ablators that offer substantially increased performance under high heat flux conditions and reduced weight relative to conventional ablators. The two-piece structure consisted of an ablative-filled foam front surface backed by Ultramet's previously established and highly insulating aerogel-filled foam. Arcjet testing was performed at NASA Ames Research Center to heat flux levels exceeding 1000 W/cm2, with the results showing a significantly reduced ablation rate compared to conventional chopped fiber ablators, and ablation behavior comparable to FM5055 at just one-third the density. It is apparent that the foam helps retain the char layer by physical reinforcement and/or that the network of interconnected passages allows pyrolysis gases to escape with less disruption of the char layer. In Phase I, Ultramet teamed with ARA Ablatives for ablative infiltration of Ultramet foams and Materials Research and Design for ablation analysis, to continue optimization of foam-reinforced ablatives by focusing on two primary areas. The ablator formulation infiltrated into the foam was successfully modified to increase heat flux capability consistent with NASA Earth return requirements (1500-2500 W/cm2 or higher). The density can be varied as needed to meet heat flux requirements while minimizing weight. In addition, a single-piece foam structure was demonstrated, rather than separate ablative- and aerogel-filled foam sections. In Phase II, the lightweight hybrid ablator will be optimized for a specific NASA mission, material and structure requirements will be predicted through modeling, and performance will be demonstrated through high heat flux testing at NASA ARC and the Air Force LHMEL-II facility. Scaleup potential will be demonstrated through fabrication of a heat shield module suitable for construction of large modular heat shields.",

The survey concluded, in part, that UAVs offer a significant improvement in data collection capability when compared to manned aircraft that are currently fielded by NOAA.  The Centaur OPA has the potential to serve as a scientific research platform that enables significant mission flexibility to the end user by allowing for both unmanned flight over littorals and spare regions and manned flight over populated or high traffic areas.  Further, the survey concluded that the Centaur OPA offers significant cost savings compared to UAVs currently fielded by government agencies.  During the Phase II program, Aurora will integrate a Micro-g Lacoste TAGS-6 gravity meter in the Centaur OPA and demonstrate the Centaur/TAGS-6 platforms\u2019 ability to autonomously gather gravity data.  The Centaur OPA will fly gravity survey missions that are representative of the gravimeter flight campaigns currently underway by the GRAV-D program.  Aurora intends to demonstrate the capabilities of the Centaur/TAGS-6 platform and its suitability for the GRAV-D program and commercial gravity data gathering applications.",

We used initial feedback from government\nagencies and industry experts, collected during beta testing and Version 1.0 evaluations, to produce Version 1.1 which is technically mature and ready\nfor trial evaluations and sale. However, the path to commercial success requires more than technical capabilities. It requires execution of a\ncommercialization plan; staffing and infrastructure to sustain marketing, sales and support; and the financing to support both. In this proposal we\noutline eight strategic commercialization objectives and a commercialization roadmap that identifies specific tactics and activities that must be\ncompleted to achieve those objectives. We further identify a subset of those activities that we seek to fund through the DHS Commercialization\nReadiness Pilot Program (CRPP), with the remaining activities to be funded with internal and potential venture investment. The proposed Statement of\nWork (SOW) represents the specific commercialization activities that the CRPP funds would support. The SOW includes activities related to creating\nawareness of and demand for Code Dx: developing a set of reference users; promoting Code Dx within the Application Security Testing (AST)\ncommunity and raising awareness among those not engaged in AST due to cost or difficulty in use; outreach to security training organizations; filling in\nsmall competitive gaps such as IDE plug-ins; and establishing partnerships to accelerate marketing and sales.",

Our Phase I study showed a significant increase in achievable area ratio, which, when combined with the low-weight, compact throttling approach, increased  divert specific impulse (Isp) performance.

        "abstract": "Infrared (IR) target scenes can suffer distortion from atmospheric species present along the atmospheric paths through which the signals are propagated, causing errors in derived target characteristics (e.g., position, velocity, angle). The main contributor to these errors is refraction of the signals by water, in its various forms (e.g., vapor, cloud, air-ice mix) along the path. Turbulence phenomena and dynamic climate conditions change the parameters (water density, temperature, pressure) that affect refraction. It is important to correct for these distorting effects in order to accurately determine the position, velocity and angle of target objects in the scene. SSI, in collaboration with CG2, Inc., will complete the development and validation of the Water Effects Correction Software (WECS). The software, customized to accurately model the distorting effects of water on IR scenes, will aid target location and tracking by correcting for the distortion effects.  Given accurate descriptions of water conditions from weather databases, the software will obtain true target location from its apparent position. The algorithms will be accelerated to support real time sensor performance capability.  Approved for Public Release 14-MDA-7903 (2 July 14)",

While lower resolution terrain is often adequate for representing the general shape of the surface, coastal and shoreline features are not represented in the low resolution terrain.

Our Phase 1 work was highly successful, and in Phase 2 Kitware will continue this work by creating an online processing mode and pushing the performance toward real-time. Accuracy and speed will continue to improve through advancements in algorithms as well as GPU and multithreaded parallel processing. Additionally, Phase 2 will add new features such a graphical user interface (GUI), a Python scripting interface, mosaic image generation, and geographic registration to reference imagery. MAP-Tk has great potential in both the military and commercial UAS markets. Applications range from mapping crop damage in precision agriculture to 3D terrain modeling to autonomous GPS-denied navigation.  BENEFIT:  The primary benefit of the proposed work is a solution to problem of camera calibration from motion imagery that is far faster and more accurate than the existing state-of-the-art. This solution will reduce reliance of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems on inertial navigation and global positioning, which are often unreliable or unavailable.  Likewise, it will have the same benefit for commercial mapping applications that rely on aerial video for mapping and 3D urban modeling.    The commercial applications of the proposed work center on the emerging civil unmanned aerial systems (UAS) market. The proposed work will enable UAS technology and services companies to integrate a readily customizable toolkit to provide their customers with more accurate mosaicking and 3D models from FMV and WAMI video coupled with UAS flight paths. This technology will benefit the range of customers leveraging UAS, including precision agriculture; security and monitoring for public safety; exploration, aid efforts, and disaster recovery; journalism, filmmaking, and entertainment; and environmental monitoring.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The increased demand for higher efficiency gas turbine engines is driving new designs capable of operating at higher temperatures and pressure ratios, in fewer stages, and with higher airfoil loads.    These conditions pose a great challenge for turbomachinery designer systems.  One particular area of challenge occurs when accounting for the strong time-varying airfoil loads produced by modern small axial gap designs.  Without reliable and accurate predictions, designers can compromise the durability, reliability and performance of next generation military and commercial gas turbine engines.  Developing a viable solution for estimating the dynamic stresses on the airfoil has two requirements.  First, unsteady forces induced by the relative motion between vanes and blades and aerodynamic damping due to vibrating airfoils must be accurately predicted.   Second, the unsteady solution turnaround time must be compressed from days to hours.   In Phase I, ADS explored the feasibility of applying a Non-Linear Harmonic Balance (NHB) solution methodology for fast periodic unsteady flow problems (FA8650-13-M-2404).   Results were encouraging as they showed that the NHB method has potential to provide fast and repeatable periodic unsteady flow solutions.    For Phase II, ADS proposes further development and commercial release of an Advanced Unsteady Flow Solver module in ADSCFD software that gives accurate, reliable and fast predictions of unsteady aerodynamic loading on airfoil due to relative motion between blades and vanes as well as vibrations of the airfoil by itself.  In addition, a Code Coupling Module will also be built and released that maps outputs from structural dynamic codes onto the CFD mesh of a vibrating airfoil surface for unsteady aerodynamic damping predictions.  By combining these two modules, it will result in a system that will provide improved predictions of resonant stress for turbine components and make it possible for turbomachinery designers to quickly and accurately estimate dynamic stress levels due to blade/vane interaction during design to arrive at more durable, more reliable, and higher performance military and commercial gas turbine engines.  To ensure the success of the Phase II project, ADS has assembled a world-class team to supplement the skills of Dr. Ron Ho (Bob) Ni, the principle investigator.  The team includes, Mr. Gary Hilbert, a Pratt & Whitney Fellow (retired) in Aeromechanics, Structures & Dynamics, and Professor Vince Capece of the University of Kentucky, who is an expert in steady and unsteady aerodynamics as well as in fluid-structure interaction of turbomachinery.    BENEFIT:  With the ability to accurately and quickly predict aerodynamic loads and stresses during design, gas turbine OEMs can iterate and optimize designs without the time and cost penalties incurred by traditional design and test development techniques.  Strategically, this capability speeds the delivery of superior products to market, and gives gas turbine OEMs tools for achieving higher efficiencies and thrust-to-weight ratios as well as a means to combat high development costs, maturing markets and fierce global competition.  High fidelity CFD simulation is widely applicable to all sectors of the turbomachinery industry, including military and commercial jet engines, industrial gas turbines and centrifugal compressors.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The production of 3D models from aerial imagery has been an active research area for many years. Given sufficient image texture and a variety of divergent camera viewpoints, camera pose and scene structure are fully recoverable. Further, software for fully reconstructing a scene from an image set is now freely available. As the range of viewpoints decreases, however, traditional methods of 3D structure-from-motion (SFM) become mathematically ill- conditioned, resulting in noisy and/or erroneous results. Since real-world mission flight patterns often do not permit imagery of target terrain from the ideal range of viewpoints, current SFM methods are often unable to supply accurate 3D terrain models even during flights where extensive video imagery is acquired. Neya systems will exploit two types of learned heuristic scene reconstruction from individual images can help address this shortcoming. The first approach learns global, persistent 3D shape cues from image features culled from a library of images labeled with ground-truth structure .The second approach learns a temporally-evolving model of transient cues specific to target weather, lighting, and scene conditions. Our proposed reconstruction approach exploits both types of monocular processing along with traditional multiview algorithms to create a 3D terrain estimation system that operates without angular view constraints.  BENEFIT:  The economic and military of accurate aerial modeling from video is already established, and there are a number of existing companies that profitably market such services today (see, for example, http://www.geoinfra-engineering.com/en/services/aerial-photography-and-3d- terrain-modelling). In many current defense-related missions, gathering a wide range of target views is either impossible (i.e. cross-border surveillance into denied airspaces) or undesirable (to reduce flight time and/or fuel cost).The proposed work, providing an enhanced modeling-from-video capability without requiring specific flight patterns, will be of interest to many users inside and outside the military: aerial terrain modeling has applications in agricultural, construction, mining, and forestry applications, for example. Optimizing the product for real-time use will open up additional markets in defense and border security.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  During this program, United Silicon Carbide (USCi), Inc. will develop basic analog and digital integrated circuit blocks capable of operation up to 350 oC, based on silicon carbide (SiC) complementary lateral Junction Field Effect Transistor (JFET) technology. In order to reduce the complexity of the fabrication process and to ensure better compatibility with the standard processes available in modern silicon fabs, we propose to develop a completely planar lateral JFET technology to realize a complementary JFET structure that would enable more efficient and faster logic architectures for digital and mixed signal high temperature capable integrated circuits. USCi will fully develop the fabrication technology and the associated process design kit (PDK) and demonstrate the technologys high temperature performance and reliability through fabrication of an operational amplifier and logic gates. Following our commercialization strategy, the fully planar fabrication process will be compatible with the processes available in modern silicon wafer foundries. This approach will create a high temperature capable, commercial integrated circuit technology that is suitable for high levels of integration and high volume manufacturing.  BENEFIT:  Harsh environment applications such as electrical actuation on military and commercial aircraft, advanced engine controls, downhole energy exploration, propulsion systems of hybrid and all electric vehicles, and space exploration require sensor interfaces, control circuits, and power systems require electronics capable of operating at high temperatures in excess of 200 oC. Electronic circuits based on silicon devices are generally not able to operate at temperatures above 210 C because of excessive junction leakage currents and limited operational lifetime and even the most advanced silicon-on-insulator (SOI) commercial products are rated at 225 C. Wide band-gap materials can be used to build devices capable of operation at significantly higher temperatures. SiC is the most mature wide band-gap material for high temperature circuit applications. Even when operating at the same temperatures as SOI circuits (200 C - 250 C), lower leakage currents and improved reliability are expected from circuits based on SiC. SiC wafers are also poised to move from 4-inch- to 6-inch size, opening up the possibility of using existing, low cost silicon fabs to implement SiC integrated circuits (ICs). Therefore, silicon carbide (SiC) is the ideal material for implementing high temperature ICs.    The advanced engine controls market is not yet well established and one major reason distributed engine controls have not yet been realized in military or commercial applications is the extremely limited supply of ICs that can reliably operate above 250 C. There is a well-established market for high temperature electronics in the downhole oil & gas and geothermal industries. Trends towards deeper wells and more advanced drilling heads require electronics capable of higher operating temperatures while providing more reliable operation. For example, a modern drilling head costs tens of thousands of dollars and its lifetime can be greatly increased by using electronics for automatic control in the drill head rather than from an operator at the surface. There is also a very large potential market for automotive engine controls. The results of this program will enable ICs operating up to temperatures of 350 C to 500 C enabling further development of these systems.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Colorado Engineering Inc. (CEI), along with its teammates, proposes to realize the multi-function seeker (MFS) concept in a scalable, heterogeneous, dynamically configurable electronic stack.  Leveraging its collective expertise in communication systems design, radar systems design, electromagnetics (EM) analysis and modeling, antenna design, RF design, advanced processing architectures, digital signal processing (DSP) algorithm design, anti-tamper (AT), information assurance (IA) and built-in test (BIT), the CEI team will create a fully functional electronic stack that will demonstrate diverse RF waveforms applicable for both radar and communications functions.  The Phase II work will include the final design, modelling, construction, and test of the dynamically configurable RF base module, the digital receiver/exciter module, and the signal processor module.  BENEFIT:  CEI has a history of success commercializing technologies developed under government programs. The most recent evidence of this success can be seen in the presentation of the Tibbetts Award to CEI by the Small Business Administration. This prestigious award is given to small businesses that represent excellence in achieving the mission and goals of the SBIR program, stimulating technological innovation, and increasing the commercialization of Federal research. CEI was presented with this award at a White House ceremony. CEI has developed software and hardware technologies for a variety of government programs, and the team has transitioned over 37 products to production for use in DoD and Government systems. CEI also has experience commercializing technology developed under Government-funded programs. Products are packaged as COTS items, listed on a catalog price sheet, supported with technical application notes and marketing materials, and made available for sale to both the commercial and government markets. CEI will promote technologies developed under this effort as part of its standard commercial product marketing and sales activities. The MFS architecture, algorithms and technologies will be applicable across all Air Force and DOD missile systems. The technologies and algorithms will be extendable to many DoD and commercial applications that utilize electronic processing and REX systems. CEI has close relationship with primes to get MFS inserted into future missile systems. The architectures developed will be extremely flexible. The commercialization strategy will include generating target data sheets for the derivative technologies and algorithms from MFS. These data sheets will be posted on CEIs website and circulated throughout applicable DOD agencies, NASA, three letter agencies, and interested qualified commercial parties. The MFS system can be scaled for other radar and communication applications. The technology enhancements anticipated under this program will reduce CSWaP requirements while increasing system performance. Enabling multi-function radars to operate in smaller CSWaP footprints will expand the applications and market for these technologies to a wider range of commercial and Government aircraft, both manned and unmanned. The additional capabilities provided by a radar and communication system (MFS) flying on small UAS will be extremely beneficial for all applications of UAS including battlefield advantages, law enforcement and disaster management.",

The primary goal of this Phase 2 SBIR project is to integrate ViPER-CVW into existing and proposed shipboard and expeditionary Navy networks, using the Hornet JMPS Mission Planning Environment (MPE) for lead integration. Fleet user input will be a prime driver of emergent VIPER-CVW functional requirements, as well as the more detailed design of expanded feature sets. Compatibility with other DoD mission planning technologies, such as Electronic Kneeboard (EKB), and shipboard network domains will be a consideration throughout the integration effort. ViPERs aviation planning toolset will also be expanded to support simultaneous plan editing, expand capabilities to support non-carrier based aviation planning assets, and ensure the portability of planning data produced in ViPER across dissimilar platform systems.",

        "abstract": "Deployment of unmanned systems continues to expand across a wide range of missions; for example, logistics and resupply missions, force application and protection, and improving battlespace awareness.  Presently these unmanned systems run at the lowest of four possible levels of autonomy, that is, in a teleoperated mode, and each system typically requires multiple operators. To address this problem of operator scalability, investigations into approaches for human supervised autonomy were called for in this SBIR.  In Phase I, we took a step toward addressing this capability gap by developing a decision support system for Anomaly Detection and Recovery of Unmanned Systems (ADRUS). In particular, we demonstrated that ADRUS could successfully handle unexpected events or anomalies and replan to recover from them. Our demonstration included a proof-of-concept prototype implementation and its performance in simulated logistics and resupply missions.  In Phase II, we will continue algorithmic development of anomaly detection, mission risk analysis, and replanning reasoning services to meet the performance requirements of our target transition environments. Our approaches and extensions will include methods for improving reasoning accuracies, model coverage and fidelity, as well as the ability to learn and improve knowledge models by exploiting operator interactions and decisions data.  We will implement and evaluate progressively mature versions of ADRUS throughout the performance period.  We will conduct repeated tests and evaluations (T&E) in simulation using realistic models of target unmanned platforms.  Based on T&E, we will characterize the robustness, scalability, and coverage of ADRUS. In addition, we will evaluate the operational effectiveness resulting from human supervisory control enabled by ADRUS. For these evaluations, we will engage application subject matter experts (SME) and operators from candidate transition programs.  We have initiated discussions with prime performers from target programs developing these unmanned platforms and we will develop our transition requirements accordingly.",

Currently fielded night vision and day vision technologies are not integrated and do not work as well as needed under many illumination conditions. By developing a Digital Multispectral Binocular System (DMBS), pilots can be provided with imagery from on-helmet VNIR and SWIR sensors that can be augmented with aircraft mounted sensors.  Because it is a totally digital system, sensor fusion and symbology overlay will be possible, providing even aircraft that do not have a HUD with heads-up symbology.  Our DMBS will allow pilots to replace two separate systems (their night vision system and their day targeting system) with a single system that is more capable than either existing system.  Digital, high resolution sensors and displays will replace analog image intensifier tubes and high voltage miniature cathode ray tubes (CRTs).  MTBFs will be improved as will functionality and situational awareness.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The mission life cycle involves many steps and participants.  Each step, from planning to mission briefings, mission execution, and debriefs, requires close collaboration between participants.  Even a localized crisis response may involve geographically scattered participants.  There is a proliferation of data in the process, but getting this data to the right people at the right time is a challenge, and distribution limitations on some data can be an obstacle with health and safety implications.  Net-centric technologies that facilitate the collection and fusion of disparate data sources in a distributed environment have evolved significantly in the last few years.  So have team collaboration and online meeting tools.  These technologies, coupled with visualization frameworks, have resulted in successful team collaboration software used by many government agencies.  The First Responder community is a great candidate for the next success story, as its mission is critical to crisis response.  Combining these net-centric technologies into an operational version of the Mission Collaboration Tool (MCT) that TechFlow Scientific prototyped in Phase I will provide a solution for collaboration support for the First Responder mission life cycle, and the product will interface well with other hardware and software solutions being developed in that community.    BENEFIT:  Collaboration on the mission life cycle by distributed participants is a common need and challenge across the military, law enforcement, government agencies, and First Responders. The tool sets and integrated environment that TechFlow Scientific proposes to develop in this effort will have broad applicability and utility across these sectors, and others. Just as internet searching has rationalized the complexity of the web, so data fusion and SA displays will help to rationalize decision making in an increasingly complex command and control environment, whether that be military or civilian.  A common theme in the challenges and lessons learned from the responses to past crises is that a single, transparent, easily accessed but password protected, unclassified web-based process for information sharing between participant crews and teams would have mitigated many of the challenges to effective crisis response.  The Mission Collaboration Tool (MCT) will be invaluable in meeting the real-time collaboration needs of the First Responder community.  Integrating with existing tools and processes in Phase II will make the MCT an even greater asset.  The first planned product that will encompass the proposed technology will be an MCT for First Responders in an LVC environment, and TechFlow Scientific will work with the 711 HPW/RHAS Warfighter Readiness Research Division to establish a long-term role for the MCT there and at Calamityville.  The design and experience with the underlying technologies can also be applied to similar problems at other organizations.  TechFlow Scientific plans to work toward commercialization of the MCT next by leveraging the development experience and design of the MCT to build similar tools for other organizations.  Probable customers are emergency response centers in both military and government agencies (law enforcement, firefighting, etc.) for use in exercises and training, or during operations.  The estimated market size encompasses tens of organizations. TechFlow Scientific could use the building blocks developed for the MCT to develop custom applications, as the design is very modular, and there is an advantage in developing a code base that represents portions of the tool that will be common to all applications.  The demand for this type of system is large, and we anticipate it growing.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The ability to access high-quality training anywhere and anytime continues to grow in importance due to the complex nature of operational team environments. Training simulations that use virtual agents that respond and behave like live teammates enhance training and help achieve the train as you fight objective without requiring a complete team of human participants. However, the domain-specific language and reasoning ability needed to make a virtual agent effective for training is challenging to construct. A solution is needed to simplify and accelerate the construction of natural language capable agents for training systems.  Such a solution would help satisfy the overarching goal to improve the cost effectiveness of achieving the train as you fight objective when some team members are not available.    TiER1 Performance Solutions is leading the SynChat: Synthetic Language Interface Toolkit for Chat research and development project. The goal is to develop a web-based suite of tools to support rapid development of agent models, and to define and implement a flexible communications interface built upon pervasive open protocols and deployed as a set of web services. This toolkit will simplify and accelerate the work of training system developers in integrating advanced language capabilities into training systems.    BENEFIT:  With the SynChat natural language toolkit, the U.S. Air Force will have the capability to develop and integrate natural language capabilities into training systems in a way that will be more affordable than todays development methods. More affordable development will permit the Air Force to apply these capabilities across a broader set of operational domains and allow more warfighters to benefit from these new training capabilities.  The broader application of language capable constructive models will help address the training availability problem and will improve mission and combat readiness. The SynChat natural language toolkit will provide similar efficiency improvements for Army, Navy, Marine, and other non-Department of Defense government agencies.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Full-spectrum cyber operations, including both Cyber Network Attack and Cyber Network Defense, place enormous cognitive demands on operators and teams. When demands are too high or tasks are not properly allocated, performance degrades, and missions may fail. To avoid operator overload, the USAF requires a thorough, real-time evaluation of the state of the individual and the team. Assessments of behavioral, neurophysiological, and physiological signals that correlate with individual and team performance can provide the information necessary to evaluate state and optimize team performance. To address these challenges, Charles River Analytics has demonstrated the feasibility of an Adaptable Toolkit for the Assessment and Augmentation of Performance by Teams in Real Time (ADAPTER), which provides a framework that flexibly integrates both current and emerging sensors, and fuses sensor data to assess performance. We propose a Phase II effort to refine and expand ADAPTER, enabling comprehensive and holistic characterization of team performance. Our effort combines time-synchronized sensors with advanced modeling techniques that will help experimenters create and use models that support research on performance and the development of augmentation strategies. The effort also includes prototype capabilities to enable experimenters to monitor the results of experiments and enact augmentation strategies in real time.  BENEFIT:  ADAPTER will benefit US Air Force and USCYBERCOM Cyber Operations (as well as those organizations that design and develop tools for Cyber Operations) by improving their ability to assess operator and team states and dynamically apply strategies to optimize performance. ADAPTER will enable the efficient development and evaluation of operator and team state models that will facilitate laboratory research on operator and team performance, and will be deployable directly into AFRL/RH labs to facilitate research on cyber operators and cyber teams. ADAPTER technologies will also further the development of our commercial AgentWorks toolkit, integrating it with a range of sensor devices to increase its appeal for performance assessment and other real-time sensing applications.",

        "abstract": "Buoy vandalism occurs all over the world for many different reasons, and costs NOAA and other buoy operators an estimated $1 million annually to replace and repair them.   To deter vandals and report any vandal attempts to NOAA, McQ has developed the Buoy Guard System (BGS).  BGS is a small, extremely low power sensor system that will detect the presence of intruders first approaching and then boarding the buoy. The primary intruder detection mode will be acoustic augmented by accelerometer. Once detected, the system will automatically capture images of the intruders and send them back via satellite communications (satcom) to buoy operators for action. Image processing will determine the optimal images to send back over satcom and optical character recognition (OCR) processing will send back the text read from the stern or sides of the intruding vessel. The detections and imagery will also be stored securely in BGS on the buoy for later retrieval. Additionally the system will have non-lethal deterrents (specifically strobe lights, an audio alarm, supplemented with sonic nausea) to ward off both ill intentioned as well as curious intruders. The system is completely self-contained and can easily be installed on a wide variety of buoy designs.",

Many activities and technological systems prevalent in today\u2019s society\u2014air traffic control and air travel, the power grids, communications, deep-water drilling operations, human spaceflight\u2014are vulnerable to the effects of flares from our Sun, which can suddenly produce orders-of-magnitude increases in gamma-and X-rays and high-energy particles.  Reliance on satellite-based high-precision positioning is particularly vulnerable.  The Discriminant Analysis Flare Forecasting System (DAFFS) characterizes the magnetic field of the solar photosphere and corona, its recent evolution, and prior flaring history.  DAFFS then delivers a categorical or probabilistic forecast for future flaring above a given size and over a specified time-frame.  DAFFS out-performs the present NOAA/SWPC forecasts for most categories, in particular for extended forecasts of large events.  The Phase I feasibility study demonstrated its appropriateness for extension into a real-time operational tool.  The objectives of this Phase II are to (1) develop and demonstrate an operational prototype and (2) incorporate the many degrees of customization that we envision are of interest for commercial customers and other government agencies.",

        "abstract": "Passive microwave sensors aboard satellites provide valuable information regarding weather conditions by measuring atmospheric attenuation over a broad range of frequencies from 0-200 GHz.  Additional ground-based sensors are desirable to provide complementary upward looking measurements that can be used to refine existing attenuation models.  Operating over such a large bandwidth, however, places significant demands on the receiver architecture; a common approach to this challenge involves channelizing the receiver for each frequency band of interest.  Unfortunately, this limits the flexibility of the system and finding components that can operate at these higher frequencies is challenging.  The approach is taken by Phase Sensitive Innovations involves conversion of the collected radio frequency signals to optical frequencies, where these signals are relatively narrowband and can be processed using conventional photonic components.  Optical up-conversion is accomplished using our own high speed (up to 300 GHz) lithium niobate phase modulators acting as broadband mixers.  Subsequently an optical heterodyne mixer is used to tune the receiver and bring the desired frequency signals to baseband for detection.  Such an approach offers significant advantages in terms of overall simplicity of the receiver design and the ability to operate efficiently at high frequencies up to and exceeding 200 GHz.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Establishing adequate access controls that limit access to information without adversely denying access is critically needed by our warfighters in todays complex battlefield environment. To address this need, CFDRC is developing an innovative method called CAPSA (Controlling Access using Proximity-focused Semantic Analysis) for granting access based on a users proximity to information. By leveraging CFDRCs existing technology for numerically quantifying information relevance using fuzzy logic techniques based on the semantic web, CAPSA provides a flexible method of determining proximity. CAPSA avoids a ridged definition of proximity, allowing it to identify proximity beyond the spatial, organizational, and operational realms.  In Phase I, a demonstration version of CAPSA was developed to show the feasibility of the Proximity Metric calculation and its use in determining access to information. During the Phase II, this metric will be enhanced and optimized to utilize more proximity information from different original sources. A full prototype will be developed and integrated into several military systems including AFRLs Phoenix architecture to demonstrate and fine-tune CAPSA. Additionally, CAPSA will be validated by evaluating it with real-world data. Throughout the Phase II, CFDRC will ensure the design and development of the CAPSA technology is compatible with all relevant DoD standards, security, certification processes, and procedures.    BENEFIT:  The proximity-based access control solution developed under this project, called CAPSA (Controlling Access using Proximity-focused Semantic Analysis), will be greatly beneficial to the Air Force and the rest of DoD in addressing identity and access management concerns in future military cloud environments. Specifically, CAPSAs semantic-based approach to access control allows it to examine multiple types of proximity and find non-obvious connections between a user and the information they attempt to access.  CFDRCs commercialization strategy is focused in three areas. First, CFDRC will develop and market the CAPSA technology for the Air Force. During Phase II, CFDRC will integrate CAPSA into AFRLs Phoenix Prime software to demonstrate its capabilities and fine-tune its Proximity Metric, which numerically evaluates the users proximity to information. After the Phase II, CFDRC will continue to support Phoenix Prime by integrating CAPSAs ability to detect insider threats based on semantic analysis.  The second focus is to market the CAPSA technology to potential military customers. In Phase III, CFDRC will integrate CAPSA into other military systems and provide consulting on incorporating new proximity types. Lockheed Martin has already indicated its customers have expressed interest in the CAPSA technology.  The last focus is to market the CAPSA technology to providers of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) solutions and demonstrate how CAPSA can provide accurate access control in the dynamically changing team-based environments of hospitals and healthcare information systems. CFDRC will use its existing relationship with Systems Made Simple, a provider of EMR technology, to market and commercialize the technology in the medical IT market.",

The proposed airborne antenna design employs flight-proven broadband MMW planar aperture, polarization, feed, and gimbal ready technologies, customized in an affordable, modular, scalable,  low-profile high-efficiency antenna subsystem capable of near-term deployment for V-band (71-76 GHz) and W-band (81-86 GHz) high-data rate communication links on a variety of aeronautical platforms.  The utilization of low-loss spatial combining (subarray-mounted transceiver electronics) together with proven polarizer, integrated diplexer, and tracking circuitry substantially reduces the losses (and costs) of traditional combining, dual-pol feed, diplexer, pointing, rotary joint, and waveguide losses, thereby enabling 50 dBi+ class equivalent gain performance in an extremely compact (size: 5 x 20 aperture) low-drag form-factor.  In addition, the modular scalable nature of the proposed design extends its applicability to the broadest possible range of aeronautical platform sizes and gain requirements.  BENEFIT:  The proposed planar aperture and related technologies have already been successfully demonstrated at W-band (94 GHz), flight- and link-tested at Q-band (44 GHz), and has been successfully produced and deployed (40,000+ units) at Ka-band (23, 26, and 38 GHz) in Commercial Point-to-Point applications.

Despite the increasing sophistication of information systems supporting them, Warfighters are confronted with stovepipes and infoglut, making it difficult access Blue Force (BLUFOR) information satisfying their needs. Additionally, current command and control systems are unable to represent and communicate complete situation models, including plan- and context-dependent readiness and capability information. Without such BLUFOR situation awareness, decision-making and planning will be degraded. Having successfully completed a Phase I effort to assess feasibility, Charles River Analytics proposes to develop and evaluate a full-scope prototype for a Blue Force Readiness, Activity, and Capability Modeling Engine (BlueFRAME). Our approach includes four components: (1) a representation capability that can capture complex situation models including concepts and associations; (2) an inference capability that analyzes and projects BLUFOR readiness and capabilities based on expressed and inductively inferred knowledge; (3) algorithms for assessing and employing value and cost meta-information in managing BLUFOR information use; and (4) a Composable Warfighter Interface to support situation awareness. During Phase II, we will create a BlueFRAME prototype that leverages in-house and external commercial off-the-shelf products to incrementally deliver a valuable decision support capability.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project will complete the research and development required to produce a Skills- and Assessments-based Learning Environment for high school biology classes. This project will create a modular software system that is underpinned by a unique data analysis platform. Using 3D interactive video gaming technology, each module will place a key science concept in the context of solving a real world problem. Students will be assessed at each stage of the problem-solving process, and their performance is exported to an online analysis platform in real time. In doing so, the teacher is given an instant visual representation that helps the teacher identify pain points for each student. By addressing these pain points, the students become more adept at each step of the problem solving process and, as they complete more modules, they are able to hone their overall problem solving skills. This project support NSF&#039;s mission by training students in the skills necessary to pursue a career in science, technology, or any problem solving profession. This project will build a grow-able and sustainable software company that will create lasting jobs for artists, software developers, and scientists. This project centers on the ethos that successful scientists solve real-world problems, and students need to experience this first hand. The aim of Phase II is to complete the technical objectives required to bring produce a Skills- and Assessments-based Learning Environment to market, which require: A) the development and implementation of software modules that address teacher-identified curricular &quot;pain points&quot;, and B) the development and refinement of the analysis system based on customer feedback. This project presents a refined approach that can be applied to any science discipline, namely: problem solving is a skill, skills can be honed through practice, and the key to solving science problems is mastery of the scientific practices that comprise the scientific method. The system will guide students as they 1) acquire the requisite knowledge; 2) collect data; 3) analyze and interpret data; 4) form and test a hypothesis; 5) refine the hypothesis, if needed, according to the data; and 6) communicate their findings. The analysis system will enable teachers to assess student achievement at each of these steps in real time, thereby allowing them to identify and address areas that are problematic for individual students.",

The interactive content, featuring animations, interactive question sets, and online tools, along with some text, may replace or enhance traditional textbooks, with studies showing significant improvements in student engagement and learning outcomes. The project addresses the nationwide high dropout rates of STEM students, due in part to outmoded learning materials. Such dropout rates not only prevent students from achieving their career goals, but result in a shortage of college graduates in nationally-critical STEM fields. The project creates novel web-based tools that empower teachers, and even students, to straightforwardly contribute new interactive content, thus tapping the latent talent and energy of many thousands of people. The project creates automated and human-overseen processes that efficiently and effectively percolate the highest-quality contributions to the top of lists, enabling content to be created and maintained at large scale and low cost. The project&#039;s new publishing paradigm can disrupt the existing publishing industry. The interactive quality content can increase the number of students who successfully graduate in STEM fields, which can strengthen the nation&#039;s economy and competitiveness. The project develops a new web-based content authoring and delivery framework that supports a novel curated-crowdsourced publishing paradigm. The framework tightly integrates collaborative web-based authoring with delivery of animated interactive web-based content. The project develops elegant tools for instructors, and even students, to contribute new interactive items. Such tools include a novel browser-based animation creation tool, which allows powerful animations to be easily and quickly created via any web browser without requiring application installation or requiring extensive tool training. The project creates and tests new processes that, via a combination of peer evaluations, usage data, and assessments, automatically percolate quality contributions to the top, for final curation by instructors, authors, or editors. Such percolation crowdsourcing can yield superior learning materials, at scale and cost-effectively, while simultaneously yielding substantially lower prices than traditional textbooks.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is significant. The purpose of this project is to create new ingredients which reduce the toxicity profile of personal care and cosmetics products. This project will achieve this by inventing and commercializing a new class of poly(ethylene glycol) PEG-free and 1,4 dioxane-free ingredients. The current, PEG- containing ingredients are highly sophisticated in their structure and function, however, PEG-base ingredients have been found to contain 1,4 dioxane residuals which are known to have a poor toxicity profile. In order to achieve a next generation PEG-free ingredient with improved performance, we will employ a new technique called atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). ATRP has proven to be a powerful method to produce polymers with improved structure, purity and function for a broad range of applications including cosmetics, biomaterials, home care, paints and adhesives. This technique, however, has also proven to be difficult to scale to commercial volumes. The result of this project will not only be improved thickeners for personal care and cosmetics products, but, it will also be a commercial process so that ATRP can be used to produce polymers with improved performance for broad market segments. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project includes work relevant to both the advancement of atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) technology (especially as it related to chemical engineering and scaling) and an advancement of the understanding of polymer structure and function for the field of rheology modifiers. Today, ATRP technology is commonly implemented using methods acceptable in the laboratory setting. In this project, we will be adapting ATRP to a scalable, efficient, cost effective industrial process. Multiple-step synthesis will be simplified to a one-pot process. The post-synthesis procedures will be optimized to save costs, eliminate toxic residuals and reduce the amount of waste generated. The result of this work will be carry with them significant intellectual merits applicable to scaling any polymer produced by ATRP technology. This project will also deepen understanding of structure to function relationships for this new class of rheology modifiers. This knowledge will not only enable commercialization of new and improved ingredients for personal care and cosmetics, but, it will also enable new high performance polymers for many new products.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes the development of river energy harvesters uniquely suited to harvesting energy from undammed turbulent river flows, currently untapped due to state-of-the-art technology limitations. Mature renewable energy technologies include silicon based solar panels, large scale wind turbines, and high-head hydropower turbines. However, consumers are often geographically distant from these resources. The vast majority of people live adjacent to life-sustaining waterways. Millions live in remote parts of the world alongside vast hydrokinetic resources, but currently have little or no access to reliable electricity. This program specifically seeks to address such underserved markets. Recently, there has been growing interest in harvesting from flows with significant kinetic energy, which have been described in a US resource assessment study as a &quot;gargantuan&quot; untapped natural resource. But with existing technology, siting continues to be the single biggest challenge facing expansion of this high-energy renewable resource. This project aims to develop harvesters specifically suited to turbulent and/or very low head flows, thereby expanding hydro-energy siting options and potentially enabling a second hydro-power boom. The Phase II technical effort will explore the conversion of hydrokinetic energy to mechanical energy via a dynamic, fluid-solid interaction. An example of the phenomenon to be harnessed is the bouncing motion observed in power lines on rainy, windy days. The repeating motion is observed only during specific weather conditions because the unstable dynamics are a function of both the flow type, and the geometry of the affected surface. This motion is undesirable in most instances, including for power lines, but it also represents an energy conversion opportunity from ill-behaved flows. The Phase I project identified and demonstrated two specific adaptive structures strategies for enhancing the desired energy conversion; additional strategies were identified and will be investigated during a Phase II project. The goal of this Phase II program is to demonstrate technical and commercial feasibility of the resulting technology by building and operating a 2 kilowatt prototype in the field.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the development of a new hazardous gas storage and delivery system for semiconductor fabrication that will significantly promote worker health and safety benefits at a reduced cost. The new system incorporates a new class of ultra-high performing absorbents, namely Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), that will greatly mitigate the environmental and public health risks by reducing incidents of toxic gas release, chances of equipment damage, and fabrication facility evacuation. Moreover, the use of MOFs enables an increase in the storage capacity while providing savings in ventilation energy, and reducing the risk of leakages over both high pressure mechanical cylinders and sub-atmospheric carbon-based storage. Given the current vast market share of activated carbon cylinders, the higher capacity MOF filled cylinders offer the prospect of substantial decreased in per wafer production costs by minimizing gas cylinder change-outs and fabrication facility downtime. Furthermore, this technology represents the first large scale commercial application for MOFs, thus opening the doors for this promising class of materials for other gas storage applications. This project aims to increase the capacity of gas cylinders for the storage and delivery of highly toxic gases, such as arsine (AsH3), phosphine (PH3), and boron trifluoride (BF3), that are commonly used in semiconductor fabrication. As a safety measure, these highly toxic gases are currently stored at low pressure in activated carbon-filled cylinders. However, the capacity of activated carbon adsorbents is severely limited by their ill-defined internal pore structure. NuMat is developing higher capacity gas cylinders by focusing on the following key technical objectives: 1) Design highly porous, well-defined, crystalline MOF absorbents to be integrated into cylinders, allowing for high capacity storage of these highly toxic gases at sub-atmospheric pressures, 2) Develop industrially relevant MOF scale-up procedures to minimize the cost of production, 3) Maximize the volumetric storage of MOFs in cylinders by developing high density MOF pellets, and 4) Integrate high density MOF pellets into cylinders to displace the lower performing activated carbon filled cylinders currently used this commercial application. Additionally, the technical milestones achieved in this project will help to establish the necessary foundation for incorporating this class of ultra-high performing materials (MOFs) into other gas storage applications.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project goes well beyond lowering the metallization costs for silicon photovoltaic (PV) cells. In the PV space, the introduction of nickel based metallization pastes can make solar cell modules cheaper and more sustainable. With global demand for energy expected to increase by approximately 40% from its current level of 17 terawatts (TW) to 24 TW by 2035, PV module production must increase from 35 gigawatts (GW) per year in 2013 to&gt;150 GW per year to satisfy a meaningful portion of this new demand. Silver based metallization pastes used in solar cells currently consume 5% of all annual silver production, making large increases in PV production unsustainable in the long-term. In addition, the fundamental mechanism of protecting base metal particles from oxidation at elevated temperatures has far reach implications that can address problems in the integrated circuits and electromagnetic interference shielding industries. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will commercialize nickel (Ni) based metallization pastes as replacements for silver (Ag) metallization pastes on silicon photovoltaic (PV) cells. Silver (Ag) based metallization pastes are used in over 90% of solar cells being manufactured today. However, the high cost of Ag results in the pastes accounting for roughly 7-10% of the cost of the completed silicon solar cell, making alternatives to Ag highly desirable. The spot price of nickel is fifty times less than Ag and orders of magnitude more abundant. Previous attempts to use Ni in metallization pastes have failed due to the rapid oxidation of Ni particles in air when fired at normal processing temperatures for solar cells. This Phase II project will commercialize a technology that protects the Ni particles in the metallization paste from oxidation while allowing the resulting conductive film to remain solderable for connecting cells together in a module. During this project the nickel-based metallization paste will be scaled up and tested on pilot lines of large silicon PV cell makers and show equivalent performance, yield and reliability when compared to standard Ag metallization pastes.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the high costs of manufacturing protein therapeutics, or biologics. Biologics are a growing category of therapeutic that can treat a range of diseases from rheumatoid arthritis to ulcerative colitis to Alzheimer&#039;s. Unfortunately, producing these highly effective therapeutics is extremely expensive, with most of the cost stemming from the purification of the target protein from a complex mixture. This Phase II project aims to develop a new filter device that makes purifying biologics faster and cheaper. The filter media will increase overall throughput, thereby easing bottleneck steps in the purification process. In addition to decreased manufacturing costs, the expedited purification also increases the overall capacity of the manufacturing line. This high throughput filter device is designed to fit seamlessly into existing purification modules, making it easy for end users to increase production efficiencies. This SBIR Phase II project aims to dramatically improve the performance of ultrafiltration membranes used in protein separations. Currently existing ultrafiltration membranes suffer from either prohibitively low throughputs or broad pore sizes, limiting their efficacy in separation processes. This project takes advantage of a unique class of polymeric materials, known as block copolymers, to make membranes that overcome the previous structural limitations. Namely, the block copolymer membranes have very high throughputs and very uniform pore sizes. These important features are possible due to the distinct ability of block copolymers to self-assembly into periodic, ordered structures with length scales relevant for protein separations. Using a combination of block copolymer self-assembly and non-solvent induced phase separation, membranes with targeted pore sizes can be made in scalable way. The research objectives for this project are to increase the porosity of the supporting block copolymer material, attach the block copolymer membrane to a fabric backing, evaluate the performance of assembled membrane sheet stock, and package the sheet stock into a device configuration. Accomplishing these research objectives will result in a mechanically robust, easy to implement membrane material that can increase the rate of protein filtration by 3-10 fold.",

This technology has particular value in the rapidly-growing minimally-invasive surgery market, in which internal closure is made difficult by the small size of superficial incisions. These markets represent more than 6 million surgeries per year in the U.S., creating a domestic market potential of more than $2.5 billion for the platform of closure devices under development. Initially, the system directly addresses a specific unmet clinical need: reducing both the technical demands of internal closure during minimally-invasive hysterectomy and the significant complications associated with the use of sutures in this procedure. There were approximately 420,000 of these surgeries performed in the U.S. in 2013, representing more two-thirds of all U.S. hysterectomies. This fraction of hysterectomies performed in this manner is continuing to grow, and will represent a total annual addressable domestic market size at peak sales of $200 MM ($600 MM globally). The proposed project develops a novel surgical closure system for closing internal incisions in endoscopy. Our initial application is in laparoscopic (minimally-invasive) hysterectomy. Sutures are typically used to close internal incisions in laparoscopic surgery. Throwing loops and tying knots are among the most difficult parts of laparoscopic procedures; these difficulties have slowed the adoption of laparoscopic hysterectomy. In Phase II, the Technical Objectives are (1) to refine the closure system to meet the requirements of a minimum viable product; (2) to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the system in a large animal model of laparoscopic hysterectomy; and (3) to demonstrate efficacy of the system in laparoscopic hysterectomy in a cadaveric model. These objectives are designed to complete the evaluation of the performance of this novel closure system against product requirements identified by the surgical community and utilized in the design process.",

If successful, nanocrystals will be produced in large quantities, inexpensively, and uniformly, resulting in a disruptive advance for existing markets and emerging applications. With greater availability and affordability, nanocrystals can be more easily utilized for more energy efficient lighting and displays, improve color quality in displays (laptops, tablets, cameras and mobile devices), increase efficiency of solar panels, and penetrate more widely into advancing applications in medical research, diagnostics and treatment. Emerging applications include the use of semiconductor nanocrystals for biofuel cells, lasers, fiber optics, electronics, security and surveillance, aviation and geothermal tracers. This project continues the work initiated in Phase I on development of a low cost manufacturing method for production of large-scale and consistently high-quality semiconductor nanocrystals quantum dots urgently needed for their commercialization. The proposed research activities directly address this need through an innovative proprietary low-temperature wet chemical synthesis route.

Many enterprises, such as financial firms and online retailers, operate software platforms that are central to their business. Even a few minutes of reduced platform performance can lead to financial losses in the millions of dollars. The first project outcome will enable enterprises to automatically detect and rapidly resolve such performance problems, leading to more efficient information systems, more satisfied consumers and more profitable companies. The second outcome will boost the defenses of our nation&#039;s computers against cyber-attacks. President Obama recently cited cyber threats as one of our most serious economic and national security challenges. Losses from theft of intellectual property are estimated to cost American companies around $250 Billion annually. The company&#039;s malware analysis technology will detect some of the most advanced attacks that defeat today&#039;s defenses, leading to safer consumer and enterprise data, and reducing financial losses. Overall the company&#039;s technology enhances the technical understanding of binary code, an important class of software employed in a range of enterprise software and most modern cyber-attacks. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a software tool called a binary rewriter that can understand and modify binary code. Although software applications are developed in human-readable programming languages, a large fraction is translated to binary code to be executed on hardware. Binary code is difficult to understand and modify. In addition, modern sophisticated techniques such as packing - employed by malware writers - further complicate this task. The intellectual merit of the project is based around the development of a novel binary rewriting mechanism that fulfills critical requirements that cannot be simultaneously achieved by any existing rewriting tool. The new rewriting mechanism will be able to reliably rewrite every binary program, including programs containing sophisticated techniques such as packing, without compromising the critical requirement for low run-time and memory overhead. It will also provide a novel mechanism for (i) monitoring the performance of enterprise applications as part of an advanced performance monitoring framework; and (ii) detecting, and therefore providing a means to stop, infection from evasive malware, a sophisticated class of malware that deliberately hides its malicious behavior.",

The product is a Web-based learning system consisting of a suite of inquiry-based activities designed to (a) strengthen the science knowledge of pre-service and in-service elementary teachers and (b) increase their confidence in and enthusiasm for teaching science. To motivate the learner, the product includes an overarching science fiction narrative with engaging 3D art as well as game-based science learning activities. All science content aligns with The Next Generation Science Standards as well as curriculum focal points and provides learners with immediate and easily accessible data on their science understanding, both procedural and conceptual. Because learners become engaged by the narrative and interactive science experiments, they are less focused on the intervention as a teaching instrument and on their deficiencies in scientific understanding. During engagement, learners are carefully scaffolded through 6 levels of difficulty, and move up and down the levels seamlessly based on performance. Also, learners collect rewards along the way to further motivate them to engage.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable unprecedented freedom for architectural photovoltaic adoption by maintaining the aesthetics of existing building materials and the quality of natural indoor lighting. This unique approach offers to achieve levelized photovoltaic energy costs of 0.05-0.1 $/kWhr by (1) producing 10-40% of DC building electricity at the point of utilization, eliminating the need for DC-AC-DC power electronics, (2) simultaneously reducing building cooling demands 10-30% through rejection of infrared solar heat, increasing the effective PV efficiency by over 5% (absolute), and (3) piggybacking on the materials, installation, framing, customer acquisition, and maintenance of the existing building envelope, reducing non-module costs by over 50%. This project will also result in a core knowledge from which future generations of transparent photovoltaic devices and materials will be designed. Visibly transparent photovoltaics are also amenable to seamless energy harvesting within non-window surfaces such as electronic displays and mobile electronic accessories, enhancing the functionality of those products without impacting aesthetics or functionality. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project develops a transformational visibly transparent photovoltaic device. Building-integrated photovoltaics are a promising energy pathway to capturing large areas of solar energy and increasing US building efficiency at the point of utilization. However, the widespread adoption of such technologies is severely hampered by the cost and aesthetics associated with mounting traditional photovoltaic cells on siding and windows. In this project, these challenges are overcome by exploiting the excitonic character of molecular and organic semiconductors that lead to oscillator bunching to produce photovoltaic architectures with selective absorption, i.e. exhibiting visible minima and ultra-violet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) maxima, uniquely distinct from the band-absorption of traditional inorganic semiconductors. By using excitonic molecular semiconductors with structured absorption in the UV/NIR these devices are simultaneously optimized for high power conversion efficiency, visible light transmission, and color rendering index.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the delivery of a custom-made nipple made from a patient&#039;s own cells for women who have had a mastectomy due to breast cancer. In the US about 300,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer annually and nearly 40% will undergo mastectomies, full removal of the breast. A third of them will opt for breast reconstruction, most of whom will desire a nipple. Patients with loss of the nipple areola complex (NAC) from cancer treatments continue to experience psychological distress long after breast mound reconstruction has taken place, yet currently available options for nipple reconstruction are vulnerable to an unpredictable degree of loss of nipple projection, symmetry, color and possible need for reoperation. The technology can be evolved to treat other unmet needs in reconstruction and the cosmetic surgery field. The technology in this project can contribute to the scientific knowledge fundamental to the fields of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine. The results of this research will help the field move towards larger, clinically relevant tissues and potentially the creation of whole organs. This project will investigate, develop tools and techniques, and select best formulation for the ultimate delivery of a graft that has been tissue engineered to address the lack of reconstructive solutions for women that have undergone mastectomies and desire nipple reconstruction. The research aims of the Phase II project will demonstrate further viability of the scientific concepts proposed, such as impact of vascularization on volume retention, and develop tools/techniques for engineering shaped adipose tissue constructs (relevant to nipple projection). The project will test and select best formulation for adipose constructs as measured by in vivo volume retention, host reaction and vascular infusion. The research proposes to further optimize size and projection parameters and develop methods to assess and characterize incoming materials to reproducibly fabricate constructs with the correct size and desired volume retention.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in reducing manufacturing costs in the $32 billion touchscreen module market and eliminating use of the rare-earth metal, Indium. Touchscreen modules are used in mobile phones, computers, point-of-sale terminals, and other display products. Existing methods to produce the transparent conducting film in touchscreen modules require many process steps and have low throughput. . By using much higher-speed processes and greatly reducing the number of process steps, this method enables 80% cost reduction in production of touchscreen sensor films. The phase II project will further develop the process to produce patterned sensor films over large areas and integrate with equipment that scales well to manufacturing. Analysis shows that the payback time on capital expenditure for new equipment required by the process will be under one year. Cost reductions enable gross margin increases of 50% and make US-based manufacturing of touchscreen modules feasible. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop high speed laser crystallization (HSLC) of printed aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) nanoparticle layers on glass to replace indium tin oxide (ITO) for the Touch Panel Industry. Sputter deposition of ITO layers for touch panels has been the Industry standard for many years. Sputtered ITO requires costly vacuum systems with slow growth rates during ITO deposition. In addition, touchscreen sensors require expensive patterning using slow and costly photolithography process steps. Indium is a rare-earth material used in multiple large volume markets which has experienced high price volatility. R &amp; D in Phase II will focus on producing patterned AZO films and working prototypes over large areas with a figure of merit higher than industry standard touch films with a projected cost structure lower than what is currently capable in large volume manufacturing . HSLC rapidly converts nanoparticles into crystalline films with superior properties at energy efficient ambient conditions. The advantages of this environmentally benign process include high throughput, high efficiency, high optical transmission, and low cost. Technical results will also advance printable electronics for other applications and markets.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project will develop an online system to find and organize the best web-based resources for entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs have the opportunity to create profitable, society-changing companies with high quality jobs, but many entrepreneurs lack skills in the areas of capital, finance, legal and startup management which are required to convert an opportunity into a successful company. Many entrepreneurs fail because they &quot;do not know what they do not know&quot;, because they do not know about available resources, or because they cannot readily find those resources. Many resources are available to entrepreneurs, but with millions of search engine links on the topic, the most useful of these are nearly impossible to find. The proposed online system will use machine intelligence software to identify and categorize a wide array of resources. It will use another machine intelligence system to grade the quality of these resources, and then use a unique display system to show the most helpful and relevant resources in a dynamic constellation-like interface. This is designed to improve the ability of entrepreneurs to explore and find the help they need to solve their problems. This project requires state of the art software development to train computers to identify and qualify each resource in order to select those most helpful to entrepreneurs. By helping entrepreneurs be more successful, more rapidly, this project will help grow America&#039;s economy, generate revenue and profits and create new jobs for businesses all across the country. The research objective of this SBIR Phase II proposal is to deliver a working system to help accelerate entrepreneurs by guiding them to the resources that will best help them achieve success. Specifically, during this project, the team will develop multiple machine intelligence systems to perform the classification, categorization and quality assessment of online resources; build on the existing Enclavix semantic network; and collaborate with the University of Utah to implement an advanced visualization system. This Phase II proposal is advancing the state of research in all three research areas. This project will include developing a machine intelligence engine to take an entrepreneur focused web-based resource and place it in the proper category in the semantic network. A second machine intelligence engine will solve the difficult problem of determining the quality of a given resource. The machine intelligence systems that are being proposed are very complex and are pushing the boundaries of this technology because of the number of resources that need to be evaluated. In addition, again because of the large number of target resources available, visualizing and exploring the data is challenging and requires an advanced visualization system that provides a new way to successfully access large amounts of data.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project shall prototype a wearable Raman optical system to monitor trending blood glucose levels noninvasively, continuously, and in real-time. A solution that is unobtrusive, long-running, and provides absolute glucose readings with minimal calibration is considered a &quot;holy grail&quot; for patients with diabetes mellitus. In the vast divide between this aspiration and the default regimen of multiple daily fingerstick measurements for single-shot glucose readings lie incredible opportunities for improvement in self-regulation and patient-specific care. Our goal is to miniaturize a Raman system into less than 10 cubic centimeters to enable transcutaneous glucose detection. Sufficient accuracy is sought so that analysis of collected data allows clinicians to provide better individualized care than is possible with either isolated fingerstick data or two-month-averaged glucose levels inferred from glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) readings. Using a novel optical configuration developed in Phase I, further miniaturization in Phase II will reduce our laboratory bench-top system to a handheld platform that is an order of magnitude smaller and maintains the necessary throughput and sensitivity to detect glucose ex vivo. This Phase II effort will also investigate the core problem of repeatability plaguing almost all optical approaches for noninvasive glucose detection. Specifically, it will be addressed for the Raman-based spectroscopic configuration explored in Phase I. Optical as well as mechanical techniques will be employed to introduce stability into the system to mitigate contributions from ambient mechanical and physiological perturbations and disturbances that cause errant readings, throw off calibrations, and frustrate end users. Testing and validation of these techniques will be performed ex vivo, using disposed skin, tissue and blood samples to create model analogues in place of animal or human transcutaneous testing. This minimizes initial regulatory overhead while providing essential test data to ascertain detection limits, capacities for overcoming repeatability, and practicalities for usage in real-world scenarios. The end Phase II milestone is to deliver a prototype for demonstration that is capable of sufficient sensitivity, and stabilized detection and quantification of physiological levels of blood glucose that can be readied for wearable and ambulatory settings. Overcoming this key hurdle is a necessary step to advance all such optical technologies for transcutaneous detection, and one which will engage potential customers and investors for continued support toward commercialization.",

        "abstract": "The projects objective is the development of a scalable all ambient temperature biological sample workflow preserving the nucleic acids for molecular analysis. This ambient workflow can be developed for large scale blood collection, transport and long-term archiving without the use of costly and unreliable cold-chain management, using commercially available biopreservation products. Since the completion of the human genome project in 2001, nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) based analysis has proven to be the most powerful diagnostic tool currently available to create actionable prediction of human health and understand and prevent disease development. The complexity of the human genome requires large sample populations to increase the predictive value of genetic analysis. Large scale archiving of population and/or patient specimens is the key to create this knowledge base. The pioneering work of Biomatrica over the past decade in the field of chemical biomaterial preservation at room temperature has allowed low cost alternatives to unreliable cold chain management. In Phase I we successfully demonstrated the power of chemical ambient preservation of nucleic acids throughout the workflow from blood sample collection and transport to the reliable storage of nucleic acids. We demonstrated that a) diagnostic analysis can be performed after storage in the ambient biopreservation products, b) the integrity of the DNA and RNA are pristinely maintained using ambient preservation c) the workflow is scalable from collection to archiving at lower costs and higher reliability than the current cold chain-based workflow. The Phase II development will result in the integration of proven commercial products into a highly scalable process, with the integration of automation equipment, the establishment of Standard Operating Procedure (SOPs) and an optimized workflow that reduces operational costs. The automated methods can be directly implemented for blood sample processing and archiving of nucleic acids in a routine setting.",

The bound dendrimer is highly durable upon laundering, rugged use and harsh weathering.  In this Phase II program, PSI will optimize and scale-up this process to functionalize and characterize multiple fabrics including cotton, polyester, and nylon and polyaramid textiles.  PSI will fabricate a roll to roll process to provide continuous antimicrobial chemistry coupling in a cost effective versatile system.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Phase II program will develop and mature a new salient physics-driven solution for CID feature design and classification to support onboard CID and decision fusion for remotely piloted vehicles.  Saliency analysis will be used to develop databases of compact, simple geometric features derived from known, discriminative, and robust scattering physics. A new Bayesian probabilistic classifier be developed and validated for SAR and HRR modes that exploit a hybrid combination of conventional sparse, data-driven signature features and efficient physics-based features.  Uncertainty will be propagated from feature extraction to decision.  Target libraries will include both civilian and military vehicles.  The classifier will be developed in a hierarchical fashion that utilizes as little target information as possible in order to achieve CID objectives.  Primarily, efficient geometric features will be used for most CID tasks.  When increased CID fidelity or reliability are required (e.g., high value targets, or known confusors), sparse-signature salient feature exploitation techniques will be used to supplement the classifier with additional information.  The salient physics-driven solution will address the limited processing and memory challenges associated with onboard CID accuracy and confidence. Furthermore, salient physics-based feature design is an enabling technology for non-cooperative target modeling.  BENEFIT:  The Phase II program is designed to address the efficiency and sustainability issues associated with the development, operation, and maintenance of current non-cooperative ATR technology.  The products of the proposed program will ultimately lead to a low-cost, quick turn-around solution for target insertion into CID databases, at a significant savings compared to conventional signature database enablers. The selection of salient, physics-based features will reduce the template/database dimensionality for multi-phenomenology CID.  The databases of compact feature sets identified by saliency analysis will provide CID accuracy and reliability.  The proposed program represents a significant change in CID design practices; tasking under the Phase I resulted in a proof of concept that addresses the system requirements of and offers risk reduction to anticipated future AFRL requirements.  In Phase II, SIG will further develop the technical maturity of this architecture, explore algorithm migration paths and requirements to operational use, and demonstrate performance in a lab environment.",

However, more effort is needed to develop, refine, and combine existing methods so they are reliable and run in real-time on real hardware. In this phase II project, radar, stereo camera, and lidar data will be fused to generate a 3D model of obstacles and dangerous terrain ahead of a vehicle. In simulations of yaw and roll dynamics, a vehicle model with adaptive tire parameters will be run forward in time to predict future vehicle behavior. Collision, rollover, and yaw instability dangers will result in alerts to the driver or automatic correction in the case of an unmanned vehicle. A third mode of the system will assist a driver when these same conditions are anticipated. Nonlinear Model Predictive Control will be used as a framework to incorporate the sensing and control actions.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Scheduling Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) resources is challenging because windows of visibility are limited between satellites and remote tracking stations on the ground, and there are more requests for access than available resources. Human scheduling at a centralized location is difficult, time-consuming, and inefficient because it is filled with complex unwritten rules. AFSCN schedulers need an intelligent, distributed, real-time planning and scheduling tool that uses spacecraft telemetry data to automatically allocate antennas based on complex optimization criteria to reduce the burden on human schedulers and enable them to focus on higher level objectives. Charles River Analytics proposes to develop a decision support tool for Scheduling Tasks for AFSCN Resources using MBO Autonomous Planning (STARMAP). STARMAP is an intelligent, real-time planning and scheduling framework for distributed market-based optimization (MBO) of antenna resources to improve the scheduling effectiveness of satellite networks. Our approach involves modeling satellites, tracking station facilities, and customer agencies as dynamic agents that, along with custom arbitrage agents, optimize the global schedule in a continuous, real-time manner that is robust to external complications and can effectively incorporate both high and low priority contact request tasks into a globally optimal schedule.  BENEFIT:  STARMAP will provide immediate benefits to the AFSCN enterprise, the 22 SOPS, and the SOCs by enabling intelligent, distributed, contact request scheduling that improves the effectiveness of satellite networks, and enables decreased staffing by AFSCN schedulers. We will enhance our Dynamic Rendering and Information Visualization Engine (DRIVE) with basic animation, agent integration, and orbital visualization capabilities.",

This is currently done using a disparate network of sensors that are shared with other missions.

The ultimate goal of this project is to provide the Air Force with algorithms capable of processing and fusing space surveillance data with improved abilities to detect, track, identify, and characterize resident space objects (RSOs). Emergent Space Technologies, Inc. has teamed with the University of Colorado Boulder and The University of Texas at Austin to research and develop algorithms to address these needs and improve the AFs capability to detect, track, identify, characterize and catalog RSOs. Our long-term goal is to provide an integrated tool suite that can be used in the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) Mission System (JMS).

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Under this SBIR, Imaging Systems Technology (IST) proposes to develop an ultra-lightweight (< 0.1 g/cm2) rapidly switchable engineered material capable of very high switchable shielding effectiveness (80 dB) for electromagnetic protection (EP) of space systems based on IST's plasma-shell technology. Building on positive feasibility results from Phase I work, IST will design, simulate, fabricate, and validate a metamaterial-like structure that consists of a second-order frequency selective surface (FSS) with integral plasma elements. Plasma-shells are ideal for high-power microwave (HPM) and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) protection in the harsh space environment; they are rugged, hermetic, operate at extreme temperatures, and are insensitive to ionizing radiation. When exposed to electric fields, the gas in these shells creates an enclosed plasma discharge. IST will design and optimize the materials electromagnetic, thermal, and structural properties using coupled-multiphysics simulations. Test samples will be validated for shielding effectiveness and launch/space worthiness. The concept can be fabricated from readily available materials using standard processes. The outcome of the project will be a working sample of a versatile low-cost, rugged engineered electromagnetic material useful for hardening satellites, aircraft, and any device with microwave electromagnetic apertures that must survive EMP attack.  BENEFIT:  Reliable space systems, including satellites, provide a significant opportunity to advance man's ability to communicate information and to observe conditions on the ground using advanced sensor systems. Satellites are an important part of modern communication and information procurement for both Government and commercial entities. Governmental uses of space-based sensor systems include Defense, Communications, and Homeland Security. Commercial industries that rely heavily on satellites include Oil and Gas exploration, Mining, Telecommunications, Disaster relief, Construction, and Media and Broadcasting. Space systems are vulnerable to damaging levels of electromagnetic (EM) radiation from unintentional sources such as high-power tracking radars during launch and co-site interference from nearby transmitters, and intentional sources such as high-power microwave (HPM) and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapons and high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) bursts from nuclear explosions. Current methods of EM protection include plasma limiters, solid state devices, various coatings, and micro electro mechanical (MEMs) devices. Each of these technologies has limitations. The use of Plasma-shells as described in this proposal represents a significant opportunity to improve the state of the art of space-based EM protection by leveraging the advantages of Plasma-shells over current technologies.",

With the recent mandates to use alternative fuels, refineries have been forced to blend biofuels (including FAME biodiesel) into conventional fuels; which are then introduced into the existing distribution infrastructure. FAME contamination into jet fuels has become a problem as pipeline trail back has already been confirmed. Currently there are 3 published (accepted) methods for the detection of FAME in Jet. These are IP585 a GC-MS method, IP590 a HPLC-ELSD method, and, IP583 a FTIR method. Two of these methods, IP585, and IP590 use high end, complex chromatography solutions, which are not then suitable for mobile laboratory use. The IP583 FTIR method is simpler, self-contained, and detects all FAMEs in the C8 to C22 range. During Phase I we demonstrated the ability of the proven IP-583 method to achieve the Armys goals of a system with the ability to automatically detect fuel type, provide a FAME detection dynamic range 100 PPM to 7%, while meeting the objective of an instrument suitable for use in the Armys Mobile Fuel Laboratory. In Phase II we will build test and certify using industry standard ASTM inter-laboratory test procedures a Multi-Fuel Fame Detector, (MFFD), instrument that meets the Armys needs to detect and measure the level of FAME contamination onsite at their critical forward operating fuel supplies.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Wide field of view (WFOV) video capability on unmanned aerial systems (UAS) has outpaced data transmission capability. Identifying regions of interest (often performed through object recognition) enables selective video compression and maximizes the useful content in data transmission. Neuromorphic classifiers currently hold the records for greatest accuracy of object recognition and speech recognition, but are too computationally intensive for deployment in autonomous systems. This proposal describes a programmable microchip for energy-efficient acceleration of neuromorphic classifiers. Neuromorphic classifiers interpret sensor data much like the human brain does, allowing them to efficiently recognize dismounts, equipment, buildings, terrains, and other interesting features in video. The proposed platform will increase the capabilities of UAS while greatly reducing the form factor and power requirements of the control systems. In our Phase I effort we developed a mixed-signal circuitry that showed a 46-360x improvement in power efficiency, and a 700-9200x improvement in performance per volume, in comparison to a digital ASIC implementation or FPGA implementation, respectively. In this Phase II effort we will fabricate a prototype system that meets the target requirements of the solicitation.  BENEFIT:  The proposed system can function as a general purpose data classifier with little modification. Many commercial electronics are looking for new ways of interacting with the outside world that can benefit through this technology. In each of these applications the proposed system will be able to perform the task with much greater accuracy and performance with a lower power budget than other solutions. Military applications include object recognition for autonomous systems, navigation for autonomous systems through optical flow, and voice and gesture recognition for human interfaces.

To address this problem AS&T proposes to develop and demonstrate the performance of the BeaconLess Adaptive-optic System and Technology (BLAST). The role of BLAST is to enhance the capabilities in controlling of a high-power beam of NAVY Laser Weapon System (LaWS), enabling its tight focusing on an extended image-resolved target in conditions that are typical for a maritime moderate to deep turbulence environment. This will be achieved by using a specifically designed and developed optical system capable of: (i) selective detection of the fragments of the target-returned coherent or incoherent radiation, (ii) deriving the wave-function associated with detecting the fundamental features of the radiation scattered by a rough-surface target. In the proposed concept it is considered that on the illuminated area on the target each point of its surface generate a spherical wave that then back-propagates and gets detected by the receiver. The ability to select patches of the target-scattered wave-field at the receiver end allows the BLAST system to form the Beacon that is an essential element of any Adaptive Optics system required for an effective operation of the laser beam control platform.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Addressing the Air Force need for a postern sense-and-avoid (SAA) system that can enable remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) to perform real-time reporting of mid-air-collision (MAC) threats, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to advance the development of the SAA Postern Insect Eye/Neuromorphic (SAPIEN) sensor system proven feasible in Phase I. SAPIEN uniquely combines multi-aperture imaging, ranging and warning over a wide field in a strap-down configuration. SAPIEN employs a compact eye-safe laser ranger using high bandwidth photo-detectors and custom Kalman/probability propagation algorithm to detect, locate, and track. The innovative use of multi-aperture infrared signal data fusion will enable SAPIEN to warn of impending MACs. In Phase I POC finalized the requirements, architecture, and components for the prototype and demonstrated feasibility through simulation and testing of the proposed SAPIEN system which showed the capability to mitigate propellers, fog, vibration, and engine exhaust. In Phase II, POC will finalize the system architecture, validate the model, mature algorithms and software, and apply the design to fabricate a prototype. We plan to perform prototype testing and modeling to validate SAA performance. Working together with prime system integrators, we will investigate a roadmap for commercialization and technology transition to Air Force applications.  BENEFIT:  Recent (1991-2000) Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) statistics indicate a majority (80%) of mid-air collisions (MACs) occur when one aircraft overtakes another from the rear hemisphere (postern collision). Now that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are making their way into commercial arenas like aerial photography, land surveying, and crop monitoring, while slow-flying Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) are allowed operations inside FAA regulated airspace, incidences of postern collisions and overtake MACs are expected to rise. When the regulations governing UAV flight in National Airspace System (NAS) take effect in 2015, the demand for reliable autonomous postern see-and-avoid systems, such as our proposed SAPIEN, will surge. In addition, because of its compact size, lightweight, and low cost, the SAPIEN system can be installed into small, remotely controlled aerial vehicles for applications such as police surveillance and traffic control. SAPIENs low cost will also make the system suitable for collision avoidance in automobiles, boats, and larger aircraft.",

For higher likelihood of transition our approach uses antennas that can be mounted on the footprint of existing antennas on wide body C2ISR platforms.  BENEFIT:  High speed air to air communications may not yet be an everyday requirement, but there are some key area where this capability could be utilized to great public benefit.  In addition to the application directly anticipated by this SBIR topic, the military is increasingly relying upon unmanned airborne platforms.  This could lead to a dramatic increase in the density of aerial platforms within a given area.  It may become necessary to utilize air to air communications as a mechanism for aircraft to notify each other of their flight plans and avoid airspace contention.  This might be deemed especially important if the possibility of satcom loss is deemed a threat.  Additionally, a mesh of unmanned systems may soon be a viable mechanism of providing cell phone like coverage to large areas as a rapidly deployed capability.  The UAS platforms would provide connections to troops without a footprint below them just as a cell tower does.  The UAS platforms would then backhaul the data by relying air to air through multiple UAS until the ground telecom hub is reached.  The Silvus Streamcaster radio platform is so flexible that many different application scenarios could be supported.  The proposed SBIR effort involves system engineering and simulation which would be very useful in pursuing this potential uses.  These size of these markets, which have not quite appeared are difficult to predict but it is not hard to imagine that within a few years the DOD may be spending tens of millions annually on this type of capability.  The two parallel applications which are non-military would be the possibility of having air to air communication for exchange of safety critical information among civilian aircraft and for a system of UAS which could be rapidly deployed to provide replacement cell phone infrastructure after a disaster destroyed the ground based infrastructure.",

Video monitoring of Launch Vehicles (LVs) during all stages of orbit insertion provides invaluable information about the health and status of a launch platform.  A modernization effort to enable improved monitoring of a LV through all stages of orbit insertion requires more capable antenna systems supporting 10-20 Mbps data rates.  Potential SATCOM data links supporting the required data rates have been identified during previous studies conducted by the United States Government.  FIRST RF is partnering with an industry leader in system integration onto launch vehicles to first, perform a thorough requirements/link/systems analysis and second, complete a design of an active antenna solution which offers the required EIRP and beam agility to close the link.  The proposed architecture leverages array antenna modules which have been designed for closing SATCOM links in high dynamic environments.    The Phase II program will be focused on the fabrication of a prototype phased array antennas and the demonstration of these antennas.  FIRST RF will collaborate with United Launch Alliance to perform testing and demonstration at their facility in Denver CO.    BENEFIT:  The proposed effort to investigate potential SATCOM data link options and develop an antenna system to support enhanced telemetry and live video downlink connection from launch to end-of-mission for the nations EELV fleet will provide the following direct benefits: 1) Selection of data link options providing the highest value in terms of availability and performance. 2) A new antenna architecture utilizing the selected data link and meeting physical, environmental and electrical requirements. 3) An order of magnitude increase in communications bandwidth for significantly improved telemetry and video monitoring of EELV health and status.   The proposed effort will also provide the following indirect benefits: 1) Reduced launch cost due to simplified CONcept of OPerations (CONOPS) 2) Increase lift mass (The enhanced communications capabilities will enable simplified flight trajectories. [no need to fly over current ground stations to maintain communications link] These simplified flight trajectories means the EELV can carry less fuel and more payload. 3) Reduced down range ground asset dependency. 4) Elimination of $100s of millions of dollars O&M costs to support ground tracking stations which are currently necessary. 5) Renewed public interest through real time HD video of launch mission operations.

Current measurement methods rely on mechanical dial indicators that struggle to provide the required accuracy, are difficult to use in tight areas, and demand a high degree of operator skill.     The goal of this project is development of an automated, handheld tool for measurement of fastener profile that is fast, easy to use, and highly accurate.  During Phase I we demonstrated that our approach provides extremely high accuracy, precision, and repeatability and is well suited for development of a fully automated inspection tool.

Technical Approach: Construct a full-scale prototype of the SIRII sensor in light-weight composite materials using a low-cost SWIR focal plane array. Validate manufacturing techniques, assembly tooling and procedures, and test methodology. Demonstrate performance of the prototype. Through detailed modeling and analysis anchored by measurements from the prototype, establish expected on-orbit performance in fulfillment of the sensors primary mission, as well as any enhancements to the design required for flight hardware. In addition, investigate the use of the SIRII design in other applications: from space (e.g. Space Situational Awareness (SSA), in particular within the GEO belt, forest fire detection, agricultural water and crop management) and from airborne platforms (e.g. anti-access/area denial, smuggling interdiction).    BENEFIT:  Anticipated Impact and Outcome: The primary mission of the SIRII sensor is the detection of missile plumes from orbit. For that purpose, the Phase I study has shown that application of the principles of optical interferometry has both practical and performance advantages over conventional sensor designs. The main outcomes of the Phase II work will be a quantitative demonstration of those advantages in prototype hardware, and a sound understanding of the cost, time, and effort required to proceed to a fully qualified flight system.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  QuinStar proposes to build a small and light-weight radio frequency (RF) front-end module to be used in an airborne W/V band SATCOM transceiver. This front-end module consists of two paths: a transmit path and a receive path. In the transmit path, a designated intermediate frequency (IF) input is up-converted to the 81-86 GHz uplink signal. In the receive path, it accepts a 71-76 GHz downlink signal and produces an IF signal at the IF port for further processing. The intent is to build this front-end with its size and weight suitable to be mounted on an airborne gimbal by doing without W- and V-band rotary joints. In this way, one of the troublesome issues which face system integrators in the development of airborne transceivers can be eliminated.  BENEFIT:  The key W/V band transceiver technologies developed for this program can benefit future DoD, NASA, and upcoming commercial satellite communication systems. For DoD, the results of this SBIR research topic can be directly applied to future MILSATCOM programs. For example, Air Force has an ongoing W/V band Satellite Communications Experiments (WSCE) program using the same frequency allocation plan. This is a strong indication that the proposed work is completely in sync with the trend of future space terminal and communication link development. NASA and other space agencies are involved in a program called \"Integrated Interplanetary Network. W-band is one of the main frequency bands this program plan to use to relay data from landers, rovers, and satellites back to Earth.    Commercially, the data crowding at the current Ku/Ka band satellites is well documented. ESA has been experimenting Q/V satellite link systems (AlphaSat for example.) Several W-band projects, such as DAVID Mission and WAVE Project, are designed to perform preliminary tests for the commercial use of the W-band. The fact that FCC allows non-exclusive use of these bands by private sectors will speed up the arrival of W/V band satellite era. This research will benefit these and other upcoming opportunities.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  For navigation of space platforms under GPS denied conditions, there is a need for micro-inertial sensors, with better accuracy and smaller volume and weight than the state of the art. We at Digital Optics Technologies (DOT) have been developing a superluminal ring laser gyroscope (SRLG) that can improve the accuracy of rotation sensing by nearly six orders of magnitude. Alternatively, for a given accuracy need, the SRLG can be very small. DOT has also developed the architecture for a superluminal ring laser accelerometer (SRLA), which can achieve a sensitivity of 10 pico-g/root-Hz. Under Phase II, we will employ a shared-cavity dual laser design, employing DPAL gain and Raman depletion, to demonstrate an SRLG with a rotation sensitivity of one micro degree per root hour, and an SRLA with a sensitivity of 10 pico-g per root Hz, two orders of magnitude better than the STAR accelerometer.  We will also demonstrate the feasibility of realizing a three-axes miniature IMU, with three SRLGs and three SRLAs, with a diameter of 3.5 inch and a height of 3.35 inch. To this end, we will demonstrate a DPAL gain and Raman depletion based superluminal ring laser using a miniature dual-vapor-cell and a laser locking technique employing chip scale vapor cells.  Finally, we will develop a complete, ready-for-production engineering design of a three-axes proto-type IMU of this volume that with minimized weight, power requirement and robustness suitable for space launch and operation on a space platform.  Honeywell and Triad Technology will be subcontractors. Dr. Selim Shahriar, inventor of the SRLG and the SRLA and the chief scientific adviser at DOT, will coordinate the overall effort.  BENEFIT:  Three SRLAs, combined with three SRLGs, can be used to realize a high accuracy IMU that is very compact and light weight. Such an IMU could also be relatively inexpensive. An IMU of this type could have a significant impact on guidance, navigation and control systems for spacecraft, launch vehicles, missiles, kill vehicles, smart munitions, and other applications requiring precision inertial knowledge. Non-DoD applications include spacecraft guidance, navigation and control, as well as commercial aircraft inertial navigation systems",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Over the past decades, the capabilities of sensors to gather data has greatly outstripped the abilities of communication links to transmit that data. Accordingly, leveraging advanced sensors requires effective techniques for data compression. In particular, modern satellites provide a vast amount of real-time information that is essential to decision makers, both military and commercial. Unfortunately, space platforms have extremely limited space, weight, and power budgets. Making the problem even more challenging, these vast data sources must be communicated over low-bandwidth communication links and the data that arrives must be trustworthy. The key novelty of our work is that our techniques achieve compression ratios that are similar to (if not better than) those achieved by standard lossy compression schemes while at the same time maintaining an a priori rigorous error bound profile for each pixel. Intuitively speaking, a prescribed error tolerance provides a small amount of freedom that may be used to improve the compression ratio. Our key innovation is the development of algorithms that take advantage of this freedom in a computationally efficient manner while guaranteeing that no error bounds are ever violated.  BENEFIT:  Presently, there are a number of commercial vendors that provide image compression solutions on a dedicated hardware chip. However, these implementations are not necessarily designed for space applications that have radiation hardening, and specialized data transmission requirements.   The primary mission of military space-based IR sensors is to detect and track point targets, e.g., the OPIR mission. To ensure that all targets of interest (some dim) are detectable, the compression algorithm must faithfully preserve this data. Otherwise, the detection algorithm, which runs in the ground station, does not have the information that it requires to function. Thus, a unique requirement of the OPIR mission (the primary application) is that the quality of each pixel in the IR image must be preserved to a specific degree (which is determined, e.g., by the detection algorithm). Numerica differentiates its solution from these offerings by providing a unique compression algorithm that is able to guarantee an error-bound on each individual pixel. We intend to develop a plan for implementing this specialized algorithm on a space processor architecture, which will ultimately provide a superior solution to other offerings available today.",

        "abstract": "Syntonics has demonstrated the feasibility of the Staring Projectile Detection Radar (SPiDR). SPiDR is a stealthy, ultra wideband (UWB) noise radar system. In Phase II we will design and fabricate a multi-channel SPiDR prototype system with detection range of at least 100-m (300-m objective). Progressively realistic laboratory and live fire tests are performed with various projectiles to evaluate the performance of the prototype SPiDR system. The Phase II prototype meets or exceeds all requirements of the SBIR topic including size, weight, power, and range. Staring UWB noise radar are lightweight, elegantly simple, intrinsically low cost/low power devices that use low probability-of-interception (LPI) spread-spectrum radio frequency signals to detect and range on objects. Using LPI signals at power levels comparable to the environmental RF noise floor means SPiDR operates without a detectable electronic signature (!). SPiDRs detection and ranging technique is intrinsically immune to helicopter vibration and maneuvering. SPiDRs radar modules are small and can be mechanically integrated in a variety of ways including as conformal patches on the helicopters fuselage or as a single multi-sided squat pyramid under the helicopter. Integrating SPiDRs user interface with the AN/AVR-2B Laser Warning System or Advanced Aircraft Survivability Equipment (AASE) is feasible.",

        "abstract": "Methane is the second most important atmospheric greenhouse gas after CO2 yet its global sources and sinks are still inadequately characterized.  Monitoring the isotopic composition of atmospheric methane is one of the most promising approaches to closing the methane budget.   Detailed process studies of isotopic fractionation associated with methane sinks and sources are also crucial.  For both purposes, a real time instrument that can measure multiple isotopologues of methane is required.  There are no existing field deployable instruments for the sensitive, real time  measurement of CH3D.  There are also no instruments available with sufficient precision to monitor ambient atmospheric 13CH4 (excluding the Aerodyne Research, Inc. predecessor to the proposed instrument).  Hence, there is a need for sensitive, measurements of both isotopologues  ideally within one instrument. Recent advances in mid infrared laser technology allow us to detect methane in its strongest absorption band at 3 microns.  We propose to couple these new lasers with advanced infrared detectors and new optical designs (for longer absorption path length in a compact instrument).  The resulting instrument will simultaneously measure the isotopic ratios of CH3D and 13CH4 with excellent precision  3 per mil and 0.1 per mil, respectively, for samples with methane mixing ratios near the ambient value of 1.8 ppm.  For process studies with elevated methane mixing ratios (such as chamber studies of peat bog emissions), the precision of the isotopic ratios will be even better (by perhaps a factor of five). The resulting instrument will be compact, portable and autonomous and will be sufficiently sensitive to deploy to remote field sites or even from light aircraft to assess sources and sinks of methane throughout the world. Our Phase II project reached its stated precision goals and demonstrated the feasibility of this approach using 8 micron lasers.  We also successfully deployed multiple instruments in various settings.  In collaboration with MIT we quantified the isotopic abundance of the primary clumped isotope of methane thus demonstrating laser based isotopic thermometry. We will obtain and utilize new 3 micron ICL lasers to significantly exceed the precision targets of the original proposal.  We will evaluate and optimize several of our instruments as they are employed in research settings.  We will extend our initial clumped isotope work focusing on improved accuracy and the detection of multiple species (13CH3D and CH2D2).  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  This instrument is eagerly anticipated by leading climate change researchers around the world since it will provide scientifically meaningful isotopic ratio measurements in real time, without pre-concentration and without cryogenic cooling of either laser or detector.  Other applications of this technology include air pollution monitoring, human breath analysis, geochemical prospecting, and industrial process monitoring. This technology will provide a significant societal benefit through improved understanding and mitigation of global warming and global climate change.",

        "abstract": "Aerosol  particles  affect  the radiative  balance  of the earth  directly,  by scattering  and absorbing  solar  and terrestrial radiation, and indirectly, by acting as cloud condensation nuclei.  It is now recognized that the atmospheric  loading  of  aerosols  can  exert  an  influence  on  the  earths  radiation  budget  comparable  in magnitude with greenhouse gases.  However, the uncertainties in the current understanding of aerosol direct and indirect forcing limit the ability to quantify human influences on climate change. We  are  developing  a  particle  single  scattering  albedo  monitor  employing  Aerodynes  patented  Cavity Attenuated Phase Shift technology that combines extinction and scattering measurements in one instrument with rapid time-response, and high sensitivity and accuracy.  It will operate at a single wavelength which can range from the near infrared (800 nm) to the near- ultraviolet (365 nm) region of the spectrum. A commercial version of the single scattering albedo monitor has been built and its properties investigated including determining its sensitivity, time response and response to test particles as a function of particle size for a number chemical species including polystyrene latex and ammonium sulfate.  It has demonstrated linear response from 0-1000 Mm-1 with noise below 1 Mm-1 (1,1s) in both scattering and extinction channels. The Phase IIB project will focus on designing, building and testing dedicated versions of the monitor for specialized markets.  These monitors will also be deployed as part of extensive field measurement campaigns in conjunction with other researchers in order to assess its field worthiness, an extremely important factor in developing a market for the instrument.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Successful development and marketing of this monitor will yield a significant level of direct commercial sales from a number of industrial markets as well as scientists active in the atmospheric sciences and environmental pollution research. The comparatively low cost and ease of use of this sensor will allow almost routine measurement of the optical properties of atmospheric aerosols,  something precluded by the cost and complexity of current instrumentation.",

        "abstract": "Industrial hydrogen production relies primarily on natural gas and hydrocarbon feedstocks to drive the various reaction chemistries that lead to hydrogen generation.  Carbon dioxide, the ultimate co- product when such feedstocks and processes are employed, necessarily becomes a major contaminant of the generated hydrogen.  Thus, carbon dioxide isolation and removal is an important process step in the efficient, low cost purification and recovery of hydrogen from the intermediate reformed and synthesis gases. A new proprietary, chemically resistant and highly durable membrane being developed in this project will improve the separation efficiency and dramatically reduce energy requirements for the separation of carbon dioxide and hydrogen. In the Phase I program, membranes with CO2/H2  selectivities as high as 15 were developed. When compared to both amine scrubbers and pressure swing absorption processes, the CMS membrane process has dramatically lower capital and operating costs. Costs for a typical CMS membrane system is $58/MM SCF H2 while PSA and amine scrubber costs are between $162 and $1,072 MM SCF H2 for the same 99% H2 purity.  In the Phase II program CO2/H2  selectivities up to 40 have been achieved.  While membranes with more than adequate selectivity have been demonstrated, there is still significant room for improvement in CO2 permeance. This program will develop a high performance (both high selectivity and high permeance), robust membrane for the purification of hydrogen.  The proposed membrane will employ a novel material with a high permeability for CO2.   While this material can easily be formed into a membrane, making the material thin enough to provide high CO2 permeance is much more difficult.  CMS has identified a means of forming this material into a thin, high permeance membrane.  This membrane fabrication method will be developed to enable fabrication of prototype membranes for pilot tests. Besides the hydrogen generation processes mentioned already, the new membrane promises to have broad application in the hydrogen economy, hydrogen processing, synthesis gas production, hydrotreating, and sulfur removal processes.  Improvements in hydrogen purification and separation efficiencies and the ready isolation of a concentrated carbon dioxide co-product will have direct benefits in emissions reductions, energy independence, and carbon management.",

        "abstract": "Inductive pickup loops are one of the primary magnetic diagnostics in modern fusion concepts. To convert the voltage measurement from the inductive pickup loop to a measurement of magnetic field, the loop voltage must be integrated. While simple in principle, in practice several factors make the integration difficult, especially when there are large scale differences between the fast and slow magnetic signals or high-gain integrators are used for relatively long integration periods. The challenges can broadly be grouped into a few general areas: dynamic bandwidth resolution, input offset errors, droop, and long-term drift stability. Prior to this SBIR work, there were no integrators in the world that could meet the ITER integrator requirements for integration error and pulse duration. Eagle  Harbor  Technologies  (EHT)  has  developed  a  long-pulse  integrator  that  exceeds  the  ITER specification for integration error and pulse duration. EHT is continuing the technology development originally started at Redmond Plasma Physics Laboratories (RPPL) and commercializing a final product that is suitable for long-pulse experiments, thus fulfilling a goal of the validation platform experiments. During the Phase I program, EHT improved the RPPL short-pulse integrators, added a fast digital reset, and demonstrated that the new integrators exceed the ITER integration error and pulse duration requirements. In Phase II, EHT developed Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) software that allows for integrator control and real-time signal digitization and processing. In the second year of Phase II, the EHT integrator will be tested at a validation platform experiment (HIT-SI) and tokamak (DIII-D). In a potential Phase IIB program, EHT proposes to continue development of the EHT integrator to reduce overall cost per channel. EHT will test lower cost components, move to surface mount components, and add an onboard Field Programmable Gate Array and data acquisition to produce a stand-alone system with lower cost per channel and increased the channel density. EHT will test the Phase IIB integrator at a validation platform experiment (HIT-SI) and tokamak (DIII-D).  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The  EHT  integrator  strongly  supports  validation  platform  experiments,  whose  programmatic  goals critically  rely  on  magnetic  data  to  validate  simulation  results  and  extrapolate  to  burning  plasma conditions. Additionally, the EHT integrator supports burning plasma experiments like ITER. The EHT integrator is currently the only integrator that meets or exceeds the ITER specifications over these long timescales. In addition, tokamaks from around the world have expressed great interest in the EHT integrator  as  they  move  toward  longer-pulse  operation  to  address  scientific  and  engineering  issues relevant to ITER. Beyond the fusion science community, integrators are used in high energy physics experiments, medical imaging instrumentation, and ion beam implantation.",

In the first year, engineering prototypes will be constructed to address remaining design questions and verify robustness for unattended operation; the capability to measure water vapor concentration in air will also be added so the instrument can report the dry mole fraction of carbon dioxide in air (the amount of carbon dioxide per amount of dry air). In the second year, manufacturing prototypes will be constructed to validate manufacturing approaches suitable for high-volume, low-cost production and to enable testing under extreme environmental conditions.

        "abstract": "Synthesis gas, a mixture of H2 and CO, is one of the top-ten platform chemicals produced from biomass and can be used to produce fuel-ethanol. However, existing heterogeneous catalysts have only a low selectivity for ethanol and produce too much low-value methane. As a result, the production of ethanol from syngas with heterogeneous catalysts is uneconomical. Our major breakthrough is the discovery of a homogeneous catalytic system that exhibits high selectivity for ethanol and produces one tenth the amount of methane as do heterogeneous catalysts. TDA Research has developed a homogeneous catalytic system that can produce ethanol from syngas at rates comparable to the best heterogeneous catalysts while producing less than 2-3% methane (heterogeneous catalysts produce 20-40% CH4). Our catalysts first convert syngas to methanol, which is homologized in-situ to ethanol.  Acetic acid formed by CO-insertion into methanol reacts with methanol to form methyl acetate, which is subsequently hydrogenated to ethanol and methanol. The alcohols are separated downstream and the methanol is recycled.  The only products exiting the reactor are ethanol, a small amount of 1-propanol, methanol (which is recycled) and a small amount of methane. At the same time, the water-gas shift reaction consumes water produced during alcohol synthesis to produce additional hydrogen. The goal of the Phase IIB project is to scale up our homogeneous syngas to ethanol process by a factor of 50 by designing and building a continuous flow reactor system.  We have chosen a bubble column reactor to dissipate the large exothermic heat of reaction of ethanol synthesis.  The bubble column will hold approximately 250 mL of homogeneous catalyst solution with another 250 mL in the circulation system.  While obviously much smaller than an industrial reactor, this scale of reactor will sufficiently simulate a full scale bubble column so that we can make the kinetic and steady state measurements, and determine the heat and mass transfer characteristics of the system needed to perform a preliminary pilot plant design at the end of the Phase IIB project.  Also, we will work with our industrial partners and perform a detailed techno-economic analysis of the process.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Corn based ethanol plants use a food to produce fuel. Thermochemical methods (such as our syngas-to-ethanol process) for making ethanol are attractive because they can use agricultural and other renewable (non-edible) waste streams to make ethanol.",

Researchers have long identified engagement as the key ingredient for success in any learning environment and particularly the online environment, but current online teaching systems lack the means by which instructors can gauge their students&#039; level of engagement because these students are not visible. Therefore in order to improve current online teaching modalities, it is necessary to find ways to communicate to the instructor the level of engagement of their unseen online students. The successful outcome of the project will allow the lecturer to receive real-time feedback from facial expressions, gaze and other body kinesics, which when averaged across the virtual classroom, provides feedback related to the reception of information delivery. The project supports NSF&#039;s mission in education, which seeks to answer questions about how teachers can provide effective cognitive and motivational support for students. This project aims to promote richer interactions between tutor and online students through integrated cognitive and motivational scaffolding, leading to higher levels of student success enabling them to compete more effectively as skilled artisans in the 21st century workforce. This project contributes four significant innovations: a machine-vision recognition system for gaze direction and facial expressions of engagement, which aggregates data across participants to improve signal to noise; a machine-vision recognition system for detecting hand gestures and postural kinesics; enabling third party pedagogical applications within a framework using ancillary hardware, and which can be sold through an educational application store; and to integrate social network functionality that replicates pre- and post-lecture socialization including pair sharing, breakout groups, team teaching, and support for online teaching assistance. The goals and scope of research required to support the above innovations include: improving machine-vision classifier data and functionality; optimization of user interface and integrated user calibration process; extending the system&#039;s functionality to both synchronous and asynchronous modalities; developing neuro-psychological and cognitive models of the online pedagogical process; design and integration of content/media interoperability and social networking capabilities; creation of open application programming interfaces for third-party developers and application store functionality with digital whiteboards and tablets; development of ancillary software modules to help students manage data related to their educational efforts, diagnose study and achievement patterns, and provide expert advice based on that data.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate the first commercial-scale processing of post-consumer plastic materials for high value applications using an innovative approach known as continuous mechanochemical compatibilization (CMC). In 2010, only 8% of the 230 million tons of plastic waste generated was recovered for recycling. A majority of the remaining plastic was directed to solid waste streams or landfills, resulting in poor use of non-renewable resources and contributing to environmental contamination. This effort will focus on the use of CMC to recycle materials without the need for extensive cleaning or sorting, thereby reducing processing steps, and making the use of these materials more cost-competitive with virgin resins. In addition to the environmental benefits, a successful Phase II proposal will also result in significant economic implications. It has been found that processing recycled materials alone creates nine jobs for every 15,000 tons of recovered materials. Furthermore, the increased availability of recycled materials would spur industrial adoption, leading to an increase in green jobs. Commercial feasibility will be demonstrated by manufacturing several customer specific post-consumer polymer blends via the CMC process. This process uses a standard piece of industry equipment, the twin-screw extruder, but in an innovative arrangement. The equipment configuration cools the mixture below the plastic&#039;s melting and/or glass transition temperature, allowing for unique chemistry to occur between polymers and/or fillers. Due to this chemistry, materials that either could not be recycled or which resulted in poor physical properties, can be redirected back to high value-applications. For this Phase II project, three post-consumer blends will be investigated. In order to cost-effectively manufacture these materials, this effort will focus on the study and optimization of the CMC process by researching several key processing parameters. These include chiller sizing and coolant flow, and screw configuration and design for CMC. At the close of Phase II, the goal is to have developed proven processes for production of recycled plastic pellets at a much lower price, while at the same time retaining important physical properties.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The proposed research builds on Dependable Computing's successful Phase I effort. The Phase II effort demonstrates the critical role played by the system safety case in the development of complex systems of systems. Specifically, the safety case (1) informs and guides systems and safety engineering and (2) enables compositional certification through use of contract-adapter arguments. Additionally, the Phase II effort demonstrates the role that the system-interface abstraction technology plays in the design and analysis of complex systems of systems. Specifically, the system-interface abstraction technology (1) formalizes critical context in the safety case, (2) hides details about component-system behaviors, (3) informs decomposition of claims in the safety case, and (4) allows formal proofs to be established for compositional properties of the system of systems. Finally, the Phase II effort is supported by novel tools designed to prepare the approach for commercialization. The safety case, technology and tools are demonstrated by application to the VIPERS challenge problem in the development of a VIPERS testbed. The effort culminates in flight testing of representative VIPERS assets.  BENEFIT:  Systems of systems provide a major and growing challenge to the state of the art in safety assurance. Individual systems are becoming increasingly complex, and are being combined in larger numbers and in more sophisticated ways as functionality escalates. There are significant opportunities for the application of the proposed technology within both the defense and civilian sectors.    The Department of Defense (DoD) has clear and pressing needs for the technology developed under the proposed effort. There is an expanding emphasis on unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) within the DoD. UASs are, by their very nature, complex systems of systems involving: one or more unmanned aircraft; communication systems that typically involve multiple radio links some operating through satellites; and a ground station that incorporates many different discrete systems such as workstations, servers, networks, and displays. The inherent complexity of the UAS requires the kind of formal, compositional reasoning that the proposed effort enables.    Crucial properties at the system of systems level can only be established by formal means because of the large number of possible system states that have to be analyzed. Existing formal techniques, though powerful, tend to address issues arising only at the system level.    From a certification point of view, although they are undocumented, informal and ad hoc, compositional arguments are already in use (e.g., when components that have an FAA Technical Standard Order are used). The compositional safety case makes such reliance rigorous, explicit and reusable.    Use of the proposed technology is certainly not limited to UASs or even aviation. Any complex military system of systems (or complex system) will benefit from both the formalization of the system architecture and the compositional reasoning capabilities afforded by the proposed technology.    In the civilian sector, the uses of the proposed technology are equally broad; two specific examples are civil aviation and the automotive industry.    Civil aviation needs new and more powerful formal analysis techniques to address the scale and complexity of modern aircraft. The series of issues that have plagued the Boeing 787 Dreamliner underscores this point: modern transport aircraft are complex systems that stretch the capabilities of current best practices in safety assurance. An analogy can be drawn between the present situation with safety analysis and the situation with aircraft structural analysis at the time of the development of the Boeing 747 in the 1960s. Comprehensive structural analysis of the B747 was severely limited by computational techniques and capacity. The ability to reason formally over the composition of components and subsystems will benefit the aviation industry. Likewise, compositional safety arguments, enabling compositional certification and recertification, will both control certification costs and allow more-rapid uptake of new safety- and performance-enhancing technologies.    As Dependable Computing's related work with our industry partners demonstrates, there is a growing desire in other industries to formally establish assurance of safety. The formal and compositional reasoning that the proposed technology enables will directly benefit these other industries. Likewise, while many other industries are not currently regulated and therefore not subject to certification pressure, demonstration of adherence to voluntarily adopted standards  like ISO 26262, which requires a safety argument  will be simplified through compositional assurance arguments.    Numerous safety-critical industries will benefit from formal reasoning and compositional safety arguments, including:    - the medical-device industry, for example drug infusion pumps and radiation treatment machines;    - the rail industry, for example in signaling, braking, and separation systems;    - the offshore drilling industry, for example in monitoring and control systems;    - the nuclear industry, for example in core thermal management and radiation monitoring; and    - the shipping industry, for example in navigation, guidance and ship control.    In addition to these safety-critical domains, industries for which the economic cost of failure is very high, such as finance and utilities (e.g., power, water, telecommunications), will greatly benefit from formalized compositional reasoning and compositional assurance arguments.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  There are numerous military applications where incorporation of Anti-Jam (AJ) GPS technology has been constrained by Size Weight and Power (SWaP), including handheld systems, unmanned aerial or ground vehicles, and munitions/weapons.  The essential elements for incorporating AJ capability into GPS receivers are multi-channel RF front end down conversion, analog to digital conversion (ADC), and digital AJ processing.  The goal of this program is to integrate multi-channel RF front-end and Digital AJ processing circuitry onto a single ASIC and interface this device with next generation military GPS receivers.  RBS Technologies has formulated a Phase II effort that will develop and demonstrate a prototype Low Power Multi-Channel RF and Digital GPS Anti-Jam ASIC that meet the following performance goals: 1) be compatible with state of the art L1/L2 GPS modernized SWaP constrained receiver technology,   2) be capable of accepting simultaneously L1 and L2 RF inputs from a 4-element (minimum 2-element) CRPA , 3) provide at least 30 dB of anti-jam protection for up to (N-1) wide band Gaussian noise interference sources where N is the number of CRPA elements, 4 )successfully pass GPS M-code signals that can be used by modernized GPS receivers for navigation, 5) consume a total power of  1 Watt or less.  BENEFIT:  The development of microelectronic chip anti-jam GPS processing that will reduce size, weight, and power by a factor of ten has a very large market  for resource constrained military applications, which include handheld systems, unmanned aerial or ground vehicles, and munitions/weapons.  In addition, there is significant potential market for civilian law enforcement and homeland security.  The microelectronic chip implementation will also be a candidate for replacing current technology where size and power is not a constraint because of lower cost and increased reliability.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  McQ Inc. developed a prototype Wireless Time-synchronized Event Control System (WTECS) for the 846th Test Squadron operating the Holloman High Speed Test Track (HHSTT) at Holloman Air Force Base.  The current state of WTECS is TRL6 and MRL 9, while the desired end state of the transition effort is TRL7 and MRL 10.  Improvements such as developing a database for the base station will allow the system to store data from multiple missions which will significantly decrease the chance of allowing the user to lose the data collected from the current mission.  Through environmentally testing all system devices, users can expect predictable performance in a variety of outdoor conditions.  Through various hardware and software modifications to the system, the production cost per system device will be lower and the system will be easier to use and contain all of the functionality desired by end users; both of which will increase adoption of the system. Making the system cheaper to produce and easier to use will directly result in a more mature system that the 846th Test Squadron will use.  BENEFIT:  The WTECS system is needed to replace the obsolete timing system currently in use at HHSTT.  The current system has limited, outdated performance capabilities that limit the ability to test and obtain the data needed for customer missions.  Also, the useful lifetime of the current system is rapidly depleting as hardware failures and the inability to replace components make many devices in the current system unusable. Like any complex R &amp; D program with a limited budget, to successfully deliver a system within the Phase II base period, McQ had to limit the features and capabilities implemented such that at least the minimum set of system requirements were met.  However, McQ has compiled a detailed list of suggested feature improvements based on feedback from the customer as well as limitations McQ found during integration testing prior to system delivery.   These features improve the usability and reliability of the system as well as meet various goals of Phase II that were not met due to budget constraints.  Therefore, the system will operate more efficiently and will reduce the number of manhours required to setup and perform tests using the WTECS system.",

Although the LITMUS system will be backward compatible with the low-bandwidth legacy lightning mapping arrays currently in existence, it will also include high-bandwith waveform data that will achieve higher signal-to-noise-power ratios and will enable the detection and tracking of lightning flashes from much larger standoff distances and with better resolution.  By the completion of the Phase II effort, a deliverable prototype LITMUS system will have been demonstrated in real-time and under realistic conditions and will be capable of mapping the entire flash sequence of intra-cloud lightning from beginning to end.",

In Phase I and Phase II programs, Mayflower developed a comprehensive topology management system that monitors, assesses, and optimizes network performance. PUTTY topology management is specifically designed for a directional network consisting of JALN-M waveform and to interoperate with other waveforms through an Automated Digital Network System (ADNS). For the JALN-M and other high capacity directional waveforms, PUTTY ensures integrity of high-priority traffic even under highly loaded and severely imbalanced traffic conditions by segregating high-priority traffic and low-priority traffic, and transporting them over separate infrastructures. The focus of PUTTY Phase II.5 program is to further develop and mature PUTTY technology by working closely with candidate JALN-M primes. The scope of the Phase II.5 program includes development of PUTTY interfaces to candidate JALN-M waveforms; evaluate their network performance with PUTTY.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Coordinate Registration (CR) of OTHR targets requires accurate real-time ionospheric modeling coupled with HF propagation calculations to convert radar-measured target signal delays and beam steers to geographical position.  Our team is the developer of one of the most sophisticated ionospheric data assimilation capabilities currently in existence, GPSII (GPS Ionospheric Inversion; pronounced gypsy).  Our team is also very experienced in developing algorithms for OTHR CR; we have developed an extensive computational HF propagation tool set.  One of the major limitations in CR accuracy is the inability of current CR algorithms to properly account for traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs).  Our previous investigations into TID mitigation produced a number of tools and ideas that we here propose to architect into a significant advance in TID mitigation.  In Phase I we developed an HF propagation simulation capability that combines a model of TIDs with 3D ray tracing to allow generation of simulated TID-affected OTH radar data (especially backscatter ionograms).  These simulated data were successfully used to demonstrate the effectiveness of ionospheric data assimilation in reconstructing the ionospheric TID structure affecting OTHR measurements.  In Phase II we will extend and test this methodology with real OTHR measurements using diagnostics from a downrange HF Doppler sounder.  BENEFIT:  An ionospheric data assimilation method with the fidelity to model TIDs in real time will allow improved OTHR Coordinate Registration accuracy.  Improved CR accuracy will enhance the applicability of OTHR as a wide area surveillance asset for Air Force and Homeland Security applications with dramatic cost savings over alternative microwave radar solutions.  In the US counter drug mission of the current ROTHR system, it is necessary for intercepting aircraft to perform cold-nose intercepts where onboard radars are deactivated (so traffickers wont detect the interceptors and dump their contraband to evade arrest).  To visually spot the target aircraft, it is necessary for the OTH radar to guide the intercepting airplane to within a couple of kilometers of the target.  However, TID-caused coordinate registration errors can easily be several tens of kilometers, so mitigation of these errors would have immediate benefit to the existing ROTHR system.  Planned use of next-generation OTHRs for cruise missile and ballistic missile detection and trajectory estimation will benefit by mitigation of TID-induced CR errors to achieve sufficient accuracy for handoff to millimeter wave radars and IR sensors.  While achieving good TID mitigation for OTHR is primarily our Phase II goal, the propagation simulation tools developed under Phase I will benefit the Air Force by providing the ability to perform studies in simulation to demonstrate the utility of OTHR as a surveillance asset in stressing TID environments.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Satellite antenna systems often use separate transmit/ receive (T/R) apertures to prevent co-site interference. This currently increases the satellite antenna payload and requires RF interference and compatibility (RFI/RFC) studies to prevent performance degradation. But an antenna design that appears RF invisible outside of its operating frequency band could be used to upgrade current satellite systems without the need for extensive RFI/RFC analysis. In pursuit of this vision, we propose to prototype and characterize a frequency&#8232;selective surface (FSS)-based metasurface antenna. In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of an electromagnetically transparent phased array antenna operating at 20 GHz (down-link), 44 GHz (up-link), and 66 GHz (satellite-to-satellite). For Phase II, we propose to design prototype metasurface antennas operating at 20, 44, and 66 GHz. Working with the Air Force, we will select one of the designs to fabricate and characterize. Our antenna concept is fabricated using a MEMS technique that is able to accurately reproduce features at the highest frequency/shortest wavelength, i.e., 66 GHz.  BENEFIT:  Our metasurface antenna concept was shown to be capable of operation in all three bands, beam steering, and adjusting coverage area. Most importantly, each antenna structure is RF invisible outside the communication links operating frequency band. Therefore, the antenna can be placed on the satellite with minimal consideration of RFI/RFC. The result is an antenna that provides an upgrade capability to the satellite while minimizing integration problems. All manufacturers of communications satellites are potential customers and form the initial addressable market for space-qualified FSS-MM apertures. We also think there may be a market for retrofitting terrestrial terminals to augment their supported frequencies.",

When it can prove multi-threaded optimizations are safe, Typhon automatically transforms code to take advantage of them. When it cannot, it annotates the source to identify the type of optimization and how it could be made safe. By leveraging knowledge of how COM works, Typhon is able to identify more optimizations than existing parallelizing compilers. In addition, Typhons integration with Visual Studio enables it to suggest refactoring strategies that would create additional optimization opportunities.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  There are many ways to improve night vision goggle performance, but that is often overlooked is the faceplate, which serves both as a substrate for the photocathode as well as a method for sealing the tube for high vacuum.  It is usually made from Corning 7056 glass.  We have verified that by increasing the index of refraction on the faceplate and by allowing it to be curved, significant performance gain is possible.    In addition to improving performance of these tubes, an optical limiter that could be incorporated into the faceplate of the tube (to take advantage of the high flux densities near the image plane) would be very beneficial.    A variety of new glass types have become available that may prove to have advantages when used in image intensifier tube (IIT) faceplates.  High index glasses and chalcogenide glasses have promise to improve performance and we have also evaluated using glass with a curved front surface.     Our Phase I effort proved merit in both a high index faceplate and in using an optical limiter faceplate and we will build and test examples of both of these (as well as an improved objective lens) in our Phase II effort.  BENEFIT:  There are multiple benefits to the military in improving image intensifier tube performance via alternate faceplate materials.  These benefits include:   Protection against battlefield laser damage.  By using alternative glass types and leveraging AFRL research, we can provide an optical limiter capability to night vision goggles to prevent them from being damaged by battlefield lasers.     Improved resolution and MTF via higher index optical glasses and a redesign of the objective lens assembly.  This will allow users to see smaller targets with higher contrast.   Improved (reduced) f/#, which increases the amount of signal and the SNR.  This will reduce the noise in the image and allow users to see targets under lower levels of illumination.   Better filtering of off-axis light to reduce veiling glare in NVGs due to cockpit displays.",

        "abstract": "In this Phase II effort, FIRST RF will demonstrate array technology enabling highly directive multi-beam TCDL communications using phased arrays integrated on the FireScout UAV platform. Phased array systems allow for dynamic beam steering with graceful degradation. Wide elevation patterns desirable for air-to-air or air-to-ground communications are achieved by using a linear array topology. These arrays also have the benefit of a narrow azimuth radiation pattern conducive to point-to-point communications and networking waveforms. Highly selective filters isolate TCDL uplink and downlink channels and allows for multi-beam functionality as well as the ability to simultaneously transmit and receive on each channel. FIRST RF proposes an innovative approach that leverages innovative phased array architecture to provide a highly functional TCDL communications node with multi-beam capability. Commercial applications of this technology have also been identified.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  To increase space environment awareness, Quantum Dimension proposes to develop algorithms for Total Electron Count (TEC) estimates with uncertainty estimates that can be implemented in existing DoD GPS User Equipment (UE). Both the TEC estimates and the associated uncertainty estimates are vital to enable modern space environment models to use the GPS TEC data for supporting the specification and forecasting of ionospheric effects and impacts on DoD radio-based systems, including communication, navigation, surveillance and geolocation. DoD Space Environment missions most lack TEC where it is most needed: in operational warfighting theaters, and over oceans. In these areas, DoD vehicles, equipped with two-frequency GPS have the ability to estimate TEC.  The algorithms will be tested using data from commercial GPS receivers as well as military DoD GPS receivers.  Our innovations provide significant advantage for DoD for use in GPS UE to resolve these ionospheric effects and its impact on DoD communication, navigation, and geolocation solutions.  BENEFIT:  The GPS Receiver market is just one aspect of the commercialization potential for this solution and demonstrates the ubiquitous nature of GPS information to the warfighter, commanders and decision-makers throughout DoD. There are a high number of commercial and military applications that can leverage this improvement to PNT accuracy without requiring replacement of existing equipment: beyond Line of Sight applications, Black programs, guided munitions, Homeland Security/Coast Guard, Commercial Fishing are just some applications that can benefit from our technology innovation.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Over-The-Horizon-Radar (OTHR) systems survey large areas searching for targets hundreds to thousands kilometers away. Accurate coordinate-registration (CR) of detected targets requires raytracing and accurate specification of the bottomside ionosphere. The proposed Real-Time EDP & TID (RETID) Specification System is based on the proven IRI electron density model and measurements by DPS4D ionosondes that provide the electron density profiles (EDPs) and the characteristic layer specifications. The DPS4Ds also collect the Doppler Frequency & Angles-of-arrival (AoA) Sounding (FAS) data associated with Traveling Ionospheric Disturbance (TID) wave structures. FAS measurements are also made on CW signals from transmitters of opportunity.  The FAS measurements are analyzed in terms of the TID wave vector and amplitude. EDP and FAS data are ingested in real time in databases at the Lowell GIRO Data Center (LGDC). The layer characteristics foF2, hmF2, foF1,  ... are assimilated in real-time in the IRI model to generate the IRI Real-time Assimilative Model IRTAM which is updated every 15 min. The TID density modulation is superimposed on IRTAM forming the TID-IRTAM. Using measured AoAs, the target location is specified by raytracing through the TID-IRTAM. Comparison of measured oblique ionograms between DPS4Ds with simulated oblique ionograms validates the RETID system performance.  BENEFIT:  The proposed RETID system takes advantage of existing ionospheric sensors, the DPS4Ds in the Digisonde Global Ionosphere Radio Observatory (GIRO) [Reinisch and Galkin, 2011], and the associated data infrastructure at LGDC. The existing instruments, the DPS4Ds, measure both the ionospheric profile specifications and the TID parameters. The RETID approach is cost effective and can be applied at any region in the world that has at least a few operating DPS4Ds. The RETID system supports operations like OTHR and HF Geolocation that measure the arrival angles of HF skywaves by providing accurate coordinate registration.",

        "abstract": "Spectral beam combination (SBC) of fiber lasers is the most practical approach to DEW-class HELs using diode-pumped fiber lasers. Use of conventional diffraction gratings to combine wavelengths is limited in that metal is inherently absorbing. Regardless of the metal layer thickness, optical power is absorbed in the grating, altering the spectral and efficiency properties of the grating and inducing optical aberrations that reduce beam quality.  Designed to overcome the peak-power damage limitations for use in petawatt (short-pulse) lasers, multi-layer dielectric (MLD) diffraction gratings are essentially transmission gratings paired with a dielectric mirror stack. Although the lack of metallic surfaces exist eliminates absorption issues, MLD gratings by definition rely on interference within the stack, resulting in higher intensities within the stack and leading to optical damage at reduced power levels. We propose to use an all-glass diffraction grating whose high efficiency is yielded by inhibiting transmitted orders, and can therefore be made of a single material with no coatings or layers. Used in an immersion topology, this grating allows for a fully monolithic SBC fiber laser system to be realized, with no free-space components. Fabricating the grating and the monolithic SBC system are the foci of the Phase II proposal.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The overall objective is to enable users on-the-move to reliably and securely send and receive information, targeted for recipients' geographic locations, filtered on their credentials, made persistently available if so designated, and tailored for their devices, facilitating their rapid reaction to changing operational conditions. The team  proposes to integrate: wireless physical layer broadcast; link layer multicast where supported by hardware and firmware of mobile devices and infrastructure; network layer multicast where supported by routing infrastructure; an efficient, reliable, scalable multicast transport protocol; DDS topics scoped per geography, credentials and  metadata markups; automated means for tailoring per those markups; and a secure, robust, distributed file system. This will yield a publish-subscribe-query Data Distribution Service (DDS) with archival of persistent messages (a blackboard), where DDS topics map to multicast addresses and correspond to geographic and other filtering criteria.  Policy Based Access Control to DDS topics will support restriction based upon security classification/clearance, roles and credentials, and will be enforced with strong encryption and capability based security. GATSID will address a major aspect of the challenge of delivering \"On-demand Information: What you need, When you need it\", enabling situation awareness systems to exploit tactical sensor data and deliver customized, location-specific intelligence products.  BENEFIT:  The transition and commercialization of GATSID will be driven by its ability to deliver secured, automated, delay-tolerant, role-based accessed, location-based messaging services across multiple communication channels to multiple platforms and using a distributed storage/archive technique. The enhanced GATSID DDS will specifically deliver four unique technical benefits, and form a competitive advantage for both the DoD/DHS and the commercial product lines. First, this software will provide a much higher, capabilities-based security to a greater granularity of tailored, geographically aware topics than current DDS products. Second, it will provide BOTH geographically- and role-filtered services AND geographic privacy of the individual user. Third, the DDS will provide efficient, scalable, reliable, multicast transport services tailored for classes of platforms and link types. Finally, GATSID will also deliver the pub/sub/query interfaces and administrative APIs that enable superior management of role-based access, topic control, and publisher/subscriber lists.  The applications will be addressed in multiple spirals of transition and commercialization demonstrations and customized productization efforts. Generally, these spirals will consist of three strategic applications.  First, there will be the demonstration and acceptance of GATSID as an enhancement to existing mass notification communication and networking programs already paid for and deployed by DoD and DHS users. Each of these GATSID applications will be tailored to enhance a greater number of automated LBS message types, greater use of delay tolerant transport, routing, and distributed storage techniques, a greater number of utilized link types and platforms, a greater number of enabled mobile nodes/users. A number of such enhancement opportunities have already been identified, and include USAF AtHoc+GATSID, FEMA EAS and FEMA Desktop Alert MNSv5 products, and an emerging commercial LBS product line design, sales, and distribution company involved in multiple industrial sectors (i.e. LocAid).  Second, there will be the demonstration, marketing, and sales of GATSID as a free-standing software product, sold as licensed software as a new LBS OEM to an existing mobile wireless platform and as  an upgrade or enhancement to existing LBS software product line for different commercial or retail spaces spaces and existing LBS hardware/software product line for different industrial spaces.  Each of these GATSID software formats will be tailored to the specific platform hardware and customized to enhance a greater number of automated LBS message types, DTN and either a private or public cloud, and a greater number of commercial links. A number of such industrial opportunities have been identified, most specifically our registration and emerging participation as an Enterprise Partner for a top smartphone designer, manufacturer, and global distributor interested in our LBS design  The Third strategy is centered upon the teams Grand Vision Product/Service bundle. The software product will be an instantiation of GATSID and its enhanced DDS technologies, RADTiN/DAM3ON attestation capabilities, PocoDoc/IMP, DTN routing techniques, and access-controlled access to distributed data storage. The hardware platform will either be a next-gen smartphone or a three-factor authenticated USB platform with secured integration of multiple micro-visored (VMs) of a users OS, data, and apps. The service would entail agent-controlled access to distributed storage as well as backup services and guaranteed replacement, hosted by multiple clouds.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The current F-35 repair CONOPS associated with any significant coating or structural damage requires the use of a trace and transfer approach to capture structural damage location, size and orientation. This is a cumbersome, time-consuming process that involves tracing damage on a large, clear piece of Mylar that is sent to Lockheed Martin (LM) engineers who&quot;eye-ball&quot;a mapping onto 3D models for repair design. The objective of this proposal is to develop an alternative approach  a digital photograph based approach.  This new approach replaces the Mylar with a digital photograph from a standard commercial camera.  The photograph can be emailed from the inspectors to the structural engineers.  The engineers can then easily extract the damage from the photograph and map it onto 3D models.  BENEFIT:  Significant reduction in time required to repair aircraft structural damage.  In order for an acceptable repair to be designed, engineers spend countless hours on collecting information about the structure to be analyzed and finding information on similar repairs and analysis completed in the past for a given location.  This results in engineers spending a lot of&quot;Non-Value Added Time&quot;just collecting the necessary information in order to process all of it.  In many cases, existing information isn&quot;t found and the analysis is completed without it.  The Navy has performed time studies on the F/A-18 structural repair process and has projected that NLign will reduce the average structural engineering disposition time from 14 hours per damage to 3 hours, a 78% reduction in time.  It is believed the benefits of using this technology with the F-35 program could be similar to results seen by the USN for the F/A-18.  Given the reduction in engineering analysis time, the benefits will also include increased aircraft availability.",

Successfully developed and proven feasible in Phase I, MAGIC-HMD is based on chirped volume holographic elements that compensate for the compound curvature of the waveguide visor substrate and chromaticity profile of the display engine. POCs MAGIC-HMD utilizes the common visor form-factor to route display imagery to the user in order to generate full-color see-through imagery by using the initial high resolution microdisplays, leading directly to visual acuity matching resolution within a 40-degree field of view (FOV). In Phase I, POC has successfully demonstrated monochrome imagery routed through both cylindrical and spherical waveguides using multiple lamination techniques for compatibility with polycarbonate visors. In Phase II, POC proposes to incrementally improve the MAGIC-HMD through a two-stage development process, from a fully integrated and stand-alone monochrome waveguide (Stage I), to a breadboard validation waveguide for demonstrating full color and display content with an equivalent 20/20 visual acuity initial waveguide (Stage II). We have partnered with Rockwell Collins to assist with integration and testing and transition to a fielded platform.  BENEFIT:  Commercial applications of the MAGIC-HMD will include the replacement of current classical optics-based HMD systems and head-up display (HUD) systems with a thin, light, and low-profile HMD system that can provide more capable, ergonomic, digital vision systems. Due to its extreme compactness, the MAGIC-HMD technology can be expected to have a variety of commercial applications, including use for aerial firefighting, highway patrol, medical, commercial aviation, space exploration, personal displays, and gaming/entertainment systems.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Todays analysts need improved 3D visualization tools to assist in critical situations such as deconfliction, line-of-sight analysis, air space and satellite control.  Currently available 3D displays cannot provide the level of detail and comfort needed because the displays contain unacceptable visual artifacts, do not provide full parallax, require special headgear, and induce nausea in many of the users.   The proposed system has demonstrated the technical feasibility of several technologies that can address the shortcomings of the current displays.  The Phase I program demonstrated a massively parallel computation and display engine capable of generating fringe information and directly writing the fringes using novel display system. The solid-state display system employs acousto-optic modulators for horizontal deflection and electro-optic phased array to generate the vertical deflection.  This technique generates true full parallax holographic images and provides the operator with a full set of visual clues.  The system is based on COTS graphics processors (GPUs) and easy to fabricate lithium niobate materials allowing the system to be optimized for small size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements. This novel approach can be scaled to larger video-rate displays, with higher angular resolution based upon the roadmaps of the underlying components.  BENEFIT:  The proposal will enable a number of critical holographic display applications based on its here-to-fore undelivered combination of an integrated 3D database, massively parallel computation engine and novel scanning technology.  The system is based on COTS graphics processors (GPU) and easy to fabricate lithium niobate materials allow the system to be optimized for small size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements. The holographic system will deliver a true holographic display generating a light field with vergence and accommodation clues aligned. Currently available 3D displays cannot provide the level of detail and comfort needed because the displays contain unacceptable visual artifacts, do not provide full parallax, require special headgear, and induce nausea in many of the users. The benefits of the improved display system allow will intelligence analysts to assist war fighters in critical situations such as deconfliction, line-of-sight analysis, and air space and satellite control. The system design can be extended to dual use applications in medicine by allowing radiologists to view holographic displays of CT and MRI images, in scientific visualization for 3D engineering drawings and multidimensional data display. Other dual use applications include visualization of cultural heritage sites, holographic special effects for the entertainment industry, and holographic teleconferencing (telepresence) applications.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Exposure to engineered nanomaterials (NMs)materials composed of particles with features smaller than 100 nmrepresents a new inhalation hazard for which there are no standard measurement methodologies or applicable occupational exposure limits (OELs). Nano-featured materials can react with the human body in ways other particles do not. When inhaled, NMs can elicit adverse cardiopulmonary health outcomes that scale more closely with dose expressed as particle number or surface area rather than mass. Consequently, the measurement of NMs fit poorly within the pre-existing IH sampling paradigm. Real-time concentration monitors are ill-suited for personal sampling and cannot distinguish NMs from other airborne particles. Electron microscopy of filters collected with conventional personal samplers can make this distinction, but this analysis is typically expensive and only qualitative. Chemical analysis of particles could be used to detect NMs separate from background particles but devices to collect particles by size are not available for use as personal samplers for particles smaller than 300 nm. The current Phase-II proposal addresses the need to assess personal exposures to NMs through both: 1) real-time, size-resolved information on particle concentration by number, surface area, and mass; and 2) subsequent microscopy or chemical analysis of airborne particles collected by size. A novel, prototype personal monitorthe Personal Aerosol Collector and Spectrometer (PACS)developed under Phase I will be miniaturized and combined into a single package. Laboratory and field studies will be conducted to test the ability of the device to assess nanoparticle exposures apart from background aerosol under a variety of conditions.  BENEFIT:  The proposed products/concepts (PACS) will directly benefit assessment of exposures to nano materials (NMs) for armed forces personnel in deployed and domestic environments. It will also be a great boon for assessing more routine exposures, including refurbishing of heavy vehicles (e.g., tanks and aircraft) and shooting ranges, where a variety of metals exposures are health hazards of concern. In these environments, adverse health effects may relate more closely to particle number or surface area rather than mass concentration. After R&D, the PACS will immediately translate to the broader field of IH for exposure assessment of any particle exposure, but particularly to environments where fumes or NMs are present.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Radio-frequency (RF) transmitting devices are found nearly everywhere today, ranging from lower-power cell phones to radar equipment to high-energy weapons systems. Accidental exposure of humans to the RF radiation emanating from these devices can cause harmful thermal effects including permanent tissue damage. Modeling these thermal effects across a whole population of humans is difficult and time consuming using todays tools and can constitute a very expensive phase during the design of RF transmitting equipment. We will meet this industry need by extending the armature-creation automation and flexible morphing prototypes we developed during Phase I, evolving them into high-quality commercial software products. We will upgrade the armature/posing tool to handle a broad array of human models and poses and include a feature that facilitates posing models in constrained environments. We will also develop the morphing capability to handle arbitrary, physics-based deformations that enable dimensions to be matched with those from anthropomorphic databases. Furthermore, we will design and implement a user-friendly graphical user interface that will enable the analyst to quickly and efficiently setup a morph and pose, to launch analysis tools, and to visualize the results.  BENEFIT:  The primary application of these new algorithms and tools will be to facilitate the development of safe designs for high powered RF systems and electronic countermeasures for customers in the Department of Defense (DoD), whose personnel may be exposed to stray RF radiation from these devices. The new posing and morphing capabilities will enable modeling and simulation of the effects of exposures to a wider array of body types and poses and at a lower cost than the very limited set of current human models can provide. In addition their role in the DoD, the posing capabilities will assist customers in the HVAC community who are designing the next generations of aircraft, vehicles, fabric, and clothing. A third application is in medicine, where the morphing capability can be used to provide detailed, physically-realistic models that cover various body shapes, internal organ shapes, and poses and can thus be used for medical education, preoperative planning, visualization, etc. Finally, this posing and morphing application will provide a synergism with our existing high-speed thermal modeling tools. The integrated software suite will provide thermal analysts from various industries with the ability to quickly perform broad parametric simulations of thermoregulatory response across whole populations of humans and in diverse poses.",

Key to the success of GPSRO inversions is a prior knowledge of cloud properties (rain, cloud liquid content, ice, etc.). STAR will implement the community Global Statistical Interpolation variational data assimilation system to ingest and extract information from a variety of observing systems and, in particular, from microwave radiances, such as SSMI/S measured by satellites from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program. Variational assimilation of satellite observations is a unique and convenient mean to produce physically consistent cloud retrieval products on three-dimensional regular grids. The proposed work aims at furthering the science that supports the retrievals of cloud parameters from both, satellite microwave radiances and GPSRO data in all weather conditions, to implement the corresponding technology and assess the accuracy of the retrievals, in terms of their suitability for Defense remote sensing applications, such as radiative transfer calculations.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The goal of the proposal is to develop a physics-based methodology and associated software to simulate the Polymer Impregnation and Pyrolysis (PIP) manufacturing process for Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMCs).  The proposed methodology is based on a mechanistic (physics-based) model that includes direct consideration of experimental observations of the manufacturing steps in pursuit of optimum manufacturing conditions. This is of prime importance to both of our industrial sponsors COI Ceramics, Inc. (COIC) and United Technologies.  Once developed and thoroughly validated, the methodology would be used in cost effective development of CMC components by the Air Force and its major aerospace engine suppliers.   In Phase I the feasibility of using this methodology has been demonstrated by qualitative comparison with experimental observations of open porosity.  Basic elements of mass and heat transfer models were also developed. The proposed Phase II effort aims to further develop, validate and integrate the models using test data from a detailed experimental program.  Close coordination with COIC, who will fabricate S400 material used in the program and lead the experimental effort, will ensure that test data will be generated to support the modeling effort and that the model will realistically simulate the  manufacturing process.    BENEFIT:  Due to the proliferation in potential applications of ceramic matrix composites in military and commercial aerospace engines and in industrial gas turbine industries, the proposed dual-use high technology product has an immediate and expanding market. The biggest benefit of the proposed product is in its ability to improve the PIP manufacturing process for CMCs by optimizing the process input variables and making the process more efficient. Thus the product will help to reduce manufacturing cost. The product can also be useful in modifying manufacturing process in order to achieve targeted structural properties.   SAI will market the methodology, the software and technical expertise (services) to CMC manufacturers and other the end-users of CMC materials.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The focus of this Phase II effort is to deliver a non-mechanical laser beam directional control unit that is small and lightweight, while minimizing power consumption for use on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) laser radar units.  Development of small, compact, low-power laser radars on small dynamic platforms is a difficult problem because of the pointing accuracy, open and closed loop scanning rates, angle coverage, and aperture size needed for the optical system.  A workable solution is to combine a few techniques to decouple the requirements.  By using this approach, coarse- and fine-angle steerers, including mechanical and non-mechanical approaches, are combined to provide the coverage and accuracy needed for the application.  The techniques of interest have the ability to scale to large apertures, provide fast and accurate pointing and tracking without greatly complicating the system design, and minimize size, weight and power.    In Phase II, Boulder Nonlinear Systems (BNS) will fabricate a prototype beam control subsystem designed for UAV operational environments and deliver this subsystem to our transition partner.  In Phase III, the transition partner will verify performance, integrate the subsystem into a laser radar sensor and test in a near-operational environment.    BENEFIT:  Optical pointing and tracking is a major issue for a variety of applications including free space optical communications, remote sensing, and weapon guidance.  The proposed beam control subsystem will reduce the size, weight, and power requirements of UAV laser radars units using less expensive, less complicated, more reliable components while providing high-speed, random access beam control. The technology has the potential to provide a cost savings of approximately $99M over a five year period compared to current mechanical beam steering assemblies.",

Currently deployed space-based imaging systems lack the spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution necessary for optimal target detection and classification.  Spectral Sciences Inc. (SSI) proposes to address the need by developing the Battlespace Large Area Spectral-imaging Transient-event (BLAST) sensor for on-orbit targeting of dynamic events and battlefield objects under suboptimal conditions.  BLAST combines Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) characterization and Hypertemporal Imaging (HTI) flash detection to provide event location and characterization threat maps for both battlespace awareness and strategic missile warning.  In Phase I, we demonstrated the utility of fast framing multiplexing imagery to the detection and classification of battlespace events and presented a set of specifications for on-orbit design.  In Phase II, we propose to design, construct, test, and field demonstrate a prototype sensor and to advance the state-of-the-art in detection, characterization, and remote sensing simulation.  BLAST will provide the Air Force with both a field testing hardware capability and with a platform design modeling capability.  BENEFIT:  BLAST sensor has a strong commercialization potential.  The technology developed for the BLAST sensor could potentially revolutionize the spectral sensing marketplace by providing fast, rugged, mechanically stable and quickly adaptable systems for point and imaging spectroscopy with applications ranging from petrochemical industry to combustion analysis, environmental sensing and biomedical imaging.  Regarding government applications not directly related to space-based monitoring, the proposed BLAST system approach is expected to find applications related to standoff sensing as applied to the detection and identification of gunfire, chemical/biological threat monitoring, flare combustion monitoring for petrochemical industry, environmental pollution sensing and in medical biomedical imaging for diagnostic and research purposes.",

While the innovations envisioned by this program are broadly applicable, they serve an immediate and urgent need for missions to prospect for volatiles at the lunar poles (i.e., the NASA Lunar Resource Prospector Mission, currently in Phase A). These missions must be rapid and precise, covering multiple kilometers in approximately 10-12 Earth days to complete mission objectives in one lunar light cycle. This calls for the ability to drive intentionally and efficiently to precise drilling destinations. Polar operations encounter low angle lighting; this creates shadows which confront robot operations with challenges in power production, thermal control, and operator situational awareness. This demands robust path planning for efficient mission planning and execution.\n\nThe proposed work develops a computer-aided mission planning tool that balances the competing demands of efficient routes, scientific information gain, and rover constraints (e.g., kinematics, communication, power, thermal, and terrainability) to generate and analyze optimized routes between sequences of locations. Planner-computed statistics about the set of viable paths enable mission planners, scientists, and operators to efficiently select routes considering a range of priorities including risk, duration, and science return.

High power, high efficiency laser diodes are now available to pump the lasers but they need large amounts of power and energy storage. The instantaneous power loading that these pulsed weapons would demand from the current electrical generation and distribution system (voltage, current, pulse width) cannot be supported. The focus of the Phase II program is the development of innovative high power density, high efficiency power conversion and conditioning technologies to support these high power, low duty cycle applications. The ultimate goal is to buffer the aircrafts generation and distribution system from the effects of high power pulse loads. RCT proposes to use an innovative architecture that will draw constant power from the generator while simultaneously firing the weapon and storing electrical energy in pulse power batteries and/or super capacitors for the next shot. The use of SiC power modules is being considered in order to operate at elevated frequency and temperature, increasing power density, while reducing EMI filter and cooling requirements.

This project will combine the advantages of EASMP with the design of state-of-the-art gearbox isolators and interior panels to provide the ability to tune these components for specific operational frequencies. With the use of EASMP integrated components, by semi-actively altering the interior panels or gearbox isolators' frequency response, it will be possible to better target and control particularly irritating tones related to the aircraft's flight mode. CRG proposes to advance EASMP maturity which is applicable across many other application areas and has the benefit of alternative stimuli boasting ultra-low power requirements and more potential for faster switching times.

In Phase II, we propose to develop an ultracold-atom system based on ColdQuanta's channel cell technology. With this approach to ultrahigh-vacuum systems, we can design and fabricate cells that are far smaller and more robust than any other vacuum technology  used with ultracold atoms (of which we are aware). With a channel cell, each stage of BEC production can occur simultaneously throughout a series of interconnected vacuum chambers. The resulting system creates ultracold atoms quasi-continuously and increases production rates by virtually eliminating dead time between sequential operating cycles. Part of the channel cell's small size is due to an integrated atom microchip that can be used to quickly produce ultracold atoms and utilize them for a variety of applications. With the flexibility afforded by atom chips, channel cells can be easily configured for a variety of interferometer geometries, including a Michelson configuration for measuring accelerations and a Sagnac configuration for measuring rotations.",

        "abstract": "Exact formulations of weapon-to-threat assignment problems have long been identified as binary polynomial optimization problems which are theoretically difficult (Non-deterministic polynomial-time-hard or NP-hard), thus previous research for implementation in the area has focused on heuristic solution methods or methods which compromise full formulation with limits on assignment.  The introduction of sensor pairing further complicates formulation and solution.  Using advanced analytics, we developed a detailed formulation of the simultaneous asset pairing and engagement scheduling problem thus fully integrating optimization of the exact problem.  Moreover, we introduced an innovative linearization approach that exploits the nature of the problem data and manages to solve the problem efficiently using commercial optimization engines.  We are currently extending our analysis using robust optimization methods to address the stated problem under uncertainty.  These robust optimization methods allow us to optimize over uncertainty in the problem data and derive solutions that are less sensitive to errors in point estimates of parameters.  In Phase II we will enhance our formulation to capture more complex dynamics between different engagements, make certain that the robust optimization extends to this more realistic version as well, and finally we will further refine our algorithms to ensure real-time implementations in realistic stressed environments.

This project develops a non-contact, non-destructive tool that enables rapid wafer scan, producing a subsurface defect map to locate and minimize defects during integrated circuit manufacturing. The end user will benefit from the lower cost of electronics resulting from increased yield. Environmental benefits include reduction of wasted wafers and associated materials and chemicals used during wafer processing. Other use of this technology is as a laboratory instrument, providing a new subsurface characterization tool to the scientific community. Semiconductors are ubiquitous in our lives and the trend towards making them (and the products which house them) faster, cheaper and smaller are clear. The industry is vocal in its need for testing equipment to keep up with this trend, but current technologies fall short. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop an inspection tool that is capable of detecting subsurface features and defects for semiconductors wafer inspection. In the wafers manufacturing, starting from the bare wafer, each step can lead to defects, which, if not detected, can lower yield and increase cost. Certain buried defects are not detectable using standard imaging techniques due to the presence of absorptive layers. This SBIR Phase II project describes a non-contact, non-destructive tool that utilizes an optical/acoustic technique that enables rapid wafer scan, producing a subsurface defect map to locate and minimize defects during integrated circuit manufacturing.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be an increased usage of sustainable materials, increased revenue for US agriculture, and increased domestic and international sales of a new and innovative product line. Success in this project will also lead to domestic job creation needed to support the research, manufacturing, and sales of these composites. The processes to be finalized during this Phase II project will support the growth of a nascent based on US-manufactured, environmentally-friendly products. Within three years of launch, it is expected that over $4 million in revenue will be generated by sales of bamboo fiber. Moreover, increases in bamboo cultivation as a result of these new products will help mitigate adverse environmental impacts and improve public health. This will be done by the inherent sequestration of carbon dioxide in the plant growth cycle, and a reduction in the pollution associated with the use of high-energy glass fiber and plastics processing techniques. This Phase II project will address the following research topics: species variations, manufacturability, additional high value products, additional composite properties, processing and treatment optimization, and commercial scale-up. The team will assess the mechanical and physical implications of variations in feedstock by the use of filament tensile testing. Surface treatments specific to bamboo fibers will be finalized, with the goal of increased fiber-matrix interfacial adhesion, mitigation of water absorption, and compatibility with at least three major resins systems. These treatments will be evaluated via composite tensile testing, filament testing and water immersion testing. Manufacturing studies will be performed to verify compatibility with commercial scale manufacturing equipment. The design and manufacture of a small scale, batch plant will address technological and automation challenges. This plant will provide a bridge to a commercial-scale plant designed to produce 6 million pounds of fiber yearly. Additional innovative aspects to the project lie in the assessment of a bamboo species compatible with climates in the US, automation of raw bamboo processing, and implementation of a fully optimized multi-step material functionalization process.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project accelerates the development of project management expertise by enabling users to rehearse tough, real-world challenges in an immersive, Virtual World environment. Studies of expert project managers indicate that their skill was acquired over many years and as a result of learning by failure. Accelerating this process would have a huge impact on the costs of real world failure. Some studies have estimated the organizational losses to upwards of $82 billion annually. These losses are thought to be largely preventable with better approaches to project management education. The broader/commercial impact of project lies in its ability to 1) lower the risk of learning through failure, 2) accelerate the time it takes to effectively train novices, and 3) alleviate some of the costs associated with unanticipated mistakes made in the real world. Using an immersive, simulation-based, outcomes driven rehearsal methodology, this product has the potential to 1) increase the success rate of projects for those with limited real-world experience, 2) by allowing users to rehearse and test deployment plans without risk and 3) by providing participants new to project management an opportunity to encounter tough problems and develop solutions under pressure. This company&#039;s rehearsal method enables teams of participants to interact with virtual replicas of actual processes and products in the context of an ongoing business with complex goals. The primary innovation will be the use of Virtual Worlds to provide rich interactive environments to accelerate expertise development among novice project managers. The Virtual Worlds environments are enriched with embedded behavior and decision monitoring software designed to automate the tracking of progress and provide feedback. Early pilots with experts indicate that the method may accelerate expertise development by as much as two years. The objective for this project is to refine the approach for use with novices by targeting key skills of project management that are normally learned through years of experience, and specifically, learning from failure. Virtual Worlds also provide an ideal platform to test hypotheses regarding the technical implementation, individual engagement and team outcomes in a novice population. As such, the project will also resolve a number of questions about the key features at play within emerging Virtual Worlds platforms.",

The eIMU will enable navigation directly to specific items in malls, grocery stores or department stores. It will also enable reliable navigation for police or fire fighters inside buildings in emergency situations. This navigation chip would enable a wide range of precision manufacturing and assembly robots. It would also enable the navigation of autonomous vehicles that can be used by police and homeland security in addition to commercial applications, such as real estate and smart agriculture. The eIMU could also be used to help map mines and to aid in oil exploration. In the medical industry, the eIMU could be used for surgical robots and wheel chairs.

In particular, the measurement (bias) stability of these sensors is extremely sensitive to temperature, humidity and stress?making it very challenging to us them for precision navigation and machine control. The proposed eIMU will address this by building a micromachined physics package around the sensitive MEMS sensors in order to actively control their environment independent of environmental factors. The technical challenges include: i) developing a process for reliably assembling the IMU dies in to the physics package; ii) optimizing the physics package for temperature stability and in order to prevent it from introducing any noise to the IMU and; iii) optimizing software algorithms for reducing the power required for environmentally stabilizing the IMU. This packaging technology will also be generic and applicable to other sensor systems and technologies.",

        "abstract": "Beginning with the release of the iPhone in 2007 and continuing with the increasing popularity of tablet computers, there has been an ever increasing desire to connect \"unsecure\" mobile devices to secure enterprise networks.  Although several pieces of technology exist to meet this need, these devices lack a firm foundation upon which to build trust and security.  This paper proposes development of Roots-of-Trust for mobile devices using Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) and the ARM TrustZone trusted execution environment.  Using these two basic technologies we propose building a Root of Trust for Storage (RTS), a Root of Trust for Integrity (RTI) and a Root of Trust for Verification (RTV).   We will implement this capability on a selected mobile device platform without hardware modification.  Because of the use of a PUF, our technology will make it nearly impossible to steal or clone a device's credentials.  The new roost of trust will be used to implement a sample application that performs strong data-at-rest encryption and will make it impossible to decrypt the sample data if it is moved to a new device, or if the device's software is tampered with.",

One method is designed to integrate as easily into existing systems, while the other requires deeper integration but provides correspondingly stronger security. The keys to our work are practicality and integration: practicality to ensure our system applies to current and near-term mobile devices, and integration to allow for a smooth transition path to mobile device manufacturers. In the proposal we describe not only the technical path to implementation for these two approaches, but also the business, legal, and political steps required to bring root of trust technology to market. Once in place, root of trust technology can be used as a strong basis for implementing other key mobile security solutions, such as secure data at rest, secure data in transit, secure authentication, and mobile device management.",

        "abstract": "In the Phase I program, TIAX LLC developed a detection methodology that was able to measure significant differences between pairs of counterfeit and authentic products in four different product categories. Establishing the proof-of-concept of this technique creates the potential for a new detection methodology that can be utilized at a port of entry by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to identify shipments of counterfeit goods. The objective of the Phase II program is to further develop and optimize the detection methodology developed in the Phase I program. In the Phase II program, we will develop a prototype detection system and demonstrate it under field conditions in a U.S. port of entry.  When fully developed, the methodology will allow for the rapid and accurate screening of closed containers for counterfeit products. It will be designed to work outdoors in a port environment in extreme weather conditions.  The TIAX methodology will use instruments that are rugged, mobile and can be operated by personnel with minimal scientific training.",

        "abstract": "The proposed SW-dMTM mobile security solution is lean and fully-software-based.  The goal is to provide the required Roots of Trust (RoTs) and trusted security services via a fully software implementation while maintaining the heightened level of assurance typically only achieved through additional, security-centric hardware.  This will be achieved by building a solution that is not only compatible with the Trusted Computing Group's (TCG) MTM mobile device security specification but also by supporting government use cases and providing additional dynamic trust verification. The solution has the following key benefits: (i) a cumulative chain of trust via a secure boot methodology, (ii) dynamic RoTs through the runtime verification and persistence achieved by stealth Trusted Agents, (iii) MTM trusted services and extensions.  In addition to trusted services they provide the foundation for both static and dynamic data and application protection and attestation.  The Phase I effort was successful in proving feasibility of key components through a proof-of-concept demonstration.  The expected result of a Phase II proposal is a prototype that could be piloted by DHS.  The TRL at the start of the Phase I effort was 2.  This was brought to a level 4 through the completion of a proof-of-concept demonstration during Phase I.  The expected TRL upon completion of the Phase II effort is 6.  A Phase IIB/Cost Match opportunity would increase the TRL to 8 or 9.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Phase II of this program aims to provide a concrete demonstration of the SIGINT system targeted for the C-130J what was designed during Phase I. Phase II will build on the antenna and array design that JST developed during Phase I, by improving the antenna array model against the full metallic structure of the aircraft; which includes shadowing, RF blockage, and mutual coupling.   Additionally, real (scaled) antenna patterns will be measured to verify full 360 degree azimuth coverage of the individual sub-arrays.  We propose constructing a 1:10 scale model of a C-130J and outfitting with it a scaled version of the designed array. This antenna array will be refined and modified to fit the model, as well a minimizing actual strong coupling and potential RF shorting to metal rib elements, on both the wings and stabilizers. After the scale model is constructed and fitted with the antenna array, necessary RF backend components will be placed inside the model and tested as well. The refined antenna array design will be fabricated and tested in an anechoic chamber for both gain and pattern performance, as well as overall DF performance. Our Phase II findings will be presented in a comprehensive final report.    BENEFIT:  SIGINT capabilities on the AC/MC-130J provide a clear benefit to warfighter by either augmenting weapons targeting accuracies or providing high accuracy threat detection capabilities for the warfighter. While the Air Force is the most immediate beneficiary of this technology, Phase I of this program explored the feasibility of enabling the SIGINT technology on other large metal platforms. Other platforms for other branches of the DoD could also be retrofitted with SIGINT. Most metal platforms with removable leading edges and a dorsal fairing would be good candidates for this capability.  Phase I of this program determined that the results of the C-130 study could be used as the foundation to migrate the DF capabilities to other platforms such as the C-17, the P-8 etc. We will also continue to consider approaches for using system design to exploit capabilities such as EW, bistatic radar, directed communications.",

The optimization of EM actuator parameters starts with straightforward math and requirements definition but becomes complicated by soft constraints like speed vs life and application specific details of the cost function. The BLDC motors we propose to build and test have significantly better metrics than any comparable motor currently available.  Working with prime contractor feedback we will develop concepts for redundancy and failsafe disconnects. We will also develop and test a continuously variable reducer which promises to significantly enhance the thermal performance, particularly in the presence of steady loads.  BENEFIT:  A hingeline EM actuation system promises to save weight and energy allowing increased aircraft performance and reliability.  The variable gearbox may allow energy savings in non military applications as well.",

In Phase I, ATR developed a conceptual design for a Low Ground Clearance Vehicle Detection System (LGCVDS) to actively prevent such accidents. The LGCVDS functions by measuring vehicles on approach to the crossing, detecting those with insufficient ground clearance, and triggering wayside active warning indicators to alert the driver with sufficient time and distance to stop. Phase II presents the opportunity to evolve the LGCVDS concept and demonstrate it as an effective and reliable system. To successfully monitor and protect vehicles at real\u2010world grade crossings, the system needs to handle a wide range of vehicle types and speeds. It must be robust to adverse visibility conditions including heavy snow, rain, fog, or darkness.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Advances in nanotechnology have promised improvements in a variety of energetic materials; however, practical application of the technology has not matched its promise. One area of particular interest is in producing core-shell energetic materials based on metal (fuel)/metal oxide (oxidizer) chemistry that demonstrate thermite-like reactions. Cornerstone Research Group Inc. (CRG) proposes to adapt an existing in-situ manufacturing technique to produce core-shell particles in a scalable process. CRG has demonstrated the scaled in-situ process in previous work, and resulting materials offer higher quality particles than reported in literature. The process allows for a safer method of particle incorporation as no particles are handled by workers and there is no mixing. It is not a colloidal process, so there is no route for agglomeration or phase separation. In Phase I CRG demonstrated the feasibility of the in-situ process to fabricate core-shell nanoparticles. In Phase II CRG will introduce Phase I processes to their existing scaled equipment and develop additional prototype equipment to meet the Air Forces production demands for core-shell nanothermite. CRGs proposed concept will allow high volume production of a material whose theoretical value has been promised but could not be practically realized prior to now due to production limitations.

This is compounded, when the vehicle remains submerged for extended periods of time which is often required for reconnaissance missions. In the case of a miniature autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), the self-localization challenge extends well beyond INS filtering. Although, position and velocity sensor systems (DVLs) have been successfully designed for large and medium scale submarines, the miniaturization of those sensor components still poses a significant challenge. To close this technological gap, the NextGen team proposes the development of a sonar-based miniature navigation sensor system that aims to challenge the weight, size, cost as well as performance specifications imposed by small and miniature AUVs. The proposed solution will combine advanced sonar technology with software modules capable of deducing the vehicle kinematics, i.e. position and velocity, in real time. The NextGen, Virginia Tech and Lockheed Martin team combines year-long expertise in i) sensor calibration and underwater navigation, ii) system integration, and iii) image processing and state estimation.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  MaXentrics Phase 2 proposal consists of delivering a general-purpose hardware platform and FPGA software implementation to characterize the performance of the various waveforms that were analyzed and simulated in Phase 1, using performance metrics specified by Air Force in target SATCOM environments.  A general-purpose FPGA based hardware modem platform will be used to implement the target waveforms, and the performance of these waveforms will be measured over a representative RF channel.  This is to ensure that the predicted theoretical performance of these waveforms can be successfully achieved in a practical HW implementation. Waveform evaluation will be performed on the basis of communication performance, covertness (i.e., featureless transmission with low-probability of intercept, detection, or exploitation), resilience (anti-jamming and interference-tolerant), and hardware feasibility.  BENEFIT:  Within the DoD market, secure chaotic SATCOM systems have potential applications in addressing the need for increased IP SATCOM connectivity. According to Thomson Reuters, Lockheed Martin won a $1.9 billion contract from the U.S. Air Force this past month, commissioning them to build the fifth and sixth AEHF satellites by 2022. These satellites will provide protected SATCOM services to high-priority government and defense facilities. The associated demands of highly covert and resilient communications suggests a great applicability of DC-SSATS for the upcoming AEHF satellites. In mid-2012, USAF also awarded Boeing a $338.7 million contract to produce and launch the tenth WGS satellite. Commercial applications for satellite communications include satellite radio (Sirius Satellite Radio), satellite television (DirecTV), and 2-way satellite internet services. 2-way satellite internet is an emerging market with ViaSat in a leading position after its launch of ViaSat-1 in 2011. ViaSat has negotiations underway for additional satellites and coverage, reaching further residential, international, governmental, maritime, and aeronautical markets, one such contract expected to yield $410M in 2013 [Seeking Alpha]. The maritime SATCOM market alone was valued at $1.4B in 2011, with steady growth predicted by Euroconsult for the next decade.",

The proposed Phase II SBIR will develop and deliver a capability to secure RESTful services using Single Sign On (SSO) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for cloud-enabled, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)-based information systems. The proposed effort will support secure information sharing between DCGS enclaves, be interoperable with existing DCGS-A ABAC architecture and information technology (IT) applications, and enable a follow-on Phase III deployment. Phase II efforts will develop detailed use cases that model operational environments; provide a Concept of Operations (CONOPS); develop prototypes based on those models; provide test procedures, reports, and conformance test kits to support validation, benchmarking and risk analysis tasks; and provide a roadmap for deployment and implementation in Phase III. The prototypes will be used to support an Interoperability Demonstration Pilot and development of the Engineering/Deployment Roadmap to implement SSO and ABAC for federated RESTful services within DCGS-A and between DCGS-A and other DoD/IC entities.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Luna has demonstrated the feasibility of a high speed extreme environment stress and strain measurement system operating at temperatures >900C (1652F) and streaming static and dynamic data at 2.5MHz. During Phase I Luna also demonstrated the system's ability to measure a 26&#61549;&#61541;/10Hz AC component on top of a larger 1.2% strain component. The proposed Phase II effort will optimize the data acquisition system and sensors to meet the performance requirements of the Air Force in a delivered prototype. The complete system will consist of multichannel readout electronics, extreme environment transducers, and robust, easily fieldable methods of attachment for both metallic and a composite substrates. Accurate high temperature strain measurements are critical in the development and characterization of modern aerospace materials and verification of vehicle and component performance models. These models are used to determine design parameters and material selection for high speed flight vehicles and component life prediction. Currently there is no suitable technology capable of providing accurate strain data in the presence of both high temperatures and large loads. This Phase II project will develop a prototype system that will be transitioned to the Air Force, commercial aerospace, and automotive industry partners during Phase III.  BENEFIT:  The proposed system will meet the Air Forces needs for an extreme environment strain measurement system capable of providing accurate static and dynamic data at high speeds. Other agencies such as NASA, DARPA, and the Navy which are performing research on extreme environment materials and systems will also benefit from the technology developed during this program. The system and sensors will enable high temperature, extreme load data to be taken in the presence of high electro-magnetic fields to verify turbine and scramjet engine performance, composite heat shield material characterizations, and airframe dynamic response. These capabilities will also make the system desirable to airframe and engine OEMs to enable performance monitoring and qualification testing which will improve the safety and reliability of commercial transportation. Specifically, Luna has been approached by the automotive industry inquiring about a system with similar needs. In addition to safety improvements through improved material selection and design, the system will enable structural health monitoring and the collection of remaining useful life data which will reduce maintenance overall ownership costs of commercial transports. Luna will work with its commercial partners to complete civilian qualifications and begin marketing the technology for commercial applications during the Phase II&III efforts.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  CU Aerospace (CUA) and team partner the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) propose to perform research, development and demonstration of energy management optimization tools based upon existing UIUC and CUA expertise to expand the operational envelope of military and commercial vehicles (aircraft and automobiles).  Such a subsystem control methodology will optimize aircraft power generation, distribution, utilization, and associated thermal management based upon potential tactical vehicle operational power requirements and environmental conditions. Current approaches are not capable of dynamically allocating resources in a model-based approach.  Additionally, there is a gap in the ability to rapidly reconfigure an energy/power allocation strategy based on a specified objective function whilst satisfying hard constraints on the system state.  To fill this technology gap, this proposal introduces innovations that will produce the industry standard for aircraft energy management software.  Phase I demonstrated the viability of the CUA-UIUC control approach, and this Phase II SBIR effort will lead to design improvements that will provide a validated enhanced aircraft subsystem and control suite by the end of this program.  These enhancements will have major implications for the expansion of aircraft mission envelopes, and our goal is to jointly develop with UIUC the aircraft energy management software tools of choice for the industry.  BENEFIT:  The Phase I results laid the foundation to develop a prototype control suite for comprehensive development and testing in the Phase II program.  Incorporating the Phase I algorithms and software tools along with Air Force guidance for most desired features, the optimization control suite will be enhanced and tested extensively in Phase II as a product demonstration unit.  Applications of the developed control approach include next generation tactical fighter, advanced mobility, or related platforms.  Commercial applications include more electric aircraft, construction and mining vehicles, and hybrid-electric automobiles. The Phase II goal will initially be to expand the approach of Phase I, optimize the software, and design features for Air Force specifications, followed by optimization for more commercial programs.",

Excessive thermal loading causes the viewing domes to emit a high background radiance, which saturates the sensor and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) below the level required for reliable targeting, guidance, navigation, and situational awareness.  During Phase 1, the Spectral Imaging Laboratory (SPILAB) designed and analyzed a bio-inspired, multiple aperture seeker that can utilize active cooling throughout the viewing apertures to eliminate the problems associated with high temperature thermal loading.  During Phase 2, SPILAB will build a prototype for hypersonic wind tunnel testing to confirm that a multiple aperture seeker can view through a hot bow wave.  BENEFIT:  The actively cooled, multi-aperture seeker will enable hypersonic missiles and munitions to navigate and target using forward looking infrared sensing.  The seeker will be useful for both Air-to-Surface and Air-to-Air missiles.  The forward looking imaging capability will also be useful for future aircraft traveling at hypersonic speeds.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The use of energetic nanomaterials in munitions has the potential to increase lethality due to the high energy content provided by these materials. However, the propensity of nanoparticles, such as aluminum, to prematurely oxidize significantly reduces the total energy content. Such oxidation is unavoidable in any current large-scale commercial process for producing aluminum nanoparticles. In Phase I, we began developing a new class of core-shell nanoparticles with both a novel structure and a unique composition that addresses the drawbacks of state of the art metallic energetic nanoparticles. The core-shell composite nanoparticles are expected to have desirable functionalities, such as reduced oxygen contamination, intermetallic reaction for enhanced energy content, and air-stability. The feasibility of producing the core-shell nanoparticles, and their beneficial attributes, were demonstrated in Phase I. Building upon the Phase I proof of concept, and in collaboration with experts in the field of energetic materials, the proposed Phase II program provides a stepping stone towards developing a commercially viable process for producing nanocomposite energetic particles. The objectives of the Phase II program are (i) to scale up the technology and assemble a prototype production system, (ii) demonstrate a production rate of at least 500 g/batch in a 5 hour time period, and (iii) show superior combustion properties of the core-shell nanoparticles compared to state-of-the-art aluminum nanoparticles.  We anticipate achieving a TRL of at least 5 by the end of the Phase II program.  BENEFIT:  Core-shell energetic nanoparticles can be used as solid propellants for commercial launch vehicles, satellites, military launch vehicles, and missiles. Additionally, these materials can be used to enhance military pyrotechnics to deliver improved battlefield illumination or compact and very high heat sources for the destruction of chemical and biological weapons. Further, they can be used to enhance the safety and performance of commercial pyrotechnics due to their high degree of stability in air and significantly faster rate of reaction. Other potential military applications include consumable port covers for ramjet engine inlets, ramjet fuels, self-ejecting combustible plumes for large-area heating, thermal battery heat sources and shaped-charge liners. Additional commercial applications include in situ soldering and welding, thermal battery heating pellets, airbags, drug injection, ammunition primers, detonators, electric matches, micro-actuators, micro-pumps, micro-thrusters, micro-switches and micro-valves.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Hybrid technologies and adaptive resource management can significantly enhance the capability and range of next-generation aircraft.  To implement this strategy, we propose to develop a control system to configure the Adaptive Power and Thermal Management System (APTMS) based on the subsequent flight profile to enable the APTMS to use the most appropriate cooling system(s), heat sink(s), and energy source(s) to maximize the aircraft capability while minimizing fuel consumption.  Based on the planned flight profile, the control system employs reduced-order physical models to forecast the performance of the APTMS with a given configuration.  Based on the predicted performance, the system will then optimize the configurations for the remaining flight periods to maximize performance objectives.  In Phase I, we devised an advanced optimization algorithm, developed a simplified model for the APTMS, implemented an integrated APTMS configuration optimization software package, and demonstrated its ability to identify optimal configurations of the APTMS during a flight to reduce the APTMS operation fuel penalty.  In Phase II we will build and validate the APTMS optimization software with detailed physical models, use the software to identify the optimal thermal architecture for the APTMS and deliver the optimization software to the Air Force for further evaluation and development.  BENEFIT:  The proposed control system will enable future aircraft to fully realize the performance benefits of adaptive energy and thermal management, and enhance the capability and range of aircraft.  In the near term, the control system will support the demonstration of the Integrated Vehicle Energy Technology (INVENT) program at the Air Force.  In the long term, the control system will significantly enhance the static and dynamic performance of aircraft thermal management systems while reducing the overall vehicle fuel consumption.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The next generation of precision guided munitions (PGM) need to have highly capable and multi modal sensors that offer the potential for both autonomous as well as man-in-the-loop target designation, ideally in the same munition with multiple modes accessible and switchable on demand within a single fly out.  Such a sensor would offer a high precision strike, thus reducing the size of the warhead, and the potential for collateral damage and cost.  The challenge described in this SBIR is to develop such a multi modal sensor while maintaining a footprint that minimizes the size of the weapon.  Polaris Sensor Technologies proposes to develop a wide field of view (WFOV) semi-active laser (SAL) seeker that is compatible with organic laser designators.  The use of innovative optical system design and high performance photo diodes enables a strap down SAL seeker that can operate stand alone in a 5 smart munition or with a WFOV IR seeker being developed on a separate SBIR. The proposed effort will design, develop, and deliver a prototype that can detect a 1% reflective target at 5 km.    BENEFIT:  A small, light-weight system with multi-mode capability is key to development of the next generation of smart weapons.  The prototype developed in the proposed effort will demonstrate key capability for a SAL seeker integrable with a WFOV IR imager.  The most likely commercialization path is with the Air Force's Flexible Weapons (FW) program, the objective of which is to develop and demonstrate a modular plug-n-play hardware solution for the next generation of smart munitions.  The modular aspect of Flexible Weapon is a means to successfully achieve interoperability and composability at the weapon level.  The proposed effort is well suited for this program as it brings significant SAL capability which, when coupled to the WFOV IR imager, broadens the mission space for a FW smart weapon.  The proposed effort is timed such that it can help meet the objective of the first phase of the FW program, which is complete hardware demonstrations through modeling and simulation, hardware in the loop testing, and captive and UAV flight testing.  Additional commercialization opportunities are being explored with UAV manufacturers to help automate flight operations in difficult environments.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The need for evaluation of aerodynamic loads on internal weapons bay doors comes from the US Air Force's requirement to open doors on many of its aircraft during flight. This ranges from an aircraft's low-speed opening of landing gear doors and speed brakes to opening weapons bay doors in supersonic flight. This sets up a situation for unsteady aerodynamic loading of these surfaces due to the potential for unsteady flow oscillations in and around the exposed bay that is known to exhibit strong tonal content under many of the flight conditions at which the U.S. Air Force operates its aircraft. These weapons bay tones and the oscillatory nature of the separated flow on the doors have the potential to excite structural modes of the doors, aircraft surfaces, or externally carried munitions and fuel tanks and can lead to buffet, flutter, or fatigue induced failures. Part of the aircraft flight certification for all operational and developmental aircraft includes assessments of the aircraft store compatibility, which is made more difficult in view of the fluid structure interactions that must be taken into account. During an aircraft development and demonstration program, a validated Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) model provides a means of generating data to support assessments regarding the design of the structure, provide flight certification, etc.  BENEFIT:  A high-fidelity Unified Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) Modeling and Testing capability for evaluation of dynamic loads on payload bay doors will result from the SBIR program. CRAFT Tech will market this unique capability to prime contractors and manufacturers of large commercial airliners/military transports/bombers and tactical fighter to study loads on weapons bay doors, the wheel bay doors and other near vicinity surfaces/components. This technology is obviously relevant to small passenger and/or regional jets, as well for loads associated with wheel wells, etc. The SBIR product is well-suited for supporting the design of a new generation of launch vehicles that is placing a premium on robust and accurate predictions of aero-acoustic and buffet loads experienced at launch. They are also very applicable to large-scale commercial pumps that are extremely prone to performance loss and/or structural failure caused by cavitation-induced severe dynamic loading.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  To address the Air Forces need for an open systems architecture data transfer device (DTD), Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a Digital Aircraft Data Storage (DADS) that provides a solution maintaining compatibility with existing mission planning equipment (MPE) and aircraft data transfer and recording sources.  This addresses MPE media obsolescence while providing a compatible solution with legacy aircraft that lays the foundation for an option to execute a longer-term strategy that completes the avionics modernization of the digital media and the data recording systems throughout the USAF. In Phase I, POC developed a data transfer unit (DTU) and DTD for the F-15 platform as identified by the USAF. We also analyzed each platform selected for evaluation (F-15, F-16, A-10) with its currently deployed DTU and DTD, focusing on the interfaces between the DTD media and the DTU. DADS requires no aircraft harness rewiring or Operational Flight Program modifications. In Phase II, POC will further develop two distinct prototypes for a demonstration showing DADS compatibility on two aircraft platforms. This will include incorporating encryption of all data using data-at-rest encryption techniques. An optional ability to connect to a crash survivable memory unit is provided.  BENEFIT:  DADS immediately addresses the Air Forces critical near-term obsolescence issues with current aircraft data transfer devices that are based on obsolete/aging technologies, such as PCMCIA and magnetic disks, by providing a digital media storage solution that is compatible with existing equipment and uses open-system standards.  This approach gives the Air Force a low-risk strategy to mitigate immediate obsolescence issues and supports an optional path for longer-term growth to a fully modern digital storage solution.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Chromium is one of the most widely used industrial metals. Several million workers worldwide are estimated to be exposed to chromium compounds in a variety of industries, including electroplating, welding, and chromate painting. Hexavalent chromium (a.k.a., chromate or Cr(VI)) via inhalation exposure is known to be carcinogenic in humans, resulting in an increased risk of lung cancer.  Concentrations of total chromium (Cr(III) and Cr(VI)) in blood, serum and urine have long been used to monitor environmentally or occupationally exposed populations. However, total Cr concentration does not indicate chromate exposure. Currently, there are no known physiological tests to determine the exposure to chromate. Lynntech proposes to address this unmet medical need through the development of a physiological testing system using an innovative immunoassay-based platform to quantifiably determine the workplace exposure of the human body to chromate using physiological markers. This system does not require an interference-prone colorimetric device or labeling agents. Also, the proposed assay is specific for chromate exposure, independent of other valences of chromium. During the Phase I, Lynntech determined relevant physiological markers of exposure to chromate and demonstrated the feasibility of the testing system. During the Phase II, a breadboard system will be designed, fabricated, tested, and demonstrated.  BENEFIT:  Lynntechs physiological testing system to quantifiably determine exposure of the human body to hexavalent Chrome (Cr(VI) has significant commercialization potential in both the federal government and private industries. Military applications include determination of exposure of personnel to chromate and mitigation of exposure effects to personnel screening. Civilian applications include screening/confirmation of individuals, as well as industrial personnel and agricultural workers that have been exposed to chromate.",

The objective is to enhance the laser warning capability existing in the ATW for CV-22 and larger aircraft application.  The plan for the CRP effort will include adapting the concept, design, components and algorithms of the USLWR to the form factor of Northrop&quot;s ATW, to produce the Advanced Threat Warner Laser Warning Receiver (ATWLWR).  The results of this effort will set the stage for commercialization in Phase III, whose objectives will be to transition the technology to USAF and its prime contractors. Further in Phase III, we will baseline the LWR production process, demonstrate high detection probability, set up a production infrastructure and deliver packaged, end-to-end tested ATWLWRs for USAF system insertion.  BENEFIT:  The proposed project would result in the Air Force transition and commercialization of  laser threat sensors that will be integrated into CV22 and large aircrafts as well as into a wide variety of Air Force platforms.

        "abstract": "For military applications, acoustic arrays can provide target signatures and locations of aircrafts, vehicles, weapons and personnel.  Additional benefits of arrays include immunity to jamming, low cost, low weight and low power consumption.  Acoustic beamforming using conventional arrays typically require 10~100s of microphones and have an aperture size ranging from several inches to several feet.  Conventional acoustic arrays have seen limited usage in aerial reconnaissance for Army applications due to the size requirements for beamforming.  While the size requirements for beamforming is somewhat constrained by the aperture, the array size can be miniaturized by microfabricated microphones and made conformal to a curved surface through the use of a flexible substrate.    Our proposed solution is to implement an acoustic array design for broadband using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based, piezoelectric microphones mounted on a compact, flexible substrate.  Additional features of the array include a hybrid electronics packaging for signal conditioning and acoustic metamaterials for array performance enhancement.  The development of a compact, flexible acoustic array is ideal for small UAS platform where conventional acoustic arrays are impractical.",

        "abstract": "The goal of the program is to reduce the cost of substrate reclaim for high-efficiency solar cells fabricated by an epitaxial lift-off (ELO) process, and to increase the number of reuse cycles for a given substrate.  If successful, this will result in a reduction in the cost of GaAs-based multi-junction solar cells, in which the cost of the substrate accounts for approximately 50% of the total cost.  The cost reduction is achieved by introducing a new multi-layer etch-stop structure into a inverted metamorphic (IMM) triple-junction cell.  The etch-stop structure is grown between the original GaAs substrate and the ELO release layer, thereby becoming the effective substrate surface after the ELO process.  The etch-stop structure prevents pits and surface damage that occur during ELO from damaging the surface of the GaAs substrate.  The standard method of reclaiming the GaAs substrate after ELO is to employ chemo-mechanical polishing (CMP) to remove the defect-ridden GaAs surface and chemically polish the underlying GaAs to yield a surface that is suitable for epitaxial growth.  The CMP process works but reduces the substrate thickness and causes minor wafer damage itself, which requires further polishing.  These factors accumulate, in practice limiting the number of reclaim cycles to 5 - 10 for a given substrate.  With the incorporation of the proposed etch-stop structure, the defects are isolated in the etch-stop structure, which can be dissolved by successive selective wet chemical etches to produce the original pristine GaAs surface on a substrate of the original thickness.  All mechanical polishing is eliminated in this proposed work, ensuring a constant substrate thickness through repeated substrate reclaim cycles and reducing the estimated cost of the recycling process to ",

        "abstract": "Accurate flow calculation is crucial to the development and support of air platforms, and CFD has been successful at predicting aerodynamic performance for a variety of flows.  The accuracy of CFD is governed by the quality of the surface mesh, and much work has been undertaken to automatically generate surface grids from CAD.  Unfortunately, quality is quantified in terms of conformance to the surface rather than relevant fluid dynamics, and users must undertake costly grid refinement studies to determine a suitable mesh for production work.  Based upon the unique capabilities offered by a CFD solver developed by Continuum Dynamics, Inc., in addition to significant experience developing fast reliable design codes, panel methods and CFD solvers, this effort will develop a low cost CFD-based grid processing tool that can be used to guide the creation of suitable surface meshes.  The proposed tool would be built around a low-cost CFD solver and will output guidance on local surface mesh correction and refinement based upon both surface topology and flow requirements/properties.  Phase I successfully demonstrated the feasibility of such a tool on several complex geometries with an assortment of geometric deficiencies.  Phase II will undertake formal development and integration.",

SMA materials provide large actuation forces and require minimal packaging volume, thereby allowing more volume for internal components and payload. The shape-changing mortar solution will be a low-cost, add-on package retrofitting to an existing interface. We will leverage our controls expertise to ensure open-loop stability in every phase of flight and precision-guidance to a GPS location. Wind tunnel testing of the projectile will be performed, yielding high-fidelity simulations of its performance. Novel techniques for controlling the SMA actuators that are simple and robust will be developed and demonstrated. Finite element analysis (FEA) and high-G drop testing will ensure the newly designed components can survive the high-G launch loads. Temperature tests from -45F to +145F will prove the components are suitable for Army operations. AVID, in partnership with Virginia Techs Center for Intelligent Material Systems and Structures (CIMSS), will deliver two smart mortar prototypes ready for flight-testing at the end of the Phase II effort.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Mainstream Engineering Corporation (MEC) proposes developing a pyrolytic solid waste remediation system (py-SWRS) for processing mixed waste at small contingency base camps. The proposed py-SWRS unit is an updated and improved version of a portable pyrolysis reactor already under development at MEC for greenwaste processing at landfills located on large, fixed DoD installations. MEC&quot;s portable fast pyrolysis unit includes proprietary reactor design features to improve yield and energetics. In Phase I, an existing pilot reactor was demonstrated with a mixed waste stream representative of solid waste generated at small contingency bases. Key components of the py-SWRS process were designed and experimentally tested. In addition, a high-fidelity design including 3D layout and sizing/costing of capital components was performed. In Phase II, process improvements will be made to fully integrate the feedstock handling, improve maintainability, and make the process self-sustaining. A second-generation py-SWRS technology demonstrator will be fabricated and fully characterized. Phase II will culminate in demonstration of the py-SWRS unit in a high-fidelity demonstration environment.  BENEFIT:  The enormous amount of solid waste generated by deployed forces is typically disposed of by burning in open burn pits or burn boxes. This practice potentially exposes troops to air toxics. Backhauling of waste exposes drivers in the convoys to the potential threat of ambush. The proposed py-SWRS unit improves warfighter safety by converting mixed solid waste (mostly from field feeding) to clean combustion products and a small amount of sterile inorganic ash. The process is also capable of exporting bio-oil that can be used for production of heat and/or power; an option which is more attractive at larger bases. The portable pyrolysis technology behind the py-SWRS also has strong dual-use commercial potential for conversion of agricultural residues to a renewable fuel oil. MEC is aggressively pursuing commercial markets for this technology in an effort to increase sales volumes and drive down costs.",

In the proposed novel concepts, the means of transferring power into the munitions housing as well as establishing data transfer link are optical. With the proposed concepts small as well as very large amount of power in the range of a few mW to over 100 Watts or more can be transferred into sealed munitions housing. The use of optical data transfer allows the proposed concept to achieve rates well in excess of 16 Mb/sec. The proposed novel concepts are suitable for in-breech and/or out-of-breech powering and data transfer applications. The proposed concepts are simple in design; do not have any moving parts or sensitive optical components; and can be designed for fabrication with commercially available components design for over 20 years of shelf life. Due to the optical nature, the proposed optical powering and data transmission concepts have the advantage of being immune to Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) and provide Immunity to Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP).",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The U.S. Air Force has a need to develop a wide-field-of-view (WFOV) multimode seeker with one mode being multi-waveband passive infrared imaging, and the second mode being a semi-active laser (SAL). The multimode system is required because of the continued need for military operations to be conducted in difficult urban environments were damage effects must be controlled through precision guidance of munitions.  Given the highly cluttered nature of urban environments and associated problems with line-of-sight designation, additional precision can be obtained via passive infrared imaging provided from the flight vehicle.  The additional image information would allow soldiers on the ground to adjust the laser designator spot accordingly and thereby increase the probability of correctly identifying and tracking targets from non-targets.  The Spectral Imaging Laboratory (SPILAB) will develop a dual resolution, WFOV infrared seeker that can be integrated with a SAL sub-system.  The combined system will have a size, weight, and power (SWaP) below the required 5 inch diameter, 5 lbs, and 50 W.  BENEFIT:  The combined infrared seeker/SAL system will enable soldiers in the field to designate targets with greater precision in cluttered urban environments.  Commercial applications include surveillance activities in law enforcement, border control, homeland security. The infrared seeker system alone will find applications in search and rescue, machine vision, robotics, and vehicle situational awareness/safety systems.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In our Phase I SBIR work to date, we constructed an implosion system using carefully-designed components and geometries that reproducibly reacts nearly 100% of the JP10 in the test cell.  Using ALE3D we have also been able to qualitatively describe the major hydrodynamic processes involved in the collapse and subsequent expansion of the assembly.  In Phase II we propose a continuation and expansion of these early efforts that will result in a similar amount of reaction, but which will occur on a much shorter time scale (hundreds of s), and potentially result in a detonation.  We will begin to examine other effects, such as the use of reactive cases and the external flow associated with missile trajectory.  We will also begin to remedy the problem of not having a complete equation of state for the JP10 along with other computational issues.  BENEFIT:  The results of the experimental and theoretical programs from Phase I have clearly demonstrated the feasibility of the technical goals of this SBIR.  We have shown near quantitative conversion of the JP10 in times less than 30 ms and our calculations have shown the influence of different design parameters and how they can be changed in order to increase the rate of reaction through improved mixing and heating.  In Phase II we intend to use the data and modeling generated in Phase I to dramatically improve the time scale of reaction by improving the mixing and directionality of the dispersing fuel cloud, and also study the effects of the flow along the missile body.  The ultimate goal is to convert all the fuel remaining in the tank to products of combustion either through a detonative event or high rate oxidation.  We will also investigate the effects of various catalysts to further enhance reactivity.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In modern battlefields, Electronic Warfare (EW) plays dominating role. To win the battlefield, it is a must to win EW first.  In fighting the EW, it is vital to possess the most advanced radio frequency-selective shielding technologies to effectively protect electronic equipment, electronic communications and data storage systems on which the C4I system is established, while the microwave bands of data communications, which are the life-support lines in battlefields, must be kept opened only for friends with absolutely no interrupt anytime. IPITEK proposes to develop a DNA-based, all-dielectric, pattern-less, multilayer-periodic structures (MPS) for frequency selective shielding. The MPS consist of only a pair of two films, with slightly different permittivity and permeability, which is periodically overlapped each other forming a multilayer structure.  The proposed MPS feature multiple, very narrow pass-bands, allowing users quickly switch transmission frequency from one to another, while blocking any unwanted frequencies.   Phase I work will prove the feasibility of the proposed MPS for selective frequency shielding by refining modeling, selecting materials, testing dielectric properties of selected materials, fabricating demo samples and preliminarily measuring the RF shielding efficiencies  of the samples. This Phase II project will produce prototypes of proposed MPS for evaluations, tests, validations, and verifications by the US AirFoce.  BENEFIT:  The novel DNA-based MPS could significantly impact capability for anti-Electronic Warfare defense, as well as numerous commercial needs for EMI-suppression in broadband and high-speed electronics industries.  The military and civilian applications include high power antennas, radomes, filters, polarizers, stealth techniques, diplexers, dichroic sub-reflectors and reflection array lenses, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), radar cross section (RCS) argumentations and EM interference (EMI) protections, and etc.  It could have a huge potential market impact.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:\nComposite materials often represent the most weight efficient and lowest cost solutions for airframe structures.  Many of these structures are in areas that are susceptible to incidental impact damage and require adequate residual strength after impact for specified periods of service.  Current design methodologies require designers to predict the residual response of full-scale composite structures based on costly and time consuming small-scale tests. Methods for translating the response of standard damage tolerance characterization tests to reliable predictions of the damage tolerance of full-scale composite structures have not been demonstrated. Under this program, Materials Sciences Corporation (MSC) and The Boeing Corporation will collaborate to demonstrate the feasibility of using progressive damage models developed at MSC to predict the impact and residual strength response of full-scale multi-bay composite airframe structures.  Data generated under the Phase II program will be used to mature the unified test and modeling methodologies established during the prior effort by MSC, leading to the publication of a new proposed damage tolerance test standard. This standardization effort will be led by Dr. Dan Adams of Alveus Engineering, acting as subcontractor to MSC. Dr. Dan Adams and MSC will brief the ASTM D30 committee and the Federal Aviation Administration over the course of the program to obtain feedback on the implementation of the standard, and make improvements accordingly. This proposed standard will be validated via round-robin testing at MSC and the Boeing Company.\nBENEFIT:\nMaterials Sciences Corporation expects that this SBIR program will yield a methodology for simulating the damage tolerance responses of composite structures that has been validated through comparison with experimental data.  This validated methodology will enable a reduction in time and funding resources required to demonstrate that damage tolerance requirements have been met for military and commercial aircraft components.",

Modern video processing and networking techniques will be utilized such that any display in the system can be connected to any image generator in the system during runtime. This type of separation will allow for specific image generator tasks to be offloaded from specific rendering channels as desired to create higher fidelity simulations. Source data necessary for the image generators will not be limited to just the image generator computer, but rather a centralized location. These steps above will make it possible to reconfigure any image generator channel to any display very quickly during runtime if there should be a hardware failure. In an era where simulators are used more than ever, tremendous cost savings can be realized by virtually eliminating simulator downtime due to image generator failures.",

Sending teams to the right area saves lives, resources, and time. New research into geographic models of subject behavior, detectability (effective sweep width), and search speed will for the first time provide planners with good estimates of search effectiveness (Probability of Success Rate). Using that information, an initial response tasking algorithm will map exactly where search teams should be tasked. Color coding will also show the relative priority of tasks. This will allow the power of formal search theory to be placed into the hands of initial responders with little to no formal training. The PI brings over 30 years of SAR field experience and over 20 years of SAR research experience to the problem including the creation of ISRID.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Advanced electrical loads, such as 270Vdc flight actuators, on high performance military aircraft are of special interest due to the near instantaneous demand and regenerative transients placed on the power system, including the generation components.  Recent research has focused on designing/fabricating electrical accumulator units (EAU) to offload the transient loads from the generator to energy storage devices.  Previous work has focused on EAU techniques which strive to off-load as much as 100% of the transients from the generator system.  This Phase II effort investigates a special class of EAU where frequency domain (FD) control techniques are used to manage transient power/energy between the generator and the FDEAU energy storage device (Li-ion battery).  Phase I simulations have shown that it is possible to design an FDEAU where the high frequency components of the transients are supplied by the FDEAU while the generator system supplies the low frequency components.  A scalable FDEAU will be built and tested with emulated battery, generator and loads.  Work will also include design of a full scale aircraft FDEAU including packaging concepts.  BENEFIT:  Military applications of the technology include advanced manned and unmanned aircraft.  As commercial aircraft (general aviation to large civil aircraft) adopt direct current electrical power systems, electrical accumulator units with frequency domain control will likely find applications.  As the world continues to \"electrify\" motion control, whether in robotic processing operations or motion control for transportation, EAU concepts will be applied to conserve energy and smooth energy demand.",

Many of these systems involve gathering data from distributed sources to support mission objectives. This necessitates an inter-spacecraft communications architecture sufficient to pass data and commands across the system elements, as well as capability to process or operate on remote data. A significant simplification of this framework is achieved by enabling remote and/or collective data operations in a diverse multi-spacecraft system through an innovative, common software application set. The crux of this SBIR innovation is the common software application set that supports a diverse array of space vehicles and vehicle payloads. This software innovation facilitates disaggregation through data and computational resource sharing across disparate vehicles, enabling cluster/formation flight of spacecraft with vastly different capabilities and sizes. It creates a new mission class through the use of minimally-capable sensorcraft, a new, low-cost mission class that exploits computational resources from larger cluster spacecraft. This virtual connection with the larger spacecraft in the cluster allows the sensorcraft to be much more capable with lower size weight and power.",

        "abstract": "Although global pose is essential for success in certain vehicle missions and tasks, when GPS is denied there is no single technology (source) that can robustly estimate global pose without suffering from one or more failure modes. We propose to design an architecture that provides robustness by integrating automated celestial navigation, registering on-board sensor data to a map (map registration) or to sensor data from a previous traverse (route registration or place recognition), wheel odometry, measuring vehicle motion from camera data (visual odometry) or range data (range odometry), and inertial measurements of acceleration and angular rates (IMU) to compensate for all possible failure modes. The architecture will provide a direct alternative to GPS over the widest range of conditions possible. The architecture will be built around Carnegie Robotics LLCs (CRLs) SmoothPose product. The proposed system supports autonomous on- and off-road driving, under tree canopy, amongst tall buildings, in deep ravines, on slippery surfaces, in cluttered and open terrainall with GPS signals denied.",

By using 100s of JADE based intelligent agents in Phase I, we successfully monitored AOIs, identified extended AOIs through link analysis, and detected incursions into restricted areas. In Phase II, we will extend the multi-agent system by designing, implementing, testing, and demonstrating a multi-agent autonomous sensing and deciding framework, including the development of knowledge bases, detecting anomalies between a real-time scene and the knowledge bases, mining the knowledge bases for new patterns and relationships, monitoring AOIs specified by the analyst, performing link analysis, and providing automated machine learning and ranking of anomalies within the multi-agent framework. Based on traffic pattern and pattern-of-life analysis, we derive knowledge bases and apply sound statistical analysis to detect changes between the current real-time scene and the derived knowledge bases.

        "abstract": "Accurate, rapid interpretation of sensor data is critical to modern anti-submarine warfare (ASW). The Navy's push towards integrated multi-platform, multi-sensor ASW operations has the potential to significantly increase situational awareness; however, due to expected shortages in sensor operator staffing, this improvement will most likely be coupled with an increase in individual sensor operator workload, an issue that could easily lead to cognitive overload and an undermining of the tactical decision-making process.  To address this problem, Stottler Henke proposes the Extensible Platform for Automated Tactical Sensor Screening (ExPATSS) to provide real-time, automated analysis for multiple simultaneous sensor video streams. ExPATTS will process incoming data to discriminate, identify, and track events of interest, directing the sensor operator's attention to the most salient. Identification will be carried out by a flexible collection of recognition modules built on cutting-edge computer vision algorithms, allowing the set of event types to be customized on a per-mission basis. ExPATSS will ship with a set of recognition modules validated by ASW sensor operator SMEs but will also be trainable for new contact types to improve long-term efficacy. The Phase II system is designed from the ground up for integration in with existing CV-TSC installations.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  For the next generation of wide field-of-view (FOV) helmet-mounted displays (HMDs) and virtual simulators that satisfy the 20/20 visual acuity requirement, a microdisplay and drive circuitry subsystem solution with commensurate resolution is needed. To address this need, a compact control board system with 2 outputs of 1080p resolution was successfully developed and utilized in Phase I to drive two quadrants of a 3840x2160 (4K UHD) image area within Silicon Micro Displays 4096x2240 microdisplay with 4.5um pixel pitch. At the end of the Phase I effort, a 4K UHD resolution Color-Ultrahigh-Definition-Micro Display (4K CUDM) subsystem prototype goggle consisting of a pair of 4K UHD resolution Liquid-Crystal-on-Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays each driven by a pair of the developed driver board, operating at 240 Hz field-sequential-color (FSC) mode set was delivered to the Air Force. The Phase I results will be extended in Phase II towards realizing a single driver board-based 3-D CUDM system with flexibility built in for motion sensor and symbology overlay input upgrades. The scalability of the resulting CUDM and driver board architecture will land itself readily to the next generation jump in CUDM technology toward 7860x4320 (8K UHD) resolution.  BENEFIT:  The goal of Phase II is to exit with a 4K CUDM Subsystem that is limited-production-ready (LP-ready) and ready for full system integration and product development. LP-readiness means that the 4K CUDM Subsystem is sufficiently developed, characterized, and reliable for a limited volume pre-production run to support third-party integration for system development. Additionally, our objective is to have a robust, manufacturable, and cost-effective 4K CUDM Subsystem that can be in volume production within 6 to 12 after Phase II.    The market opportunities for the 4K CUDM Subsystem include disparate applications in the military, profession/commercial, medical, and consumer gaming markets. The military marketAir Force in particularrepresents the greatest market opportunity because:   Applications are well-defined, understood, and mature   High resolution (4K UHD and beyond) and large FOV requirements are established   Application areas are numerous and diverse, representing the largest potential volume.    Therefore, the Air Force is our key end-customer for use in applications like the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS). Other military applications include HMD systems for pilots (all aircraft), tankers, and dismounted combatants in both tactical and training simulators.    Professional/commercial applications include simulation training for Homeland Security, police force, and 3D CAD engineering applications. Medical applications include devices for ophthalmic disease diagnosis and therapy, surgical simulation trainers, and remote robotic surgical visualization systems. The consumer video game market holds promise, but the economics will follow in the wake of military and professional system implementations.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Currently tactical Head up Displays (HUD) are expensive both in cost of acquisition and Life Cycle Cost terms. In addition, retrofit of a more capable HUD into an existing airframe is complex and the bulk of the HUD competes with other display systems for valuable cockpit volume. The objective of this program is to verify the practicability of a new approach to the HUD architecture that will show significant improvements in all areas of performance when compared to legacy systems. In addition, the new HUD concept will include design features, including increased modularity, which will permit easy retrofit into existing airframes and will offer a significant reduction in Life Cycle cost, both by reducing cost of acquisition and by increasing reliability.    An update of the technology state of the art baseline developed in Phase I and a refinement of the architecture developed during the Phase I program will support development of a production representative HUD design and the establishment of a set of Key Performance Parameters (KPP). A prototype HUD will be fabricated and tested against the KPPs to verify the RTHUD concept.    BENEFIT:  Large numbers of current tactical aircraft and tactical trainers are fitted with legacy HUDs which are of limited performance and are or are becoming difficult to maintain due to their aging and obsolescent technology. Many of these airframes are candidates for cockpits upgrades to include panoramic displays which compete for space with a conventionally configured HUD. Further, the aircraft structure under the coaming/glare shield can required costly changes to accommodate a new HUD unless the HUD is physically small and/or custom designed to fit. The development of new technology, modular and low profile HUD design has the potential to mitigate the installation problem and be compatible with the introduction of panoramic Head down Display technology. The concept will allow a common design or small family of modular variations to address multiple airframes.      Cost of ownership will be reduced via the introduction of more capable, lower power technology to improve both functionality and reliability and the amortization of common design and qualification costs over multiple programs. Further savings will accrue as a result of the reduced cost of aircraft modification during the retrofit process.",

        "abstract": "The proposed project provides a demonstration of the ability to retrieve refractivity profile information from ungroomed radio signals of opportunity, also known as refractivity from radios or RFR, in an operationally relevant environment using operational radio receiver systems. The overall concept of RFR as originally developed was to monitor friendly, ungroomed tactical radio links and continuously provide estimates of vertical profiles of refractivity that define radio frequency (RF) ducting conditions that impact RF sensors and communication systems. The specific software application which executes the RFR technique is called Radio Inversion. The output of the software application is a current estimate of the local modified refractivity profile, provided in a format that is suitable to be used in propagation prediction tools such as AREPS. The goal of this project is to further build on the validation process by increasing the breadth and number of signals-of-opportunity over which the RFR concept is validated, and to present validation results that demonstrate its value in operationally relevant conditions. A wider mix of cooperative and non-cooperative signals will be used. Data collection geometries will include both over water and over land transmission paths. Results will show the value of RFR to support critical tasks such as the placement of assets to provide more complete monitoring of emitters in support of C4I operational goals. Proper placement of surveillance assets can ensure more complete coverage for the surveillance function, can reduce the probability of detection for friendly assets, and can even lead to improved geolocation accuracy for hostile emitters.  In the end, this project is designed to confirm that offshore sensors can be used to monitor a combination of cooperative and non-cooperative emitters, use this information to more accurately assess local ducting conditions, more accurately evaluate RF signal propagation, and more effectively place sensors to support surveillance operations while minimizing counterdetection.",

Examples of critical applications of interest to the AF include that require improved thermal management include modern aircraft, directed energy systems, and satellites. TIMs aim to ensure a continuous thermal conductivity path between the heat source and heat sink/dissipater, thus permitting the efficient operation of electronics. The major impediment to achieving reliable TIMs is high thermal interfacial resistance, which increases over time due to introduction of air pockets and the loss of contact between the meshing surfaces under thermal cycling. To address this need, ADA Technologies, Inc. proposes a novel approach to synthesize high-performance TIM pads based on reduction of interfacial thermal resistance via electronic conduction. ADAs proposed TIM aims to realize significant improvements of the current state-of-the-art in thermal performance, reliability and install/rework.  BENEFIT:  Anticipated Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research and Development (No proprietary info): ADA has designed our efforts to realize high-performance TIM pads offering significant improvements over the current state-of-the-art. If successful, ADAs technology will permit the development and usage of electronics that offer higher power and faster operating speeds by providing more efficient heat management. This will directly benefit capabilities in next generation AF efforts such as those anticipated in military aircraft, directed energy systems, satellites, and avionics. Furthermore, this technology will have direct benefits in many commercial electronics including personal electronics (e.g., laptops, cell phones, music players) and civilian aircraft, spacecraft, and other microelectronics.",

The single camera algorithm and concept of operations will be modified to account for wave slap, water droplets, fog, other visual obscurants. The technology will be modified to enable ranging convergence in the presence of 50% target visibility. The technology will support ranging using vertical mast motion and submarine forward velocity. The technology will support inclusion of previous ranging results to speed convergence and increase the accuracy of follow-on observations of a target.",

        "abstract": "Thermal Transfer is a critical part of power electronics application in both terrestrial and space environments.  Due to longer lifetime expectancies and harsh operational conditions, space vehicles require unique materials to deal with the increasing electrical and thermal loads placed upon the structure.  Increasing use of power electronics including high current carrying semiconductor devices such as IGBTs, MOSFETs, power transistors, and modules drive the need for specialty thermal management materials both in the packaging of the discrete devices as well as for the packaging of modules consisting of several or arrays of these devices. \n\nThe overall objective of this program (Phase II) is to adapt CarbAlTM-based advanced thermal management substrates from terrestrial to space applications.  ANI will target improved CarbAl\u0099-based heatsinks and thermally conductive circuit boards for power electronic applications.  CarbAl\u0099 is a carbon-based thermal composite with a thermal performance exceeding that of many metals.  The low CTE provides excellent matching to state-of-the-art power transistor dies and the low density and robustness make it suitable for space vehicle applications.   The proposed Phase I program is a continuation of the materials development completed internally at ANI.  If successful, the technology developed through this project will provide and accurate, robust, reliable and cost effective.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: Children who do not learn foundational mathematical concepts during elementary school generally get further behind in math as their math deficiencies compound over time. Through a prior IES SBIR Fast-Track award, the project team developed a series of supplemental math games designed to provide elementary students with engaging, adaptive, and personalized or team-based learning opportunities. The current project will develop a digital dashboard to strengthen teacher\u2019s ability to integrate these games within their instructional practice, and a full 3rd grade mathematics curriculum.\n\nProject Activities: To begin the project, researchers will create wireframes of a digital dashboard to support teachers in integrating math games within instructional practice. In addition, the researchers will script instructional content, interactive exercises, graphics and video elements, and scoring algorithms for measuring progress. These components will then be integrated within the overall system. The project includes 42 weeks of iterative testing with two teachers where feedback will drive refinements of prototypes. Once development is complete, the researchers will assess the usability and feasibility, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the product to improve student outcomes. To do so, the team will conduct a three-month long pilot study including 20 grade 3 teachers. Students will complete a pre- and post-test on measures assessing knowledge and understanding math outcomes aligned to common core math standards. Qualitative data will also be collected from teachers via questionnaires.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: Students who fail to achieve proficient levels of literacy are at increased risk for grade retention, referral to special education, and dropping out of high school. The kindergarten through 3rd grade years are particularly important for students to gain a strong foundation in reading as those who continue to struggle with reading are significantly less likely to achieve reading proficiency. The Assessment-to-instruction, or A2i, is an existing technology tool that supports individualized literacy instruction by interpreting reading assessment results to plan and implement individualized instruction. Developed and tested with prior IES funding, researchers find that K-3rd grade children in A2i classrooms showed significantly greater gains compared to control classrooms. However, feedback from practitioners demonstrates that A2i implementation often requires substantial amounts of researcher support and local district adaptation, and that the cost of A2i is not sustainable for most school district budgets. This project will develop a technology platform to enable a high-capacity, cost-efficient, scalable version of A2i so that it can be easily used by teachers and educational leaders in a wide variety of settings.\n\nProject Activities: The project team will redesign the current version of A2i using the Software-as-a-Service model deployment, allowing frequent updates and optimizations while reducing the cost of entry and maintenance. Redevelopment will focus on optimization of the data modeling logic and database structure to provide a more logical relationship between objects. Using modern development standards, concepts such as schools, districts, grades, classrooms, and students will be implemented as discrete data objects, which are interrelated through the database structure. The researchers will create professional development modules to support efficient and effective implementation. These components will then be integrated within the overall system. Iterative refinements will be conducted at major production milestones until the product is fully functional. Once development is complete, the researchers will assess the usability and feasibility, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the product to improve student outcomes in 25 kindergarten to grade 3 classrooms. The A2i program will be implemented over the school year and will track pre-post student reading outcomes on school selected achievement measures, including 3rd grade state Common Core reading assessments.\n\n",

The technical objectives specific to Phase II effort are twofold: (1) Analytically design the four Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research (SUGAR) wind-tunnel models that employ Distributed Multiple Control Surfaces (DMCS) and Variable Camber Continuous Trailing Edge Flap (VCCTEF) to achieve the weight and drag benefits, and (2) Fabrication of one of these four designed models to validate the AAW-process experimentally by a future wind tunnel testing. As per the first specific objective, four wind tunnel models will be designed for high speed Transonic Dynamic Tunnel (TDT) testing along with their detailed fabrication and wind tunnel testing plans. These four models are carefully chosen to incrementally demonstrate the benefits of applying AAW technology and aeroelastic tailoring technique by potential future fabrication and wind tunnel tests. As per the second specific objective, the fabricated wind tunnel model will be delivered to NASA along with its target performance improvement predicted by AAW-process for validation with a near-term wind tunnel testing. In order to ensure the safety of the wind tunnel models during the TDT testing, flutter suppression and gust load alleviation controllers will be designed for those models that are not aeroelastically tailored and have analytically displayed potential flutter instability problems.",

New enhancements to the Air Forces PCPAD intelligence cycle are, thus, critical to providing the analyst with the ability to strategically process, exploit and analyze the most critical information. Aptimas SCAAN system seeks to enhance PCPAD by distributing data exploitation and analysis tasks across a network of semi-autonomous agents (i.e., processing software resources) efficiently managed by a command, control, and communication (C3) software organization. SCAAN ensures robustness of distributed data analysis by balancing agent workload and building resilience to failures. SCAAN supports accuracy and optimality of large-scale data analysis by efficiently partitioning a global search problem into distributed interdependent tasks across multiple agents. SCAAN also provides agents with autonomy for learning patterns in a distributed fashion, and reduces the time of analysis by implementing algorithms that minimize processing of irrelevant data and communication requirements. Additionally, SCAAN operates in a hybrid infrastructure, leveraging service-oriented and cloud-enabled frameworks to support processing of large-scale data in accessible and denied environments. In summary, SCAAN is a processing, exploitation and analysis tool to assist analysts in efficiently and accurately extracting critical information from large-scale, distributed, multi-modal, multi-source data.",

The proposed Phase II project will test two potential solutions (KeraStat and Halogel) to determine their efficacy in reducing time to wound closure and decreasing scarring in a porcine burn healing and scarring model.  Following this in vivo efficacy testing, we will further expand to test the efficacy of KeraStat for reducing time to wound closure and for scar prevention in an investigator-initiated 60 patient human clinical trial in partial thickness burn patients.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Electrically driven technologies are replacing hydraulic, pneumatic and mechanical systems in new military aircraft designs to improve capability, reliability and maintainability.  This transition requires high performance electronic components capable of operating over a wide temperature range.  Capacitors, which provide necessary power conditioning, have been identified as a limiting component for these architectures.  New dielectric materials and capacitor designs are needed to provide high specific capacitance and operation at high temperature.    TPL completed a successful Phase II program to address this need and demonstrated fundamental proof-of-feasibility for a capacitor design using a novel dielectric film technology.  A high dielectric constant capacitor film based on fluorinone polyester (FPE) polymer modified with titanate nanopowder was developed.  Thermal and electrical performance characteristics of sub-scale FPE nanocomposite capacitors and packaging materials support a significant advance in high temperature operating capabilities.      The proposed Phase II will focus on maturing the capacitor technology and transitioning from the laboratory scale demonstration to commercially produced devices for the Air Force&quot;s high temperature inverter-converter controller.  The final product of this transition will include production ready material, processes, designs, and manufacturing capabilities for a state-of-the-art capacitor capable of operating from -55 to 250\u00b0C with an energy density&gt;1.0\u00b5F/cc.    BENEFIT:  The success of this development program will enable the miniaturization of electrically driven technologies for future aircraft weapons platforms.  Similar benefits can also be realized in commercial hybrid electric vehicle applications, where reduction in size and increased efficiency will offer lower fuel consumption and lighter total weight in vehicles.  An additional application for high temperature, compact filter capacitors will be in the utility industry for high power converters, where operating temperature and size are also key concerns.    Commercial vehicles are expected to experience the most significant impact overall.  The sales of light-duty hybrid electric vehicles are projected to advance to more than 2,000,000 in 2016.  In addition, heavy-duty bus and truck fleets are systematically being upgraded to hybrid electric drives.  Each of these commercial hybrid units will benefit from higher performance capacitors.",

        "abstract": "Chemical, biological, or toxin attacks in military and civilian settings are a serious and growing concern.  Standard first aid for exposure to some chemical warfare agents and toxins includes the immediate administration of relevant antidotes using an autoinjector.  When an attack occurs, pre-filled autoinjectors must be immediately available and thus highly portable, and they must be suitable for use by nonmedical personnel.  Similarly, rapid distribution and administration of targeted vaccines is critical during biological attacks.  Storage of drug formulations as separate components within the injector (e.g., a dry medication and a diluent) can significantly extend the shelf life of many medications.  Creare proposes to develop a novel miniaturized autoinjector that automatically mixes two or more pre filled components immediately prior to injection.  The drug storage and reconstitution method uses Creare&quot;s recently patented technology for disposable, pre-filled drug cartridges and is applicable to single-component, dry/wet, liquid/liquid, and multicomponent combinations.  In Phase I, we developed feasible autoinjector designs and demonstrated key autoinjector functions.  In this Phase II project, we will optimize autoinjector platform designs, manufacture prototype devices, and test the prototypes to demonstrate functionality, reliability, and overall suitability for military and civilian use.  We will also begin preparing for FDA product approval.",

        "abstract": "Countering the threat of intoxication by organophosphorus nerve agents is an important mission for homeland security. Currently, the most promising strategy is to bioscavenge the agents using injectable plasma-derived butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) that has low substrate specificity and may offer a broad spectrum protection against OP agents. Human plasma-derived BuChE at 400mg IV dose is prophylactically effective achieving good protection for 10 days. However the current unmet need is a single non-IV administration capability to deliver BuChE and sustain the plasma concentration at 80-200 g/mL for up to 60 days. Luna is developing an intramuscularly injectable physiological depot engineered to release BuChE at specific rates. The Phase I results demonstrated the feasibility of the technology by both experimental data and PK modeling. The microhydrogel depot continuously released BuChE for periods up to 60 days and PK simulation data showed that the depot formulations were able to provide BuChE plasma concentrations above the protective threshold level (2xLD50) for&gt;50 days. In the Phase II period, the depot technology will be optimized and extensively assessed in proper animal models for pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety performance. Luna will also work with JPEO-CBD to define a product development strategy and a clinical regulatory pathway.",

        "abstract": "As IEDs increase in complexity and explosive strength, the Army needs a better way to do IED remediation and road repair to enable our convoys to bring troops and supplies to the battlefield.  A primary method of dealing with IEDs in roadbeds is to use a bulldozer to remove (and detonate) the IED and then bring in an excavator to refill the roadbed so that convoys may resume.  A heavy duty bulldozer is a formidable tool in removing IEDs; however the cab of the bulldozer is unprotected.  By using armor and armored windows the occupant is better protected, but it is harder to see the roadbed and maintain situational awareness.  In addition, the bulldozer driver is still vulnerable.  Full armor plating of the cab is possible, but this leaves the operator with almost no useful view of the real world.    SA Photonics has developed a high resolution, high performance head steered vision system that uses cameras placed on the host vehicle and a high resolution head mounted display.

This novel design enables the M3I system to simultaneously inspect critical composite materials and structures, and to measure the structural defects (e.g., inclusions, voids, and disbonds), material layer thickness for manufacturing verification, and two dimensional layer-by-layer radio frequency (RF) dielectric properties in the S-X bands (2-12 GHz) safely and effectively.  In Phase II, POC plans to develop and test a portable M3I prototype in the field.  POC plans to refine the overall M3I system design based on the Phase I results, lessons learned, and the requirements of the initially targeted applications.  The Phase I system will be optimized and improved through design, modeling and simulation, and laboratory testing to prepare a final design for prototype fabrication.

Therefore, testing vehicles in convoys travelling in operationally realistic environments serves a critical role in enhancing US military capability. Proper convoy formation is paramount to safety and test execution. However, drivers have difficulty maintaining required vehicle-to-vehicle spacing when visibility is poor due to dust, heavy precipitation, or low lighting. Improperly spaced convoys may increase costs by requiring repeated tests or lead to a safety incident. The IS4S team proposes a GPS-based driver assistance system that clearly and concisely communicates accurate vehicle spacing information to drivers of a vehicle convoy. A GPS-based solution will perform in zero-visibility and in all weather environments, as well as provide vehicle spacing information when line-of-sight is obscured by terrain or vehicle maneuvering.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Aviation near volcanic plumes is dangerous because aircraft engines can be damaged if they ingest airborne ash and aerosols.  Knowing the forecast location of an ash plume will improve aviation safety while reducing engine maintenance costs.    Ash forecast models are immature.  To improve their accuracy we have conducted research with volcanologists at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) resulting in a doubling of forecast accuracy.  This Phase 2 proposal will continue the forecast-model development.      A leap in forecast accuracy will be possible when we are able to measure the size and concentration of the ash at its eruption source.  We are partnering with Polartronix, also located in Fairbanks, who has designed a sensor that can be flown on unmanned aerial systems into a volcanic plume.  This sensor will be tested using unmanned aircraft operated by UAF.  Data from these sensors are expected to again double forecast accuracy.    We have nascent technology to reduce aviation risk, help jet engine manufacturers understand issues of engine maintenance, and a tool to mitigate the economic impact of volcanic eruptions on global commerce.  We intend to commercialize the technology.    BENEFIT:  Our development work includes technology that can be used to reduce aviation risk, help jet engine manufacturers understand issues of engine maintenance, and a tool to mitigate the economic impact of volcanic eruptions on global commerce.    The market for the services is global and includes various government agencies like the US Air Force, USGS, NOAA, FAA as well as manufacturers of aircraft and jet engines.  The same technology also has applications with pollution monitoring from point and non-point sources as well at forecasting fallout from a dirty bomb.",

While cable systems employing high-temperature superconductors (HTS) have the potential to meet this need, further development work is required to improve the performance and increase the technology readiness level of key system components. The proposed work focuses on the cryostats used to encase the cryogenic HTS cables used in a shipboard HTS degaussing system. Currently, HTS cryostats are made in the factory at predetermined lengths and cannot be modified during installation. This can be problematic during shipyard installation because it is difficult to precisely determine the required length, and cryostats often need to be rerouted relative to initial installation plans. Creare developed a modularized HTS cryostat that will provide the much needed flexibility to tailor the cryostat length and apply end connections at the time of installation. In Phase I we completed a proof-of-concept demonstration of our Field Serviceable Cryostat (FSC) approach for superconducting degaussing and power cables.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Fires initiating in engine nacelles and dry bays are the most common causes of loss of aircraft. However, since the Montreal Protocol restricting the production of Halons, a replacement has not yet been accepted by the aircraft survivability community despite numerous testing programs. The costs and limitations of designing new systems based primarily on live fire testing can be mitigated by modeling. In this Phase II project, ADA Technologies is partnering with Fire Science NM and SURVICE Engineering to develop, validate and implement a fast-running, physics-based, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code for mapping the concentration of clean agent fire suppressants in obstructed environments such as dry bays. At the core of the simplified approach is the focus on the low-Mach number equations, describing phenomenon happening in the subsonic regime, such as the dispersion of fire suppressant. The Phase I preliminary model demonstrated the required speed and accuracy. In Phase II, the code will be further streamlined and thoroughly validated against full-scale test data. Finally, the code will be converted to a module and integrated into the FPM (Fire Prediction Model) platform for use by the DoD survivability community.  BENEFIT:  A fast-running CFD code modeling the dispersion of Halon replacements, also known as clean agents, would allow optimization of new fire suppression designs by minimizing the amount of suppressant to be carried on-board an aircraft while ensuring satisfactory extinguishment performance. Limiting weight is always a primary concern in aircraft applications. Finding an effective and environmentally friendly replacement for Halon 1301 for dry bay and engine nacelles would be greatly aided by such a validated CFD code. This code would be applicable to a variety of fire suppression applications looking for optimized Halon replacement systems. DOD markets include a variety of new and retrofit applications linked under the joint aircraft survivability program. Beyond military aircraft, commercial aircraft is another natural fit for the code, as airframers are facing the same issue for engine nacelle and APU protection. Finally, weight and cost optimization of fire suppression systems of other, non-aerospace obstructed volumes is another commercialization opportunity. For examples, light armored vehicles in the DOD market and server rooms in the commercial sector represent promising business prospects for the future code.",

Gas-lubricated foil bearings offer a potentially attractive alternative, but despite their very successful commercial application to aircraft air cycle machines, they have not been widely used in gas turbine systems due to limitations with high-temperature operation, cost, and a variety of other issues. The objective of the proposed project is to develop a new hybrid foil bearing concept that has the potential to address the key issues inhibiting broad application of foil bearings to small gas turbines. In Phase I, we worked with a small turbine engine manufacturer to define the ideal requirements for such a bearing, developed a design, fabricated a prototype, and tested it in an existing room-temperature test rig.

The automation must handle very dense maritime surface picture conditions that can exceed 1,000+ surface contacts that quickly become overwhelming for operators to adjudicate. A promising strategy to adjudicate the surface contact picture automatically is to optimally allocate the resources of airborne sensor suites that are typically deployed on manned and unmanned airborne platforms conducting ship self-defense and maritime surveillance operations. Early detection and classification of potential threats is possible using high range resolution and tracking radar. Additional classification is possible by combining EO/IR interrogation, and association with stored data and available off-board information. It is envisioned that a sensor suite resource manager (RM) would be employed to automatically construct the surface picture with the use of classification aids that leverage the merging of information from organic and inorganic sources. It is also desirable that the RM is capable of dynamically tasking the platform via flight profile changes in response to the evolving surface picture, taking into account mission profiles, OPSITs/TACSITs, platform kinematic capabilities, airspace restrictions, and threat profiles. In addition, the RM must have situational awareness of the local airspace traffic in order to conduct the mission effectively and maximize on-station time.",

        "abstract": "It is estimated that 20 percent of returning forces from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are afflicted with PTSD or major depression. In the last year alone, over 400,000 military veterans have been diagnosed with PTSD. Among troops still in the military, experts estimate that one in five has experienced acute stress, anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues as a result of war-zone deployment. Recent studies indicate that not all cases of PTSD, depression, and contemplations of suicide are identified using mental health assessments given to soldiers following deployment.   Building on its extensive pre-existing natural language processing and text analytics portfolio, Sentimetrix has developed the COPTADS (Clinical Online PTSD and TBI Analysis and Decision System) to automatically analyze the content of text documents for signals of PTSD or TBI. In Phase I, multiple scoring algorithms were developed trained and tested, demonstrating accuracy approaching that of human experts.  In Phase II, we plan to further improve the COPTADS system, significantly improving its accuracy and scalability.  Significant functionality enhancements will allow users (clinicians) to execute temporal queries and monitor trends of individual patients and patient groups, as well as observe their responses to various therapies.",

        "abstract": "The overall objective of this program is to develop a practical process for the production of large crystals of BaTiO3, PZT, or other commercially interesting material via solid phase consolidation of nanoscale powders. To accomplish this goal three key challenges were addressed: 1) a facile synthetic procedure for generating micron-scale seed crystals, 2) a process for patterning seed crystals with a high degree of control over their crystallographic orientation, and 3) a solid phase consolidation procedure that yields high quality crystals. Phase I of this project focused on the synthesis and patterning of seed crystals, with demonstration of patterning and consolidation of PZT on the order of several mm. In Phase II, new seed crystals of alternative materials (i.e. optical, thermoelectric, or ferroelectric crystals) will be made and patterned to demonstrate the general nature of this approach for growing large crystals. In addition, anisotropic seed crystals will be fabricated to yield higher quality seed crystal arrays. In both cases, the seed crystal arrays will be consolidated into single crystals with sizes >1mm. Methods for consolidation will be determined to yield high quality single crystalline materials that are of significant commercial interest.",

        "abstract": "State-of-the-art additive manufacturing technologies for metal parts have evolved primarily around powder metallurgy and fusion welding-based processes.  These processing methodologies yield parts with inferior mechanical and physical properties as compared to wrought metal of the same composition.  Additionally, the production rates for even the fastest processes are relatively low, the part envelopes are limited to a few cubic feet, and often the process must be conducted in an atmospherically controlled chamber.  Aeroprobe's additive friction stir (AFS) process is a novel high-speed, large-volume wrought metal additive manufacturing technology that will enable affordable, full-density, near net-shape component manufacturing from a wide range of alloys, including aerospace aluminum alloys, nickel-based super alloys, and metal matrix composites.  The ability to rapidly fabricate large-scale, complex wrought and functionally graded aluminum components from three-dimensional models will be an enabling manufacturing advancement in exploration launch vehicle fabrication, for parts such as those on the Orion Crew Module. A scaled representation of the window frame structure proposed for the Orion Crew Module was fabricated from 6061 Al using Aeroprobe's additive friction stir process during the Phase I program.  To move AFS up the TRL ladder to full-scale demonstration and deployment, two major technical objectives must be met: (1) develop process/structure/property relationships for AFS deposition of aluminum aerospace alloys, such as 2219, which can be used for process control and material property optimization; and (2) demonstrate net-shape, large-scale aluminum launch vehicle and aerospace components (including a functionally graded structure) with mechanical properties comparable to traditional wrought metals.",

        "abstract": "This project addresses very high power switches for accelerators used in high-energy physics research and particle research.   Existing devices have relatively slow switching times, compared to those required for the application.   The proposed program seeks to develop high-voltage, high-current devices with much faster switching times and reduced conduction losses, thereby reducing heat and improving reliability. Two approaches are utilized here.   The first is to develop switches operating at very low (cryogenic) temperatures, and the second is to apply proprietary switching topologies to this application. In  Phase I,  a cryogenic  drive  system  was  developed,  and  two  cryogenic  power  modules  were demonstrated  in  a  liquid  nitrogen  bath  switching  6000-volt,  240  ampere  (megawatt-level)  pulses. MTECH measured significant reductions in the switching times and on-state voltage of these devices. Phase  II has been extended  through  June 14, 2014.   In this work,  several  improved  half-bridge  (as opposed to single-switch) prototypes have been developed, and these are currently under test.  These prototypes are expandable to handle megawatt power levels at continuous operation.   MTECH believes these are the highest voltage levels achieved at cryogenic temperatures, and that this work represents a significant milestone. In the proposed Phase IIB program, MTECH will gather input from potential customers and end users in making the Phase II prototypes ready for commercialization  by developing packaging, instrumentation, and interfaces that are useful in various applications and fields of work.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Apart from accelerator applications, which could lead to major breakthroughs in the understanding of fundamental physical phenomena, the high-power switches developed in this program could find use in power distribution systems for existing or future power grids Examples include superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) systems and turboelectric aircraft propulsion systems (in which MTECH currently has active programs), as well as superconducting power transmission, superconducting wind turbines, and medical and military applications.",

A coupled continuum and discrete damage analysis will be developed for Abaqus to capture the entire failure sequence under monotonic and fatigue loading. To accurately capture the effect of fabrication induced initial defect and the mechanism driven bondline failure, a novel macro-micro bridging model will be developed to determine the cohesive model parameters. A unified cohesive interaction for crack initiation and propagation will be developed for the macro-level fatigue damage prediction with a local strain based delamination initiation criterion. The validated static and fatigue analysis toolkit will then be enhanced during the 2nd year program through its integration with a thermal and moisture diffusion model to study the environmental aging on the residual strength and life of a bonded composite structure.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Conventional rigid-panel solar arrays are deployed with complex mechanisms or dynamically-tuned and damped hinges, with cables or external linkages for synchronization. Altering the number or size of panels incurs significant new engineering, tooling, manufacturing and integration.  This SBIR develops the Modular Advanced Synchronization Technology (MAST) deployable array that uses multi-functional panels with internal linkages that synchronize hinges having integral distributed motive force for simple, passive deployment and lock-up.  The approach is fully modular and easily adaptable to different sizes of solar panels and because of the distributed deployment force, different numbers of panels per wing, reducing NRE and schedule. The development has emphasized maximum use of modified COTS parts for low cost, and high performance composites for low mass.  In Phase I, we designed, analyzed and built a 3-panel demonstration which verified the hinge and synchronization approach.  The Phase II builds upon these results, updating the panel-to-panel hinge design, developing the approach for a root panel hinge, hold-down and release interfaces, array deployable harness, and GSE.  We fabricate a five panel array with representative structural properties, test the stowed array in launch environment, and perform hot and cold vacuum deployments to increase to TRL 5, showing readiness for flight qualification.  BENEFIT:  The standardization and reduced complexity of the MAST deployable array approach improves cost and reliability, key issues in all space solar array deployment, by applying a known qualified technology to a variety of array sizes and configurations.  Because of its broad applicability, the approach could meet the requirements for higher performance and more cost-effective solar arrays in a variety of missions, from small spacecraft to very large ones.  Reliable high power arrays at low cost could enable new spacecraft applications, including commercial space radar and earth observation platforms. The basic technology can also find commercial applications in other space deployable structures such as larger deployable antennas for commercial communication satellites, or even deployable space habitats for commercial space tourism.",

Whereas other discrimination systems utilize features defined by subject matter experts (SMEs), our MFL algorithm learns important characteristics of a target through training with historical data.  In prior work, we have applied our MFL algorithm to single sensor returns of radar and Electro-Optical Infrared (EO/IR) data to perform discrimination.  In this work we will utilize the manifold structure within a high dimensional vector space to link the returns from multiple sensors in a novel and effective manner.  This manifold-mapping capability will allow us to perform joint discrimination and correlation between sensors that exploit different wavelength regimes and phenomenology.  This proposed capability is a game changing feature of our algorithm, in that this system could perform feature aided tracking without pre-defining what features are to be used.  The benefits of our algorithm would be twofold.  First the algorithm will still prove useful in situations where SME derived features are denied or unavailable.  Second, and possibly more importantly, the algorithm could be used on current or new sensors regardless of the phenomenology exploited.  Approved for Public Release 14-MDA-7739 (18 March 14).",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  There is a need to identify, qualify, and certify post-repair corrosion-inhibiting self-healing coatings in order to inhibit further corrosion on aluminum substrates. Many technologies have been developed in academia and industry to reliably identify visible and hidden corrosion on aluminum surfaces and components, restore lost coating material, or create a barrier to future corrosion. The research team at Luna Innovations Incorporated has developed a comprehensive system for the corrosion protection of aerospace components. Lunas self-healing and anti-corrosion additives can be applied in both solvent and water-borne primers and we have a strong relationship with established paint manufacturers to meet MIL-SPEC requirements. Lunas coating system is compatible with CPCs used in Air Force coating tech orders and it proven to be suitable for aerospace aluminum alloys. By working closely with an aircraft maintenance consulting group, Luna has been able to address potential issues as identified by Depot and Air Force customers, as well as validate that the coating materials and application methods for sustained corrosion protection on war-fighting systems will be user-friendly, portable, financially viable, and reliable  BENEFIT:  The total annual US cost estimates for corrosion related expenses are in excess of $300 billion, or 3.1% of the GDP.  Much of the costs are associated with the maintenance of metal materials; 20% of the estimated corrosion-related costs involve scraping and repainting steel structures.  A self healing coating will be beneficial to any industry sector that suffers from corrosion, such as infrastructure, transportation, utilities, and production and manufacturing.  A durable, thermally stable, autonomous self healing corrosion protection coating will increase serviceable lifetime, reduce costs and improve operational efficiencies. Chrome-free coating systems will also provide an environmentally conscious solution to corrosion.",

Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) requires the ability to navigate and interpret mounds of data to produce actionable decisions. Through the Urban Telepresence program, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is redefining a concept of operations for ISR operations by enabling remote, virtual operators to interact with operational environments without being physically present. However, redesigning this workflow requires advancements to human-machine interfaces. To support this need, the Aptima team is developing the Sensor Operations via Naturalistic Interactive Control (SONIC) platform. SONIC is a multimodal user interaction framework optimized for use within highly immersive and data-rich environments to provide an intuitive, naturalistic way for users to interact and collaborate with distributed sensors, unmanned systems, and teammates in the operational environment. SONIC integrates an immersive multimodal workstation with a context-driven interaction service, and is built on top of scientifically-grounded human-machine interface guidelines for hybrid reality environments. Ultimately, the objective of SONIC is to enable analysts and operators to provide mission support in real-time from remote locations more effectively, without an increase in workload or a decrease in performance.",

The tag integrates a new propellant health monitoring (PHM) sensor for nitrocellulose-based propellants developed in the Phase I effort and a passive wireless tag for monitoring the degradation of ordnance propellant.  The tiny sensor is a surrogate of the propellant itself and is made of inert propellant components and conductive fillers so that it changes resistance as the propellant components age.  Sensor resistance data obtained during accelerating aging allows correlation with propellant stabilizer depletion for selected propellants.  The wireless tag, containing the PHM sensor is bonded externally to ordnance devices so that it&quot;sees&quot;a similar environment as the propellant.  A wireless field reader queries the tag on the ordnance device and correlates sensor resistance with propellant aging data and displays remaining life of the propellant.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) operating on high altitude long endurance (HALE) operation can cause sections of the aircraft to experience temperatures as low as -100 F.  This is particularly damaging to the landing gear hydraulics and wheels.  Critical low-temp weak points within the landing gear are the elastomeric O-ring seals.  The simplest approach is to replace existing seals with new low-temperature elastomer seals in the same form factors.    During the course of the Phase I effort, the team formulated and cast prototypes of a new elastomer seal as a -214 size O-ring.  Glass transition temperature, thermal retraction (TR-10), low-temp tensile, fluid exposure to hydraulic fluids (MIL-PRF-87257, MIL-PRF-5606), and lab-scale hydraulic testing indicate the Luna O-ring performed well down to -100 F under static conditions and -70 F under dynamic conditions while exposed to hydraulic fluid.      During the proposed Phase II, the team will optimize the seal formulation, scale up production to large-scale, evaluate seals per relevant specifications, validate seal performance in system level testing, and continue to work towards commercialization of the technology.  Luna and team members will work closely with the part OEMs, platform OEMs, maintainers, and end users to replace the existing seals on form/fit/function levels.    BENEFIT:  The first product for this technology would be seals to be integrated into UAV platforms as drop-in replacements.  These seals would be cost effective and provide enhanced capabilities, specifically the capability to operate at HALE conditions with no leakage.  This would enhance the capabilities of the UAVs by removing limitations on HALE flights, as well as reducing the risk of damage during landing.  Testing will be performed to ensure that the seals meet the relevant ASTM, SAE, and MIL specifications.      Once established, this new seal technology could be used for multiple other platforms, both military and civilian.  Other markets include the larger aerospace market (other aircraft); space (missiles, rockets); oil drilling and pumping equipment; and specialty chemical processing equipment (low temperature, harsh conditions, etc.).",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Specialized aircraft coatings can degrade over time and impact desired performance. Current reflectometers measure at normal incidence to the surface which does not accurately predict the electrical performance of the material across the aircraft's surface.  It is desirable to measure the interaction of the non-specular component or traveling wave to fully characterize the electrical performance of the coatings. Under a Phase I SBIR effort Matrix Research designed a prototype RF traveling wave inspection tool that can be used to measure dB/in attenuation of coatings along the surface. After studying the phenomenology of traveling waves Matrix used a full wave electromagnetic simulator to design traveling wave transducers. These transducers were then used the prototype traveling wave inspection tool. This proposal describes the work Matrix will perform during a Phase II effort to further mature the traveling wave inspection tool. The main objective of the Phase II effort will be to create a more rugged, conformable, easier to operate prototype that could be used by technicians on the flight line to evaluate the performance of a vehicles surface coatings.  BENEFIT:  With the number of platforms in the United States arsenal that use specialized coatings expected to be well over a thousand, the maintenance community is going to require new tools to help guide their sustainment and repair decisions.  The traveling wave tool that is being developed in this effort will help to significantly improve maintenance efficiency by helping maintainers quickly identify problematic materials/aircraft regions. Being able accurately determine where there are material performance problems will also significantly reduce the number of unnecessary repairs.  As such, this tool can find wide acceptance throughout the community.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) operation represents a stressful, cognitively challenging domain where operators are routinely subjected to both occupational and combat stressors and performance failures can have catastrophic effects. Effective performance in such conditions has many dimensions, including technical proficiency, probability of catastrophic failures, mission productivity, resistance to stress symptomology, teamwork, and long-term work engagement. Effective selection methods for UAS operators should accurately, efficiently, and holistically predict these key outcomes. The focus of the proposed Phase II effort is to continue the development of a customized trilogy of adaptive assessment content, for which prototype versions were developed within Phase I. This includes components measuring executive level cognition, personality, and biographical history. These assessments are assembled within a novel content delivery and protection framework that incorporates adaptive content sequencing and generation algorithms, a configurable multistage architecture, and stealth scoring optimization. The format of the assessments ranges from computer administered questions to adaptive, simulation-based assessment content embedded within a realistic drone search and rescue game environment. The Phase II include comprehensive assessment content and software products for integration within existing military assessment frameworks, platform-specific systems for unmanned aviation, and private sector transition clients.",

One of the primary measurements often taken during science experiments is mass. This is even more relevant in biology, where mass is often one of the key measurements taken for analysis. During the Phase I effort, a ZGMMD prototype was developed, tested, and demonstrated the feasibility of a means to determine the mass of samples less than 1kg, without the use of earth's gravity. The ZGMMD's innovative way of determining the mass, of low mass objects, in microgravity environments has been shown to be feasible, and effective. The Phase I prototype has shown to be able to provide great mass measurement capabilities, exceeding the Phase I requirements, specifically in accuracy and precision.",

We are joined in this effort by Dr. Paul Scerri of the Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute. The goal of this SBIR program is to develop tools that will automatically [italics added] optimize multiple disparate platforms' performance, survivability and target area deconfliction in high threat environments. In Phase I, we made significant progress addressing the research issues underlying TOPDAT. On the primary research task of assessing the feasibility of applying the TREMOR/DIMS approach to the cooperative strike planning problem, we showed that it could be applied and good cooperative plans could be found in a reasonable amount of time. Overall, the Phase I effort made clear the important issues and put us into a better position to find good solutions in Phase II. For Phase II we propose to complete and extend TOPDAT functionality, including core algorithm updates and speed-ups, reengineer the system for compatibility with JMPS, and validate the TOPDAT technology as low-risk path to integration with JMPS for cooperative strike planning. Following are brief summaries of the key technical objectives.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The primary objective of this research effort is to develop a next-generation X-ray tomography and surface topography imaging system for four-dimensional (4-D) characterization of liquid mass distributions within dense fuel sprays.  This will be accomplished through high-speed 3-D imaging, providing information on both temporal and spatial variations of fuel mass distribution.  The overall technical objectives of the research program are to (1) resolve the three-dimensional (3-D) liquid breakup process in dense sprays using X-ray radiography with multiple lines of sight and discrete tomographic reconstruction, (2) capture two or more 3-D X-ray images at rates of 10 kHz or greater, (3) minimize uncertainties due to changes in X-ray energy distribution along the absorption path, (4) enable studies of practical fuels with high soot loading, high temperatures, and high pressures, and (5) capture breakup dynamics of liquid-core and liquid-sheet structures by mapping 3-D liquid-surface topologies at 10 kHz or greater using structured light imaging.  The proposed diagnostic systems will be optimized for image contrast over a wide range of optical densities to cover both gas-centered swirl coaxial and impinging-jet rocket sprays, which should also cover a wide range of applications in propulsion, including gas-turbine, augmentor, and scramjet combustion systems.      BENEFIT:  We anticipate that four-dimensional (4-D) X-ray tomography and surface mapping will provide new measurement capabilities for studying liquid-breakup dynamics in a variety of propulsion systems, including rockets, augmentors, gas turbines, and scramjets.  This will enable improved fundamental understanding and modeling of dense sprays, which is of significant practical and scientific interest.  The data provided by the proposed research program will enable propulsion engineers to design and optimize liquid rocket injectors to improve stability, performance, and maintainability.  The understanding developed from the proposed tomography system is critical for improving the speed and efficiency of the design process, ultimately helping to avoid and or solve problems associated combustion dynamics brought on by transient, non-uniform fuel-air mixture preparation. This measurement capability is applicable for military and commercial propulsion systems, as well as industrial furnaces and internal combustion engines, leading to significant commercial applications.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Physical Optics Corporation (POC) seeks to meet the need of an Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) deficiency by fielding a capable remote expendable reporting environmental sensor that will greatly enhance the AFSOC Special Operation Weather Teams (SOWTs) ability to provide timely, accurate and critical deep battlespace weather reconnaissance and intelligence.    SOCOM SBIR 10-006 provided $1.8M in funding to POC (Torrance, CA) and, as a result, enabled the development of a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) -6 weather sensor prototype, the Micro Weather Sensor (MWS), which meets or exceeds AFSOC remote sensor requirements.  As required by the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), software was also developed and implemented to ingest, compile, and disseminate MWS data.  Currently, the MWS provides a Meteorological Aviation Report (METAR) at 20, 60, or 180 minute intervals (user defined) and 360 daytime color imagery (on demand) that is fully integrated into the AFW-WEBS weather monitoring system.    Future MWS enhancements (beyond the initial STTP) include an integrated ceilometer onto the main platform, air-emplacement capability, winds aloft above the sensor measurement, chemical/toxic industrial contaminants and radiological detection/reporting, and acoustic signature detection capabilities.    BENEFIT:  The intended customers are Combatant Commanders (air & ground)/mission planners/mission tracking and post mission analysts, Air Force Weather Agency, [Navy] Fleet Numerical Meteorological Oceanographic Center (FNMOC), DoD service components, Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC), U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), and coalition partners (as required).      This effort will satisfy a combined U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) and Special Operations Command Central (SOCCENT) Joint Urgent Operational Need Statement (JUONS) CC-0272, AFSOC Deficiency 0355,  Automatically Collect & Transmit Weather Observations in Deep Battle Space, DEF0205, Combine Weather Data into Battlespace Awareness Depictions for Mission Planning, Rehearsal, and Operational C2 Systems, and an AFWA requirement for a remote weather observation sensor as outlined in Observing System 21 (ORD OS-21 I/II/III).  Additionally, it will help resolve HQ AFSOC Prioritized Gap List (FY15-34) PGL5  Situational Awareness and PGL36  Planning Integration, and Joint Special Operations Command, Special Operations Meteorological and Oceanographic Collection and Integration System (SOMCIS) Capability Development Document (CDD) (JSOC, 21 Mar 07).    The Micro Weather Sensor (MWS) is new technology that fills a longstanding remote sensing surface weather data collection gap.  A primary objective of a remote sensor is to collect weather information over large spatial, denied, and inaccessible areas and integrate the data with other information to aid decision-making.  Getting more data points on the atmosphere, more frequently and from more locations is the key to improving forecasts and warnings for mission planning and execution events. Therefore, remote sensors are invaluable to increasing the accuracy and timeliness of military support forecasts and warningsthe overriding goal of this effort.  A basic necessity, therefore, is that critical aviation weather parameters are measured when and where they are needed most:  flight ingress/egress routes and data sparse regions where military aviation assets are operating.  SOWT elements currently have two (2) systems in their inventory for tactical/field use, the Advanced Distributive Sensor Systems (ADSS) Weather POD and the Vaisala TMQ-53.  Both of these systems are bulky, heavy, and relatively expensive and neither fully satisfies SOWT remote sensing requirements (size, weight, low-detection profile).  The TMQ-53 is the AF standard tactical meteorological system weighing approximately 100 lbs (when packaged for transport) and costs approximately $250K per system.  The ADSS Weather POD consists of four separate equipment items with a combined weight of nearly 40 lbs and a cost of approximately $100K per system.  Additionally, the ADSS Weather POD program has been terminated, so replacing/maintaining current systems is no longer a viable option.  The MWS in its current Phase II configuration, by comparison, consists of 2 equipment items (basic sensor and a plug/play ceilometer) with a combined weight of ",

        "abstract": "The combustor liner is subject to the highest temperature and pressure in a gas turbine. Combustion produces gas with temperatures exceeding the melting point of the liner.  The components longevity is largely a factor of cooling. Multi-hole film cooling effuses gas from the high pressure stages of the compressor to the hot side of the liner where the gas forms an insulating film. Enhanced cooling allows higher combustion temperatures and improved turbine efficiency. Shaped film cooling holes improve film effectiveness. However, conventional manufacturing methods do not provide practical ways to create shaped film cooling holes. Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) is an additive process that is capable of producing complex geometry using a single method. DMLS sequentially spreads layers of powder metal and selectively melts regions defined by a 2D slice of a 3D CAD model. Theoretically any geometry can be built. Solid Concepts is one of the most technically advanced suppliers of Direct Digital Manufacturing (DDM) services.

Our EDLS-ISS system includes a separate base unit tethered to two low-profile sensors, which can be non-invasively mounted on the surface of the ARED to serve as new footplates.\n\nThe EDLS-ISS is being developed for two reasons:\n- Operational.  Force plates on the ARED will allow crewmembers to verify loading, and to record forces.  This device provides a simple, non-invasive solution that measures foot forces and displays this to the astronaut.\n- Research.  Kinematic experiments on the ARED \u0096 for example, characterizing limb segment relative motions during a squat \u0096 require corresponding force and moment measurements.  Our EDLS-ISS system provides three-axis force and three-axis moment measurements for such experiments.\nBy providing a short-term operational solution and a sustainable long-term research solution, ELDS-ISS is an important tool for the spaceflight community.\n\nDuring Phase I, we improved the design of the existing 6-DOF Microgravity Investigation of Crew Reactions in 0-G (MICR0-G) Adapt sensor module, previously developed by Aurora and MIT.  These improvements optimized the sensor for use on the ARED: decreasing the overall height of the sensors and separating the electronics into an off-board \"base unit\", increasing the footprint size to cover most of the surface of the ARED platform, updating the hard drive and electronics, providing a real-time user-feedback display, and developing ARED mounting options.  The anticipated result of our Phase II effort will be three complete EDLS-ISS systems, each of which includes a base unit and two sensor units.  Two systems will be flight-qualified.",

        "abstract": "Advanced laser diode technology developed using silicon MEMS packaging enables the construction of an efficient and compact line-narrowed diode stack combined with a Volume Brag Grading (VBG) to create a Diode Pumped Alkali Laser (DPAL).  A single laser diode bar, with 20pm spectral line-width, has demonstrated more than 30W of CW output power at 780nm pumping a rubidium vapor laser.  However, current methods used to assemble laser diode stacks prevent narrowing the spectral line-width below 0.05 nm due to pointing inaccuracy of the individual laser diode bars and thermal stability issues with a large VBG.  A new 3D silicon based laser diode technology enables all laser diode bars to be packaged in near perfect alignment to the VBG for narrowing down spectral line-width.  In addition, the lower thermal resistance of the silicon laser diode package improves electrical-to-optical efficiency and stabilizes both turn-on time of the DPAL system and wavelength drift.  The Silicon Macro-Channel (SMC) cooling technology will also be applied to the VBG element to stabilize wavelength drift and minimize any thermal gradient in order to maintain narrow line-width.  The SMC and silicon MEMS packaging implemented in the new laser diode technology and VBG cooling has demonstrated improved laser diode performance and spectral line-width narrowing due to the accurate micron-level assembly of the laser diode bar.  This technology will overcome the limitations of current diode approaches and prove the feasibly of a high performance and cost-effective pumping source for DPAL systems.

CL demonstrated that a cost-effective nondestructive non-invasive coating evaluation tool in real-time is highly feasible.  Tests with the CIMOSA prototypes showed that USAF paint samples with different levels of degradation can be discriminated between when compared to the normal sample. Phase I results, clearly identified a validation pathway and the strong commercial interest in the CIMOSA system offers us the confidence that continued Phase II technology improvements in all the CIMOSA subsystems will lead to a non-destructive and non-invasive aircraft paint coating integrity monitoring system and will meet the Air Forces requirements for an intuitive to use, portable device that requires no sample collection or use of any chemical assays. The entire system will be validated by bench-top aircraft paint samples of numerous paint layers with various autoclaved time ranges followed by aircraft measurements in a hanger at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

In order to facilitate the accelerated insertion of new composite materials, there is a need for an improved analysis methodology that allows designers to reduce the time and cost associated with material and structural development and test programs.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop, demonstrate, and validate a linked knowledge-base-type set of analysis tools that facilitate development of material design data for composite structures.  The composite analysis methodology will include important mechanical behaviors of the material in a form that can be used as a stand-alone engineering tool, or linked to a comprehensive set of analysis tools, that reside at major airframe and engine design organizations, for filling out and extending the property trends.  BENEFIT:  The product of this SBIR program will be a set of computational tools for quickly and reliably predicting the fundamental mechanical properties and strengths of fiber reinforced composite materials.  It is expected that accelerated insertion of materials will be facilitated through development of linked engineered material databases, which are capable of conducting quick virtual testing of laminates, i.e., supplemented by limited physical testing, rather than proceeding directly to complete experimental characterization.  This toolset is expected to include property correlation, trends, and factors.  Key tests required to characterize a new material system will be documented.  Development, validation, and commercialization of this tool-set for both military and commercial aircraft and engine systems are the ultimate goals of this program.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Aircraft engine and structural components are being produced from forgings with increasingly complex geometries in a wide range of aerospace alloys. The forging process involves a number of steps required to attain favorable material properties (e.g., heat treatment, rapid quench, cold work stress relieving, and artificial aging). These processing steps, however, also result in the introduction of residual stress. Excessive bulk residual stresses can have negative consequences including: part distortion during machining and/or during service, reduced crack initiation life, increased crack growth rates, and an overall reduction in part life. While bulk residual stresses are often accounted for with simple approximations that ensure safety, improved understanding of bulk residual stress fields would enable higher quality design and analysis methods. This could lead to overall higher performing structure. The proposed work plan will develop improved technology for the measurement of bulk residual stress and will demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach under representative conditions.  BENEFIT:  The proposed residual stress measurement technology is a significant improvement that would fill a critical gap in capability for bulk residual stress measurement, enabling high-quality measurements in aerospace materials. This technology is important to the aerospace community, and is applicable to many other industries as well. For example, pressure vessels, turbines, industrial facilities, ships, and heavy equipment all contain critical structure with significant amounts of residual stress. As design and analysis techniques evolve to incorporate residual stress effects, it is important to have residual stress measurement techniques capable of providing the necessary supporting data with a high degree of accuracy. The proposed technology expands residual stress measurement capability to support these important challenges.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The objective of this SBIR research effort is to investigate algorithms for mitigation of sensor saturation, including the effects of laser dazzlers,  in mid-wave infrared (MWIR) cameras using advanced image-processing techniques.    The optical irradiance present in dazzled imagery spans several orders of magnitude more than conventional MWIR focal planes can reproduce. The large variation in irradiance is manifested in the imagery as severely under-exposed and over-exposed regions of the captured image as well as artifacts due to the scattering of rays within the imaging device.Image processing based solutions offer the potential for dazzler mitigation without prior knowledge of any dazzler characteristics and offer an alternative solution in applications where the addition of optical filters to the collection device is impractical or undesirable.Our approach employs High-Dynamic-Range image processing to combine multiple frames of varying exposure in a statistically rigorous manner in order to capture information in both low and high-light regions, and maximize the information content in a single image.  In addition, a two step pre-processing scheme is utilized to separate and remove dynamic (lens flare) as well as static (main beam) contributions from the corrupting high energy source.    BENEFIT:  There will be immediate benefits in military applications of this technology to surveillance, reconnaissance, and target acquisition and tracking. For example, this technology may be used to mitigate saturation effects of directed energy laser dazzlers on guided missile electro-optics. Since methods developed in this project will not be specific to the MWIR band, they may be more generally applied over the visible to LWIR range of imaging devices. Programmable consumer digital cameras in the visible band could eventually be controlled with these algorithms, presenting a large market for this technology. Multiple frames with exposure times covering the full dynamic range of intensities would be automatically taken, with a composite HDR image then constructed from these frames. Lens flare due to reflections internal to the camera would also be reduced using the methods devised here.",

In Phase I, an operational model for this WGM radiation detector was developed. Model calculations demonstrated high potential of the technology for ultra-sensitive detection of FIR-THz radiation using a sensor of a sub-millimeter size. A breadboard prototype developed in Phase I was capable of measuring THz radiation power at least an order of magnitude smaller than that detectable by a state-of-the-art THz detector. Phase II effort will concentrate on systematic studies of the detector characteristics as a function of structural parameters such as geometry, size, and material of the microcavity,  the development of integrated deployable detector prototype, and investigation into robustness and reliability issues in the context of a field sensor.

        "abstract": "Despite over 100 years of research, decompression sickness (DCS) remains the mission-limiting factor in the design and execution of deep combat dives.  Divers may spend over an hour decompressing after spending as little as ten minutes at the target depth.  While decompressing, divers are limited in vertical mobility, making then susceptible to detection and threatening their survivability.  Recent technological advances in a number of areas may provide the means to limit the need for decompression.  The Creare team proposes to develop an Integrated Diver Physiology Platform (IDPP) to reduce the decompression obligation of combat divers in extreme dive profiles.  The IDPP will use novel, probabilistic decompression algorithms to change the breathing gas composition in real time to reduce decompression risk, control the delivery of DCS-mitigating pharmacological agents, and prescribe a personalized ascent profile.  The algorithms will be supported by an integrated, miniaturized, physiological sensor suite monitoring bubble formation, breathing gas composition, tissue inert gas tension, and other common physiological metrics.  This physiological feedback will allow the system to minimize decompression obligation while monitoring and maintaining the safety of the diver, enabling dive profiles currently impossible with existing technologies.",

        "abstract": "Sonobuoy systems are used to detect and determine the location, course and speed of underwater vehicles such as submarines and Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs). Multiple sonobuoy transmit and receive pairs are typically deployed over a large area, nominally a 40 nautical mile diameter. Current systems rely on VHF radios to continuously offload data to overhead aircraft. While this approach has proved to be effective, the upload data rates are severely limited and the power consumption of the RF transmitter is a significant portion of the total system power, limiting the duration of these missions.  To address these issues, SA Photonics has developed a concept design for NeptuneLite, a low cost, low power Free-Space Optical (FSO) communication system specifically designed to offload data from receive sonobuoys. During the Phase I program, we analyzed and developed a complete concept design to support sonobuoy FSO links. A thorough system analysis was performed to validate the performance of the communication link as well as the tracking and acquisition systems. The result was a concept design for a prototype system that will be developed on this Phase II program.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Space-based systems have become indispensable elements of global communication, military  reconnaissance and scientific research. The expenses associated with any space launch are  enormous and, once in orbit, a system failure can have catastrophic consequences. Extensive Earth-based testing is essential to ensure a high success rate. To approximate the demands of space deployment, the Air Force maintains large test chambers capable of creating low temperature, high vacuum environments. However, the testing apparatus within these chambers is often poorly suited to the harsh cryo-vac environment and mechanical failures are not uncommon. A program of applied research is proposed to develop a family of versatile, high-precision positioning system fully compatible with space chamber environments. Under Phase II, research will continue into commercial motion technologies that are inherently more compatible with cryo-vac conditions and design modifications with the potential for further improving the performance of these technologies. Ultimately, multi degree-of-freedom positioning systems will be built and validated.    BENEFIT:  The 7V and 10V space test chambers maintained by the Air Force at Arnold Engineering Development Center will be the initial customer for the proposed cryo-vac positioning systems.  Once validated within terrestrial test chambers, adaptation of these systems for use aboard spacecraft represents a potent and enduring secondary commercial market.  The Department of Energys extensive network of particle accelerators driven by cryo-cooled superconducting magnets represents another large potential market.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  We propose the development of a high-speed, passive, in-situ, hyperspectral sensor system and its integration into engine-scale augmentor test program at AEDC.  In this effort, custom probe optics will be integrated into an existing mechanical engine probe to provide multiple views of the flame radiance coming from various locations in a turbine engine thrust augmentor.  The light from the probe is routed to an innovative adaptive spectral imager, which uses computer-controlled spectral filters to monitor concentrations of multiple combustion product species at data rates of 50 kHZ.  The spectral filters can be changed on the fly at rates of up to 20 kHZ, allowing the system to make a variety of different types of measurements in rapid succession. Temporally- and spatially-resolved measurements are to be processed to yield combustor properties such as species column density, local fuel/air ratio and heat release on a time-scale fast enough  to resolve the evolution of the flame sheet as it passes between the fields of view of the probe.  The time resolved data can be processed into a number of data products for direct comparison to fluid dynamic models.  BENEFIT:  The immediate result of the proposed program is a prototype sensor system for ongoing augmentor testing at AEDC and a general purpose high-speed hyperspectral readout for general application in combustion research.  The sensor system is aligned with the AFRL roadmap for advanced augmentor development, which includes advanced sensors for experimental validation of augmentor models and augmentor performance.  The sensor readout will serve as a diagnostic tool that can be combined with a variety of experimental techniques, including tomographic reconstruction to provide further insight to augmentor physics. The experimental verifications provided by the sensor will facilitate further model enhancement and establish confidence for advanced CFD techniques in design applications.  The prototype adaptive spectral readout will be portable, simple to use, and could be readily applied in a variety of research and land-based combustion measurement applications. Given the unobtrusive, passive nature of the system, it is applicable not just for augmentor measurement, but also to any application requiring monitoring or control of combustion dynamics. The prototype could be used directly by commercial engine manufacturers and aerospace companies in component tests, engine tests, and in land-based installations.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Measurements of combustion and gas dynamic properties inside gas turbine engines and augmentors are needed to aid in engine development, performance testing and evaluation, and for verification and validation of combustion modeling codes.  Flame emission spectra in the ultraviolet and visible portions of the spectrum can be used to determine species concentrations, fuel-air ratio, and instantaneous heat release in liquid fueled gas turbine combustors.  In Phase I, Bodkin Design & Engineering demonstrated snapshot hyperspectral imaging of hydrocarbon flames simultaneously recording spatial and spectral data.  In Phase II, we will design a custom multi-modal sensor system that will measure multiple species concentrations (including free radical species such as OH*, CH* and C2*), local fuel/air ratios, heat release, and fuel/air mix temperature inside a gas turbine engine or augmentor.  The system will use fast, compact spectral imagers operating simultaneously at both ultraviolet (UV/vis) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths and will record hyperspectral images at frame rates as high as 2000 Hz.  The completed system will be demonstrated on the J85 engine test stand at UTSI.  BENEFIT:  Combustion diagnostics has been an important area of research for half a century.  Key improvements have led to more fuel efficient and less polluting engines of all types including aircraft and automotive engines, industrial furnaces, and power generating turbines.  The system to be developed in this project will directly benefit the Air Force in its development of better jet engines since it will be an important tool for imaging fast, dynamic instabilities in combustion zones while simultaneously providing important chemometric and thermometric data.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The objective of this Phase II Program is to continue the development of a Source Analysis and Modeling System (SAMS) for the AEDC STAT space effects test facility.   SAMS will allow the test facility user to carry out high fidelity simulations of STAT source emissions onto test articles and to investigate secondary source effects when interacting with other chamber systems.  The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo code Monaco is chosen for the dynamical simulation, and modified as necessary for the specific STAT source parameters and configurations.  A magnetic field capability was developed and successfully integrated in Phase I in order to handle ions that are also present.  A sufficiently detailed STAT chamber geometry is used to create the space mesh using Pointwise.  The Phase II Program will develop and finalize source models for the STAT atomic oxygen, electron, and proton sources.   Source model fidelity will be assessed and improved using STAT source and diagnostic test data.  The SAMS modular and extendible architecture will be designed for additional source model integration on future programs.  BENEFIT:  The SAMS derivative commercial product could be licensed to a modeling and simulation software company that is currently marketing and distributing software products to the customer base of interest.  This could be the best approach for sales and distribution.  Modeling and simulation markets that we will target include the following.  Space simulation chambers are maintained and operated by most large US defense and aerospace contractors, as well as at several NASA facilities.  Of these chambers, tens have ionizing radiation and particle beam sources used to evaluate systems under test for performance in harsh space environments.   Modeling codes are typically used to predict system performance and establish test exposure levels, so the STAT SAMS and/or Source Models or variants could be used by these various agencies and contractors in test planning, predictive system assessments, or in system analysis and refinement.   Some US allies are also involved at various levels in the development, testing, and performance assessment of space payloads.   Countries such as ESA members, Canada and Australia, Japan, South Korea, and others who maintain test and evaluation chambers could be customers of the modeling code.  Internet sales of a commercial code could open a variety of otherwise unreachable markets around the world.  Electron beam tomography, photolithography, and welding are moderate size industries that have various needs for modeling and simulation of beam propagation, target effects, and secondary phenomena.  Proton beams are now used for radiotherapy and surgery, such as for prostate cancer.  Various ion beams are using in milling, machining, etching, deposition, and sputtering production lines.",

DCWS employs sensors to track individual vehicles in real time and interface with signal controller to implement advanced signal protocols (e.g., as phase hold to extend green beyond max and all red extensions). DCWS also warns the drivers in advance, who are going to be stuck in the DZ using an advanced warning system.

        "abstract": "Currently, the most successful approach for table-top soft X-ray and EUV (Extreme Ultra-Violet ) sources is that of High Harmonic Generation (HHG), where high intensity pulses are used to drive frequency conversion from a noble gas.  This configuration converts the infrared drive laser to photon energies beyond 1.6keV (x-rays). This approach requires extremely short pulses and typically uses Ti:sapphire lasers.  These lasers, however, suffer from reliability and stability issues due in large part to their reliance on complex and unreliable green (532nm) pump lasers.  This work will address that problem by proving the viability of direct diode pumping for Ti:sapphire amplifiers.  Direct diode pumping is widely recognized for reliability in the larger, industrial markets addressed by Yb-doped laser systems but has not been developed for Ti:sapphire. Recently, KMLabs, along with collaborators at the Colorado School of Mines, was successful in demonstrating the worlds first Kerr lens modelocked ultrafast oscillator  using 445nm high power blue diodes  and ushering in a new era for Ti:sapphire systems.  The promise of direct diode pumping is a 5X-10X reduction in pump laser cost and a corresponding increase in reliability. In this Phase II, we will to take the next step in furthering this research to include an amplifier based on direct diode pumping of Ti:sapphire, with an objective of eventually converting the output to the EUV through HHG for BES applications within the DOE. In phase I of this work, we developed a pump module for an ultrafast Ti:sapphire laser oscillator, and demonstrated direct diode pumping of that laser up to powers &amp; gt;300mW. We showed the feasibility of extending this technology to an ultrafast Ti:sapphire amplifier system. In Phase II of this program, we will investigate the details of further amplifying our direct diode pumped Ti:sapphire oscillator up to levels capable of HHG using direct diode pumping of an amplifier also.  We will use our patented cryogenic amplifier technology to run this system at high average powers.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Traditional Ti:sapphire markets such as 2-photon microscopy, bio-imaging, and OCT continue to grow, but that expansion could be much larger with cost reductions and reliability improvements. Additionally, industries that have relied on Yb based systems (delivering 300-500fs pulse widths) due to the cost and complexity of Ti:sapphire systems (micromachining, ophthalmology, bio-medical), could benefit from the shorter Ti:sapphire pulses.   This program seeks to eliminate the cost and reliability issue while enabling very short pulses (20-30 fs) for existing applications, as well as to open new markets for Ti:sapphire lasers.",

        "abstract": "To address the Armys need for a low-cost rearward sense-and-avoid system, Physical Optics Corporation proposes to advance development of the Airborne Enhanced Rear Obstacle Avoidance System (AERO) proven feasible in Phase I. This system is based on a novel integration of two orthogonal sense-and-avoid techniques. The key innovation is its unique design that provides highly accurate obstacle detection and avoidance as well as situational awareness in degraded visual environment such as rain, fog, dust, or during nighttime operation. In Phase I, POC successfully met all the objectives and conclusively demonstrated the feasibility of the AERO system. Key technical risks associated with the technology were reduced via designing, developing, and testing a limited-scale prototype in simulated brownout conditions. As a result, Phase II development is now a straightforward process of engineering, optimization, and risk-reduction. In Phase II, POC plans to further mature this technology by building a modularized AERO system that can be integrated with select platforms for preliminary flight testing. We anticipate that at the end of Phase II, AERO will reach technology readiness level (TRL) 5/6 and will be mature enough to proceed to full certifications, engineering and regulatory documentation, and pre-productization.",

        "abstract": "Current TD-1A/B chain tiedowns are heavy and physically demanding for Navy personnel to handle. But, any replacement requires high strength and extreme robustness to UV radiation, salt water, corrosion, solvents, oils, extreme temperatures, abrasion, and droppage, making weight optimization challenging. Significant research has been devoted to using synthetic materials instead of chain to reduce weight. However, environmental testing for flight deck operations includes water immersion and freezing conditions that can greatly effect both polymer lifetime and flexibility related to positive tensioning. The use of chain sidesteps many of these performance barriers, and the TD-1A/B is accepted and proven under conditions including near-darkness and freezing rain through extensive in-service testing. Therefore, Templeman Automation LLC. (TA) proposes a new approach for lightweight chain tiedowns using innovative weight-reduction design practices. The critical advantage of TA's LiteLinx approach is that the resulting chain system will function with existing TD-1A/B tensioners, and LiteLinx tensioners will work identically to current tensioners with current, in-service chains. While only the combination of LiteLinx chains and tensioners will meet the target weight of 6 lbs, the interoperability achieved will be critical for Navy adoption of the new technology as TD-1A/B hardware is gradually replaced through natural attrition.",

        "abstract": "Conventional generation of a high-quality RF carrier (signal) beyond 50GHz requires high precision cavity engineering that inherently restricts contiguous bandwidth coverage. Worse, even if one were capable of fabricating a set of such stabilized, frequency-dense cavities to mimic discrete 30-120GHz band coverage, the absence of wideband electrical gain in this range would invalidate such an approach. Recognizing this basic limitation, the proposed work will generate a high-quality tunable signal by heterodyning phase-correlated optical tones combining high power and low noise. In contrast to conventional RF-photonics approaches, a high quality tunable RF signal will be derived from a single, shot-noise-limited master oscillator. The new technique unifies, for the first time, the low-noise characteristics of highly coherent master oscillators and high-power heterodyning. In simple terms, the approach combines high-power emitters with very low RIN characteristics, without resorting to high-resonance cavity construction. Specifically, the novelty of the proposed work is reflected in: (a) the first use of tunable injection locking to guarantee true frequency agility to the 300GHz range and beyond; (b) combined phase-noise inhibition and high-power scaling that is otherwise not possible in conventional shot-noise-limited oscillators; and (c) nearly lossless, fiber distribution of the tunable RF carrier with absolute phase reference.",

In this project, we are building a system that removes known vulnerabilities from embedded software and adds protections to prevent exploits of undiscovered vulnerabilities; by integrating with vulnerability detection technology, we will largely automate vulnerability patching, although without formal specifications, some human review will be necessary. Our system uses static rewriting of the software binaries either prior to or after deployment and will integrate with and complement other GrammaTech tools developed under various DoD contracts.  The proposed system will operate directly on software binaries, even in the absence of source code or symbol information, applying both to newly developed software and legacy software. The system will be retargetable to different instruction sets to accommodate a variety of embedded systems platforms. To ensure that added protections do not break the functionality of a program, the proposed system will verify that the rewritten program is semantically equivalent to the original program, except for the corrected flaws.",

This process of allowing accumulation of charge and subsequent removal by personnel is a process that the Navy would prefer to eliminate due to inherent hazards to flight and ground crew and potential scratch damage to the transparencies. The solution is to eliminate the possibility of charge accumulation during flight. Eikos Inc, teamed with The Boeing Company, proposes that the solution is to make part or the entire surface of the transparencies conductive by enhancing that surface with Invisicon technology, which utilizes carbon nanotubes in an extremely thin veil that can conceivably be deposited either in bands or over the entire transparency surface.

        "abstract": "Radar signatures of small boats and ships are inherently complex due to their myriad topside features: railings, antennas, masts, ladders, armaments, pilot stations, outboard engines, storage bins, etc. In boats, the use of fiberglass and other radar-penetrable materials for hulls and decks further complicates the radar signature by exposing interior geometry. Radar detection, identification, and tracking of watercraft depends on accurately characterizing radar signatures and their variability over anticipated operating conditions. However, at these wavelengths, watercraft can span hundreds to thousands of wavelengths, well beyond the capability of any full-wave electromagnetic solver. Asymptotic (ray-tracing) solvers do very well at quickly predicting the signatures of large, complex shapes, but they suffer in capturing the effects of detailed features measuring a few wavelengths or less. Yet, these detailed features can play an important role in the overall radar signature. We propose to develop a practical signature prediction capability for watercraft that hybridizes the solution of two mature electromagnetic modeling technologies based on ray tracing and method-of-moments. Phase I will focus on hybrid formulation development and proof of concept through numeric experiments. In Phase II, hybridization algorithms will be refined and implemented in a radar signature tool, including a commercial-grade GUI.",

State-of-the-art hydrogen storage vessels that meet these requirements are currently very expensive to manufacture due to high carbon fiber costs.  This work addresses the need for lower- cost tanks by utilizing recently-developed, low-cost fibers and graded composite designs. The Phase I/Phase II project seeks to reduce the cost of hydrogen storage vessels for fuel  cell  powered  cars  by  25%  by using low-cost  carbon  fibers  in  a graded construction of the vessel wall. CTD performed detailed design iterations using laminate analysis and finite element analysis to optimize the design and minimize the cost of a 700 bar hydrogen storage vessel using a graded construction, demonstrating that a 25% reduction in cost is feasible if suitable lower cost fibers are available. CTD also investigated low cost fiber options developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Target areas for improvement, including the need to develop methods for handling large fiber tows and improving fiber and matrix interactions were identified. In Phase II, fiber handling, fiber sizing, and polymer matrix materials will be optimized to provide the best combination of low cost and high performance for hydrogen storage vessels. This work will include the fabrication and testing of composite laminates, as well as burst tubes or small tanks.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: In addition to optimizing the cost of 700 bar hydrogen storage vessels, low-cost composite structures have application in wind and tidal turbine blades, as well as in automotive and marine structures.",

        "abstract": "Residential and commercial buildings represent a prime opportunity to improve energy efficiency and sustainability worldwide. Currently, lighting and thermal management within buildings account for 20% of the United States yearly energy consumption. The objective of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase 2 project is to develop a low-cost, near-infrared (NIR) selective, plasmonic smart insulating glass unit (IGU) that reduces building energy consumption by  dynamically  optimizing  solar  gain.  During  this  project,  Heliotrope  will  utilize  scalable solution-based techniques to create unique nanocrystal electrochromic layers. The novel electrochromic layers will be initially examined for compatibility and performance, then subsequently used to construct solid-state energy efficient windows. Systematic characterization of the solid-state electrochromic device will establish which components in the system are performance limiting. Upon successful fabrication, Heliotrope expects to achieve enhanced solar modulation at fast switching speeds. During our Phase 1 project, 4 &amp; quot;x4 &amp; quot; prototype smart panes (larger than the size originally anticipated) were fabricated and tested using low-cost, solution-based techniques. Prototype coatings were built as a laminated pane of glass, consisting entirely of solid-state components. Initial performance showed 40% near infrared modulation with less than 3% visible light modulation at switching speeds of ~2min. In our Phase 2 project, we propose to extend the development of low-cost, NIR-selective, plasmonic electrochromic  windows  by  fabricating 10 &amp; quot;x10 &amp; quot; IGUs that are powered wirelessly through their framing. Fabrication of the windows will occur using the same scalable techniques developed during the Phase I effort. ASTM standards will be used to validate window durability under a variety of conditions.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The economic and environmental benefits of using electrochromic windows are clear: reducing one quad of energy use would yield an average savings of $10.6 billion, while eliminating about 21.5 gigawatts of power produced by fossil fuels and saving nearly 59 million metric tons of CO2 emissions. It is estimated that the use of electrochromic windows in buildings can achieve a 50% reduction in peak energy demand and a 30% reduction in overall energy use. Still, current electrochromic windows in the market have not reached their market potential due to their high cost ( &amp; gt;$200/ft2  installed). Heliotropes NIR selective electrochromic windows are based on an innovative design that increases lifetime and performance, while reducing production cost. Wide- scale adoption of this unique technology will not only enhance market penetration for dynamic windows, but establish a new benchmark for performance and cost.",

        "abstract": "The DOE Sunshot initiative aims at reducing the installed cost of solar energy systems by about 75% and predicts that this will drive widespread, large-scale adoption of this renewable energy technology and restore U.S. leadership in the global clean energy race. Conventional solar technologies are also limited in their form factor, weight, flexibility, color- tunability, and transparency, which have impeded growth in flexible PV and large building integrated PV markets. Soluble small molecule organic photovoltaic technology promises to lower the cost per watt of modules and also the balance of system costs below the goals of Sunshot. These materials can be coated as inks onto conventional plastic rolls in high yields using roll-to-roll technology allowing for the generation of lightweight, flexible, semi-transparent, color-tunable and extremely inexpensive solar cells. The goal of this project is to demonstrate that the lifetime of encapsulated organic PVs made using organic soluble small molecules are long enough to meet the needs of the markets. The Phase I projected demonstrated the commercial feasibility and stability of soluble small molecule organic solar technology. In an inert environment that simulates well-encapsulated devices, these devices showed performance that potentially meets the requirements for early-stage products (5 or more year effective lifetime), and demonstrated that 20-30 year lifetimes needed for building integrated photovoltaic are feasible. The goal of the Phase II proposal is to demonstrate that the lifetime of encapsulated organic PVs made using soluble small molecules are long enough to meet the needs of the markets.  Specifically, for rigid encapsulation Phase II will demonstrate 20 - 30 year of lifetimes, which are necessary for the building integrated PV (BIPV) window market. For flexible encapsulation technology Phase II milestones include 3 - 5 year lifetimes, which will enable the technology in niche flexible portable markets - a stepping stone towards the flexible BIPV market.  Commercial Applications and Benefits:  The development of the technology is anticipated to achieve a price point that will compete with non-renewables and help the US transition to a clean energy future. On the shorter term, the flexibility, low-weight, color-tunability, and semitransparency of the technology will fulfill unmet needs of flexible and building integrated PV (BIPV) markets. The low costs and custom manufacturing enabled by the printable technology for the BIPV markets supports domestic manufacturing by reducing the advantage of mass manufacturing and low margins.",

        "abstract": "Electric vehicles, including hybrids in the nearer term, are the principal transportation technology\nby which the United States can become independent of foreign oil, can become energy independent overall, and can effect control over greenhouse emissions.  For this to become reality, electric vehicle costs need to come down and performance needs to improve.  For electric vehicle motors, the goals are to reduce manufacturing cost to $4.7/kW by 2020 while improving operating performance, including power density, peak power and operating efficiency. This SBIR Phase II project will build on the materials and process accomplishments of Phase I, to develop innovative magnet wire insulation for motor windings that results in increased power density and operating efficiency.  This will be achieved by developing a wire insulation that has as much as 10 times higher thermal conductivity so that heat can be better dissipated, meaning that the motor will run cooler and therefore more efficiently.   In doing so, all other mechanical, thermal and electrical characteristics of the insulation required by standards will be maintained.  With better heat dissipation and efficiency owing to high thermal conductivity insulation, dedicated liquid cooling might be eliminated, contributing to smaller, lower-cost electric drives. The proposed advance in magnet wire insulation will result from the incorporation of high thermal conductivity inorganic particles into high performance polymers.  The novel insulation is proposed to be applied by the conventional wire enameling method.  Electrical, thermal, mechanical, and chemical property measurements according to NEMA standards for magnet wire will be made to insure that all requirements are met or exceeded.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits:  In terms of cars scheduled to enter the U.S. market, it appears that President Obamas goal of one million EVs by 2015 will be surpassed. And the Electric Vehicles Initiative forecasts 10 million by 2020. This will create a robust market for motors with the wire insulation being proposed here.  In addition to application in EVs, wire insulation technology will also play a key role in larger electric motors that will be used in electric buses and land &amp; amp; marine-based military vehicles.   Beyond the traction motor applications mentioned, improved motor/generator systems will also be critical for other energy technologies such as wind turbines.",

        "abstract": "The utility-scale wind industry is evolving towards very large ( &amp; gt;4MW) machines with blades longer than\n70m for both land-based and off-shore installations.  There is a rapid ramp in cost associated with ground transportation of blades longer than 65m, rising to a threshold that is considered practically prohibitive for blades longer than 75m. Managing the quality of such large blades using conventional manufacturing methods is also becoming increasingly challenging. As a product of the SBIR Phase 2 R &amp; amp;D, Wetzel Engineering will create a Field-Assembled Component- Based Rotor Blade technology that addresses the above concerns.  The blade is assembled in the field from factory-built sections sized to be easily transportable, and both the manufacturing and assembly are performed on open fixtures such that the quality can be inspected carefully before finish. During Phase 1, Wetzel Engineering identified the optimal configuration for sectioning a blade for more cost effective manufacturing, transportation, and field assembly.   We also performed structural engineering  of  the  major  components  of  the  blade,  assessing  the  feasibility  of  the  concept  and identifying the potential cost and performance benefits of the technology. Phase 1 validated that the concept has merit and should be developed further in a Phase 2 SBIR project. During Phase 2 Wetzel Engineering will optimize the engineering of the structural components used in forming the blade through a program of comprehensive component and substructure testing. We will further validate and refine our understanding of the technology by building a 41m subscale test blade and subjecting it to static and fatigue testing. Finally, we will validate the scalability of the technology by engineering an 83m component-based blade for operation on a land-based 6MW wind turbine.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Wetzel Engineering, working with its Wetzel Blade manufacturing affiliate, will commercialize the technology by manufacturing 41 and 46m blades for the US domestic replacement blade market for aging 1.5-2.0MW turbines and by manufacturing 83, 90, and 100m blades for 6-10MW wind turbines for the worldwide off-shore and large land-based wind industry. Wetzel Engineering believes that the technology developed here will create a revolution in the engineering and  manufacturing of rotor blades.",

        "abstract": "The problem being addressed in this proposal is the existing extensive use of energy hungry hot water heaters in both residential and commercial building in the United States. In addition, any attempts to date to create a low energy hybrid hot water heater (HWH) have resulted in hot water heaters so loud that they cannot feasibly be used in residential applications. This project entails the development and prototyping of a hybrid hot water heater compressor which drastically reduces the energy needed to heat hot water as well as reducing the sound emitted from the hot water heater. Phase I successfully created a New (Electrochemical) Compressor suitable for a 50 gallon Hybrid Hot Water System, that is more efficient than current mechanical compressors and that is also, noiseless, vibration free, modular and scalable utilizing non-GHG refrigerant (water). The Phase II goal will be to create a High Fidelity heat pump hybrid hot water heater in conjunction with General Electric (GE) containing an Electro Chemical Compressor (ECC), allowing this unit to determine how to meet the DOE performance and cost of targets for the commercial residential electrochemical based Hybrid Hot Water Heater.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The need for this product is very clear. More than 70% of electric demand is utilized in buildings, with the U.S government reporting that approximately 15% of residential electric demand is for hot water production.  Anything that will reduce that individual subunit demand will significantly reduce our total energy demand, emissions from producing electricity, and our dependence on foreign energy sources. In addition to energy conservation, this product would also reduce the use of GHG refrigerant, resulting in substantial environmental benefits. Utilizing this technology, GE could really have far-reaching positive effects on HWH market, (a) increase their share if they want to, and (b) increase the overall size of the market for Hybrid units. This is a disruptive and transformational technology that gives them an edge, they could really make a big splash and force the market to grow and for their share to increase. In addition, this compressor technology could be modified to other applications very easily and quickly for the following appliances: wine chillers, electronic cooling: basically anything that needs cooling above zero C.",

        "abstract": "Modern aircraft gas turbine engines utilize highly loaded airfoils in both the compressor and turbine to maximize performance while minimizing weight, cost, and complexity.  However, high airfoil loading increases the likelihood of flow separation at lower mass flow rates.  Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) plasma actuators have been shown to be a very promising technique for compressor stall control.  DBD devices can either be installed directly on rotor/stator surfaces or the compressor endwalls to control rotor tip flow.  A fundamental challenge in driving DBD actuators is providing appropriate electrical waveforms to the devices.  Creare proposes the development of an innovative compressor stall system which enables (1) substantially higher produced thrust than existing DBD actuator systems, (2) implements a unique excitation waveform that optimizes thrust production by DBD actuators, and (3) provides the potential ability to control spike-type compressor stall through controlling compressor tip leakage flow.",

This will be accomplished primarily by implementing an integrated data storage module, removing a current limitation of an integrated historian and general optimization of inherent features of FMS which will permit fleet-wide deployment that is more efficient as an ICAS module. The existing FMS is currently dependent on third-party software and adds to the cost of installation due to the associated licensing fees. FMS 2.0 will be redesigned to eliminate the software components that require these licenses. Additionally, FMS 2.0 will allow for system expansion, and this base effort also includes a feasibility study to address the viability of expanding FMS to new systems and ship classes beyond DDG-51 class.  Additionally, this follow on Phase 2 will allow for system expansion which includes a feasibility study to guide the expansion of FMS to systems properly equipped with sensors that support energy monitoring. In addition to helping operators make decisions to optimize fuel efficiency, we also then provide the data transparency and analytics to determine the root cause as to why the less fuel efficient plant configurations are less fuel efficient, and then provide guidance on corrective/maintenance action to improve fuel efficiency. Systems included in the study are: Diesel propulsion engines, electrical generators, air conditioning plants and refrigeration plants. Up to two systems will be selected to monitor for energy consumption purposes within the scope of FMS 2.0. The FMS 2.0 product will be completed in FY15 and ready for deployment to Flight IIA DDGs equipped with fuel meters in the near term and other ICAS ships equipped with fuel flow meters in the future.",

Cockpit interactions would be safer and more efficient thorugh Voice Communication. Though Voice Recognition systems are becoming widely used, in flight environment conditions usage has been limited due to the unique challenges of elevated noise levels, specific cockpit lexicon, limited cockpit hardware, and lack of standardization.  SouthernAir Aviation Inc. has developed a NextGen Voice Activated Cockpit Management system with applications for flight procedures, emergency procedures, control of aircraft systems and flight management systems.  From simple to complex architectures, the system syncronizes software applications and aircraft systems in a unified model of both language and safety critical development environment to voice activate functions using NextGen Voice Recognition with heuristic pilot response.  Procedures are enabled through wireless Bluetooth connection or wired communication. Additional tools of the system include a novel HMM Model comprising a decision management algorithm and synthetic lexicon for parsing and contiguous recognition.  All the performance requirements are met within a 2% time-slice of a 700MHz Power PC processor and within 1 GB of memory.  Unique key capabilities include: Automatic Lexicon Development, Phonetic Distance Analysis, Coarticulation Handling, Accent Tolerability.  The NextGen advanced performance relies on allophone parsing and reduced recognition error with data processing in real-time, ideal for critical emergency situations. This system is remarkable in that it achieves very high recognition rates (98%) with a very large command set (131,000 unique words and thousands of word combinations).\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge NASA SBIR Phase I Support.",

The prototype successfully detected center frequency, bandwidth, amplitude, and time stamp of ambient signals, and reduced spectral data transfer by a factor of 30,000, which will ensure that the data can be transferred over a standard 802.11 communication link. In Phase II, POC will develop a rugged, survivable, field WISDEM system prototype to cover the 1?6400 MHz band using a prototype low-cost receiving system. POC will use the EPG range in Phase II as the surveillance and reconnaissance target, and the current bandlimited RF links, to document an improved capability. POC will baseline the existing performance and compare it with the WISDEM Phase II prototype. POC will refine estimated costs for production runs of 10 and 50 units. Successful demonstration of these prototype implementations, which are easily integrated with current Army Electronic Proving Ground (EPG) test operations, will ensure rapid transition to production-ready capability in Phase III.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Commodities Sustainment Group (CMXG) at Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC) is in the process of re-architecting their organization to operate as a production system designed to work like a finely tuned machine.  The envisioned machine will be structured in such a way that leadership elements at all levels of the commodities sustainment enterprise can readily assess the status and progress of the workload (e.g., with defined gates, release points, and visual displays) as made visible through true North metrics while providing them with well-defined levers to make timely adjustments (e.g., Drum-Buffer-Rope (DBR) based control elements).  Consistent with this vision, KBSI proposes an effort to attack high payoff opportunity areas within this architecture to support and accelerate sustainment machine deployment.  The specific execution model elements targeted include a Metrics-centric (Strategic, Operational, Tactical) element, production control paradigm leveraging a modified Drum-Buffer-Rope (DBR) element, Visual Displays element, Tools / Tech Data element, and Touch Time (TT) element.  The core technology will result in a metric driven viable systems architecture for CMXG that can be reused across the command.  The long-term benefit of the proposed effort is the realization of pervasive commodities sustainment system health visibility, insight, management, and control producing sustainable improvements in production capacity.

        "abstract": "NASA is emphasizing the use of larger, more integrated models in conjunction with systems engineering tools and decision support systems. These tools place a corresponding stress on legacy engineering visualization systems which now are required to handle larger data sets, provide more intuition to the user, integrate well with many other tools, and help the user with his/her ultimate goal: improving the design of complex systems.    \nPhoenix Integration proposes to complete the prototype visualization environment created during Phase I to the point where it is a commercially viable product. New features, refinements, and integration with other tools will be accomplished in Phase II. In particular, the work will involve major improvements to whitespace exploration algorithms, techniques that enable users to unconstrain or modify the underlying engineering model in an effort to obtain results in previously unattainable areas. Work will also include more data mining algorithms (e.g. Principal Component Analysis), new graph types (e.g. spider plots), export formats to 3-D tools (e.g. Tecplot), integration with MBSE/SysML tools, integration with web-based decision support environments, and incorporation of probabilistic analysis. A rich integration with ModelCenter, the company's engineering integration and trade study environment, is planned, although a standalone capability will also be offered. The visualizer's architecture will be based on OpenGL and will use the GPU to parallelize rendering computations. Design will focus on usability and responsiveness, with the goal of providing quick insight into complex data.

        "abstract": "Purpose: Instruction in English Language Arts (ELA) for students with severe intellectual disabilities and autism can be challenging, as these students often do not have the skills to engage with text. In recent years, special education experts have proposed a comprehensive approach to supporting students with intellectual disabilities and autism in ELA, centered on strategies including word identification, vocabulary development, comprehension, fluency, writing, and research, and by providing opportunities to independently read and explore a wide array of self-selected texts. This project will develop tablet-based and app technology that provides age-appropriate content and a variety of evidence based strategies to support middle school students with severe disabilities in meeting Common Core State Standards in English Language Arts.\n\nProject Activities: In 2013 during Phase I, a prototype app was developed and tested. The app included simplified versions of researcher-developed content whereby middle school students with cognitive disabilities listened to grade aligned nonfiction stories read-aloud, while individual words were highlighted on the tablet. These stories also included symbol supports, vocabulary instruction with in-text definitions, and comprehension questions. At the end of Phase I, pilot research with 3 students and 2 teachers demonstrated usability as the app operated as intended, and initial feasibility as the teachers were able to integrate the tool within standard practice and students found the app to be engaging. Phase II will add additional components to the existing prototype, including: adaptive instruction to adjust to individual student differences, formative data feedback to guide individualized instruction, additional stories, and additional skills in research and writing. During Phase II, the research partners at East Tennessee State University will carry out an iterative investigative process by implementing 3 studies to explore the usability and feasibility, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the app to improve a variety of ELA skills. In Year 2, the fourth study will be a randomized control study with approximately 30 students, half of whom will be randomly selected for intervention. Students in the control group will be provided with the intervention at the end of the study. Analyses will compare pre- and post-test ELA scores.\n\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The U.S. Air Force needs a mission critical, high-performance electro-optical system capable of active or passive detection and characterization of a wavefront backscattered by an object of interest. In the AS&T novel concept proposed in the response to the Air Force requirements, a target-scattered coherent or incoherent complex optical field is detected by a dual-form optical sensor. The architecture of this beaconless wavefront sensor (BlessWFS) and direct post-processing of this detected field allows the retrieval and complete characterization of the wavefront. During Phase I AS&T designed, integrated and performed proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating the performance of the beaconless wavefront sensing technique. During Phase II, AS&T will extend the performance capabilities of the system, design and build a brassboard for verifying and optimizing the predicted system performance, demonstrate and refine laboratory operation, and estimate the working envelope. The program will culminate with a field demonstration of pre-prototype level BlessWFS performance in an operationally relevant environment.  BENEFIT:  An important benefit of the proposed concept is the development of an advanced sensor with unique capabilities that allows the detection and characterization of a complex wavefront from a coherent or incoherent illuminated object. The technologies developed under this effort are suitable for various applications including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance needs of ground-based systems, airborne usage, or space deployment. In the commercial sector, this technology can support needs and requirements of air-traffic control platforms, astronomic and microscopy systems, laser telecom, as well as wavefront detection during ophthalmological treatments and vision correction operations.",

In order to mitigate such undesirable performance, modern EPS designers must develop and apply suitable mitigation strategies, which typically involve energy storage, filtration, and/or advanced control.

        "abstract": "Modern military systems contain numerous avionics and electronic systems that must perform to very high standards in hostile environments in the presence of numerous potential sources of electromagnetic interference (EMI). On airborne platforms for example, there could be dozens of RF systems radiating and receiving mission critical signals simultaneously over a very wide range of frequencies. Undesired electromagnetic coupling between these systems can easily occur, leading to loss of function of one or more critical systems. In addition to this cosite interference, there is also the potential for EMI due to sources of electromagnetic energy not located on the platform of interest. These sources of external interference could be due to systems operating on nearby platforms such as a high power radar on a ship, or could be due to intentional jamming. In order to ensure maximum likelihood of mission success, modern military platforms must consider the mitigation of cosite and inter-system EMI prior to deployment, whenever subsystems are added or changed, and periodically during the service life of the platform to ensure continued compliance as the equipment ages. Through this proposed effort, we will show how the GPU-based parallelization of EMIT will lead to significant reductions in simulation time, greatly improve the usability of the tool, and make it possible to add higher-fidelity modeling formulations without sacrificing run time or decreasing the efficiency of the cosite engineers.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses two roadblocks to reducing the cost of wind energy: the labor-intensive construction process, and size limitations imposed by road or rail transport for turbine components. The former issue drives up manufacturing costs and reduces US competitiveness with countries with inexpensive labor, while the latter forces sub-optimized tower designs and prevents turbines from growing larger and taking advantage of faster, steadier winds at higher hub heights. This project addresses both of these problems by adapting spiral welding - a well-understood system for pipe and piling manufacturing - to wind tower production. Spiral welding is highly automated, requiring as little as 10% of the labor of the equivalent manual process. It also combines multiple operations into a single machine that can be operated on-site, eliminating transport costs and barriers. This project&#039;s innovation is to adapt existing spiral welders -that can manufacture only straight,constant wall-thickness pipe - to producing tapered, variable wall thickness towers. A novel material geometry and automated control of machine parameters are the keys to transforming the standard system to one optimized for turbine tower production. With on-site spiral welding of turbine towers, significant reductions in cost of wind energy are possible. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be felt in many areas: technical,commercial and environmental. The system&#039;s major contribution is an increase in the use of wind energy for US electricity, enabled by both reduction in energy cost and increase in the number of cost-effective wind sites. Reducing the cost of tall towers enables increases in the height and size of wind turbines, allowing them to reach and be optimized for steadier, higher speed winds. With these increase in size and optimization, decreases in cost of wind energy of 12% (for 120m tall towers) or more are possible. In addition, the US land area for which wind energy is cost effective can be doubled at 120m hub heights. Spiral-welding of turbine towers also provides US jobs and increases American competitiveness with overseas producers. Because on-site production is inherently local, manufacturing jobs are created in the communities where wind turbines are installed. Also, this method gives local production a major cost advantage over imports by producing towers that are too large to transport from port to wind farm. This allows domestic manufacturing to not only compete, but dominate in a domestic tower market worth roughly $1B in 2011.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is aimed at optimizing production of a bio-surfactant in preparation for commercial launch of the product. During Phase I, the company developed an engineered microorganism that synthesizes the surfactant, and a key customer confirmed the identity and purity of a sample of the surfactant. During Phase II, synthetic biology methods will be used to increase the efficiency of the microorganism producing the surfactant. In addition, multiple samples of purified surfactant will be shipped to customers for evaluation. Customer feedback will identify any product features that require modification and will result in development of a detailed product specification, which will include metrics such as: purity, color, acceptable variation in composition and molecular weight, etc. The objectives of this Phase II project are to optimize surfactant characteristics and microbial production efficiency so that the surfactant can be profitably manufactured and sold for use in consumer products formulations. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it should enable the company to demonstrate that synthetic biology methods can be used to increase the efficiency of production of a bio-surfactant so the surfactant can be sold as a commercial product. Progress toward that goal should enable the company to attract a partner, for example a large chemical company, who will agree to collaborate on commercialization of the bio-surfactant. If the bio-surfactant can be made and sold profitably, the company will be positioned to fund future research and development aimed at commercial launch of additional bio-surfactants. Benefits to society are that chemicals produced using this technology will be manufactured using domestically grown renewable raw materials, which do not compete with food. Furthermore, the energy required to produce these chemicals is low since the fermentation reaction is performed near ambient temperature. The chemicals are inherently safer than traditional chemicals because toxic solvents are not used, and the surfactants are biodegradable and do not contribute to increased greenhouse gas accumulation. These bio-surfactants will initially be used in personal care products, such as body washes and shampoos. However, the surfactant market is large and diverse, creating an opportunity for use of bio-surfactants in products as varied as laundry detergent, paints and coatings, and floatation-agents used in the mining industry to purify valuable minerals.",

The use of analysis to drive design from an early stage is critical to their success, yet conflicting design requirements and demanding space constraints make traditional design/build/test methods challenging and expensive. The proposed SBIR program focuses on overcoming this through the development of a user-friendly multi-disciplinary design and analysis software toolkit that can rapidly perform parametric studies and design optimization of solar array concepts. The software package will provide a graphical user interface and analysis procedures to evaluate critical performance metrics, while eliminating the unnecessary pre-processing and computational overhead associated with current approaches. Analysis capabilities will include flexible multi-body dynamics, array deployment, modal analysis, and response simulation. Model creation will be simplified through the use of an extensible, hierarchical blockset solution and a library of blocks specific to deployable solar array analysis.

The Sabatier reaction is conventionally carried out in a fixed bed catalyst at high temperatures of 350-400 ?C. For the long duration future Mars missions (~ 18 months expected stay on Mars), the fixed bed Sabatier reactor design however is inadequate due to performance and catalyst durability issues. In addition thermal management within the reactor is a major issue due to exothermicity of the reaction. Lynntech has demonstrated the feasibility of a novel low power, low temperature plasma assisted catalysis process for addressing these limitations with the methanation of CO2 at a scale of 14 g/h methane production rate.

Most of this code is written in the C programming language. We need a scalable static formal program verification tool that is able to prove the functional correctness of flight-critical software, limiting any failure of flight critical software to hardware faults.\nThis project seeks to leverage the matching logic verification framework. Matching logic is generic in an operational semantic of a given programming language, so we also seek to give a semantics of a subset of C, called CIL, which is guaranteed to be deterministic. While we already have a semantics for the entirety of C, CIL is more representative of flight-critical software, and the simpler, deterministic semantics will result in a more efficient, and thus more scalable, static program verification tool. We are also building a new unification- based rewrite engine that will result in a more powerful version of the Matching Logic Framework.  In order to make the tool more commercially feasible, we will develop new techniques in pattern inference, so that loop invariants and some pre/post conditions can be determined automatically.  We will perform a thorough evaluation of our tool on a large-scale piece of software with similar characteristics to a flight system.",

        "abstract": "The proposed work focuses on implementing fast-response pressure-sensitive paint for measurements of unsteady pressure in rotorcraft applications. Significant rotorcraft problems such as dynamic stall, rotor blade loads in forward flight, and blade-vortex interaction all have significant unsteady pressure oscillations that must be resolved in order to understand the underlying physics. Installation of pressure transducers is difficult and expensive on rotorcraft models, and the resulting data has limited spatial resolution. Application of a fast-responding pressure-sensitive paint should provide unsteady surface pressure distributed over the blade surface. Fast PSP measurements have been demonstrated at NASA Langley on a 2-meter rotor model in hover and in forward flight by the ISSI/OSU team using two single camera systems. More recently, measurements were conducted in forward flight using multiple cameras and lasers at two azimuthal positions. We propose expanding this system for production testing. During Phase I, a lens controller + pan/tilt stages with Ethernet control and presets was developed. This device will be used to control the field of view of the system remotely. Mitigation of motion blur at the tip was demonstrated using a galvanic mirror. A temperature measurement capability using TSP was added to the system to allow temperature corrections to be applied to the PSP data. Fast efficient data processing software that included automatic image registration and scripting of repetitive operations was investigated to speed up data processing. These new tools and software will be integrated into the data acquisition package and data processing package to improve accuracy and productivity during testing.",

        "abstract": "During T-11 personnel parachute deployment, nylon canopy fabric is dragged across suspension lines and other parachute materials at high speeds, resulting in frictional heat damage. High strength cotton is used in sleeves, suspension stow line loops, deployment bags and as barrier fabrics between nylon webbings due to its low friction and heat buffering properties. Cotton yarn production and textile manufacturing in the US is decreasing due to the shift in textile manufacturing to Asia. The ability to purchase high strength cotton within the US, thereby maintaining Berry Amendment compliance, is becoming more difficult. There is a critical need for the Army to find an alternative domestically produced fabric that can perform like cotton as energy-absorbing buffers to protect the parachute canopies from damage during deployment. To meet the Army need, Luna has developed an inexpensive, durable finish that reduces the coefficient of friction of high strength commercial fabrics by greater than 50%, resulting in decreased frictional heating of parachute materials by over 60C in high friction simulated parachute deployment testing. These prospective replacement fabrics surpass the friction buffering capacity of the currently approved T-11 parachute buffer fabrics, eliminating the need for the purchase of foreign produced cotton.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The promise of lightweight, flexible and ubiquitous solar power depends greatly on the form factors available, their ruggedness and their cost. Nascent technologies based on organic active materials require substantial isolation from moisture vapor and oxygen to enable peak performance and lifetime. All the while, the incorporation of such devices into aero-platforms like UAVs and high altitude airships further drives requirements for low-mass and surface smoothness to reduce drag. In this project, we will optimize the ultra-barrier coating system identified in Phase I to minimize its mass, to optimize and quantify is barrier characteristics, to demonstrate ruggedness and durability consistent with the needs of the application, and ultimately to integrate it into sub-scale and full-size wingskin hardware for demonstration purposes.  BENEFIT:  The promise of co-cured solar wingskins is the enhancement of flight-time endurance enabled by the embedded solar array, which is capable of re-charging onboard batteries during flight. For UAV platforms that require re-fueling at regular intervals, the incorporation of solar cells into the wingskin can allow a unit to remain in its flight path for substantially longer than baseline, potentially limiting the number of planes coming and going into a specific area. The output of this Phase II effort is an ultra-barrier encapsulation and co-curing technology that enables very lightweight photovoltaic arrays to be incorporated into UAV wingskins. The encapsulation technology meets the mass needs of solar-enhanced UAVs, and meets the ultra-barrier needs of organic electronics.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This Program is concerned with providing Next Generation capability to the AF OAP and JOAP.  This takes the form of a portable, 35-lb analysis system called the Q5800A from Spectro, Inc.  Such an instrument provides the capability of comprehensive oil and debris monitoring that no technology in the Program or known to be commercially available can provide.  These long-standing, 40+ year programs, which have provided so much value to the DoD in terms of identifying aircraft issues and in doing so, saving lives, face the current challenge of needing to provide this analysis with aging, near-obsolete equipment that can no longer provide full aircraft monitoring needs.  The objective of this Phase II program is to prove that such a Q5800A system meets AF OAP and JOAP needs via undergoing a detailed testing protocol.    BENEFIT:  A Q5800A system which can provide quality analysis of neat oil, captured particulate, and can be expanded to provide a comprehensive suite of oil quality results (fluid mixup, viscosity, water content, aciditiy) and which is portable (35 lb.) at the same time simply does not exist on the market today and can provide AF OAP and JOAP with long-sought needs for a next-generation comprehensive analysis device.  Its commercial promise is similarly large.",

        "abstract": "The design concepts being considered for Heatshield for Extreme Entry Environment Technology (HEEET) rely on the use of 3D woven carbon fiber preforms.  Therefore, there is a need to be able to predict the properties and performance of a woven material.  Validation of predictive modeling tools would allow for the use of these tools to design and optimize the 3D weaves, significantly reducing the cost of fabrication and testing of a variety of configurations.  While there are proven tools for the prediction of laminate composite properties, textile composites are relatively new materials and much less effort has been focused on modeling this class of materials.\nTherefore, MR&D is proposing to use the lessons learned from the Phase I effort, to improve the strength prediction capabilities, evaluate the effects of porosity and molding of curved panels, and deliver a beta version of a 3D weave design optimization tool. A combined analytical and experimental program has been proposed.  The analytical effort involves modifying the current version of the 3D weave modeling tool, based on the lessons learned in the Phase I program, to include things such as unique bundle strengths for the different yarn types and improved failure criteria to improve the strength prediction capabilities.  It also includes increasing the current capabilities to allow for estimating properties of 3D woven composites with varying levels of porosity or that have been molded into curved panels.  The experimental effort involves fabrication and testing of various 3D woven reinforced composites (flat, curved, partially densified).  The properties obtained from this experimental effort will enable improved calibration of the modeling tools.  Finally, the final portion of the Phase II effort will focus on the preparation of a beta version of the 3D weave design optimization tool for delivery to NASA for use in heat shield design as well as other applications requiring the use of 3D woven preforms.",

        "abstract": "This program addresses the need for non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methods for quality assessment and defect evaluation of thermal protection systems (TPS).  Novel linear drive eddy current methods are proposed for NDE of carbon-based TPS materials, such as felts, rigid materials, and three dimensional woven fiber composites. Using a combination of physics-based models of layered media, including an eddy current micromechanical model extension for composites, multivariate inverse methods, high resolution imaging, and innovative sensor array constructs, the developed methods will independently measure the material characteristics of interest.  In Phase I, the focus was on adapting methods developed for carbon-based composite structures and laminates and demonstrating feasibility of these methods for felts, rigid materials, and three-dimensional woven composites.   In Phase II, the focus is on maturing this method, including the instrumentation hardware, models, and sensor designs, to provide scanning assessment and in-situ monitoring capabilities for TPS material condition assessment.  JENTEK's MWM-Arrays have a linear drive that permits both scanned type imaging and permanent installation for monitoring of anisotropic properties, temperature, and stresses at multiple depths.  The projected depth of the magnetic field into the test material can be adjusted through the sensor dimensions and excitation frequencies; this enables inspection of materials more than 1.0-in. thick and supports measuring far-side surface recession in ablator materials.  JENTEK delivered the MWM-Array solution used by NASA KSC on the Space Shuttle Leading Edge to detect damage of the Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) thermal protection tiles; thus JENTEK is well-positioned to deliver a practical TPS NDE solution.",

NASA estimates that the current Mars to Earth transfer rate of 6 Mbps might be increased to 600Mbps using a Laser Communication (LC) system.  Beam jitter caused by spacecraft-based motion must be reduced to sub-microradian levels to enable beaconless optical beam pointing.  ATA will create a Compact, Lightweight Isolation Platform (CLIP) that will host the LC collimator telescope and provide a stabilized platform to prevent the 150-microradian spacecraft disturbance environment from reaching the LC terminal.  To enable that stabilization, ATA will develop an ultra-low angular noise Capacitive Angular Position Sensor (CAPS).  The proposed sensor will have low power and high reliability, which ATA will demonstrate by producing TRL 4 prototypes in Phase I and TRL 5 CLIP engineering development unit (EDU) in Phase II.\nThe integrated CLIP overall design is a major innovation.  Most significantly, the platform payload capacity must increase from the typical few hundred grams to as much as 50 kilograms, roughly two orders of magnitude, but without major growth in the mass of the platform itself.  While the payload for most stable platforms is only a small fraction of the platform overall mass, the CLIP payload must be from more than half (3 kg) to as much as 94 percent of the total platform mass (3-50 kg payload + 3 kg platform).  Combined with the large payload range, the needed disturbance rejection from 150-microradian to less than 0.5-microradian across the broad frequency range of 0.1 to 500 Hz requires innovation in the platform suspension, high-performance actuators, servo controls, and structure.  Other programs have demonstrated these requirements individually, but the innovation CLIP provides is to combine structure, suspension, actuators, and sensors to give the required performance within the stringent 3-kg weight and 15-W power constraints.",

Phase I results include: 1) the demonstration via proof-of-concept prototypes of lossless compressive gains of 4x-20x for NAS Parallel Benchmarks, and 2) the formulation of COPA, a Compression OPportunities Auditing & discovery process that facilitates the analysis of any given large-scale code with the purpose of optimizing it for performance via data movement reduction.\nPhase II targets the consolidation of the new theory through two major thrusts: 1) the development of software that facilitates integrating high-yield compression into HPC codes, and 2) the further infusion of the technology into NASA applications. Thrust 1 will produce a fully functional prototype of a software suite for the automatic/semi-automatic acceleration of HPC codes via compression. The prototype will incorporate ease-of-infusion features (e.g., MPI-enabled compression and decompression routines), as well as ergonomic features that allow the seamless integration of new compression modules into the suite.

FFMDS is a FM architecture that will include algorithms to be run on each cluster module for fault detection, isolation, and recovery; software to be used at a ground station to direct recovery actions; and protocols for communication of fault information between cluster modules and between modules and the ground station. The architecture is service-oriented, so that algorithms for fault detection, isolation, and recovery can be added to or subtracted from the system as appropriate.",

        "abstract": "Constructing, maintaining, and adapting operational procedures for manned space operations is a complex task, requiring the procedure author to satisfy constraints resulting from the system configuration, current state, and a set of procedural constraints imposing additional restrictions on these procedures. For operations on NASA's International Space Station (ISS), these procedural constraints may be of several different types. Notes, Cautions, Warnings, and Inhibits are all relevant types of procedural constraints. Phase I of the Constraint-Checking Editor for Procedure Tracking (ConCEPT) established the feasibility of constructing a constraint-checking system for procedures represented in the Procedure Representation Language (PRL). Using automated translation and Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) generation technologies developed on previous projects, ConCEPT assists users in identifying conflicts and inconsistencies in PRL procedures as they are developed. The user edits a PRL procedure in the Procedure Integrated Development Environment (PrIDE), using procedure steps that have been annotated with procedural constraints. As the procedure is being developed, ConCEPT automatically and continuously gathers appropriate procedural constraints and checks them against the procedure. ConCEPT then alerts the user to any violated constraints. Phase I defined relevant scenarios of use and established feasibility by demonstrating a proof-of-concept system to relevant NASA flight controllers.",

The early systems are envisioned in the 10 to 100kWe range and have an anticipated design life of 8 to 15 years with no maintenance. A non-nuclear system ground test in thermal-vacuum is planned by NASA GRC to validate technologies required to transfer reactor heat, convert the heat into electricity, reject waste heat, process the electrical output, and demonstrate overall system performance. This SBIR project by ACT will develop a modular single-facesheet Variable Conductance Heat Pipe (VCHP) radiator, operating near 450K, to support the Technology Demonstration Unit (TDU) for surface power. Based on the Phase I results and the experience gained during previous NASA SBIR VCHP radiator programs, ACT and VST will develop in Phase II a low cost high specific power modular radiator for the TDU. New features of this radiator include direct bonding to the titanium condenser and the fact that it is modular and therefore, the CTE mismatch on the manifold direction is eliminated. The modular radiator will consist of 12 clusters of 9 modules each. ACT will design the modular radiator, validate the radiator module, fabricate the heat pipes and test the clusters in ambient conditions before sending them to GRC. VST will further develop the GFRC direct bonding and attach the GFRC fins to all the heat pipes.",

This device is well sized for spacecraft ranging in size from several tens of kilograms to several hundred kilograms.  It could be fueled by either xenon or iodine.  The latter yields performance like xenon, but stores at low pressure and high density, make it especially attractive for volume limited spacecraft.  The available specific impulse will be 1400-1600-s. The target thruster efficiency is 45%.  At 100-W and 1500-s, the thrust will be 6.1 mN.  The lifetime of the thruster may exceed 10,000 hours, yielding a throughput of greater than 14.9 kg.\n \nIn Phase I, the thruster was designed. Design considerations included efficiency, specific impulse, temperature, lifetime, mass, volume, and cost.  Careful attention to the magnetic field resulted in a \"magnetically shielded\" shape, which should minimize or entirely eliminate ion wall losses.  Testing with a nominal 200-W thruster showed the feasibility and desirability of both permanent magnets and a diamond discharge channel.  Permanent magnets save mass, volume, and power.  Diamond reduces ion sputtering by 50% with respect to conventional materials.\n\nIn Phase II, the 100-W thruster and a compact cathode to accompany it will be manufactured, tested, and improved.  Performance, lifetime, and plume properties will be evaluated.  Testing will include both xenon and iodine.  Year 2 development will focus on maximizing throughput.  Integrated testing will include a compact, low cost, power processing unit. The technology will reach TRL 5.\n\nThe program is responsive to NASA topic S3.03, Propulsion Systems. Both the \"Electric Propulsion\" and \"Micro-Propulsion\" sub-topics are relevant.

        "abstract": "The goal of the proposed effort is to use selective laser melting (SLM, an additive manufacturing technique) to manufacture a hot fire-capable, water-cooled spool piece that features an advanced regenerative cooling technique that combines high heat flux performance with low pressure drop. SLM enables us to \"print\" the spool piece in days, despite the complexity of the regenerative liner's inherent flow passage complexity. This reduction in manufacturing lead time, combined with the fact that SLM manufacturing costs are driven in large part by the amount of raw powder used during fabrication, results in a substantial cost reduction for future regeneratively-cooled rocket engines. Additionally, the proposed advanced regenerative cooling approach features a heat-pickup efficiency that is at least two orders of magnitude higher than traditional milled channel liners and/or brazed tube bundle chambers.\n\nAs a result of our Phase I activity and confidence in our commercialization path, we will be making a capital investment to stand up an SLM manufacturing capability in house.  We plan to augment that investment with an internally-funded trade study that we will use to derive main combustion chamber performance requirements for a future expander cycle engine.

To prevent excessive fuel loss from reaction with the hot hydrogen gas and uranium hydride formation, dense, fine-grained tungsten claddings are needed.

Oxygen and hydrogen isotopic records preserve history of water/rock interactions depending on chemistry and ambient conditions. Ratios of these isotopes are the main tool in paleoclimatology studies on Earth. A proposed non-contact optical instrument similar to ChemCam will be capable of measuring not only complete elemental compositions but also the key isotopic abundances in surface materials. We demonstrated the resolution and sensitivity required to determine these isotopes in synthetic samples and natural minerals relevant to Mars. We are utilizing and developing our recently published technology: Laser Ablation Molecular Isotopic Spectrometry (LAMIS). Our concept is simple and scientifically proven. We will advance to TRL4 with the further aim of integrating our LAMIS detector with a ChemCam-like instrument. The proposed effort leverages and advances the technology developed for ChemCam. The added strength of measuring isotopes will greatly expand the capabilities of the ChemCam, which is already a highly successful instrument onboard \"Curiosity\". We will develop a breadboard prototype of the instrument that can be later amended to measure other key isotopes (C, N, B, Cl, Mg, Ca, Sr). We plan further infusion in NASA missions and commercialization. The immediate focus is on Mars but our concept is also highly germane to future landing missions to the Moon, other planets and their moons, asteroids, and to a broad range of applications in ecology, agronomy, nuclear industry, radio-chemotherapy, forensics, security and other fields. Our instrument can be used for stand-alone landing missions or for in situ sample characterization prior to sample return.",

        "abstract": "Spacecraft for NASA, DoD and commercial missions need higher power than ever before, with lower mass, compact stowage, and lower cost. While high efficiency, space-qualified solar cells are in themselves costly, integrating them into a high performance Photovoltaic Assembly (PVA) using conventional glassing, interconnecting, stringing, tiling and laydown techniques can double their cost in $/Watt. The cost of solar power could be significantly reduced if the design of the Photovoltaic Assembly could be modified, modularized and standardized to be compatible with automated electronic assembly and terrestrial solar panel manufacturing methods. Additional benefits of such an approach include higher quality and consistency, improved qualification traceability, and robustness on thin flexible as well as rigid arrays. During the Phase I effort Vanguard successfully demonstrated automated pick-and-place, electrical interconnection, and adhesive dispensing adapted to our lightweight flexible Thin Integrated Solar (THINS) PVA. THINS uses multi-cell covers and advanced interconnection and encapsulation technology, which enables automated integration of traditional and advanced space qualified solar cells. Engineering economic analysis showed the potential for >30% PVA $/Watt cost reduction, while the encapsulation approach associated with THINS showed enhanced durability in space environments, even at high voltages and extreme thermal cycle environments. During the Phase II Program we will further enhance our automated sub-module manufacturing, and scale the approach to the module level. Automated assembly scale up will be performed while integrating into an existing deployable space structure platform, enhancing the TRL of a high performance high power application of automated cell integration scalable from tens to hundreds of kilowatts, and providing a credible commercialization path, all while reducing solar array costs by more than $150/W.",

Turboelectric propulsion for aircraft applications is envisioned, and cryogenic and superconducting components are sought. In particular, low AC loss superconducting wires for the stator windings and superconducting wires with filaments less than 10 micrometers in diameter are of interest. There is an intense push in the aircraft industry to ultimately develop an all-electric aircraft, with liquid hydrogen and fuel cells being considered as the prime generation source for aircraft propulsion. The U.S. is in competition with Europe for the development the next generation all-electric aircraft.  Superconductivity especially magnesium diboride (MgB2) superconductors are considered an enabling technology that is being investigated by NASA, Air Force, Rolls-Royce, Airbus and EADS.  This means the need for a low cost, low AC loss (fine filament superconductor) that can operate in the 10-25K temperature range in 0-2 tesla fields for superconducting stators for motors and generators.  This wire is need by 2016-2017 time frame so all cryogenic motors and generators can fabricated and tested in the NASA test bed.  In the Phase I Hyper Tech has shown that fine filament MgB2 wires can be fabricated and there is potential for low AC losses in the 60-400 Hz range for stators.  In the Phase II Hyper Tech will continue to work on developing, manufacturing, and testing fine filament MgB2 wire.  The wires will also be twisted to reduce coupling losses.  The wires will be tested for their superconductor and engineering current density and AC losses.  The result of this work will be a low AC loss MgB2 superconductor wire for enabling all-electric aircraft development and allow the U.S. industry to lead the world in this needed and rapid developing technology.",

For long duration exploration missions, minimal mass systems are desired that lessen logistical supply requirements for storing and distributing potable water. In particular, it is imperative that an effective biocide is used that prevents microbial growth, biofilm formation, and microbially induced corrosion in the water storage and distribution systems. To address these needs, Reactive Innovations, LLC successfully demonstrated a Phase I program that developed an electrochemical silver ion generator to produce an effective biocide solution for disinfecting water throughout the water storage and distribution system.

Further, to scale to wide use, engineers who are not formal methods experts must have usable tools, as automated as possible, integrated into their usual software development environments (IDEs).\n\nOur proposal, SPEEDY, is a user experience (UX) design for convenient generation, manipulation, and checking of specifications, directly in a common IDE (Eclipse).

We assessed many specification suggestion algorithms, selecting some to be implemented and evaluated on realistic software in Phase II.

Currently, the maximum power available from conventional solar arrays, for a given spacecraft, is limited by either the weight or stowage volume of the honeycomb panel substrates. Flexible substrate arrays can enable higher power spacecraft by improving specific power (W/kg) and specific volume (kW/m3) as well as improving the deployed natural frequency. Typical designs for flexible substrate array require a stiff boom mechanism to deploy the array and provide the deployed structure. Heritage flexible substrate arrays have used metallic slit-tube or coilable longeron booms. To be feasible, large, next-generation flexible substrate solar arrays require deployable booms that are more thermally stable than metallic slit-tubes (STEMs), and less expensive and lighter than coilable longeron booms (i.e. AstroMast).  To address this need, CTD has developed the Stable Tubular Extendible Lock-Out Composite Boom (STELOC Boom).  The STELOC Boom can provide stiffness equivalent to coilable longeron booms with a significantly reduced volume, mass and cost.

Modern spacecraft, for example, may have thousands of sensors and hundreds of systems/subsystems (and extensive cabling) but relatively few FM co-solutions. Theoretically, the overall FM challenge is in monitoring, modeling, and managing the huge numbers of signals and then determining how to detect them and set appropriate handling actions.\n\nFor complex systems FM is not trivial, and automated FM is tasked with catching potential failure conditions within interconnected networks before consequences elevate.

These components are utilized to protect high power amplifiers (HPA) during the transmit cycle from destabilizing, and potentially harmful, power reflections from the antenna element. During receive cycle these components are utilized to direct lower power received signals with minimal attenuation to the low noise amplifiers (LNA). As such, performance specifications of these ferrite control components, such as bandwidth, insertion loss, isolation, power handling, temperature stability, radiation hardness, and linearity impose strict limitations on the overall system performance. Over the course of the proposed Ph1 SBIR program self-biased ferrite control components based on highly textured hexagonal ferrite compacts which have the potential to eliminate biasing magnets and significantly reduce the size, cost, and weight of the TRM while concurrently increasing power handling capability, and improving temperature stability and radiation hardness will be investigated. Specifically, a research and development path to realizing high performance self-biased ferrite materials and device designs for operation in space based environments at Ka-band (>27 GHz, 31.5 - 34 GHz targeted) is outlined.",

Detecting Earthlike planets existing within the habitable zones of nearby stars is a key element of NASA's space exploration mission.  The NASA JPL starshade incorporates a deployable center ring-truss as a hub and flower-like petals that wrap around the hub for packaging.  As a result, it exhibits exceptionally challenging deployment kinematics.  Roccor's Phase II will contribute to maturing the design of the NASA JPL deployable starshade through system and component design and analysis and supporting ground-demo hardware thereby helping to position it for spaceflight should it be transitioned to a NASA flight mission.Roccor's broad Phase II focus is on maturing each of the deployable starshade system elements that support the petals including the unfurling control system, the launch control system, and the deployed strut system.  Innovative solutions have been conceptualized for each of these petal support functions as part the Phase I program.  \nIn Phase II, Roccor will emphasize developing and demonstrating the proposed petal unfurling technology culminating in a 1/3 scale fully functional and motorized hardware demonstration with 30 petal simulators, 3 of them being instrumented and strength-representative (e.g. fragile and narrow petal tips).

At millimeter-wave frequencies, these GaN devices have demonstrated power densities of 5 to 8 times higher than GaAs or InP devices. Further, we are proposing to operate these devices in a quasi-switching mode, which has demonstrated, in Phase I simulations, drain efficiencies approaching 70%. The resulting MMIC, operating over the 106 to 114 GHz band, will produce an output power of one watt and an efficiency of greater than 33%. Secondly, we are proposing to utilize a new low loss, H-tee combining approach to combine 4 of these high-efficiency chips to achieve 4 watts. The net result is a unique combination of high performance devices and innovative power combining. We anticipate that this work will result in an order of magnitude increase in the state-of-the-art of SSPA output power and efficiency at F-band.

More recently, miniaturization of high-performance programmable integrated circuit technologies as embodied in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), as well as rapid advances in high-speed data conversion technologies at a gigasample per second and beyond, have enabled the implementation of direct-conversion radio frequency (RF) systems, including radar, that operate almost completely in the digital domain. In addition, solid-state high-power RF device technologies have improved in efficiency and speed to the point where highly efficient pulsed transmit sources are possible. As these device technologies have matured, their application in space environments has accelerated to the point where extremely flexible programmable radar systems can be implemented in a very small size, weight, and power footprint. Trident Systems has developed a powerful radar architecture called RAPTOR, validating it through flight testing on a number of Department of Defense programs. In Phase I of this effort, Trident Systems developed and validated a design concept for a flexible, programmable space-qualifiable digital radar transceiver (SQDRT) based on RAPTOR.  This was accomplished through a comprehensive development process consisting of mission and requirements analysis, component trade studies, design analysis and simulation, and interface & form factor trade studies.  The objective of the Phase II effort is to successfully produce a functioning form-factor prototype of the SQDRT, through a comprehensive program of system modeling and simulation, detailed digital & RF electronic design, FPGA firmware development, mechanical design, fabrication, integration, and testing, culminating in a prototype demonstration.

The NATPEN includes a nanocarrier (NC) loaded with specific drugs, a biocompatible gel to contain the NC, and a microneedle patch for transdermal delivery of the therapeutic. The innovations in the NATPEN as a topical treatment modality will enable minimally invasive, extended, targeted delivery of drugs to the peripheral terminals of the sensory neurons. The NATPEN modality has minimal toxicity and is easy to administer. In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of the NATPEN concept by developing a prototype of a topical drug delivery system capable of transporting the therapeutic through skin and having nerve targeting capability and controlled release of the drug. In Phase II, POC plans to optimize, demonstrate, and validate the therapeutic modality in animal models of PN. The FDA approval pathway will be outlined and considered at each developmental stage.",

Our modeling will extend the well-established 4-layer model to a general N-layer model, and within each of the lower foliage layers incorporate a random distribution of tree trunks. We will calibrate our CEM-based model with existing and newly collected data and validate our methodology using full-wave simulation of selected environments. Through rigorous numerical Monte Carlo studies and closed-form analytical techniques, we will derive channel models appropriate for different communications frequency bands.

The RMSF core is comprised of a dispersive spectrometer that images the sample spectrum from 3 \u0096 5.5 micron onto a digital micro-mirror device (DMD) such that different columns correspond to different wavebands.  By applying masks to this DMD, a matched spectral filter can be applied in hardware.  This results in a highly flexible system that can address a wide variety of chemicals by simply updating the DMD masks applied and a wide variety of applications through modular hardware design.  Use of the DMD and a single element detector in place of a conventional FPA results in significantly reduced cost and improved performance in terms of image uniformity, pixel operability, and dynamic range.

The latter will provide the ability to safely operate the cryocooler system off of virtually any spacecraft power bus from all perspectives, meaning that the cryocooler system will be protected from transient effects from a \"dirty bus,\" and the cryocooler will not impart back onto the power bus large amplitude current ripple that would otherwise affect the performance of other devices on the bus.",

The structural retrofitting concepts steer and dissipate blast and impact energy in order to enhance sensor survivability while providing a known transfer function that allows impact reconstruction from sampled wavefield data. Sensor interrogation electronics will be also be developed to wake-up and capture high-speed sensor data when necessary.

        "abstract": "Over the past decade, research into active combustion control has yielded impressive results in suppressing thermoacoustic instabilities and widening the operational range of gas-turbine combustors. Active Combustion Instability Control (ACIC) controls the combustion process such that the heat release profile is modulated to dampen the naturally occurring thermoacoustic instabilities. A major challenge to effective implementation of active combustion control is the availability of valves and actuators that provide adequate flow modulation control authority. The majority of the published work revolves around valves designed to modulate the main combustor flow. At present these valves are not designed to operate in a harsh environment and as such are required to be located outside the main flow path, reducing their control authority. To effectively meet the challenge, valves and sensors that are smaller, more responsive and robust must be developed. Ultimately the control valves are co-located with the fuel injection manifold. The trade-off for the harsh environment operation is the ability to maximize the flow modulation control authority. The objective of this research is to integrate the required control authority into an operational environment. This research continues the development of a light weight fast-acting fuel control valve for harsh environment operation. In the Phase 1 effort, the valve demonstrated the ability to modulate fluid flow at 1,000 Hz.  This demonstrated the valve will allow the precise time dependent fuel control required for lean-burn combustor operability. In this Phase II research a Prototype valve is designed, fabricated and flow tested using commercially-available driver circuitry to  demonstrate valve operation in harsh thermal environments.",

        "abstract": "NASA's future X-ray astronomy missions will require X-ray optics that have large effective areas, are lightweight, and cost effective.  Recent X-ray telescopes, such as the Chandra Observatory, utilized reflectors made from zerodur which were up to 20mm thick.  The thickness of these reflectors, as well as the mass, limited the number of nested optics that could be implemented.  Current state of the art telescopes, such as those found on XMM-Newton, utilize reflectors made from an electroforming process with shell thicknesses on the order of 1mm.  This reduction in thickness has enabled a larger number of reflectors to be implemented, 58 nested reflectors in the case of XMM-Newton, but the weight still needs to be significantly reduced for future missions.  The proposed innovation seeks to improve upon the current state of the art by replacing much of the NiCo with a stiff, lightweight, ceramic material.  A thermal spray process, which was tested for feasibility in Phase I, will be enhanced to allow for the deposition of porosity graded alumina onto the rear surface of the NiCo reflector. Several diagnostic techniques will be employed to adjust the in-flight particle state as well as the residual stress of the coating as to not adversely affect the micro roughness of the optical surface as well as the figure accuracy of the optic. The gradation of the alumina layer will allow for CTE matching with the electroformed shell as well as optimization of the ceramic stiffness.  By reducing the NiCo layer from 1mm to less than 100um with a 200um alumina layer as the support structure the overall mass of the telescope can be greatly reduced allowing for a greater number of reflectors to be nested.",

For deep space applications at long operational ranges, high performance stabilization of the space terminal data link is required. To meet this need, CDI has developed a novel application of our free-floating isolation platform. Based upon a Shuttle-proven technology, this approach yields 6-DOF isolation from the disturbances of the host vehicle while providing high-bandwidth active stabilization to attenuate both payload disturbances as well as any residual disturbances transferred from the base across the power/data umbilical. The proposed approach is designed to achieve better than 0.5microradian-rms stabilization for all frequencies above 0.1Hz when operating on a spacecraft.\n\nPhase I developed the design concept, demonstrated robustness through sensitivity studies, demonstrated performance through simulation, and establish the feasibility of the approach to meet the space terminal isolation requirements. Component testing of the sensors and actuators further demonstrated that the design will meet the performance requirements. These tests and analyses advanced the technology to TRL-4.\n\nPhase II continues the development by ground testing an end-to-end prototype on a soft suspension testbed to demonstrate overall performance in a simulated low-g operational environment. Both acquisition search and beacon track will be demonstrated. Iterations of development and environment testing are performed to produce several space qualified 2-axis strut assemblies for delivery to NASA. Three strut assemblies rigidly mounted to any space terminal will provide 6-DOF isolation and high-bandwidth stabilization.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project represents a new development in man?s ability to keep birds away from the airspace surrounding an airplane or out of the way of the massive rotors of wind turbines. Animals respond to a bright ultraviolet light in the same way as humans respond to a bright flashlight in their eyes. If the light is strong enough, it causes an involuntary behavioral response resulting in the animal being deterred from the area of the light source. Ultraviolet light has the advantage of being visible to most species of animals while being invisible to humans. This Phase II project builds on the Phase I project that demonstrated with 98% confidence that bird behavior is influenced by the presence of the wildlife deterrence system?s bright ultraviolet light in a completely natural environment with no human presence. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is focused on three high value applications of the wildlife deterrence system. They are renewable alternative energy (wind farms), air transportation (planes and airports), and agriculture (aquaculture and agriculture). Renewable energy is at the top of the U.S. priority list. Wind energy is one of the most promising forms of alternative energy. At the same time, there is an immediate and pressing need to reduce the mortality rate of endangered and protected species at wind farms. A compelling global need for the wildlife deterrence system is exemplified by the aviation industry and the incidence of bird strikes. The U.S. Department of Transportation Inspector General reported in August 2012 that in the past two decades, wildlife strikes have increased from 1,770 reported in 1990 to 9,840 reported in 2011, a greater than five-fold increase. Thirdly, although not at the level of importance as protection of aircraft and deterrence of birds from wind farm turbine rotors, worldwide seafood demand has grown annually by 8.3 percent since 1970. This means that worldwide aquaculture production has rapidly expanded. Of particularly promising potential are solutions to the mussel farming problems of the international aquaculture industry which is well established in many parts of the world. All producing locations in North America and Europe share a common problem of severe predation loss from diving ducks such as the Common Eider that can be devastating to the mussel producer, with the potential to wipe out an entire crop (100%).",

This directly addresses the need for improved biopharmaceutical production monitoring. The current manual sampling and off-line analysis methods have significant limitations including contamination risks and inherent time delays that severely limit process control. The primary objectives of this effort include the optimization of a high brightness super luminescent diode (SLD) light source and the accompanying optical probe. The SLD provides the light throughput that is required for quantitative in situ measurements, and is perfectly suited for light coupling to an optical-fiber probe. This approach has the added advantage of multiplexing, thereby enabling a single monitor system to simultaneously track analyte concentrations in multiple bioreactors. Both the probe and SLD will be rigorously tested through a series of benchtop and live fermentation evaluations. The ultimate outcome of this effort will be a market-ready, probe-based bioreactor monitor compatible with the major expression platforms in the biopharmaceutical industry. The broader impact/commercial potential of this proposed project, if successful, will be to enable the fast-growing biopharmaceutical industry to make game-changing advances in the development and production of critically important drugs. By replacing current manual chemical measurement methods performed during the production of biopharmaceuticals with automated and continuous monitoring, this real-time probe-based monitor will enable needed improvements in process efficiency, lead to reduced development costs, and accelerate the time to market for state-of-the-art drugs. Because of the high value of these medications, and the driving market need, the commercial potential for this real-time monitor is significant with a specific market niche estimated at $510 million in the U.S. alone, residing in the larger global biologics market estimated at $239 billion by 2015.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will finalize the Grip-Act-Reposition (GAR) Miniaturized Stable Working Platform for Minimally Invasive Procedures Inside Active Organs - with initial focus on treating Atrial Fibrillation (AF). A common procedure for treating AF is Radiofrequency (RF) Catheter Ablation in the heart. A catheter with an electrode is used to deliver RF electrical current to tissue ? burning paths that electrically isolate the fibrillation trigger sources. With existing catheter-based devices, ablation lines must be formed from a high number of discrete lesions created sequentially. Forming contiguous lesions in the beating heart is challenging, resulting in long procedure times and first-time success rates as low as 30% for some forms of AF. GAR will revolutionize catheter-based minimally invasive procedures. GAR will (i) provide a mechanism to enter a body cavity or organ, including those such as the heart or lungs which move constantly; (ii) clamp to a tissue wall, and (iii) create a stable platform from which to operate and/or deliver various local treatments (energy, pharmaceuticals) to tissues. Additionally, the rotating gear mechanism and simple grasp-and-release function will allow repositioning within the cavity in a continuous line or arc without losing contact with the tissue wall. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to a) improve healthcare in both the U.S. and worldwide and b) generate revenue and US manufacturing jobs in a $5 billion market space. Atrial Fibrillation (AF) affects 2-3 million Americans, and approximately 20 million people worldwide. The cost to the U.S. healthcare system is an estimated $6.65 billion annually in procedures and, more commonly, maintenance medications. Major limitations to existing catheter ablation procedures are cost ($12,000+), time (4+ hours), and success rate (30-80%). Typical solutions to AF are often treatment with medications costing $3,000+ yearly with many side-effects. GAR will reduce procedure time - in the case of RF ablation to 1 hour- and improve success rates, reducing the need for repeat catheter ablation procedures. Cardiac ablation will become a more viable treatment for patients on maintenance medications. Additionally, GAR can be applied in other medical applications and conditions, such as repairing difficult bleeds in the intestines, where precise navigation within a moving organ, loose tissue, or a body cavity is desired. The project will also result in additional collaboration between academic and commercial institutions to take the technology to market, along with training opportunities for both high-school and college interns.",

Using the application developed in this Phase II SBIR, instructors will be able to generate and deliver quizzes quickly enough for ad-hoc in-class use and easily enough to integrate frequent practice and diagnostic tests into daily instruction. This will enable instructors to better evaluate students, keep students engaged, and tailor their instruction to student needs. Students will be able to take more practice tests, which evidence shows helps retain and recall class content, and administrators will obtain more data tied directly to student outcomes. Expected benefits include increased student success rates and richer data that universities and accreditation agencies can analyze to evaluate and improve programs. In addition, this Phase II SBIR will implement, test and improve techniques for automated question generation and outcomes alignment that can be used in other applications.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project develops positron emission tomography (PET) imaging products to manage neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. PET is now a key diagnostic and management tool in oncology, and compounds labeled with [18F]-fluoride provide optimal signal to noise ratios and resolution in medical imaging applications. Ground Fluor Pharmaceuticals (GFP) developed proprietary single-step fluorination technology that allows [18F]-labeled medicines to be prepared efficiently from cyclotron-produced [18F]-fluoride. Under this Phase II research project GFP will apply its new technology to produce the imaging agent 6- [18F]fluoro-L-DOPA (FDOPA), a compound useful in diagnosing Parkinson&#039;s disease and in cancer imaging, that is not currently readily available because of the difficulty in its production. GFP will scale-up and manufacture pharmaceutical grade ALPDOPA (GFP&#039;s precursor to FDOPA) under pharmaceutical cGMP conditions, and offer this material for research studies and for clinical imaging. GFP will develop an FDA drug master file and will provide technical and regulatory assistance to cyclotron pharmacy customers adopting GFP&#039;s technology for commercial production of FDOPA. In addition to helping to bring this valuable imaging agent to market, GFP will assist academic and pharmaceutical research groups in the development of new [18F]- fluorinated imaging products. The broader impact/commercial potential is to expand the scope and utility of PET as medical diagnostic tool, thereby improving treatment and management of serious medical problems. Although [18F]-fluoride possesses, perhaps, the most advantageous properties for imaging, is relatively inexpensive, and is widely available, it is difficult to incorporate into medicines for imaging. GFP has developed a general enabling technology that uses the relatively inexpensive and widely available form of [18F]-fluoride to create new molecular imaging agents to advance personalized medicine. This technology, and the compounds it creates, will provide the physician with new opportunities to diagnose, assess, and more efficiently treat unmet medical needs. The manufacturing technology developed here is a broad platform applicable to the preparation of a wide range of new imaging agents. The commercial potential of PET imaging is significant; the worldwide market for PET is expected to grow to $15 billion by 2015.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Program (SBIR) Phase II project advances antenna technology and wireless network performance by developing a new kind of wireless mesh network node, i.e. integrated router, radio and antenna, and the software necessary to create a network of such devices. Networking is an important productivity resource, but can come at a high cost especially for high-data rates. Dramatic capacity gains in urban wireless networks are achieved by deploying directional antennas to minimize interference and allow substantial frequency reuse. Indoor mounting of nodes in windows is desirable to avoid complications with landlords, avoid weather, and decrease RF path loss. Finally, larger antennas produce more directionality, so the desired wireless node needs a large surface area and yet must be something that people are willing to hang in their windows, i.e. transparent and attractive. This project is using transparent conductive coatings with a novel combination of beam steering and Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) radio technology to develop a mostly transparent wireless node that achieves a&lt;15 degree wide beam that is electronically steerable over&gt;110 degrees. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes increased US competitiveness by facilitating the spread of high speed Internet access and through the sale of innovative new devices in the US and worldwide. Community networks will deploy these nodes, as they are the lowest cost and simplest way to create an inter-building network. In particular, delivering signals via windows overcomes RF absorption in the masonry structures typical of public housing projects. Successful commercialization of this technology will significantly reduce the cost and increase the performance of urban wireless networks, thus helping extend Internet access to un- and under-served neighborhoods and reducing the cost of offloading 3G/4G wireless traffic to local Wi-Fi hotspots.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to further develop large-scale manufacturing methods for inorganic semiconductor nanowires. These nanowires will be used to make printed photosensors, a superior alternative to conventional light sensing devices. Traditional synthetic methods for nanowires are extremely expensive, and only produce extremely small quantities of nanowires. The proposed technology seeks to produce a cost-effective method to make nanowires at large scale. Without a reduction in cost, and an increase in production volumes, commercial products based on nanowires are still not viable. By developing effective printing techniques, this program will significantly drive down the cost to produce printed photosensors. A specific demonstration objective is to use these nanowires to make a printed photosensing device with performance characteristics similar to conventional devices. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to provide innovative and superior technologies for printed and flexible electronics compared to what is available today. Flexible electronics technology is expected to be increasingly applied in a variety of applications including energy (photovoltaics, batteries, and lighting), consumer devices (displays, sensors, actuators), healthcare (sensors), communication: radio frequency identification (RFID), and defense (sensors, photovoltaics, displays). The area of flexible electronics is a rapidly growing global market. Appropriate novel technologies must be developed to replicate current solid state devices; these include printable semiconductors, insulators, and conductors. The manufacturing technology being developed in this project will facilitate the use of inorganic semiconducting nanowires for printed photo sensors with both flexible and transparent characteristics.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop a faster and more accurate optical instrument for studying live cells and tissues. The study of live cells has yielded numerous discoveries (e.g. germ theory, the Krebs cycle, cell division) and is important for drug discovery and disease treatment. Live cells are transparent and need to be observed for long periods of time (days, weeks) in their natural state. To make the cells visible and measure them quantitatively, current state of the art instruments require injecting the cells with staining agents or light emitting fluorophores. Both processes are invasive, labor intensive and expensive and long term observations of live cells is difficult: staining embalms the cells and the fluorophores fade quickly and kill the cells in hours. The Phase I project produced a proof-of-concept prototype that provides quantitative imaging of live cells by processing the light transmitted through the cells in their natural state. Completion of the Phase II objectives will upgrade the Phase I prototype to a commercial grade instrument: improve optical design and build a housing enclosure, develop commercial grade software and automate the hardware controls and develop task-specific software applications to solve particular biological problems. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable life scientists with a new and powerful instrument for studying live cells. The greatest impact of the commercial instrument developed in Phase II project will have is enabling researchers to do science better than before, i.e., more accurately, more quantitatively, and more noninvasively. The range of breakthroughs enabled by the instrument will likely include: novel drug discovery by accurate monitoring of cell response to treatment, fundamental studies of cell proliferation and growth, minimally invasive automatic diagnosis of cancer biopsies, and fast and accurate blood testing instruments. Scaling up the production of the instrument will create new jobs and increase the US dominance in the biotechnology area. Due to their full automation, the instruments can also operate in areas with limited access to trained personnel and provide the digital data necessary for remote diagnosis, such as Medically Underserved Areas/Populations in United States.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project is designed to improve academic advising and access to advising to over 11 million community college students. Community colleges serve a significant population of non-traditional adult students seeking associates degrees and vocational training to improve their job and career prospects. Currently only one in four students enrolled in community colleges graduate. The project will fund the completion of a knowledge based software system that utilizes the knowledge of academic advisors, codifies and converts their collective expertise into an advanced, knowledge based system that mirrors guidance and recommendations that an expert advisor would provide a student. Using this program community colleges, under pressure to improve graduation rates while confronted with severe budget cuts, will be able to economically expand the availability of advising services to large numbers of students. The program can be tailored to individual campuses connecting their course offerings to a student&#039;s recommended major and provide a wide variety of career advisement support materials. The program also builds on national movements to advise students with career clusters and career pathways in order to improve student completion rate. The broader / commercial impact of the project is to benefit over 2,300 two year colleges serving 11 million students, many of whom are not receiving any or adequate academic advising. Nationally experts are beginning to realize that stronger academic advising is a critical component to improving graduation rates. However, due to the cost of providing one on one advising is high and schools and faced with reduced budgets, campuses need tools to expand their advising without adding significantly to their budgets. Nowhere is this more acute than at the community college level where only one in four students graduate and students report advisement as a major weakness in their progress toward degree and college completion. This project will complete the development of a nationally available instrument that upgrades academic advisement for a broad, currently under-served population of students who receive little or no advisement. The knowledge-based system is built around a nationally accepted career clusters concept. It supports a diminishing number of advisors at high school and two year colleges, as well as advisors at workforce development and other non-campus agencies. The program is already supported by three state community college boards in California, Washington and Nevada.",

The technology can be used to create special effects, take measurements in engineering, and automatically check product quality in factories. Current 3D imaging systems are often too expensive, too slow, or too inaccurate to provide viable commercial solutions. This project will develop new techniques for three areas within the broader topic of 3D imaging: reconstruction, inspection, and motion capture. The objective of the project is to develop fast software that can run on low-cost, commercially available sensors and computing hardware. The software will be designed to take advantage of new kinds of computer processors found in computers and mobile phones: heterogeneous processors. To provide high-quality results on this emerging computing platform, the project will develop new mathematical and software approaches. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will result from the introduction of low-cost, high performance 3D imaging tools to the marketplace. 3D printing is an example of the way in which reducing cost and making a technology easier to use can create entirely new applications and markets. The research objectives of this project will lead to 3D imaging products that are cheaper and easier to use than today&#039;s solutions. 3D imaging addresses large and growing markets in engineering, inspection, manufacturing, surveying, and product development. It can enhance these industries by reducing costs and saving time. Making the technology easier to use will allow it to be adopted more widely, cultivating new vocational skills and opportunities.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to develop small size, light-weight, and affordable personal particulate matter (PM) dosimeters. The targeted battery powered instrument almost the size of a fountain pen can be clipped onto clothing and freely carried around. The instrument can sample the surrounding air, separate airborne particles into several size ranges, and measure the mass of particles collected from the air sample in each size range. The instrument is comprised of a miniaturized cascade impactor with micro-electromechanical resonant balances embedded within, as impaction substrates. The cascade impactor configuration separates airborne particles based on their size and deposits them onto the resonant balance surfaces. Added mass of the deposited particles causes a negative shift in the resonant frequency of the microscale resonant balances. Integrated electronics within the system measure the resonator frequency changes and calculate the deposited mass and consequently PM concentration in the air flow in real-time. Development of such instruments would be a major leap forward, not only in aerosol science and technology, but also in microsystems technology. This product would be the first commercial product using a microscale mass balance in a sensory application and could open the door to other possibilities. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in industrial hygiene for high dust work environments such as coal mines, underground construction sites, stone and wood cutting facilities, etc. Aerosol particles in the diameter range of a few microns and below pose serious threats to human health. While larger particles are filtered out by human nose and throat, finer particles can reach deep into the lungs and even other organs through the blood stream. It is well established that exposure to high particulate matter concentrations increases risk of various chronic diseases, lowers life expectancy, and in extreme cases leads to severe untreatable conditions such as Silicosis. Currently available particulate monitoring systems cannot address the need for a versatile, convenient, highly portable PM monitor. More importantly, the convenience, affordability, and versatility of the instrument allow tighter monitoring of PM levels and protecting every individual worker from harmful PM exposures. This could be a lifesaver for millions of workers in high risk environments.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a production prototype of an automated nanoscale manufacturing process monitoring tool based on the resonance force microscope (RFM). The tool will combine image force microscopy (IFM, a version of RFM that measures the linear part of the susceptibility) and scattering near-field optical microscopy (sSNOM) with atomic force microscope for use in the hard disk drive (HDD) and semiconductor industries. sSNOM measures the dipole-dipole interaction force while IFM measures the dipole-dipole force gradient, both with nanometer spatial resolution. These techniques allow direct imaging of resonances associated with electrons, phonons, and plasmons. The capability to image plasmon resonances is well suited to probe the near-field (NF) profile associated with a plasmonic structure called near-field transducer (NFT) utilized in heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR). With HAMR universally viewed as the next generation technology for HDD industry, the need for a monitoring tool for mass production of HAMR head is acute since there is currently no simple way to probe the NF profile of NFTs. The objectives of the proposed project are (1) to successfully prototype an automated NFT characterization tool and (2) to field test it with one or more HDD manufacturers. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be felt not only in the HDD industry but across many industries. While the monitoring of NFT production is the near-term niche application for the automated tool, the same tool will have longer-term value for in-line characterization of physical and chemical properties of nanoscale materials and structures in the manufacturing environment of diverse industries, including, for example, the measurement of stress in the channel layer and chemical characterization of defects in semiconductor industry and monitoring of protein-based pharmaceuticals. In R &amp; D and academic settings, the RFM technique provides the capability to image individual biomolecules in situ, such as for the real-time monitoring of membrane protein dynamics on cells, which will provide unprecedented utility in biomedical and clinical research. A reliable label-free imaging tool with the capability to identify chemical bond information at the molecular level will potentially bring about revolutionary advances in many fields of basic and applied biological science, including drug discovery, proteomics, structural biology, and personalized medicine.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is aimed at the design and manufacture of agents useful for the diagnosis and treatment of breast and other cancers. The primary product is a novel water-soluble molecule constructed from poly(ethylene glycol) (or PEG), containing multiple arms with folate groups as well as a diagnostic agent. The folate groups will target cancer cells preferentially over healthy cells and the fluorescent diagnostic agent will allow effective breast cancer diagnosis. This targeting molecule differs from currently available materials in that the length and number of the PEG arms as well as the attachment of folate groups can be very carefully and reproducibly controlled, addressing a critical weakness with previous multifunctional devices. The precision synthesis steps are catalyzed by an enzyme, leading to very pure products. Currently three folate-targeted diagnostic molecules are in Phase III clinical trials, but all are based on small molecules and a single folate targeting group. The advantage of a polymer-based device with multiple folate groups will be a longer circulation time in the body with more effective targeting of cancer cells. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant since by 2020 approximately 18.2 million Americans will be diagnosed with cancer. Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in both white and African-American women. One in eight American women develops breast cancer, and a new patient is diagnosed in every three minutes. Chemotherapy has many side effects such as hair loss and nausea, and requires extended patient care. Specific targeting is a significant advantage for diagnostic and chemotherapeutic agents. When a drug is delivered directly to the cancer cell to kill it, the collateral damage of healthy cells is minimized. New delivery devices are badly needed for cancer diagnosis and therapy, and if successful this project will provide both a new diagnostic agent as well as a platform technology for additional products. Another impact of this project is the use of an enzyme-catalyzed green manufacturing process which minimizes wasteful by-products. In the longer term, the market potential will be significant as the technology is adapted to specific diagnostic and therapeutic products.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is focused on network forecasting, a new approach to securing industrial control networks. In essence, network forecasting involves monitoring all devices on a network, and for each device using past behavior to predict near-term future behavior. Deviation from predicted behavior then signals a potential issue. The intellectual merit of the innovation lies in its departure from traditional network security paradigms. Traditional approaches, such as signature-based anti-virus and intrusion prevention systems, detect misbehaviors by recognizing repeats of past behaviors. These approaches necessarily overlook one-of-a-kind or zero-day misbehaviors. In contrast, network forecasting incorporates an understanding of correct and expected network behavior so that aberrant behavior can be identified even if it has not been seen before. The approach builds on the company&#039;s previous work in understanding the active roles that devices assume on a network. When predicted network device behavior fails to match reality on the network, network operators can respond without needing to fully understand the details of the threat that caused the disturbance. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is substantial because critical infrastructure - such as a power generation and distribution grid - represents both a significant investment and a substantive vulnerability in modern society. While recent cyber-attacks may have heightened public awareness of the threats to critical infrastructure, such infrastructure has been the object of sustained concern from government and private-sector groups for many years. However, while the need for increased security in critical infrastructure has grown over time, the effectiveness of network security methods has not kept pace with the sophistication and impact of cyber-attacks. If successful, network forecasting has the potential to transform the security and monitoring practices in nearly all domains of critical infrastructure. Continued technological advances and economic growth presume the existence of secure, networked critical infrastructure. Substantial advances in the security of such infrastructure, such as that promised by the technology being developed in this project, can help protect the future of our society.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop a novel technology that will enable non-surgical treatment of gallstone disease. Symptomatic gallstone disease occurs when gallstones obstruct the outlet of the gallbladder and prevent the flow of bile. Obstruction can result in significant pain and if left untreated can lead to dangerous infections. The most common and effective treatment for gallstone disease today is surgical removal of the gallbladder, or cholecystectomy. Unfortunately, many patients are not eligible for surgery due to other complicating medical conditions or very old age, and the surgery itself can have complications. This project will develop a catheter-implanted device contained within the gallbladder to prevent stones from reaching the outlet. The procedure is quick and requires only local anesthesia, making it safe for elderly and sick patients. This project will finalize the design of the device, evaluate its safety in an animal study, evaluate its biocompatibility with biologic, chemical, and mechanical tests, and transfer the design to a manufacturable product. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes helping gallstone disease patients who are not eligible for surgery, providing an alternative for patients who prefer not to have surgery, and significantly decreasing overall healthcare costs. While gallbladder surgery is currently the standard of care for symptomatic gallstone disease, surgery is not without risks ? complications can occur from general anesthesia or the surgical procedure, and post-operative pain and digestive disorders are common. The new proposed procedure is expected to be faster and safer than the current standard of care. In addition, the proposed device enables patients to keep their gallbladders, maintaining normal digestive function. Considering the large population of patients with symptomatic gallstone disease (approximately 1.3 million annually in the U.S.), the decreased procedure time, recovery time, and overall healthcare costs could be very significant.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will optimize large-scale production of latex polymers from alkyl itaconates. These latexes represent a new class of polymers that offer desirable properties in wood, textile, paper and adhesive coatings, including low odor, no VOC contribution, and bio-based production. Itaconix has previously developed cost-effective emulsion polymerization processes to produce this new class of polymers. The research objective for this project is to scale and optimize these processes for use in large production reactors. The expected result is commercial quantities of itaconate latexes. The project is highly innovative and will enable a major new class of latex polymers that are novel, offer desired coating properties, are made from renewable resources, and will accelerate the development of integrated bio-refineries. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is a significant expansion in the potential use of competitive bio-based products. Many of the current bio-based products under development, such as bio-acrylic acid, are drop-in replacements for petroleum-based versions of the same product. Future use of such drop-ins often depends on complexities of commodity prices, short-term economic objectives and long- term environmental goals. The benefits from producing and using of itaconate latexes are straight forward and uncomplicated. These products offer novel chemistry with unique functionality at competitive price/performance to petroleum-based products. They are safe for humans and the environment to manufacture and use. They are made from renewable resources and will accelerate the development of high-value-added bio-refineries, and from paints to paper, consumers are seeking to increase the bio-content and use of renewable resources in the products that they buy. Commercial scale production and use of itaconate latexes will expand opportunities in the U.S. to meet all of these objectives.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to fabricate and commercialize Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) that are free from any wavelength limitations imposed by the choice of semiconductor substrate. These revolutionary VCSELs will operate in a single mode with high output power, narrow linewidth and a stable linear polarization for use in spectroscopy and communications. Using 2D photonic crystal structures and substrate-independent reflectors, it is possible to build efficient single mode VCSELs at any wavelength covering the near-infrared and approaching mid infrared (800nm to 2,500nm). High efficiency and high output power are achieved by very low electrical resistance and efficient heat sinking. The first prototype will have the ambitious goal of offering a preferred alternative to DFB lasers in long-haul fiber optic communications and near infrared spectroscopy. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes many societal, educational, scientific and commercial benefits. As a social benefit, the commercialization of this technology will enable faster and simpler air and water contamination measurements, and faster and lower-cost telecommunications. As an educational and scientific benefit, the next generation VCSEL development provides a robust and reliable method for fabricating 2D photonic crystals that are usable for optical signal processing and novel laser designs. Also, the resulting high-efficiency compact lasers with high mode quality can be used for pumping high power solid state lasers; and finally, the high speed versions of these advanced lasers can simplify data communication in fast computer systems used in scientific simulations. As a commercial impact, the additional functionalities of the next generation VCSELs will enable them to break out of their current niche datacom market into broader applications in communications and instrumentation. Their substrate independence will eventually make it possible to process them on silicon and other materials suitable for the final application. This will lead to a significant increase in demand for VCSELs due to the new markets that they will serve.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will investigate a new series of low-cost non- precious metal catalysts for combustion of volatile organic compounds (VOC) at NexTech Materials. Catalytic combustion is an efficient approach for the VOC destruction at mild temperatures. NexTech proposes nano-sized transition metal mixed oxides as catalysts for this application. The results from Phase I efforts indicate that the catalysts can oxidize VOC (e.g., propane, butane, hexane, butene, toluene and propanol) to CO2 and H2O at 200-250 deg C and gas hourly space velocities of 45,000-150,000 ml/g-hr. The temperature for complete conversion of VOC on the composite oxides is 100-150 deg C lower than that on the conventional precious metal catalysts under the same reaction conditions. The oxide catalysts are also more tolerant to silicon and phosphorous, two common impurities in VOC stream, than the precious metal catalysts. The promising catalysts will be scaled up, washcoated in monoliths, and evaluated under real VOC combustion conditions in Phase II project. The replacement of precious metal catalyst to the composite oxide is expected to save 80% catalyst cost and 30% operation cost. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to abate VOC emissions from industrial processes and natural-gas-fueled engines. Since VOC are toxic to human health and contribute to a number of environmental problems (e.g., photochemical smog), environmental legislation has imposed increasingly stringent targets for permitted levels of atmospheric emissions. This catalytic combustion technology can remove VOC by oxidizing them to CO2 and H2O on the catalyst surface before they are released into air. As compared to conventional Pd and Pt catalysts, the substitution of NexTech?s composite oxide catalysts could drastically improve the combustion efficiency and reduce the cost, which allows VOC catalytic combustion technology more widely used in the world for reducing air pollution. The generated information can provide new insights into understanding activation process of O2 and small organic molecules and their interactions on the transition metal oxide surface. The data will be utilized to understand VOC oxidation behavior and design more active VOC combustion catalysts in the future. The generated information can also be applied to develop active catalysts for combustion of natural gas, light hydrocarbons, soot, H2, CO and other fuels.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will prototype, characterize, and verify performance merits and the commercial viability of an Adaptive Dual-Fuel (ADF) Injector. Diesel engines are 30~40% more efficient than port-injected gasoline, spark-ignited engines. Gasoline and E85 fuels are among the most widely available fuels, but are mostly used on spark-ignition gasoline engines with much lower thermal efficiency than diesel engines. The key innovation of the ADF injector enables direct-injections of both gasoline/E85 and diesel fuel selectively on-demand from a single injector. The ADF injector can enable advanced combustion modes that have demonstrated simultaneous reduction of NOx and Particulate Matter (PM) emissions and improved engine efficiency through advanced low temperature combustion. The advanced combustion mode enabled by the ADF injector can improve the thermal efficiency of gasoline/E85 engines by approximately 30~40% by using gasoline and/or E85 fuels in a compression ignition combustion mode. The adaptive dual-fuel injector also provides flexibility for enabling engines to run on either pure diesel, gasoline-diesel, or E85-diesel dual fuels. The Phase II work includes prototyping, spray visualization imaging and laser based measurements, computational optimization, and single-cylinder engine combustion testing to demonstrate the commercial viability of the proposed ADF injector. The broader/commercial impacts of this project pertain to significant benefits for energy security and environmental protection. The potential customers include engine OEMs and auto makers. This project will significantly benefit US consumers through fuel cost saving, enable low cost methods to meet the new CAFE standards, and benefit the US economy by expanding the ?green? manufacturing base. The dual fuel injector, developed and analyzed in this work, provides new capabilities, which can enable transformative combustion methods for ultra-high efficiency, clean combustion. The industry-university collaborative engineering research directly support graduate student research and will train and educate the workforce of the future, providing them with the knowledge and skills needed to address the challenges of energy utilization. The research and development efforts, which focus on a critical problem of global importance, will be widely disseminated to engine designers, OEMs, and researchers, while the next generation of engineers is being trained.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continue the development of an innovative robotic gripping technology that leverages the unique jamming behavior of granular materials to enable a device that can passively conform to objects of varying shape and then vacuum harden to grip them rigidly. These ?jamming grippers? are a unique solution for the agile gripping and manipulation of arbitrary objects with a single gripper -- a need that occurs in manufacturing robotics, prosthetics, and increasingly in home and healthcare robotics. Preliminary results published in top scientific journals successfully implemented this technique in a laboratory setting. The Phase I and Phase IB efforts further demonstrated the technical and market feasibility of a commercial product based on this technology. In Phase II, the research objective are: 1) to answer the critical remaining research questions that stand between the prototypes and a commercial product, 2) to demonstrate product feasibility by transitioning the technology from the prototype stage to a first Alpha product, and 3) to expand the capabilities of this technology by developing and testing prototypes for adjacent market applications. Successful completion of this project will position the team for sustainable sales of a suite of related products. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be realized through technological contributions in the area of robotics. The first target market will be industrial manufacturing, focusing on tasks where variations in object shape are prevalent (e.g. food handling, pharmaceuticals, bin picking, and kitting/assembly). Alternative robotic gripping solutions range (in increasing price) from vacuum suction cups, to traditional jawed grippers, to customized or specialty grippers, and finally to general purpose multi-fingered hands. The simplicity of the proposed jamming gripper can potentially enable two orders of magnitude price reduction over current grippers that achieve similar performance. This gripper is also uniquely positioned to open the door to a previously untapped niche market ? simple movement tasks in manufacturing that must currently be performed by human laborers due to lower volumes or frequent line changes. The flexibility and low cost of a jamming gripper makes it a more agile and reusable component, and this type of solution is the key element that is missing for bringing robotic automation to many smaller scale manufacturers in the U.S.",

Current embodiments of this technology use 40 year old technology that cannot scale beyond two lines of text, consume significant amounts of power, and are prohibitively expensive when using more than a single line. This Phase II project will focus on establishing a mechanical Braille cell module using the polymer-based single dot actuator successfully developed in the Phase I project as the foundation for a multiline display. The primary technical challenges to be addressed are achieving the mechanistic and electrical requirements while maintaining low production costs. Thus, this project has three primary objectives that build on the single-dot actuator: (a) construction and testing of 1- and 6-dot prototypes that meet technical requirements, (b) construction of an 8-dot Braille cell and demonstration electronics and software, and (c) assembly of a short line of Braille text to demonstrate the cells perform as expected when arrayed in the anticipated display format. Additionally, PBI has the access to technical facilities and knowledge to successfully perform the Phase II. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the visually handicapped community, 1.3-2 Million individuals, does not have access to an affordable device comparable to a modern a mobile tablet or computer display. This severely limits the ability of this community to access digital information and dramatically impacts literacy levels, STEM-related education, and employment. The currently available piezo-electric technology is prohibitively expensive and cannot display more than 2 lines at once. This makes it unsuitable for use with mathematical equations, images, and other larger-scale digital information. The affordable device developed using this Phase II funding will use a novel polymer technology to display several lines of Braille text at once. In addition to allowing the visually handicapped community to participate more fully in this digital age, the development of this device will change the way complex, multi-line information is disseminated. Braille literature is significantly larger than traditional. For example, the King James Bible weighs 64lbs, takes up 60 inches of shelf space 12 inches x 12 inches and costs $342.

In Phase I the first laboratory test for ice adhesion using a commercial instrument led to rapid screening of ice release coating candidates. A new theory for rigid adherent removal in shear from hybrid elastomers led to a study of ice adhesion, that is, ice as a rigid adherent. Guided by the new model and practical experience gained from laboratory tests, a new coating system was identified from which ice could be removed easily and with low force. Feasibility was demonstrated for being able to produce a durable, low cost, ice-release coating with commercially available engineering materials. This was a major success that achieved the main objective of Phase I R &amp; D. In Phase II, the main technical objectives are to decrease peak removal force and retain low cost components and easy processing. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project include generation of low cost, durable ice-release coatings and related products. These new materials will greatly reduce icing problems and enhance the safety of operations in the aerospace, energy, and refrigeration industries.

In this project more detailed representations will be built, advancing NLP technology and delivering state-of-the-art analysis of conversations that detail consumer decisions, motivations, and questions about products. In addition, the representations of consumer commentary will be integrated with third-party data, resulting in the development of predictive models of consumer behavior that exceed the accuracy of current models. This will allow product vendors to quantify the influencing factors behind product adoption and attrition, which is crucial to proving marketing hypotheses, predicting business outcomes, and improving customer awareness of product issues. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the ability to improve the analysis and use of consumers&#039; perception and experience of products.

The capital and labor costs and manufacturing times associated with autoclave processing are significant but necessary to ensure composite quality. Achieving high-complexity geometries poses additional hurdles. Current methods used in these cases include a small selection of OOA pre-impregnated parts, the use of thermoplastic bladders, or the bonding of autoclaved components. A large opportunity exists for OOA technology to reduce material and labor costs while also enabling one piece, seamless composite structures with extremely complex internal &amp; external geometries, allowing manufacturing of parts which were previously unachievable. The Phase II project will further the development of a self-pressurizing technology that allows OOA processing of any resin system without a loss in quality. The Phase II will expand the operating temperature and pressure window, improve forming processes, and characterize performance on commercially relevant pre-impregnated systems. Phase II results will yield a mature forming process and several tooling grades with verified performance. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the realization of a manufacturing technology that will enable the composites industry to form more complex geometries and allow greater competition throughout the industry.

There is a need for advanced drug administration capability in animals that enables new complex dosing profiles, provides automation for chronic studies, and improves scientific validity. Technical challenges include the development of a low-power inductively-powered pump actuator, ten-fold pump miniaturization and wireless control of a large number of implanted pumps. The research objectives are (1) to optimize pump performance and usability (2) to extend cage size compatibility and connectivity (3) to optimize software usability (4) to optimize system design and establish quality assurance processes for scale-up and (5) to conduct an in-vivo validation study. Successful demonstration of the remotely-controlled implantable infusion pump system will enable new dosing schemes, provide precise temporally controlled dosing for more reproducible results from acute and chronic studies, and enable new approaches to drug therapy that would not otherwise be possible. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in uniquely improving scientific outcomes and facilitating the drug development/discovery process. Currently, only one in 10,000 drug candidates successfully attain FDA approval with a significant number of candidates failing or discarded due to inadequate drug administration.

        "abstract": "Capitalizing on a strong expertise in III-Nitride epitaxy, GaN-Si power device designs, and wide-bandgap power electronics, researchers at GeneSiC Semiconductor propose a SBIR program focused on the development of 15 kW/300C-rated power converters using AlGaN/GaN-Si MOS-HFETs and Schottky rectifiers. The proposed AlGaN/GaN-Si power converters to be developed in this program will usher in a new generation of high-efficiency, low-cost, and radiation-hard power conversion units on-board future NASA spacecraft. Phase I of this proposed work focussed on the optimization of the design and fabrication of the AlGaN/GaN-Si MOS-HFET and NSJ SBR devices. Phase II will be focused on the design and integration of Si/GaN gate-drive circuitry with the power SBRs and transistors to create high-power integrated circuits. Another major objective during Phase II will be the construction of Rad-Hard packaging for the power ICs. At the end of Phase II of this program, a fully-functional 15 kW/300C rated power converter IC equipped with AlGaN/GaN-on-Si  MOS-HFETs, Natural SuperJunction (NSJ) SBRs as free-wheeling diodes and on-chip SiC or III-Nitride gate drive circuitry will be demonstrated at a switching frequency of \u2265 1 MHz and at a temperature of  \u2265 300C. As compared to the existing state-of-the-art power electronics technology, the proposed AlGaN/GaN-on-Si power converters will offer (A) Lower on-state losses, 300C operation and 1 MHz switching capability (B) A Lateral device architecture, which is highly desirable for construction for monolithic power integrated circuits (C) Possibility of hybrid interconnection of III-Nitride Power Devices with on-chip Rad-Hard AlGaN/GaN Gate Drive Circuitry (D) Desirable Normally-OFF Power Switches",

        "abstract": "Exhaust systems have a significant impact on performance of the vehicle, from the automotive perspective, to its acoustic signature. The soldier wants all the power available for mobility, yet has to pay attention to the noise signature that can be detected by human and sensor devices. Military exhaust systems are largely influenced by program signature and or detectability requirements, and many requirements are quite the opposite of commercial exhaust systems. With the customization, low manufacturing volumes and tight development timelines, it is difficult to produce a low cost system. GLSV has extensive experience developing complete exhaust systems, beginning with the back pressure simulation through comprehensive design, FEA, CFD, acoustic simulation, prototyping and low volume production. Having produced over twenty five custom exhaust systems for marine, ATV, tactical trucks, and combat vehicles puts us in a market leading position to design and manufacture modular components with a focus on low cost tooling and assembly methods.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant   The Dracula Pipette is a co axial embryo microinjection tool  with the injection pipette presented from inside the holding pipette  Double nested tips seal against the surface of the spherical embryo when a vacuum is applied in the space between them  This allows a portion of the nearside surface of an embryo to be held by vacuum while a glass pipette is passed for injection  aspiration of fluid contents or biopsy of embryonic cells  A proprietary laser drilled biopsy probe  invented shortly before the beginning of the project  provides a new and better method for harm free biopsy of pre implantation embryos at a stage of development when they can provide more accurate DNA information for pre implantation genetic diagnosis  PGD   The US Patent and Trademark Office issued the patent for the andquot suck and punctureandquot  process in less than a year from the date of application  saying there was no relevant prior art to consider  Patents for the device itself and for our proprietary laser drilled biopsy probe are pending  In October of      this project was designated as high priority by NIH  This device  useful at all stages of embryo development up to the time of implantation in the uterus  is uniquely capable of control and manipulation of embryos at the hatched blastocyst stage of development  Hatching refers to the natural process of escape from the zona pellucida  the capsule that encloses the ovum and the embryo itself during the first few cell divisions   After hatching from the zona  these early embryos have no real structure and cannot be held on one side and penetrated from the opposite side  as is done routinely on embryos still in the zona  using conventional equipment  The Dracula Pipette has shown that it is valuable for water volume reduction before freezing of embryos  Dr  Taylor  the Project Director  produced the first live babies from frozen thawed embryos of llamas using this tool  Researchers at LSU  have recently had breakthrough success in freezing of large     um  equine embryos with the Dracula system  which has not been possible before  Work done by Dr  Taylor at Montana State University with mouse embryos shows the capability of this system for survivable collection of a few stem cells from the inner cell mass and for injection of genetic\nmaterial  stem cells  into the blastocoel space of mouse embryos for production of transgenic mice  a procedure that previously required special equipment for chilling of the zona  as well as the expensive piezo hammer for penetration of the zona  The human embryo may exist for more than two days as a hatched blastocyst  and there has been no good tool for manipulating it at this most differentiated stage before implantation  Because it is large and fluid filled  the human\nhatched blastocyst is difficult to freeze successfully and difficult to biopsy  Though the Dracula Pipette will surely be important for use with the expanded and hatched blastocysts of other species and on embryos at all stages before implantation  it is the only tool on the horizon for harm free biopsy of human hatched blastocysts beyond the   cell stage and before implantation in the uterus  The Dracula Pipette Project will supply the current best prototype of the device for\ntesting and practical use by several respected embryo researchers in a variety of laboratory settings  working mainly with bovine and mouse embryo models  The consultants will provide feedback about their experiences with the device and their ideas for improving or changing it for specific purposes  The inventor and a team of technical contractors will work to correct design problems as they are identified and will use appropriate micro technology firms for production of specific improved prototype parts  As these cycles of evaluation and upgrade continue  emphasis will shift to practical manufacture of all parts  so a robust  user friendly device can be\npresented to the scientific community  This tool  the Dracula Pipette  offers inexpensive embryo manipulation for routine procedures like water  volume reduction before freezing  and the capability to perform previously very difficult or impossible procedures on later stage embryos  GeneSearch  Inc   the applicant Small Business  will commercialize the Dracula Pipette and biopsy probe through licensing of the intellectual property involved  We will maintain a small facility for creation and testing of new prototypes and variants of the device  and for coordinatin with licensees to provide instruction and practical assistance for new users PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  The Dracula Pipette is a self contained single tool for holding and puncturing pre implantation embryos  It replaces complicated and expensive combinations of conventional devices  It will open areas of research in biopsy and freezing of relatively large embryos that are now very difficult to manipulate  research areas previously ignored because the tool was lacking  Most importantly  it will give human fertility clinicians a way to biopsy and\nfreeze these later stage embryos harmlessly for pre implantation genetic diagnosis  PGD  at the stage of development which has been identified as resulting in the most accurate DNA analysis",

        "abstract": "TIAX proposes to continue development of a new durable flame retardant (FR) treatment for nylon/cotton (nyco) combat uniform textiles, like that used in the Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform (MCCUU).   Currently the military procures specialty FR uniforms to meet its needs. Although these uniforms provide critical FR properties, they are twice as expensive as standard uniforms and not as comfortable or durable. As a result, a general need exists to develop a FR treatment method for the standard MCCUU which would provide the needed FR properties  without significant impact on the other critical uniform properties  for an increase of 5% or less in the cost of the uniform.  Current FR treatments are typically designed for use on cotton and do not perform satisfactorily on textile blends with nylon. These existing treatments also tend to add substantial weight and decrease the strength of the fabric. TIAX&quot;s new FR treatment for nyco textiles is based on an understanding of the particular chemistry of nyco blends and provides excellent FR properties. In the proposed Phase II program, we will iteratively test and improve the process and begin to scale up production to deliver prototype FR treated nyco fabric to the Marine Corps.",

These new capabilities are being deployed in a contested cyber environment that is made more challenging due to resource constraints such as bandwidth, Size-Weight-and-Power (SWaP) constraints, and the dynamic nature of deployed MANETs. New cyber defense approaches are needed that address the constraints of operating securely in this new tactical networking environment. The goal of this effort is to continue development of technologies that address the unique challenges of providing defense in depth to these tactical radio networks. The focus of this effort has been to conduct and use a cyber-defense study of SRW to motivate the design, development, and demonstration of those technologies. Reservoir Labs has identified, and is developing, two technologies under this effort: (1) R-Check, a static analysis tool for identifying and prioritizing software vulnerabilities through source-code analysis and (2) Blackball, a dynamic technology for countering Byzantine attacks through a model of outlier detection based on collaborative trust. While motivated by an analysis of SRW, both technologies should be portable and applicable to other JTNC waveform products.",

Hence decimeter accuracy performance levels for a moving vehicle become both achievable and cost effective.

The inlet pressure for these systems is typically on the order of 1.4 psia with a discharge pressure requirement above atmospheric pressure.  In the past this has required multiple stages of compression by machines operating at high speeds on ball bearings.  The bearing life in these machines was at most a few hundred hours.  While this is feasible to use for a proof of concept test system, it is not acceptable for the H2 compressors in application at the launch pad.  It is desired to replace these grease-packed ball bearings with foil bearings to greatly increase compressor life.  Additionally higher speed can eliminate several stages thus reducing complexity and cost of the system.  If this technology proves feasible it could finally make densified LH2 propellant a reality for future launch and space applications.",

This will facilitate safe and legal operation in the national airspace following FAA approval.\n \nThe continued SuperSwift system development will address the design issues identified in Phase I.  The stock airframe utilized in the Phase I study, the Tempest, while well qualified for use in preliminary flight testing, created additional challenges for integration of the soil moisture measurement payload.  Due to the requirements of the radiometer antenna the Tempest was modified during Phase I to accomplish initial flight testing, but had several challenges including external placement of the antenna, more complex manufacturing of the control linkages for the rudder and elevator, and a soil moisture electronics payload that is deeply integrated into the airframe and difficult to remove for testing and replacement.

The system is a gravity-independent, compact, leak-tight, Solid Oxide Electrolyzer (SOE) system with embedded Sabatier reactors (ESR). Applying Corning Incorporated (Corning) Intellectual Property (IP), ENrG and Paragon can leverage an all-ceramic, efficient, and low mass solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) that remains leak-tight after hundreds of thermal cycles. Paragon proposes that incorporation of the all-ceramic technology into our SOE/ESR system will result in a design that will: 1) be thermally shock tolerant and capable of hundreds of on-off cycles at faster cycles than compared to the metal-to-ceramic SOE designs, 2) be lighter, smaller, and require less power than existing designs, 3) allow for high (>90%) single pass utilization of feedstock, and 4) achieve a thermodynamic efficiency of up to 80%. Our Phase II effort includes laboratory tests to optimize operation of an all-ceramic design for increased single pass utilization of the feed stock and mitigation of carbon deposition. Engineering analyses and component testing will be performed to inform the design of a stack. The stack will be built and tested to verify requirements. Results will be used to size a full system with recommendations for integration.  An engineering development unit will be built and delivered to NASA. Integrating cells that operate as either an electrolyzer or a Sabatier reactor simplifies operations, lowers hardware complexity, and increases reliability. The proposed system can perform multiple functions without modifications, making it a readily deployable technology for various missions from ISRU on the Moon and Mars to regenerating 100% of a crew's oxygen in spacecraft or habitats.",

Non-uniformity of the central wavelength over the wafers, run-to-run and reactor-to-reactor non-repeatability are primary contributors to reduced manufacturing yield. On the epitaxial level, non-uniform device performance results from the variations of chemical composition and thickness of the individual InGaN quantum well layers. Being extremely thin, the individual quantum well layers remain beyond the resolution of the standard optical monitoring techniques. This SBIR Phase II projects objective is to research and develop a prototype of optical monitoring and control system utilizing AccuStratas know-how in real-time optical monitoring, intelligent data-mining, and process modeling, which has already been commercially demonstrated in the PV industry.    AccuStrata will develop, install, and validate on a commercial MOCVD reactor a beta-prototype of a spectroscopic optical monitoring and process control system. The system will monitor the LED thin films as they grow in real time on the individual wafers, record the signal in a broad spectral range, and process the information to retrieve the most important film parameters and their distribution over a single wafer, all the wafers in a batch and multiple batches. During the epitaxial growth of the thin quantum well films, the recorded spectral signal will  be  correlated  to  the  process  parameters  such  as  substrate  temperature  and precursor  gas  composition.  AccuStrata will deploy a novel algorithm for a real-time pattern search in the acquired broadband spectral data and display any abnormalities and differences in the deposition of the individual quantum well layers. This information can be used by the MOCVD engineer to better tune the epitaxial process, and later can be integrated into the MOCVD reactor to ensure better repeatability of the individual quantum well layers in the LED structure and allow tightening of the distribution of the LED central wavelength. The monitoring and control system will shorten the time for manufacturing high quality LEDs, reduce non-uniformity on a single wafer and batch-to-batch and reactor-to-reactor variations. It will enable manufacturing of new generation HB-LED with improved efficacy and lower cost, needed for faster adoption of SSL.",

        "abstract": "Accelerator magnets that are currently being used in high-energy physics experiments are limited to a maximum magnetic field of about 20 T because superconductivity in the low- temperature superconductors (LTS) from which the magnets are constructed breaks down at higher fields. The only way to build the next generation of more powerful accelerator magnets is by using high-temperature superconductors (HTS) that can operate at magnetic fields of 20 T and above. There is currently no feasible method to bundle HTS into high-current cables that have an overall current density of at least 150 A/mm2 at 20 T that is required for the next generation of accelerator magnets. This proposal seeks to develop HTS cables that have a high current density needed for the next generation of superconducting accelerator magnets that operate at fields of 20 T and above. During Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of raising the critical current density at 20 T of conductor on round core (CORC) cables that were invented by the PI towards 200 A/mm2. During Phase II we will commercialize CORC cables that have a critical current density of at least 300 A/mm2 at 20 T from which the next generation of accelerator magnets can be built. We will accomplish this by optimizing the cable layout when using superconducting tapes that have thin layers of copper and contain thin substrates.   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  High-temperature superconducting magnet cables with high current densities will enable the next generation of accelerator magnets for high-energy physics, proton cancer treatment facilities, and practical fusion magnets. These cables will also benefit superconducting magnetic energy storage systems for use in the power grid and for application within the Department of Defense.",

The maximum RF power available without beam is limited by the maximum power rating of the WR1800 waveguide RF ceramic window used in the fundamental power coupler.  Operation at this maximum power limit is hampered by the fact that the specific value of power transmitted which produces the maximum temperature difference can vary significantly depending on the thickness of the anti-multipacting titanium nitride coating on the ceramic. We propose a Phase II pototyping effort to develop a new higher power RF window for use in waveguide input couplers for superconducting cavities.  The aim of the design is to increase the power limit to the highest practical value, with a goal of 1 MW standing wave.  In Phase II, a test article would be built at AES with conditioning and testing taking place with a 300 kW transmitter at Brookhaven National Laboratory.

        "abstract": "Generation and preservation of high-brightness electron beam is a major challenge of accelerator R &amp; amp;D for time-resolved chemical imaging applications due to the importance of space-charge in this operating regime. The space-charge forces play a fundamental role in emittance degradation and bunch lengthening within the gun and subsequent emittance compensation drift. In order to generate and preserve the electron beam, transverse and longitudinal space-charge effects have to be precisely managed. Several different approaches, such as single-electrons at high repetition rate, and various velocity bunching and magnetic compression techniques, are being actively pursued. However, each has drawbacks that our proposed tabletop, single-shot, ultrafast, high-brightness system resolves. In a pump-probe setup with femtosecond resolution, our instrument enables the chemical imaging of surface dynamics on an atomic level. The technical objective of the present project is to develop a tabletop single-shot, ultrafast, high- brightness, Time-Resolved Chemical Imaging device utilizing an X-band RF gun that has a smaller footprint and is more economic than competing schemes. In Phase I, we have performed simulations that demonstrate the potential of our concept to deliver a 20 pC, &amp; lt; 75 femtosecond electron bunch that is more than three times brighter than an equivalent S-band photocathode gun. We have completed the preliminary engineering analysis and design to demonstrate that the concept is robust and viable for near-term fabrication.  In Phase II, we will complete the design and fabrication of the UED electron source. We have worked with the BNL/ATF Facility to develop  a  test  program  and  received  approval  for  the  necessary  facility  modifications  and schedule for completing Phase II validation experiments.  The Phase II experimental setup will be a functional prototype UED device that will lead to near-term commercial sales.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The prototype X-band RF electron source we propose would find immediate application as a tabletop Ultrafast Electron Diffraction (UED) system for time-resolved chemical imaging, and as a resource for the pharmaceutical industry in drug-cell interaction analysis. Being compact and affordable with femtosecond temporal resolution, the instrument will deliver added value and increase the accessibility of smaller programs/users to existing ultrafast discovery science, and will also enable new applications with significant public benefit. As an advanced accelerator driver, significant future opportunities in medical systems and other commercial fields that require higher energy and seek highly compact devices, will emerge.",

        "abstract": "There is a need for extremely lightweight low power instrumentation for real-time measurement of isotopic variants of carbon dioxide (CO2) in ambient air, suitable for use on un-manned aerial vehicles, to allow better quantification of sources and sinks of this major greenhouse gas in remote areas such as the Arctic.  The proposing company is developing such instrumentation using infrared laser spectroscopy, a technique which has been shown to provide the extremely high precision needed to measure the small changes in the proportions of CO2 isotopic variants (isotopologues) that are induced by biological and physical processes in the environment.  To be useful great precision is needed in the measurement of the ratios of isotopologues of CO2, typically a fraction of a part in 1000 (written as per mil, &amp; quot; &amp; quot;, i.e. 1/1000).  The measurement precision goal of this project is 0.2  (in 1s) for the ratios of two minor (i.e. rare) isotopic variants of CO2 to the major isotopic variant: [13CO2]/[ 12CO2] and  [ 12C18O16O]/[12CO2].  The proposed general approach is laser absorption spectroscopy in the mid-infrared, with a &amp; quot;quantum cascade &amp; quot; laser which can access the specific absorption lines of the 3 isotopologues at the same time.  The proposing small company has previously demonstrated, and indeed currently sells field-ready laser-based instruments with better than the precision goal stated above, i.e. with a precision for CO2 isotopic variants of approximately 0.05  with 1 second averaging, which is the best precision of any commercial laser instrument for CO2 isotopes.  The challenge that the proposing company is addressing is how to greatly reduce the current instrument &amp; apos;s mass and power consumption while maintaining excellent precision.  Very good progress was made during Phase 1 of the project, in that a new optical module was designed that is approximately one half the size of the current instrument &amp; apos;s.  Furthermore, that optical module was integrated with a laser, detector and electronics so that it functioned as a complete instrument with a demonstrated precision of  0.09  with 1 second averaging for two isotopic variants of CO2 in ambient air, thus exceeding the target precision goals.  In addition, significant progress was made in reducing instrument mass and power requirements, with an identified path toward eliminating a water chiller/circulator used for thermal management, and by using a much smaller air sampling pump. Key elements of an extremely lightweight calibration system also were demonstrated during Phase 1.  During Phase 2 the various elements of the instrument will be integrated into a complete stand-alone instrument and the performance will be tested.  The general approach of Phase 1 will be continued, with staged reductions in mass and power while precision is tested and maintained, so that a useful instrument result is nearly guaranteed.  The methods to reduce size and power will be of benefit to the company &amp; apos;s other trace gas instrumentation, and thus will be of benefit to the atmospheric research community.",

        "abstract": "Atmospheric nucleation processes produce large numbers of particles. Once formed, these particles grow rapidly and may alter the formation and lifetime of clouds, and thereby influence the earths radiation balance.  Rapid growth of newly formed particles has been observed in many locations, but it is not known what chemical constituents contribute to this growth. While mobility-selection mass combined with spectrometry has provided important chemical data for particles above about 10 nm in diameter, data for smaller particle sizes are lacking. The problem is the low efficiency for placing a single electrical charge on these small particles, without significant multiple charging, as is required for their mobility-based size-selection. These data are required to validate models for nanoparticle growth. This work aims to improve the electrical charging, and hence the efficiency of the mobility size selection and particle collection process. Even with a unipolar charger, the fraction of particles that carry an electrical charge is small (a few percent), and this fraction decreases rapidly with decreasing particle diameter.  Our approach is a condensationally-enhanced charging and evaporation method for increased efficiency of particle charging.  In contrast to other condensation approaches, our method greatly reduces the time for the entire condensation-charging-evaporation process to a few tens of milliseconds, thereby minimizing the opportunity for chemical artifacts.  Thermal desorption chemical ionization mass spectrometry data obtained using our condensation-evaporation system show clean ion spectra for particles sampled in chemically reacting atmospheres. This project will optimize this technique for placing a single electrical charge on particles in the 3  10 nm size range. It will also integrate the new charger with the Thermal Desorption Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer, providing critically-needed information on the species that are responsible for the growth of nascent atmospheric aerosol.  Commercial Applications and OtherBenefits: This technique will enable measurement of the chemical composition of newly formed particles. Such data will have important atmospheric implications, and will improve understanding of cloud formation and global climate. Commercial applications extend beyond the atmospheric research community to the nanofabrication industry, where size-selective characterization of nanometer-sized particles is critical, and to the emerging field of ion trap mass spectrometery where controlled charging of large molecules is needed.",

        "abstract": "Superconducting radiofrequency accelerators require a critical component that connects the radiofrequency power supply (which is warm) to the accelerator cavity (which is very cold). This coupler component must be insulating on the outside to block heat from going into the cold region. It must also be highly conducting on the inside to minimize radiofrequency power losses. No manufacturer has been able to strike a satisfactory balance. Existing methods do not work well enough to satisfy the requirements of the large new accelerators that need to order thousands of these couplers. AASC has validated a better solution in Ph-I. Alameda Applied Sciences Corporation (AASC) has demonstrated thin films of copper coated onto stainless steel that could meet the conflicting requirements of the RF coupler. Stainless steel blocks heat on the outside while copper conducts RF power efficiently on the inside. Our Ph-I coatings passed a high pressure water rinse test at Fermi Lab. The electrical conductivity of the film is characterized by a parameter called RRR that must exceed 30. Our Ph-I films gave RRR=42-64, in excess of requirements.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Various governments are expected to invest $1B into superconducting accelerators over the next decade or so. Private sector investment would match or exceed that with breakthroughs as noted above. About 20% of this investment would go to the purchase of RF couplers.

        "abstract": "Transformative new user facilities are currently in the planning stages at DoE. These facilities will use a LINAC to accelerate electrons upwards of 2.5GeV to produce free-electron lasers (FELs) output. Afterwards roughly a 750kW electron beam has to be stopped. This amount of power has been conventionally stopped using water baths. Dissipating this amount of energy in water introduces a mobile radionuclide management issue that could be avoided with a highly, thermally conductive foam core beam stop. Conductive POCO graphite foam was initially thought to offer a promising solution to this beam stop problem. Graphite foam, available at density from 0.1 to 0.9 g/cc, certainly increases the radiation length as desired. As a result the energy dissipation per unit length of the dump (the average heat flux) is reduced. Preliminary analysis indicates that graphitic foams (in an XFEL like copper jacket) would allow the use of a single foam core dump per high power beam line. However, available graphitic foams, like POCO, are anisotropic, with thermal conductivities much higher in one direction. These foams do not have the ideal properties for this application due to their level of anisotropy. This would result in a worst case, material failure, and less efficient heat transfer. Allcomps isotropic variable-density, high conductivity foam has unique potential for solving this problem.   Being highly thermally conductive and tailorable in density, it is possible to reach the appropriate beam stop design parameters. Demonstrating its uniqueness, Allcomp produced a 0.5g/cc density version of its foam, and tested specimens over the beam stop operational temperature regime. Foam blocks, in thickness of 3inch (12inch square) and 6inch (12inch square), were produced and foam properties were established, and compared to predictions. Finite element thermal and stress solutions were prepared. Predicted peak temperature results over 20 year radiation exposure period were lower than for solid graphite and well within material limits for the foam. Material processing development will be continued, as well as material tests.  Radiation tests at ORNL are planned.  Results of radiation damage effects will be measured in terms of change in foam thermal conductivity as function displacement damage per atom (dpa).  Phase I analytical study results provided insight into the expected dpa over a 20 year exposure.  Commercial Applications and OtherBenefits:  Allcomps high conductivity foam opens new opportunities in commercial applications such as a heat spreader in computers, avionics racks, and spaced-based electronics. Our isotropic highly machinable graphitic foam is an ideal core material for HEP sandwich structures.",

Mass assigned to support structures, although critical in function, compromises detection through production of secondary particles that interferes with particle tracking. This SBIR focuses on lowering the mass associated with sandwich core materials being used in detector support structures, by a factor of 5 or more.   This will require new, innovative, and entirely different foam processing. The method proposed will lead to a hollow foam ligament, with ligament shell material composed solely of high conductivity graphite.   Accomplishing this advancement in foam properties will also provide a new innovative material pushing battery anode and cathode performance to a higher level. Allcomp produced hollow ligament foam, at a density of 0.03, 0.05g/cc, and 0.08g/cc. In the brief period afforded by Phase I we thermally and structurally tested the material in manner appropriate to HEP detector application. Foam ligament thermal conductivity was measured at close to 2 times that of copper.    Further  processing  development  proposed  in  Phase  II  will  raise  the  conductivity  to 1500W/mK, approximately 4 times that of copper. Phase II will further advance Allcomps graphitic foam processing.  The graphite ligament material will become highly ordered pyrolytic graphitic. Phase II will focus on varying the chemical vapor deposition variables to improve the quality of carbon deposition.  Our objective is to reduce the surface defects in the thinwalled graphite ligaments.    Gains in ligament graphitic quality is reflected in increased electrical and thermal conductivity. Sandwich structures with this advanced foam will be made and thermally tested. Active cooling of the structures with both air and liquid will embrace the realm of future HEP tracking applications. Through a collaborative effort with battery development teams, this material will be studied for application of anodes and cathodes. Light weight conductive graphite foam is an enabling material for the next generation extremely lightweight detectors for high energy physics experiments. Hollow, low mass graphitic foam is under evaluation for advanced cathodes for batteries.

However, by shifting from a wet to a dry cooling system, the volume, weight and cost of the cooling system are substantially increased.  To realize the water use reduction benefits of dry cooling, lower cost dry cooling condensers are needed. The proposer has developed a highly efficient condenser heat exchanger technology that increases the performance of air cooled condensers, reducing condenser volume and weight by 63% and 65%, respectively, while also reducing fan power requirements by 52% and achieving the same heat transfer as competing technologies.   These characteristics make the technology more economically competitive with classical water based approaches, and will allow utilities to meet constraints on water use, at an affordable cost. Condenser heat transfer and pressure drop models were developed and utilized to design full scale and test article condensers that have optimal performance, size, weight and cost.  A subscale condenser test article was then manufactured and tested and test results showed volume reductions of 63% and pressure drop reductions of 52%, versus conventional dry cooling condensers.  These advantages result in a 43% to 48% reduction in condenser total cost, versus conventional dry condensers.  Under the Phase II project, a prototype partial condenser panel of 400 kWt capacity will be manufactured and tested, under simulated operational conditions, to demonstrate the technology.  In addition to showing that the technology has better heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics than conventional dry cooling condensers, economic analyses will be used to show that costs are substantially lower.   Lastly, a transition plan will be created to guide the subsequent commercialization of the technology.  Commercial Applications and OtherBenefits: Given  the  performance  and  cost  advantages  of  the  technology,  the  commercial opportunity for applying the technology to the utility industry is large, and with the cost advantage  the  proposed  concept  will  save  $29  billion  per  year,  versus  conventional  dry condenser technology.",

        "abstract": "There is a manifest need in the US and the world for renewable, lowcost energy. However, conventional and small hydropower systems for (20,000+) low head dams (550ft.) in the US tend to be extremely costintensive due to a variety of configurational issues. These include coffer dams, power houses, complex foundations, complex unit maintenance, large space requirements, and turbine technology requiring major civil engineering work. These factors have severely limited the number of economicallyviable projects in the low head power range. DOE has identified these dam locations and has challenged industry to produce a unit generating clean power at low cost to the public. The ATS turbine/generator answers this challenge as it provides the hydropower industry with a magnitude lower cost power generation system, requiring no power house, with onefifth weight and volume of a conventional system, simple maintenance and not requiring dam reconstruction. The ATS 63 Turbine/Generator is built primarily of composite materials, massproducible and ranges from 100kW to 2.5MW depending on head and flow. The low cost avoids the need for subsidy (unlike wind and solar). It will alter the hydropower outlook for the future in the US. The DOE SBIR Phase I project produced the critically peerreviewed unit design (based on an earlier test of a scale model validating the concept). Material strengthand costanalysis validated the design, and in a Phase II project, ATS will build the first unit and test it on a dam or canal. Mass production manufacture can be started on completion of the Phase II test, eventually employing an estimated 300 people in less than five years. In Phase III, ATS will install multiple units on a large US river dam, confirming a lowcost solution for power generation to all large dams including the Army Corps of Engineers lowhead dams in the US major rivers and lakes.   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  A world market of at least $83 billion, excluding China (having 49% of all hydropower) is estimated based on a preliminary market study by an independent leading consulting group. The commercialization plan provides for a pathway to economic success, made in the USA.",

        "abstract": "As nuclear power plants extend their operating life beyond 40 years, attention is being focused on the health of the insulation material of important cables.   Faced with the prospect of an extremely expensive, wholesale replacement of thousands of miles of cables, nuclear facilities need a cost-effective, non-destructive, remote, and in-situ method to determine whether or not cables are healthy or should be replaced.   While other products exist to identify conductor faults, there is no method available to assess the health and the remaining useful life (RUL) of the insulation material of installed cables. To address this problem, Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR), an in-situ non-destructive test, will be performed on cables typically used in the nuclear industry.  These cables will undergo accelerated aging to simulate the natural aging process that occurs in a nuclear power plant.  As they age, FDR measurements will be compared with a standard laboratory test known as elongation at break (EAB) to correlate the results and provide estimations of a cables health and RUL. During Phase I, a subset of nuclear power plant cables were thermally aged over the entire duration of the project.  During this aging process, FDR measurements were compared to EAB results to assess insulation elasticity which is an industry-accepted measure of insulation health.   The results demonstrated that FDR could be closely correlated to EAB. In Phase II, AMS will expand the research to include a larger population of cable types commonly found in nuclear power plants.  Cable samples will be obtained and subjected to aging conditions while recording and correlating FDR measurements with the cable age.  These correlations will be incorporated into a test system for nuclear facilities to assess the health of a cable and determine its RUL.  Commercial Applications and OtherBenefits:  The FDR correlations with cable health and RUL will be packaged with commercial hardware and custom software to provide a cost-effective solution for implementing a cable aging management program to satisfy regulatory guidelines. This system will identify and locate insulation problems and provide plant operators with a condition-based assessment of installed cable.",

        "abstract": "Superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities for use in the International Linear Collider (ILC) are currently fabricated by electron-beam welding of press-formed half-cell cups.  Cavities produced in this method experience weld-related defects that limit accelerator performance and increase the cost of supplying the SRF system to the end user.  E-beam welding in its optimum state is expensive and causes additional manufacturing risk and lead time.  Development of an alternate method that increases first and second pass production yields offers the benefit of cost reduction to the end-user which will have significant public benefit. This project will develop a weld-free cavity forming process which will eliminate welds and weld-related defects and therefore reduce cavity cost.  The primary reference model will be the 1.3 GHz 9-cell TESLA-style SRF cavity but the objective will be to produce a 3-cell cavity.  The sequential forming processes of spin-necking and hydroforming will be employed to produce cavities from a single, weld-free tube of cavity metal.  Cavity irises will be mechanically formed on a spinning machine and cavity equators will be formed through a hydroforming process. In Phase I, successful development of a spin-necking process to produce the iris geometry at the actual ILC scale was completed.  3-cell cavity pre-forms which are ready for the subsequent hydroforming process were produced.  Detailed design of a production hydroforming machine for high-rate production of ILC cavities was completed.  Numerical modeling was performed to optimize both spin-necking and hydroforming for further development in Phase II. In Phase II, the spin-necking operation will be further optimized and completed to form iris sections for 3-cell cavity.  A hydroforming system will be built for the fabrication of 3-cell ILC cavities.  Phase II development will be conducted with steel, copper and niobium seamless tubes. Nb 3-cell cavity will be tested for its SRF performance at a U.S. National Lab.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this project is to develop and energy efficient method to convert CO2  and water to formic acid. Formic acid is widely used in Europe as an alternative to antibiotics in animal feed, and for grain preservation, but it has not been adapted in the US because it is more expensive than other alternatives.  The objective of Dioxide Materials work is to make formic acid from a carbon dioxide feedstock, at a cost less than antibiotics or other alternatives and take advantage of the fact that formic acid is generally recognized as safe for human consumption. Key advantages of the work include: 1) Carbon dioxide, that is now a waste product contributing to global warming, will change to a valuable feedstock to produce useful chemicals; 2) farmers will have an economic incentive to switch from antibiotics to formic acid.  That will save farmers money and at the same time lead to healthier foods with no residual antibiotics. In our previous Phase II effort, Catalysis of CO2  Conversion into Useful Chemicals, we developed catalysts that could convert CO2  to useful chemicals at high energy efficiency.  The effort was tremendously successful.  We lowered the energy needed to produce the products by a factor of 2.  The work was published in Science and has appeared in over 200 news articles. The objective of the work proposed in this proposal is to move from an efficient catalyst for production of formic acid to a complete system for the production of the formic acid. The system will include all of the parts of the electrolyzer: the cell itself, the membrane, and the anode. It will also include the separation system to purify the product.  Our goal is to lower the cost of  formic acid by a factor of 2 or more to prices lower than antibiotics or other food preservatives or even of methanol.",

        "abstract": "Concrete  is  widely  used  in  light  water  reactor  (LWR)  constructions  as  building foundation  and  support,  shielding  material  and  for  radiation  containment.     The importance of concrete in providing protection to LWR structures are found in the containment building, spent fuel pool and cooling towers.  The integrity of construction materials like concrete is an important consideration and concern for LWR facilities since degradation of these structural materials can lead to costly maintenance and downtime and also increases the risk of safety. The cause of concrete deterioration can be attributed mainly to chemical attack from chemicals present in the concrete or environment that can lead to chemical changes in the concrete over time. Technologies that can assess the integrity of LWR structures and provide means to mitigate the degradation of reactor structures will help prolong reactor life and diminish the risks of structural failure. A portable, nondestructive assessment (NDA) Raman spectroscopy instrumentation and fiber optically coupled sampling probes with microscopic imaging will be developed. The Raman probe is used to obtain Raman spectra and petrographic image of not only the surface of the concrete structures, but also depth profiles using smallholes drilled into the structure. These data will be used to assess the onset or presence of chemical corrosion in the concrete structure.  Commercial Applications and OtherBenefits:  The principal market for the NDA Raman tool is in inspection of civil engineering structures. As the current program is focused on concrete aging in light water reactors, likely  customers  include  the  NRC  as  instrumentation  provided  to  their  regional inspectors.

        "abstract": "It is extremely important to understand and control the temporal characteristics of electron beams at accelerator photoinjectors. Measuring and setting the electron bunch length is critical to the operation of the accelerator, and can ultimately determine if physics experiments at user-based accelerators can be successfully performed.  Many parameters affect the temporal characteristics of electron bunches at the photoinjector including the drive laser optical pulse, the photogun bias voltage, beam current and bunch charge, the field strength of focusing magnets and phase and field strength of RF bunching and accelerating cavities. Optimizing these parameters can be a time consuming process, particularly during accelerator commissioning.  Electrodynamic has developed a new beam monitor technology that is providing the CEBAF control room a real-time, non-invasive, measure of electron bunch shape at the photoinjector.  A beam monitor system was installed on CEBAF during Phase I during its 12 GeV upgrade. As CEBAF turns back this new, real-time diagnostic of bunch shape and bunch length is available to the control room for its re-commissioning. This new technology also has potential applications in fast kicking and bunch shaping when actively driven by external RF. Future accelerator designs require advances in fast kicking technology. Electrodynamic has developed experimental hardware and software in Phase I that will enable fast-kicking and bunch shaping experiments to commence in Phase II. At the successful completion of Phase II, Electrodynamic will have equipped JLAB with beam monitors, a MEIC 1:10 prototype bunch kicker, and a new photogun.  The successful completion of these efforts will develop these new technologies into products, putting Electrodynamic in an ideal position to market them worldwide.",

        "abstract": "The last several years has seen the emergence of a new trend in HPC design  the rise in the use of special purpose add-on hardware optimized for efficient math computations, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and compute accelerators. Effectively utilizing this hardware is challenging and requires many new programmer skills. Despite these complications with programming them, this hardware provides dramatic performance benefits, and is already used in three of the ten fastest supercomputers in the world, so this trend is unlikely to slow down in the near future. Despite this move to hybrid architectures and the diversity of hardware options available, programmer effort for common tasks is often reduced via the use of software libraries. Examples of commonly used libraries are FFT, BLAS, and LAPACK. The programmer expects that optimized and functionally correct versions of these and other routines are available for any given hardware. Ideally, the use of libraries reduces debugging time, eases porting to alternative or future hardware, and gives excellent performance because it is tuned by experts in the hardware and the algorithms. In reality, the space is fragmented, which pushes significant burden to the software developer.  For this project, EM Photonics is developing an open source, unified set of fundamental libraries for use on hybrid HPC systems. EM Photonics will provide baseline functionality for common library routines written in OpenCL that will be cross-platform and open source. We will also provide a framework that will allow others (researchers, hardware vendors, commercial library providers, etc.) to plug in alternate implementations. In Phase I, we prototyped a BLAS library, showed LAPACK functionality, and created a highly-performing matrix-multiplication routine using a robust automatic tuning system. We devised a system by which highly compatible kernels can be written without burdening the programmer and then automatically tuned to achieve both code clarity and the highest performance. In Phase II, we will expand the supported routines to include a commonly-used subset of LAPACK, sparse BLAS, and FFT. We will also build out a framework for easier development and performance optimization of generic kernels, as well as facilities for adding device-specific code. Finally, this code will be thoroughly documented and released as open-source to encourage community participation in development, as well as widespread use.",

This approach is inefficient. A few US Industries that have used virtual design and analysis tools have developed environmentally-friendly fabrication processes, improved quality and performance, and reduced manufacturing costs to remain globally competitive. The Phase II project leverages an existing, state-of-the-art software code Virtual Fabrication Technology (VFT) used currently to design and model large welded structures prior to fabrication - to a broader range of applications and products for widespread use by small and medium-sized companies.  This will enable these companies to have on-demand access both to weld modeling training and to low cost weld simulation technology through a cloud-based high performance computing portal.  In Phase I the VFT code, which was tied to an expensive commercial solver, was modified to perform efficiently on a high performance open source finite element code called WARP3D.  The results from Phase I clearly demonstrated that the software code produces high speed accurate solutions and can enable these fabricators to overcome the barriers to high performance computing using an easy-to-use portal. The Phase II program goal is to complete the adaptation of a (HPC) software code so it is accessible and useable to small and medium sized firms to improve their manufacturing and fabrication processes that yield products that have higher quality at reduced costs. The new software will be hosted on the Manufacturing and Polymer (M &amp; amp;P) Portal within the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) at the Ohio State University.  This adapted version results in very rapid solution times and a new menu driven graphical user interface (GUI) so that the user does not have to be an expert in computational methods to use the code effectively.

        "abstract": "Most time resolved studies of processes in materials to date have made use of readily available visible and near-visible pump sources to trigger the events and, thus were able to study only a small subset of phenomena. Recently, investigations of the dynamics stimulated by THz pulses have led to advances like the selective control of an insulator-metal transition, discovery of light induced superconductivity and observation of coherent nonlinear photonic effects that can be used for ultrafast control of materials. Excitations of complex condensed matter driven by THz pulses exhibit interesting dynamics that can also be used in a new generation of electronics. For these experiments it is critical to obtain pump pulses in the THz frequency range (0.3 to 10 THz) that are tunable with a bandwidth on the order of 1% and energy per pulse of ~ 1mJ. Building on our recent successful experiment we propose a three stage THz source scheme. Two of the stages have already been demonstrated separately. In the first stage the beam is modulated in  energy  by  passing  through  a  passive  wakefield  device.  The energy modulation is then converted into a density modulation by means of a chicane. In the third stage, the bunched beam produces  a  narrowband  high  power  pulse  of  terahertz  radiation  by  going  through  a  power extractor. The beam based source provides sufficient power and allows for a wide tuning range.\nPrior to this Phase I proposal we had separately demonstrated two key stages of the proposed three stage THz source. In Phase I we designed, fabricated and tested the third stage separately. A narrowband THz signal was obtained. We designed full scale THz sources in two frequency ranges for experiments at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory. In Phase II, we plan first to use the ATF facility to demonstrate a full scale THz source and study its spectral purity and bandwidth, power levels, frequency tuning methods and range, and finally the free space matching and radiation patterns. The ultimate objective of the Phase II project is to develop and demonstrate an ultrahigh energy (~ 1 mJ) narrow band tunable THz source. The experience gained during the project will culminate in the design of a standalone THz source based on a compact, few MeV (medical /cargo inspection) accelerator.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  A tunable, powerful, narrowband THz source will allow scientists to selectively excite and study new dynamic phenomena at light sources. Besides applications for basic science, these sources can find a variety of applications in communications, non-destructive evaluation, radar systems and medical diagnostics.",

These inductors will incorporate high quality magnetic materials for enhanced energy storage and will be integrated with conventional CMOS manufacturing processes through partnership with IBM, Global Foundries and TSMC to enable integrated voltage regulation. Under Phase I of this project, Ferric Semiconductor improved their thin-film magnetic core power inductor process so that it would be amenable to high volume manufacturing.

        "abstract": "Assuring the longterm, safe storage of CO2 requires the development of effective monitoring strategies that have minimal environmental impact. Models show measuring the resistivity contrast between injected CO2 and the host reservoir offers a means to image directly CO2 volume and saturation in situ, with the highest accuracy, while producing no noise or other emissions that impact humans. However, there is presently no cost effective method to acquire such subsurface resistivity data over a large area. The new borehole tosurface electromagnetic (BSEM) survey configuration has been shown to image oil towater contact in a 2000 m deep oil reservoir over an area of 25 km2, thereby extending resistivity methods to deep reservoirs. The resistivity contrast between brine and oil and brine and CO2 is almost the same, and models show that the configuration should work at the Phase II test site to image CO2 over an area of approximately 50 km2. However, the source used in BSEM must be located at the bottom of a borehole, which greatly increases cost and reduces system life and reliability. A new type of EM source that does not require any downhole components was compared to three other potential downhole designs (including BSEM) and found to be comparable or better in all categories. The source is easy to deploy and was tested at a functioning oil field close to, and in the same geology, as the proposed Phase II test site. The measured data agreed very closely with model predictions. A controller will be developed to scale up the prototype source to do a complete survey. Two surveys will be conducted at the Kevin Dome CO2 sequestration site. The first will occur before CO2 injection and the second after 150,000 tons of CO2 has been injected. The resistivity images will be compared to a full suite of seismic, well logs and geochemical data acquired in parallel. These will be the first such deep surveys in the US and a critical first step for CO2 applications and for commercial introduction of this method into the US for mapping the distribution of CO2, oil, water and steam in reservoir formations.

        "abstract": "Due to their extensive use as industrial solvents and metal degreasers, chlorinated organic solvents including trichloroethylene have become persistent contaminants in groundwater and soil at DOE sites and elsewhere. Acute exposures to trichloroethylene can impair the central nervous system, while long-term exposures can induce hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and neurotoxicity. Despite advances to measurement technology at laboratory level, the real-time on-site monitoring technologies for chlorinated organic compounds are still lacking both in terms of selectivity and sensitivity. HJ Science &amp; amp; Technology proposes to build a novel portable microfluidic automation instrument capable of performing automated aqueous organochloride (chlorinated solvent) analysis with high specificity and sensitivity for real-time and on-site environmental monitoring at DoE sites and elsewhere. During the Phase I effort, HJ Science &amp; amp; Technology has established the technical feasibility of performing microfluidic automation of organ chloride speciation. In particular, we have successfully    performed    on-chip    separation    and    detection    of    trichloroethylene    and dichloromethane in an aqueous mixture.   In addition, we have also successfully demonstrated microfluidic automation of sample preparation and analysis capability. The Phase II work plan includes optimizing the microfluidic automation procedure for organochloride conjugation and fluorescence labeling in order to further improve the detection sensitivity.  The Phase II work will also include refining the fabrication method for microfluidic chip capable of complete end-to-end automation of sample processing.  Finally, the overall goal of the Phase II effort is to design, build, and test a portable organochloride speciation Phase II prototype for real-time and on-site environmental monitoring.  Commercial Applications and OtherBenefits: In addition to the DOE sites, the proposed technology can also be used to perform real-time monitoring  of  chlorinated  organic  compounds  in  drinking  water  as  regulated  by  the  EPA. Beyond government agencies, the proposed technology has immediate applications in private environmental remediation companies and waste management agencies.",

        "abstract": "Observing solid-liquid interfaces with high resolution is important for comprehension of physical, chemical, and biological interactions between material and fluid. A more detailed knowledge of these interactions can substantially improve our understanding of the processes that occur during operation of catalysts and degradation of materials inside battery, as well as the operation of biological systems. Currently, a few liquid stages at synchrotrons have been home-built and suffer from leaks, are extremely cumbersome to use and do not provide any additional capabilities such as electrical biasing and heating of the sample. Failures of these liquid cells make experiments extremely challenging to carry out and in some cases endanger surrounding equipment. Our approach in this project will be to develop a continuous flow environmental cell specifically for X-ray microscopes that will allow operation of the sample in liquid and gas at a wide range of pressures and with on-chip electrical and heating capabilities. In Phase I we developed and successfully tested a prototype of the environmental cell and integrated it in a synchrotron X-Ray microscope. In Phase II we will develop this system to a production ready package that includes an integrated 3-axis holder motion stage and electrical biasing and heating capabilities of the sample, providing a wide range of in-situ abilities. Dynamic in-situ experiments are finding increasing use as direct methods to explore the relationships among materials processing methods, microstructure, and functional properties. X-ray microscopy can provide information about changes in chemical structure of materials with high spatial resolution during dynamic in- situ experiments. Many processes such as degradation of materials, charging/discharging of batteries, operation of cells/bacteria can be studied with X-ray microscopy and are of a great importance to academic as well as industrial research. The proposed platform provides a tool to study such changes in the chemical structure of materials.",

        "abstract": "The inability to dynamically image materials at atomic resolution in changing liquid environments is a significant impediment to the advancement of physical, chemical, biological, medical, and material sciences.  Hummingbird Scientific, via its liquid cell holders, has greatly enhanced the ability of researchers to obtain transmission electron micrographs of materials at atomic resolution while in liquid environments.  However, no product currently on the market allows the TEM  data  to  be  correlated  with  other  environmental  parameters  directly  measured  in microfluidic cell. This proposal will aim to resolve environmental parameter measurement and control issues.  These goals will be accomplished by developing and bringing to market a new in-situ TEM microfluidic holder that contains an integrated, microfabricated pH sensor and temperature sensor in addition to a heating element.   This new tool will allow researchers to measure and control environmental parameters at the sample directly and will be a crucial enabling technique for opening up the possibilities of in-situ experiments in liquids where for electrochemical processes the local (change in) concentration of acids and bases at the sample are key reaction parameters. The phase I project successfully developed a working prototype of a microfluidic TEM specimen holder with integrated pH and temperature measuring capabilities. In  phase  II  of  this  project,  we  will  integrate  the  sensor  into  a  single  device,  allowing simultaneous pH and temperature measurement, as well as temperature control.  This will be integrated with control hardware and software to make a turn-key system. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the availability of a characterization technique that can image solid/liquid interfaces up to atomic resolution under quantifiable and accurately controllable environmental conditions. This will provide new insights into the process controlling assembly and, ultimately, function in biological systems and biomolecular material as well as insights into material microstructural changes during active electrochemical processes. Our understanding of either case is limited because, until recently, we lacked an experimental tool possessing both the spatial and temporal resolution needed to capture the formative events.  While in situ TEM has emerged as an enabling capability in this regard, to develop a predictive understanding that can impact biomedical and materials technologies, we require an environment in which temperature is tightly controlled and pH is measured. This new window into these materials promises dramatic advances in our understanding of the underlying kinetic factors that control material behavior, leading to more targeted development of new materials.",

        "abstract": "High speed imaging of plasmas is limited to relatively short record lengths and is very expensive. Portions of the tradeoff space where slightly reduced spatial resolution allows gains in record length and reduced costs are poorly explored. HyperV Technologies Corp. proposes to construct a 1000 pixel fiber coupled framing camera with a frame rate of 100 Megaframes per second or better, a record length in excess of 2048 frames, and a pixel depth of 8 to 12 bits. This will allow 2048 frame movies of fast, bright plasma events to be recorded in a single shot. Phase 1 activity centered around the design, construction, and testing of a prototype 100 pixel fiber-coupled streak camera. Images received by a 1x100 array of fibers connected to photodiode pixels were directly integrated with analog front-ends and digital back-ends. Each fiber channel was successfully tested at 20,000,000 frames per second with resolutions of 10 bits, and record lengths of 128,000 frames. The individual channels were then integrated to construct a 100 pixel streak camera (seven modules of fifteen pixels each). The camera was tested by observing fast moving plasma jets as a representative light source. Results of the Phase 1 experimentation were then used to generate designs for cameras with up to 10,000 pixels at the same performance, and also cameras with fewer pixels but at up to five times the speed and increased bit resolution. In Phase 2 a framing camera capable of recording bursts of high speed plasma video at frames rates of 100,000,000 frames per second with arrays of up to 1000 pixels and resolutions of 8, 10, or 12 bits per pixel will be designed, constructed, and tested. Smaller pixel count protoypes will be tested first at HyperV and then at several volunteer university and national lab plasma physics research groups. These testing results will be used to generate the final 1000 pixel full-scale camera design, targeted for the specific needs of pulsed plasma physics research groups. HyperV will then construct a fully operational 1000 pixel prototype camera and test it by observing HyperVs high speed plasma jets.   Commercial Applications and OtherBenefits: The primary commercial application is in sales or rental of the device to researchers performing experiments in which long record length at high speed (i.e. 100 Megaframes per second) is needed and a 1000 pixel resolution is acceptable. This includes magnetic fusion devices such as tokamaks, as well as plasma propulsion, and basic plasma physics research. However other low-shot-count, fast, bright events could be recorded as well, such as in applications in ballistics and explosives.",

        "abstract": "Computational simulation of many of todays important and challenging problems in science and engineering involve multiple, complex, interacting physical systems, and often involve combustion or other sources of energy release. This multiphysics modeling refers to the advanced coupled modeling techniques used to simulate these interacting systems. There are currently no existing accepted open standards for multiphysics application coupling, which causes implementation of many single-problem solutions at high cost. This project will extract and generalize an existing multiphysics software integration infrastructure for use by the broader community interested in developing multiphysics capabilities with existing simulation applications. This general, free, open-source multiphysics infrastructure will serve as a reference implementation to help guide the development of a new open standard for highly inter-operable multiphysics software design and execution. During the Phase I project, a Software Integration Toolkit was designed, and an implementation of that tool kit developed and distributed  as  the Component Object Manager. The approach is to separate the multiphysics capabilities from the underlying software integration constructs, and then to implement the multiphysics-specific capabilities on top of the general software integration infrastructure. A consortium of stakeholders is being assembled, along with an open website to facilitate distribution of the software and interaction be- tween the stakeholders. The Phase II project will extend and complete the infrastructure based on interaction with the consortium members, with the goal of developing a reference implementation for use by the community, and eventual standardization of multiphysics software construction inter- faces. Example applications and verification and validation problems for multiphysics use will also be constructed and distributed freely to provide evidence of the broad utility of the infrastructure.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: An open standardized infrastructure will significantly enhance the ability of private sector users to leverage high-performance-computing modeling and simulation in their critical missions, at a fraction of the current cost. The benefits include increased realism, decreased time-to-solution, increased manufacturing capability, reduced manufacturing cost, and a decrease in the product design cycle. Integration-ready software encapsulating couple- ready models are the future of high-performance-computing-based modeling and simulation, and a key to maintaining national competitiveness.",

The approach is by comparing sophisticated simulation to measurements of novel anode designs, validated by the similar comparison using the LAPPD baseline RF anode stripline design. Models of these anodes and the neighboring micro-channel plate structures and front-end coupling have been constructed in a proprietary 4- dimensional electromagnetic finite-difference time domain (FDTD)  simulation code developed over 20 years by the small business. The simulations agree extremely well with measurements of the baseline LAPPD anodes. The overall objective is the development of: 1) anodes with bandwidths of 4-6 GHz and substantially reduced crosstalk, and 2)  pad-based anodes allowing application-specific patterns. Models of the baseline LAPPD anode were created in the FDTD simulation framework, and validated by comparison to measurements. The factors governing the analog bandwidth limit and cross-talk were identified from the simulation. New designs have been proposed and simulated that show improved analog bandwidth by factors of 3 or more, with substantially reduced cross-talk. The plans for Phase II are: 1) to construct, simulate, and measure prototypes of the new designs. 2) working closely with the proponents to optimize designs for collider, PET, and high-occupancy neutrino detectors, and 3) to integrate optimized designs into the LAPPD package for commercial production.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The availability of large-area photodetectors with excellent time and space resolution would be transformational in scientific, medical, and security markets. If successful, the work proposed here makes application-specific optimization for lower cost much easier. A beneficial side-effect is to broaden the market for large-scale applications in the medical and security fields, lowering the unit cost for scientific applications.",

        "abstract": "The use of non-native substrates for GaN- based devices leads to devices with high densities of defects stemming from misfit dislocation formation due to lattice mismatch and large values of wafer bow stemming from thermal mismatch. The latter is particularly problematic as one attempts to grow device films on large area substrates. The high defect densities give rise to degraded performance and reliability, while the wafer bow can be problematic to device fabrication as well as to growth of e.g. InGaN at lower temperatures than underlying buffer layer temperatures, reducing device yields. The technology proposed utilizes HVPE films grown on both sides of the wafer, which results in a bow-free, thick GaN template which is scalable to large diameter substrates. Templates are polished to an epi-ready finish, which is only possible when the wafers are flat in the first place. We have demonstrated the FLAAT concept using 2 and 4 sapphire for GaN thicknesses up to 50 microns. Initial LED results yielded lower wavelength distribution across a wafer than a control layer directly on sapphire. Phase II of this program will improve the structural, optical, and electrical properties of the templates as well as demonstrate the concept at 6. We will additionally demonstrate the concept using AlN films instead of GaN films.   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The technology can provide the quality of freestanding GaN at the cost of a GaN template so many types of devices can be impacted by the availability of the FLAAT templates.

In Phase II the team of MicroXact, MSU, OSU, ORLN and TechOpp Consulting will develop and test stand-alone sensors and instruments.

However, these premier parallel modeling tools are too difficult for non-experts to use effectively.

High-performance computing is especially critical for the design of superconducting RF electron guns and accelerating booster cavities for high current electron beams. For these systems, the fields induced by the beam itself impact the performance of the accelerating structures. A self consistent solution that treats the cavity fields and the fields of the beam itself is needed. The cost of performing high-current beam testing is prohibitive for repeated iteration of accelerator prototypes, but the input from high-performance computing codes can be used to perform most of this iteration in the design phase.

        "abstract": "In the proposed collider eRHIC, hadrons from one of the RHIC storage rings will interact with electrons accelerated in a six-pass energy recovery linac (ERL). The maximum energy of protons will be 250 GeV and the maximum energy of electrons will be 30 GeV.   The machine will heavily rely on SRF technology.  One accelerator physics issue being considered in the design is that the nonlinearities of the accelerating linac in the ERL produce a spread in energy which will degrade the polarization of the electron beam.  One way to compensate these nonlinearities is to use a harmonic SRF linac at a multiple of the main linac frequency of 704 MHz. There are a number of challenges in developing these SRF cavities. First, related to the very high current  in  the  ERL,  is  minimizing  the  Higher  Order  Mode  (HOM)  power  generation  and damping this power efficiently. Second is maximizing the real-estate gradient in the limited space available. Third is to design a cryogenic-efficient cavity. In the Phase I project, an innovative design for these harmonic cavities was identified  a multi- cell  accelerating  cavity  with  a  special  coupling  cell  based  on  a  photonic  band gap  (PBG) structure. This structure allows very strong damping of higher-order modes which leak through the photonic-band gap array, it increases the real-estate gradient by eliminating the end groups which  are  usually  used  for  fundamental  and  higher-order  mode  coupling  in  SRF  multicell cavities, and has a potential many-cell upgrade path with excellent cryogenic efficiency. The Phase II project will build the first-ever multi-cell superconducting accelerating cavity with a PBG coupling cell, addressing the mechanical design and manufacturing issues along with the cavity tuning and power coupling challenges. In Phase III, Niowave will collaborate with Brookhaven National Laboratory (host for eRHIC) and Los Alamos National Laboratory (developers of the photonic band gap SRF cavity designs) to offer complete harmonic cavity systems for eRHIC and to develop and market highly damped SRF cavities using PBG cells for high-current accelerator projects worldwide.",

Companies have yet to harness the potential of powerful new computing technologies to find solutions for energy and other costly inefficiencies persisting in their supply chains  many of which must be solved in real-time. This project addresses DOEs interest in turnkey solutions advancing the use of HPC in manufacturing and is intended to result in increased supply chain efficiency, reduced costs, and job creation.  The overall objective is to develop a next generation production planning and distribution optimization algorithm together with a data-integration platform to provide timely and accurate data required for the optimization model.

Phase I R &amp; amp;D resulted in (1) a comprehensive model formulation that provides vehicle routing, production optimization and inventory optimization simultaneously and (2) a Big Data analytics framework to support the generation of the required input data. We demonstrated that using HPC, we can achieve 1080- times faster performance (vs. non-HPC implementation) without loss of optimality, thus proving feasibility of our innovation. We used industrial data and benchmarking to prove optimality and scalability. Our results were reviewed by several prospective customers and we received encouraging feedback (see support letters). We plan to build on the formulations and the test-bed created in Phase I and improve our algorithms. Our research activities will also focus on overcoming challenges including scalability of the solution, data security, and total cost of ownership.

        "abstract": "The Department of Energy and other federal agencies have made significant investments in software performance engineering tools, which can be complex and difficult to use.   Novice users first encountering a tools complexity and vast array of features are intimidated and easily frustrated.  There is also a lack of advanced  problem  identification  capabilities  so users rely heavily  on  their  own  experience  and  intuition  to  identify  the  root  cause  of  a  software performance problem.   These problems limit the tools adoption by small companies and independent software vendors, particularly in the manufacturing sector. This project is developing a complete production grade software performance engineering product that lowers the barriers to entry for novice users and enhances their ability to mine actionable information from software performance data.  The new product presents a simple, intuitive, and systemized user interface that guides users through performance engineering workflows and will use advanced cloud-hosted performance analysis services to offer unprecedented data analysis and problem detection capabilities. Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of the approach by developing a prototype performance engineering product that successfully resolved pain points in every stage of the performance engineering workflow and measurably simplified tool usage.  In a study of 124 unique workflows, the prototype shortened workflows by approximately 50% and reduced   the number of commands a user must master from eight to exactly one. Phase II will further develop the new product, particularly for applications that use co-processing accelerators, and demonstrate the feasibility of using cloud-hosted performance analysis services to improve productivity. Cloud-hosted performance data storage, analysis, reporting, and visualization services will be prototyped using the new product as client-side software.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Performance engineering is critical to delivering the full potential of high-end parallel computing, a fundamental technology for science and engineering discovery.   We anticipate that products developed in part by this project will improve engineering capabilities for approximately half of the roughly 280,000 manufacturers in the United States who missed deadlines or restricted product development in 2012 due to performance limitations of on-site computing resources.",

Germanium gamma-ray detector technology has been an important factor in the historic success of these user facilities. The present and next generation facilities would be most effectively utilized by larger germanium detectors providing better spatial resolution and higher count-ray capacity. New Modular Planar Germanium (MPGe) detector system development will provide a new detector basis for arrays at user facilities. Through collaboration with nuclear physicists, prototype MPGe detector systems will be evolved from concept to commercially available instruments. During Phase I, the original MPGe concepts were experimentally demonstrated. These measurements validated improvements in the operating characteristics of existing detector systems that established the feasibility of the new MPGe detectors for higher luminosity physics experiments. The concept was developed into a prototype MPGe design. The prototype MPGe design will used to make the first of a series of prototype MPGe detectors during Phase II. These detectors will be used to further develop algorithms to improve the detector performance. The detectors will be evaluated by nuclear physicists in conditions relevant to nuclear physics experiments.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  In addition to immediate impact at DOE user facilities performing nuclear physics experiments, the enabling detector technologies will impact nuclear security and nuclear medicine. Nuclear security and nuclear medicine represent large commercial markets. Nuclear security is the most immediately accessible market. Nuclear medicine is the very largest market, requiring a longer term approach.

        "abstract": "Existing high current negative ion sources have unacceptably short lifetimes.   In this Phase II project, a long lifetime, high reliability H- ion source capable of delivering current greater than 10 mA will be constructed, built, and tested. Feasibility was proven and preliminary designs were completed during Phase I.  The immediate DoE need for this technology is a H- ion source to serve as an injector to proposed Intensity Frontier accelerators at Fermi National Laboratory.  There are several other science, medical, energy, and industrial applications for which this technology will enhance capabilities.  Existing H- ion sources embed the H- production in a plasma environment. Inevitability, these H- production processes lead to transport and extraction complications.  Disadvantages of existing H- sources are power and gas inefficiencies, leading to low duty factor operation, and large vacuum facilities to maintain injector pressure.  Larger duty factor and H- sources have comparatively short lifetimes before ion source refurbishment is required. An ion source generating hyperthermal hydrogen atoms via the interaction of molecular hydrogen ions with electrons generated in a 2.45 GHz microwave source (MWS) will be constructed.  These atoms will be converted to H- ions via surface and volume conversion mechanisms.     Recent  advances  in  positive  ion  sources  using  the  resonant  interaction  of  2.45  GHz microwaves in hydrogen gas with an 875 Gauss magnetic field have led to intense DC positive ion beams.  Twenty five percent efficiency in converting hydrogen gas into positive ions using 1 kW of microwave power has been routinely observed. MWSs are becoming increasingly common in commercial use due their inherent DC operating capability.   The Phase I study showed that these positive ion sources can be modified to be good sources of atomic hydrogen and negative ion beams.   Phase II will construct of source construction and extensive testing with a suite of diagnostics. Though H- ion sources enjoy several advantages over positive ion sources, their commercial use has been limited by their short lifetime.   In this work, a modified 2.45 GHz microwave proton source will be used as a source of neutral hydrogen atoms that will be surface-converted to H- ions and extracted into a high current, low emittance ion beam.  The anticipated result will be a prototype of an extremely reliable DC H- ion source capable of producing greater than 10 mA of beam, which will enable a wide range of DoE and commercial applications including isotope production and separation, semiconductor manufacturing applications, cyclotron injectors, and ion injectors for magnetic confinement fusion energy.",

        "abstract": "The methods are sought for real-time in-situ monitoring of the irradiation performance of graphitic components in the cores of next-generation nuclear plants. Such structural monitoring is necessary because radiation-induced damage to graphite can lead to mechanical degradation, dimensional change, and porosity, which can compromise the safety of the operation of the reactor. The information on the graphite degradation can be used by nuclear reactor operators to improve the reliability, sustain the safety, and extend the life of current and future reactors.  A new device is proposed, based on a Compton imaging tomography technology recently pioneered. Using this approach, the structure is scanned by a planar X-ray beam, and the 3D density profile of the material is reconstructed from the Compton-scattered X-ray images recorded at multiple positions of the beam. In contrast to existing approaches, this technology permits much quicker and less expensive examination of nuclear graphite condition, without disrupting the integrity of nuclear components. In Phase I, a novel nondestructive evaluation technology has been  developed  and  demonstrated  for  inspection  of  nuclear  graphite  components,  with emphasis on future use in gas-cooled next-generation nuclear plants. A thorough analysis of nuclear graphite inspection needs in the context of next generator nuclear plants operation was completed, and the required evaluation performance parameters were formulated to address the customer needs. Based on the target performance parameters, a prototype inspection system has been designed via modeling and system analysis, and its feasibility demonstrated experimentally by imaging defects and cracks in samples of several types of nuclear graphite, with density resolution ~1% and penetration depth ~5 cm, with resolution ~2 mm. In Phase II, plans call for development and optimization of a system design with enhanced evaluation performance, and fabrication of a standalone system for graphite inspection that will be tested at the end of the project at project subcontractor, who is responsible for next-generation nuclear plant development.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: In addition to the inspection of graphite components  in  reactor  cores,  this  approach  (with  slight  modifications)  can  be  used  for evaluating the integrity of refractory, ceramic, and composite components in nuclear reactors. Due to its small size, the system can also be used in oil and gas applications for borehole wall inspections and in refineries for pipeline maintenance and monitoring.",

        "abstract": "An improved method is needed for the detection of radiological materials for nuclear nonproliferation and safety. Current techniques using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), while robust, are limited in range due to pulse energy and diffraction. Furthermore, atmospheric broadening of the spectral lines reduces the sensitivity of the detection scheme, such as optical emission spectroscopy, to measure the isotopic content of radiological materials at standoff distances. We have proposed the use of femtosecond laser pulses that can form stable filament s air overcoming diffraction and the high energy requirement. They can, thus, deliver high intensity for ablation to interrogate radiological materials or target samples at long distances. We have experimentally demonstrated the utility and potential of optical filaments for LIBS at range. The ablation plasma from femtosecond pulses and optical filaments show remarkably different characteristics from a nanosecond laser plasma that seem to suggest that atmospheric broadening is less critical for femtosecond and filament LIBS in air. We have also demonstrated a new technique to increase the range and intensity of filaments for long range propagation. We plan to combine optical emission spectroscopy with laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS) to investigate the plume dynamics of laser ablation plasmas from nanosecond, femtosecond laser pulses and optical filaments over a broad spectral range. This will enable us to select the best spectral range for laser interrogation of radiological materials at standoff distances.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The proposed technology will allow the precise and accurate measurements of radiological materials using LIBS and LAS. These techniques can also be applied for other atmospheric monitoring and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) applications.",

        "abstract": "Networked applications work very badly when delay variation (queuing delay) gets large but evidence shows that current queuing delays are barely tolerable and rapidly increasing. There are a plethora of commercial, home-rolled, open source, and university created tools, but none are capable of measuring and monitoring delay variation in real-time or isolating its root cause, thus this projects aim is to fill that gap with no or minimal impact (additional traffic) to the network. The goal of the proposed work is distributed network monitoring to identify delay bottlenecks, process the data to compactly represent its real-time variation, then securely exchange the results in a way that allows all the involved parties to collaboratively locate the delays root cause while not compromising their privacy or security. Making the secure, privacy-preserving dissemination of the new delay information part of the solution allows it to be easily incorporated into existing network management products. The project plan includes working with established small businesses in the network management area to integrate delay-based diagnostic information and working with linux developers to integrate the measurement points into the kernel. A method and proof-of-concept software implementation were developed for a Transport Segment Delay Estimator (TSDE). The TSDE infers path delay behavior based on a novel extraction of information collected at a single point. Using simulated scenarios, the method was successfully validated and output data was compressed by three orders of magnitude. A prototype of the TSDE will be implemented in a commodity network device and tested. A packet loss detection feature for the TSDE will be evaluated. A secure, distributed measurement architecture to include TSDE results in a Network Management Aggregator will be developed, using standards-based approaches where possible.  Commercial Applications and OtherBenefits: The TSDE can be deployed in home or ISP routers. The data can be used by network managers to detect and isolate bufferbloat, a drag on productivity and a barrier to energy-saving programs like telecommuting and telepresence. TSDE data can pinpoint most critically affected parts of infrastructure. The techniques can be used in the the DoE networks and between networks to share data.",

In particular, such electrical measurements could support the development and manufacture of advanced energy related materials used in technologies such as photovoltaic cells, fuel cells and advanced batteries, thereby increasing performance and/or lowering production costs. The goal of this project is to develop microwave imaging add-on modules and probes capable of quantitatively measuring the electrical properties of small regions of a material using microwaves.  These modules for scanning probe microscopes, such as atomic force microscopes, make use of the near-field interaction between the exciting microwaves and a material and can resolve regions 10 nanometers in size (less than a million atoms) with little perturbation of the material.  In Phase 1 commercial probes and modified hardware were used to establish the feasibility of using microwave imaging systems to quantify local permittivity and conductivity.  Repeatable measurements that vary in a systematic way with electrical parameters were obtained from a variety of samples.  The proposed plan for Phase 2 is to develop research prototypes of the needed hardware and probes and research their performance against test structures and real-world samples. These prototypes will improve upon a commercially available scanning microwave imaging module.  This current non-quantitative product is based upon a decade of university research, and is compatible with major commercial AFM platforms.

Ni-base single crystal (SX) superalloy blades have high creep strength and are widely used in aerospace engines, but their use in industrial gas turbines (IGT) is limited primarily due to castability issues and low yield. Current techniques for developing new SX alloys are empirical in nature and are inadequate in identifying unique alloy compositions that can satisfy both the processing and property objectives.  QuesTek Innovations LLC, a leader in integrated computational materials engineering, is designing a SX Ni-based superalloy that can be cast effectively as large IGT blade components, provide superior high-T creep performance comparable to state-of-the-art aeroturbine blades, thereby allowing increased thermal efficiency. During the Phase I, QuesTek successfully developed, calibrated and validated critical computation models on the liquid density and buoyancy, phase stability, and precipitate coarsening etc. These models, together with QuesTeks existing proprietary Integrated Computational Materials Engineering tools and design platform, were utilized to design a new prototype single crystal alloy, QTSX. The preliminary casting and testing results of QTSX have demonstrated advantage over 2nd Generation SX alloy ReneN5. The technical objectives of the Phase II will be to further refine QuesTeks process-structure and structure- property models (including explicit creep rate model) and optimize the design in Phase I.

The problem is particularly acute in the next generation X-ray FELs which will be using seeding techniques and where the energy spread requirements are more stringent. Its been proposed to mitigate this problem by using a passive corrugated structure with a mm-scale aperture, generating strong longitudinal wakefields to remove head-to-tail residual chirp in the beam in relatively short distances. In this project, a proof-of-concept prototype of the corrugated structure will be developed, in the context of applications for multi-GeV X-ray FEL beamlines. The prototype structure will feature planar geometry with an adjustable gap, to enable residual chirp removal over a large range of X- ray FEL operating conditions. The device can also serve as a more general tool for tailoring electron beams longitudinal phase space properties in a wide range of scenarios. A small-scale (18 cm long) prototype was developed and tested experimentally on a 60 MeV electron beamline. While performed at low energy, the experiment was a critical step towards technical approach validation, and provided an important benchmark for numerical models. A full-scale GeV-class prototype Dechirper (2 meters) will be designed, fabricated, installed and commissioned at the operating LCLS light source facility.

        "abstract": "Conventional linear lattice accelerator designs limit the available dynamic aperture because they are unstable to chromatic effects and subject to resonances.  By designing a lattice that is non- linear from the initial design, so-called integrable optics, the dynamic aperture can be increased as particles can pass through resonances and are less sensitive to chromatic aberrations in the lattice.  Integrable optics implementation could become a major breakthrough to extend the intensity frontier of particle accelerators, and advance exploration of small cross section events such as lepton flavor oscillations. In response to such opportunity, it is proposed to develop non-linear magnetic inserts required to produce the requisite non-linear motion at the IOTA ring, an electron accelerator ring under construction at Fermilab, which is designed to test non-linear dynamics in a scaled model of the larger proton machine. A successful development of the prototype insert would facilitate the first practical demonstration of the integrable optics accelerator. A magnetic design and initial engineering of the non-linear magnetic insert were completed. A four sectors bench top prototype was fabricated, and measured with the pulsed wire and a Hall probe. A full-scale (2 meters long) prototype insert will be fabricated, characterized through magnetic measurements, and installed on the IOTA ring.  In addition, a beam transport experiment with the prototype insert will be performed at Fermilab.

Such low propagation velocity results in concentrated energy dissipation and irreversible damage of the magnet during an unprotected quench. This project is developing a novel method for quench protection of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets based on coupling the magnet with a high-power resonant coil. The quench protection is realized by applying an electromagnetic pulse through the resonant coil and disrupting the superconducting state in the conductor. This creates a large (10s of meters) normal zone in less than 10 ms, thus ensuring even distribution of the energy dissipation. The proposed protection system does not involve generation of high voltage on the coil leads and does not contribute to cryogenic losses. The system is easily scaled to a magnet of arbitrary size. Multi-Physics design, mechanical design, fabrication and systematic study of a proof of concept experiment utilizing this inductive was executed. A HTS solenoid with this quench protection system will be designed, built and tested for utilization in Ultrafast Electron Microscopy (UEM) experiments at the UCLA Pegasus Laboratory. physics magnets.

The new technology will deliver compact, high spatial-resolution, high-efficiency, thermal- neutron detectors capable of real-time neutron measurements; such devices currently do not exist.   Commercial Applications and OtherBenefits:  Development of the novel solid-state neutron detector array design will benefit a wide spectrum of applications beyond those of neutron scattering instruments.   The scientific and commercial impact from the proposed research is expected to be significant, where the technology can meet the imaging demands of new generations of neutron scattering instruments.  The neutron-imaging device has direct applications in many other areas of science and engineering, such as in high-resolution neutron radiography/tomography, in neutron diffraction studies for stress/strain  measurements  in  materials  with  internal  defects,  and  for  surface  diffraction  studies  of coatings.",

        "abstract": "While substantial advancements have been made in realizing tube based large area detectors such as the Large Area Picosecond Photo-Detector (LAPPD), there is widespread agreement in the cathode community that a higher QE bialkali cathode is possible, and that the present understanding is largely-recipe driven without the adequate control or understanding to achieve the previously observed high yield of narrowly clustered QE &amp; apos;s.  Thus, the goal of this SBIR is to develop high quantum efficiency photocathodes, based on a robust understanding of the underlying physics and chemistry. The challenges associated with the deposition of multi-alkali-antimony photocathode will be addressed using two main strategies, 1) pre-synthesis of multi-alkali-antimony compounds using specialized technique, and 2) deposition of the synthesized compound to form a high QE photocathode.  In-situ monitoring of photocathode growth using such techniques as dynamic X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) will permit process optimization to realize as yet unattainable QE response with significant gains in process yields.  The process thus developed will be amenable for large scale production of large area photocathodes in a cost effective manner. The key accomplishment of the Phase I research is the invention of a novel synthesis route for ultrapure photocathode compound from its constituents, whose chemical composition and lattice parameters perfectly match the calculated theoretical model slated to perform with significantly higher QEs than is currently demonstrated.  Deposition of this material to form a photocathode film was performed and its characteristic properties demonstrated.  A joint patent application from the participating institutions has been filed. The Phase II research will extend the Phase I study to further enhance the photocathode QE through a robust understanding of the correspondence between theory, the materials growth, and thin film fabrication.  Technology commercialization efforts will be undertaken in parallel with the research.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The ability to consistently make photocathodes with high QE at high yields will substantially lower the cost per detected photon in large water Cherenkov counters for short- and long-baseline neutrino experiments, Positron-Emission Tomography, and other applications limited by photon counting. The improved QE also ameliorates  the  difference  in  QE  between  vacuum-based  and  silicon  technologies,  while retaining the big advantage in noise, gain, and bandwidth. In addition, a robust theoretical understanding of the relationship between cathode growth procedures and electronic band- structure, scattering, and morphology will allow improvements in cathodes for other regions of the spectrum, including in the UV (liquid-Argon, liquid-Xe) and the IR (defense and astronomy).",

        "abstract": "Modern science and High-Energy Physics in particular, use scientific workflows to collect and analyze extremely large data sets using high-performance data acquisitions systems. As the requirements for scientific data processing systems continue to grow, fundamentally new approaches must be developed to meet future needs. The data distribution technology must support extreme data rates and must scale to 1000s of nodes. As the development of scientific workflows is highly collaborative, seamless evolution of algorithms and input/output data types must be supported without disrupting or complicating workflow development. The new solutions must be more robust and flexible than currently available solutions. Finally, as these systems grow larger and larger, effective software techniques are needed to control (startup, shutdown), configure, and manage scientific assets. This Phase II SBIR proposes a new approach based on the international OMG Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard to support scalable and extremely high-throughput messaging for High- Energy Physics applications. Our implementation, RTI Connext DDS, has been proven in high-performance industrial and military real-time distributed systems. DDS supports loose coupling, discoverable, structured data models, tunable quality-of-service, and extensible typesall of which are significant improvements over the prior generation of technologies and therefore, highly desirable in scientific data processing. Phase I research demonstrated that DDS is an attractive technology for scientific data processing. RTI Connext DDS exceeded the expected bandwidth goals while being very resource efficient. The developed communication patterns were shown to simplify programming and system management. Phase II research will productize the DDS features deemed  essential  for  scientific  data  processing.  Specifically,  a  high-throughput transport,  a  powerful  data modeling capability, communication patterns, and a standards-based application programming interface will be productized. Feedback from the subject matter experts at national labs will be incorporated in the work plan to ensure alignment. The main objective of this research project is to meet the requirements of high-energy physics and Astrophysics applications. However, the resulting technology is applicable in a much broader context. For example, finance and healthcare domains often require systems that support extremely high throughput and low latency. Large-scale distributed systems in aerospace and defense, energy  systems,  factory  automation,  and  transportation  are  critically  dependent  on  having  a  robust  data distribution middleware for physical infrastructure control and management. The technology developed under this SBIR will be immediately applicable in several other commercial as well as government programs. RTI is experienced in commercializing technology with 100s of successful customers and maintains its top 1% rank (a rating of 100 in the DoD commercialization achievement index) as assigned by the DoD.",

        "abstract": "Extreme high vacuum (XHV) systems are characterized by very low gas pressure and a small outgassing rate of the system surfaces. The pumping techniques required to reach XHV conditions impede further reduction of the XHV pressure by either re-emitting chemically-stored pumped gas or allowing back streaming of exhaust gas. It will be advantageous to be able to switch to a true gas exhausting pump without any danger of back streaming, after reaching XHV pressures.  An XHV-specific passive, power-free pump, capable of permanently removing hydrogen gas from the system via permeation through a palladium membrane, will be constructed. The pump consists of a hydrogen transparent membrane capable of withstanding a differential pressure of several atmospheres differential pressure. The upstream side of the membrane is exposed directly to the vacuum, while downstream  is  connected  to  a  small  exterior  volume  continuously  micro-flushed with  inert  gas  to transport the permeated hydrogen away. The principle milestone in the Phase I was to show that a Pd membrane or foil could successfully be operated in vacuum to transport hydrogen one way, i.e., it pumps. This was accomplished and the foils were shown to be mechanically robust with their pumping action simulated using COMSOL. The overall Phase II program goal is to optimize the Perm-Pump design for maximum pumping speed while improving its robustness against overpressure and contamination, and demonstrate its operation at extreme high vacuum. At the end, a prototype will be ready for demonstration. This pump will extend system pressures into the lower XHV range, without the re-contamination from conventional vacuum pumps that reduces effective pumping speeds.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The pumps advantage is that it will operate at the low end of the ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) range and all the XHV range. Those laboratories utilizing XHV can immediately take advantage of it use on existing systems as a direct add on product. Such a major improvement in pumping technology would also spur efforts to improve materials and make XHV systems as common as UHV systems are now. Commercial uses would include semiconductor EUV lithography, MEMS devices, and the aerospace industry as well as science labs.",

        "abstract": "ScienceTomorrow in collaboration with Dr. David C Joy, at the University of Tennessee Research is proposed to fabricate direct digital Quantitative Secondary Electron Detectors (QSED) for scanning electron microscopes (SEMs).  If successful, commercial versions of the QSED would transform the SEM/STEM into a quantitative, metrological tool with enhanced capabilities that, in turn, would broaden research horizons across many industries. In Phase I the detector was fabricated and tested for sensitivities, noise reduction, DC offset elimination, and metrological capabilities (linearity, accuracy, etc.).  10X10 solid state devices were made using standard lithography planner process. The devices were wired, bonded, and assembled on to the microscope. The separated charge carrier were allowed to accumulate across the electrodes. The Charge were measured and correlated with Secondary electron collection. The results are achieved meeting the proposed objectives in Phase I: 1) QSED produces no more than -34dB of detector noise across its entire operating range results in improved SNR with QSED as characterized the detective quantum efficiency (DQE) being equal to geometric efficiency. 2) a near zero DC-offset (dynamic range &amp; gt; -35 dB) achieved for all operating conditions demonstrating improved dynamic range, and  3) Demonstrated that the QSED image contrast achieves a nearly within R2 of 0.992 linear relationship with SE collections. A near (.8% of reading) linear relationship between pixel signal and collection, will enable quantitative, nanoscale, dimensional measurement from SEM images. Together milestones #1, #2, and #3, if successful achievement, demonstrates an improved signal-to- noise ratio, a practically unlimited dynamic range, and quantitative imaging in the sub-5nm regimes which are not possible with ET detectors. Thus, this approach could lead to transforming SEMs into commercially viable, quantitative metrology tools, both for the OEM and retrofit markets. This work will produce a crucial advancement in electron microscopy with wide-ranging applications. In Phase II scale up the Solid State Device Array (SSDA) and integrate electron counter in the device. Also, characterize the device to validate the design and develop compatible interface software. Integrate device and software for critical dimension measurement in sub-nanometer scale.  Key advantages anticipated from this work: 1.   Low noise will improve SEM resolution in nano-scale critical for dimensional metrology.  2.   Quantitative measurement will enhance process control, improve reliability prediction and design validation in semiconductors, photo-voltaic, bio-medical devices and catalysts. 3.   Video and dynamic-imaging will advance nano-scale research in pharmaceutical and semiconductor.  4. Lower cost will make high-performing electron microscopes affordable to more researchers. 5. Compact size and ease of integration will enable to retrofit and upgrade existing SEM/STEMs. In private briefings on this concept, this QSED idea has generated enthusiastic interest among a number of SEM makers, service companies and existing SEM users who have also offered to support ST in this project. The proposed QSED advance sits squarely in the middle of ScienceTomorrows mission and, if successful, will further the companys business strategy by launching an advanced, high-margin product that will enable the company and its partners to create at least 17 net-new jobs by the end of 2018.",

        "abstract": "Solid-state power electronic circuits that incorporate switching devices such as IGBTs, IGCTs and MOSFETs can now operate at voltages as high as 3KV to 6.0+KV with peak currents of 0.5-6.0+KA.  Modulators built with various topologies require high voltage, energy  storage  capacitors,  that  can  operate  at  the  same  voltage  and  current  as  the switching devices.  Presently such capacitors are large, costly and cannot be integrated onto the same boards as the rest of the power electronic components. This SBIR program addresses the  development  of  solid-state  Polymer-Multi-Layer (PML) capacitors, for use in high ripple current and dV/dt pulse power applications. PML capacitors comprise thin high temperature polymer dielectrics with breakdown strength  greater  than  1000V/m.    A  large  area  mother  capacitor  material  with thousands of capacitor layers is formed, which is segmented into capacitor chips that have low ESR and ESL and can withstand temperatures &amp; gt;260oC. The Phase I development demonstrated PML capacitors with 2,000 to 3,000 layers, with excellent capacitance and dissipation factor stability in the temperature range of -60oC to 160oC. 10F parts were successfully tested with multiple discharges up to 1100V, discharging 2KApeak current at di/dt &amp; gt;1000A/s.   PML capacitors with such pulse power capacity have an energy density of 1.8J/cc, which is approximately 100X improvement over state of the art pulse capacitors, which utilize a lower temperature polypropylene film dielectric with double metallized polyester film electrodes. The Phase II development will focus on solving interconnection problems identified in the Phase I work, when several capacitors are connected in series using a bifilar configuration, as well as termination damage when attaching leads to the first and last capacitors.  PML capacitors with internal series connections will be produced, which will eliminate the need for external series connections. Instead, capacitor chips with a voltage rating of 1KV to 5KV will be stacked in parallel configuration to form a small surface mounted capacitor block.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Commercial applications include inverter DC-Link capacitors for hybrid and electric vehicles, wind power generators, large-scale PV installations, electric trains, elevators and industrial power supplies.  DC-link capacitors currently produced using polypropylene film dielectrics are one of the largest, costliest and most failure prone components in an inverter. Cost, weight, and volume improvements in automotive inverters, will improve the competitiveness of U.S. automotive power electronic OEMs and will have a direct impact in oil consumption and overall dependence on foreign energy imports.",

This project is being extended in scope to include in Phase IIB the development of a turn-key X-ray spectrometer that will meet growing needs for advanced detectors for synchrotron science applications.

This approach is inefficient. A few US Industries that have used virtual design and analysis tools have developed environmentally-friendly fabrication processes, improved quality and performance, and reduced manufacturing costs to remain globally competitive. The Phase II project leverages an existing, state-of-the-art software code Virtual Fabrication Technology (VFT) used currently to design and model large welded structures prior to fabrication - to a broader range of applications and products for widespread use by small and medium-sized companies.  This will enable these companies to have on-demand access both to weld modeling training and to low cost weld simulation technology through a cloud-based high performance computing portal. In Phase I the VFT code, which was tied to an expensive commercial solver, was modified to perform efficiently on a high performance open source finite element code called WARP3D.  The results from Phase I clearly demonstrated that the software code produces high speed accurate solutions and can enable these fabricators to overcome the barriers to high performance computing using an easy-to-use portal. The Phase II program goal is to complete the adaptation of a (HPC) software code so it is accessible and useable to small and medium sized firms to improve their manufacturing and fabrication processes that yield products that have higher quality at reduced costs. The new software will be hosted on the Manufacturing and Polymer (M &amp; amp;P) Portal within the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) at the Ohio State University.

        "abstract": "The negative-electron-affinity (NEA) photocathodes which produce polarized electrons are a vital component of electron accelerators such as that at DoE Jefferson Lab and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). Future systems, such as the International Linear Collider (ILC), will require a polarized electron beam intensity at least 20 times greater than produced by strained GaAs, which is used in the current generation of photocathodes.  Additionally, the degree of electron polarization needs to be increased beyond the 80% currently attainable and intrinsic material properties related to improving the surface charge limit must also be addressed, and the photocathodes should be more robust in an RF gun environment. The end result of the combined Phase I  Phase II effort will be a new generation of robust photocathodes capable of yielding intense, highly polarized electron beams for use in advanced electron colliders.  We have previously achieved &amp; gt; 85% polarization using a strained superlattice formed from alternating layers of GaAs and GaAsP approximately ten monolayers thick. For this program we will apply a novel strain- compensated superlattice concept utilizing antimony-, arsenic-, and phosphorus-based material which should overcome material limitations of the GaAs/GaAsP alloys. In the Phase I we designed and fabricated an Sb- and P-based strain-compensated superlattice structure grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The Phase I program optimized the growth conditions to achieve the desired alloy composition and interface quality.  Photocathode structures were grown and characterized.  Novel  Sb-based  SL  photocathodes  studied  in  Phase  I  will  be  further  optimized  by  investigating parameters that can affect the polarization and quantum efficiency of these photocathodes for high current electron guns. Further improvement on QE The performance of the optimized cathodes will be evaluated in realistic gun environment by Jefferson Lab.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  A successful project will produce a highly efficient polarized electron source for use in experimental research at DoE Jefferson Lab, SLAC, and other electron collider facilities.  These devices have applications in other areas which include magnetic imaging research, surface analysis, Quantum computing and cryptography.",

        "abstract": "The effectiveness of synchrotron radiation science is being hindered by the limited availability of advanced detectors.  This is due to the limited deployment of existing detectors as well as limited development effort to provide new advanced capabilities. As synchrotron radiation experiments become more sophisticated, advanced detectors will be necessary to leverage the capabilities of the beamlines and enable discovery. A novel microstrip detector prototyped by a national laboratory has proven to be highly effective at acquiring data with the count rates, energy resolution and spatial resolution needed for complex x-ray studies. The fast position-sensitive strip-array detector enables real-time, microsecond timescale study of phase transformations and reactions as a function of temperature, chemical gradients, and pressure. In these applications the intensity can vary over several orders of magnitude over a very small angular range and detectors capable of accurately measuring these large variations are critical. The overall objective of this SBIR program is to leverage the DOEs investment in detector technology that far too often lies locked up in laboratories. The proposed effort will complete the technology transfer of a laboratory-conceived microstrip detector thus making it readily available to a broad community of researchers worldwide. Phase I addressed several impediments to the widespread deployment of the detector and demonstrated the feasibility of a design that increases its utility and reduces cost of ownership. The Phase I conceptual design became the roadmap for transitioning the initial laboratory-built prototype into a robust and reliable commercial instrument. Phase II accomplished the research and engineering needed to produce an advanced engineering prototype of that conceptual design.  In addition, the prototype contained several advanced features that improve performance and ease integration. Phase IIB is designed to complete the transition and position the technology for immediate commercial deployment.  Further advancements will be made in terms of manufacturability, component-level qualification, system testing, and a more universally compatible software interface. Two pre-production prototypes will be constructed and made available to participating scientists for evaluation in target market applications.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The commercial deployment of the of this detector will enable researchers to advance discovery by providing an instrument that significantly speeds up the data gathering process as compared to present techniques. By acquiring data simultaneously at many points, the quality and quantity of data will be improved 100-fold from the current state of the art. These detectors will benefit a wide range of applications ranging from structure-based drug design to environmental remediation of contamination sites to new discoveries in nanoscale material science.",

        "abstract": "Plasma sheaths near metallic and dielectric surfaces in the presence of oscillating electric fields impart physics effects of critical significance for fusion experiments and industrial plasma processing applications.  In magnetic fusion research, thin sheaths form near radiofrequency (RF) antenna structures and induce ion sputtering from antenna surfaces; the sputtered ions contaminate and cool the core plasma and reduce fusion power output. Industrial processes for semiconductor manufacturing (etching, thin-film deposition, etc.) require precise knowledge and control of the plasma steady-state in order to ensure proper fabrication, but these equilibrium parameters are sensitive to sheath parameters which vary on much shorter timescales. To enable the numerical optimization of fusion reactor antennas and plasma processing reactors, development of rapid, accurate simulation methods which model sheath effects on larger spatial and slower temporal scales are needed. Sub-grid models to mimic the faster timescales and smaller length scales of the sheath physics at plasma-wall interfaces are developed and verified. These models are incorporated into the VSim commercial software package. Capacitive lumped-circuit element sub grid sheath models were generalized for plasma in contact with dielectric walls, and the model was successfully benchmarked in first-principles particle-in- cell simulations. Test particle behavior was augmented to account for the sheath voltage increment when passing through a sheath, and accurate surface deposition fields were added for charge and energy. New test particle features from the Phase I will be deployed to provide accurate electron and ion energy distributions and sputtering/impurity-production predictions for industrial and fusion plasma applications.  Plasma chemistry tools and self-consistent steady-state initializations will be added. The sheath sub grid model will be augmented to include improvements to the DC-rectified potential, magnetic field effects, and effects arising from multispecies plasmas. Fusion antennas and industrial processing reactor operations will be modeled.   Commercial Applications and OtherBenefits: The proposed VSim development enables its use as a design tool for plasma-etch-based semiconductor manufacturing equipment, filling a need in the industrial plasma processing community for computational kinetic and fluid models which make effective use of parallel computing clusters. Industrial plasma processing customers can use the software to more rapidly design and optimize equipment to carry out increasingly complex manufacturing processes. Additionally, by studying the optimization of RF antennas in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) device, we will be able to improve the efficiency, and perhaps even enable the success, of a $10B fusion experiment.",

        "abstract": "Robust H  ion sources are a key component for the Spallation Neutron Source at ORNL. Antennas used to produce H   ions often fail when plasma heats the protective insulating coating on the antennas, exposing the bare metal and causing structural failure. Reducing antenna failures, which are expensive and reduce the operating capability of the source, is the top priority of the SNS H   Source Program at ORNL. Our numerical modeling of the plasma interaction with insulating surfaces in the H   source will provide an optimization of antenna design that will reduce antenna failure for the SNS. We propose to use the high-performance computing software package USim to perform innovative simulations of plasma interactions with rf antennas in ion sources such as the one in use at SNS. We plan to develop specialized software modules that will allow researchers to easily model rf ion sources and other ion sources and take advantage of high-performance computing to optimize plasma device designs. In Phase I we determined that our fluids models will be able to simulate plasma-induced damage to the SNS H   ion source antenna. We also demonstrated the ability to integrate spectral analysis and optimization techniques into our software technology in order to improve simulation capabilities. Successful completion of the Phase I tasks shows that our Phase II workplan is feasible and has a high probability of success. In Phase II we will provide complete simulation capability of the SNS H   ion source plasma and antenna damage using different fluid-based models. We will integrate spectral analysis into our simulation code in order to simulate possible precursors to antenna coating melting. Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, modularized software specific to modeling ion sources.

        "abstract": "We are developing a subsurface monitoring technique for providing spatially resolved profiles of soil moisture in the vadose zone that can be easily deployed using either cone penetration testing (CPT) technology, conventional drilling, or in some applications, direct burial. The technology has application to a wide variety of earth and environmental science and infrastructure monitoring challenges. The ability to field an in situ monitoring device that can spatially resolve soil moisture (as well as water table elevation) in profile will substantially assist with understanding specific sites, as well as help improve the state-of-the-art in model development, verification, and long-term monitoring that are crucial to effective remediation and understanding coupled biological, geochemical, and physical (hydrologic) processes in the unsaturated zone.  Our technical approach extends the state of the art in time domain reflectometry (TDR) for soil moisture determination to enable quantitative and robust decision support at vadose zone environmental management sites. The sensor we will develop combines advances in the processing of TDR data with innovations in the physical sensing apparatus. These advancements enable high temporal (and thus spatial) resolution of reflectance continuously along the inside surface of a borehole using a flexible parallel waveguide that is permanently emplaced against the geologic formation. The spatially resolved reflectance is directly related to impedance changes along the waveguide that are dominated by electrical permittivity contrast due to variations in soil moisture. PRISMS will thus be able to monitor soil moisture in profile (as well as water table elevation) with high spatial and temporal resolution, to enable substantial improvements in the state-of-the-art of model development, verification, and long-term monitoring crucial to effective site management and remediation. In contrast, most existing commercial TDR-based moisture sensors perform a bulk characterization of the soil volume surrounding a short, un-insulated waveguide, and therefore cannot resolve spatial variability in the soil condition. Phase I included laboratory to research performance of the method in a range of soil types and at varying pore water salinities, and also researched and identified commercial manufacturing techniques to produce waveguides of the physical characteristics required to maximize precision, accuracy, durability, and achievable length of continuous measurement profile. Phase I will also assessed issues of deployability and produced prototype PRISMS that were emplaced at a DOE IFRC site, where time series data were acquired from PRISMS. The goals of Phase II are to continue to increase the technical effectiveness of PRISMS and to advance its readiness for commercial production. Specific tasks include: improving sensitivity and noise immunity through waveguide design optimization; refining and extending multi-reflection deconvolution and other algorithms to improve response to steep moisture gradients; addressing complications due to elevated pore water ionic strength; determining requirements for integration into third party electronic reflectometry equipment; and perfecting various methods of emplacing long vertical PRISMS waveguides in situ. Field demonstrations are also included in the proposed work.",

The focus of this SBIR Phase II project is to demonstrate the success achieved by TreadStone in Phase I by demonstrating the technology in test apparatus supported by US automobile companies, meeting the revised technical and performance requirements. TreadStone will also optimize the processing techniques thereby demonstrating that its technology advancements can meet the low cost targets. The feasibility of the technology has been demonstrated in the Phase I project.  Ex-situ corrosion test data indicates that stainless steel plates with novel TreadStones nano-structured corrosion resistant and electrical conductive coating can meet the revised technical and performance targets.   The in-situ long term durability was also demonstrated in a single cell performance test. This project goes beyond TreadStones current low cost metal plate technology that uses a very small amount of gold for PEMFC transportation applications.  It will develop a gold-free metal plate coating technology meeting the revised industry requirements including: i. gold free coating; ii. lower electrical contact resistance ( &amp; lt; 5 m.cm), and iii. roll to roll coating on stainless steel foil strips, before stamping. TreadStone plans to optimize the composition of the coating materials, develop the larger scale fabrication technology and demonstrate the technology in full size, automotive short stack with our team partner Hawaii Natural Energy Institute, University of Hawaii.  Industry support will be provided by Ford Motor Company, General Motors and Impreglon, Inc.

Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The implementation of this project will reduce the fuel cell stack metal bipolar separator plate cost which accounts 15-21% of the overall stack cost. The proposed technology will reduce the cost risk associated with the fluctuating gold price of current metal plate technologies.

        "abstract": "Designs for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) employ several plasma-facing materials selected for their suitability to regions of the vessel with different power and flux characteristics. Tungsten is one of the most important candidates for diverter component materials, given its low erosion and good mechanical properties at high temperature. However, high-toughness tungsten alloys that are suitable for fusion plasma environments still must be developed to overcome the inherently brittle nature of tungsten. Solid solution alloys of tungsten-iron with relatively high toughness and ductility, produced using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processing, are being d eveloped. The process allows the direct deposition of solid solution alloys to produce complex net-shaped plasma-facing com ponents of the desired tungsten alloys, without the high impurity levels, porosity, complexity, and cost associated with alternative processing such as melting, sintering of powders, or homogenization heat treatments. CVD  processing  was  successfully developed  for  a  fully  dense,  uniform  tungsten-iron  (W -Fe)  alloy  that demonstrated increased ductility compared with pure tungsten. Alloys containing 2.5, 3.5, and 4.1 at% iron were produced. Nanoindentation testing showed the Young &amp; apos;s modulus and hardness of the CVD W -Fe alloys were less than those values for CVD tungsten, and the W -Fe alloys survived multiple heating cycles to 1200C at a heating rate of 20C/sec. Dislocation motion in tungsten and W -Fe alloys was modeled u sing three complementary approaches: molecular dynamics, quantum m echanics, and kink pair nucleation and motion coupled with the phonon drag kinetic theory of gases. The CVD tungsten-iron solid solution alloys will be optimized, and detailed modeling and material characterization will be p erform ed. Specimens will be exposed to simulated plasma transients to characterize performance. High temperature thermomechanical properties (tensile and compressive strength vs. strain between ambient and 1200C) will be measured. Thermomechanical damage will be modeled using thermo-elasto- plasticity finite element modeling. Dislocation dynamics modeling of the plastic deformation of W -Fe alloys, and modeling of dislocation nucleation, emission, and motion from crack tips in tungsten and W -Fe alloys, will be performed to determine the influence of iron on the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature.  Commercial applications and other benefits: Nuclear fusion is an ideal alternative to increasingly scarce and expensive fossil fuels and can provide a much greater quantity of environmentally sound energy than wind, solar, and geothermal sources. Practical application of fusion for efficient electricity generation requires the development of materials and structures that can withstand the demanding reactor environment. The proposed tungsten alloys are key materials for reactors that will ultimately be scaled up for commercial use.",

The ability to detect the spatial location and time of arrival of single photons with increased accuracy represents the ultimate goal in optical detection for many of these applications. Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), developed to meet these needs, are mostly made using processes and materials not compatible with contemporary CMOS. Moreover, the mask sets required to fabricate deepsubmicron CMOS circuits cost over a million dollars, require million dollar design tools, and require years long development by skilled design teams. Digital silicon photomultiplier (DSiPM) detector array and readout design cores are being developed and made available to fabricate high performance detector arrays for planned and future DOE science missions. The IP cores include in each unit cell: enable/disable logic, active quenching circuits (AQCs), thresholded counting circuits, time stamping circuits, sparse readout logic, Geiger mode (Gm) avalanche photodiode, and 12bit ADCS. To reduce the data bandwidth and reduce power, readout of pixel information is performed using a sparse readout technique, with onchip 14bit digitization. Digital information is readout using LVDS signals. The mask design is being developed to permit designers to quickly and efficiently fabricate new detector arrays, of various size and aspect ratio, without having to undertake the expense and risk of custom detector design.

As such, observations of ice extent and thickness, including temporal growth and melt cycles, improves our understanding of the ongoing global climate changes, and enhances our ability to predict future changes. Despite continual improvements in global climate models, there is still greater difficulty in reproducing the current climate in the Arctic than elsewhere in the world. LIDAR measurements of mixed type and water surface elevation or profiling have not yet been successful from space, and they do not characterize the surface, with sufficient detail and timeliness for albedo to be estimated, so that the local mass balance of the various Arctic sea ice types, including snow cover and open water, cannot be correlated with heat balance estimates. Proposed is a small size, weight, and power (SWAP) dualmode twocolor laser altimeter boresighted with a radiometrically\ncalibrated CMOS imager. The small unmanned aerial system (SUAS) optimized instrument, operates seamlessly over ice, water, snow, ground, and vegetation.  Real time fullwaveform processing of 532nm and 1064 nm laser returns, allows surface classification, and, combined with the radiometricallycalibrated multicolor [red, green, blue, and nearinfrared (R,G,B,NIR)] CMOS imager, allows normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to be calculated for each pixel. Optimized for the harsh Arctic conditions, the low SWAP dualmode altimeter is implemented with a offaxis, afocal optics, a miniature dualband high rate pulsed laser, and highgain, lownoise segmented avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays. A fixed holographic element scanner achieved efficient ground coverage, and the data is digitized, georeferenced and processed, in real time, using a FPGA processor before being stored in 1 TB of solid state memory. In Phase I, the SUASoptimized dualmode altimeter was developed, and the optics, scanner, laser, receiver, and GPS/IMU components were specified. Design trades were then conducted to achieve the performance goals within the SUAS rigorous SWAP constraints. The laser and avalanche photodiode (APD) receivers were fabricated and tested, and an endtoend performance simulation was performed, verifying performance. In Phase II, the dualmode altimeter will be fabricated and characterized. Real time processing and calibration firmware will be developed, and the system will be demonstrated in field tests.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Currently, the top three global uses of LIDAR mapping data are: 1) topographic mapping; 2) flood risk assessments; and 3) watershed analysis. Natural resource applications in geology, water, and forestry, Hydrology / flood applications, and power utility applications are expected to grow, as a result of the innovations flexible deployment and lower cost.

Transimpedance amplifiers (TIA) are widely utilized in experimental and commercial applications for this task. Numerous detection systems require wide bandwidth, ultra-low noise, high gain, and linear amplification. Commercial TIAs having this combination of features are surprisingly not readily available and many consumers resort to costly and time consuming in-house development.  We propose to develop ultra-low noise, wide bandwidth, high gain, transimpedance amplifiers (TIA). This will be achieved via the development of an Advanced-TIA Platform - a circuit designed (using surface mount technology) to achieve linear amplification of current 1 nA, signal bandwidth  5 MHz (-3dB), equivalent input-noise ~ 1.5 nA (rms), and transimpedance (gain)  107 V/A. This exacting set of specifications is not readily available in commercial products. It will, furthermore, have the capacity to be adapted to a range of specifications, enabling custom performance metrics to be fulfilled. This platform will be developed into a Plug-and-Play device that is compact and vacuum-grade; attributes that are beneficial to scientific R &amp; amp;D applications.  During the Phase-I period we developed a circuit that established the feasibility of our Advanced-TIA concept; we accomplished this by computer modeling the circuit, evaluating its performance, prototyping the device and demonstrating its performance. During Phase-II we will mature the Advanced-TIA circuit into a Platform and construct the Plug-and-Play device.  This significance of this effort is captured in the following: 1) It will result in novel TIA products suitable for communication, science, and service industries within government and private sector markets; 2) It has broad inherent value within the scientific R &amp; amp;D sector and is likely to attract future development funding; 3) Other benefits to the federal and private scientific R &amp; amp;D programs include less time spend on in-house development, cost savings, and greater programmatic productivity.",

This requires complex detector fabrication and signal readout processes and is often associated with high cost, low yield, and high power requirements. There clearly is a need for a detector technology that can achieve fine position resolution while maintaining the excellent energy resolution intrinsic to semiconductor detectors, can be fabricated through simple processes, does not require complex electrical interconnections to the detector, and can reduce the number of required channels of readout electronics. Proximity electrode signal readout, in which the electrodes are not in physical contact with the detector surface, satisfies these needs. On equal footing is the need to develop low cost, high density readout electronics adapted to the unique demands required in a proximity electrode readout detector. Our overall project vision is to demonstrate the viability of a large HPGe strip detector using novel proximity sensing electrodes paired with a low cost, high density spectrometer capable of real time signal processing. Phase I allowed us to successfully refine the concept of the proximity sensing in HPGe detectors by employing a large area detector prototype in single sided strip configuration and reconstructing sub-strip pitch position resolution.  In Phase II we will further develop and optimize this promising new technology resulting in a fully operational, multi-dimensional position sensitive HPGe detector with real-time processing and display of energies and positions. We will achieve this goal through detailed characterization and modeling of the detectors, which will guide the optimization of the fabrication processes and implementation of proximity sensing HPGe detectors. In parallel we will refine and optimize signal processing schemes that enable the determination of energies and positions of the gamma-ray interactions in real time.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:   If this concept can be successfully demonstrated for imaging as well as particle tracking applications, XIA and our commercialization partner ORTEC will develop benchtop and portable products intended for medical and mining industries, basic and applied research in within DOE and DHS offices.",

        "abstract": "With solar power being seen as of national strategic importance, the U.S. DOE established the\nSunShot Initiative which is driving an aggressive goal of $1/Wp installed price from the current cost of $2.34/Wp for large (utility) scale PV installations.  As PV module prices have dropped precipitously due to global oversupply, Balance of System (BOS) or non-module costs such as installation labor, structural materials, and site preparation have come down much slower to the point that they now make up a majority of the overall installation expense. A typical 10 MW-DC plant will require 30,000 \u2013 40,000 modules on 12.5 - 17.0 km of racking, currently each step of the installation process is carried out by hand, being both time consuming and labor intensive. To specifically address this problem, Brittmore Group seeks to dramatically reduce BOS costs through the introduction of automation and robotics into the repetitive steps of the large scale PV installation process.  Brittmore\u2019s System consists of three components: the Panel Assembly Cell (PAC), a mobile factory where individual modules are preassembled and wired into larger panels, the WaveRack ground mount, a simplified fixed tilt ground mount support system that doubles as an above ground transport track for panel installation, and the PV Autoloader/Shuttle, an automated system that takes preassembled panels from a centralized logistics area and installs them at megawatts per day rates. The Brittmore System can dramatically reduce labor, heavy equipment, and overhead costs as well as dramatically reduce construction times. Under SBIR Phase I, Brittmore Group developed the PV Autoloader to supplement the prototype\nPAC, WaveRack and PV Shuttle sub-systems. Under SBIR Phase II, The Company seeks to fully productize the Brittmore System by taking all three components from Alpha to full production.  \n",

SKINfrared LLC (SKI), a spin-off from the Krishna Infrared Detector (KIND) Nanostructures laboratory at the University of New Mexico (www.chtm.unm.edu/kind) will team up with Raytheon Vision Systems (RVS) to deliver a MWIR FPA to Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) for the evaluation at the end of the two year project.  BENEFIT:  InAs/GaSb SLS have emerged as a disruptive technology in the past five years. Broadband higher operating temperature detectors provide additional functionality for surveillance, space situational awareness and reconnaissance missions. The partner on this proposal, RVS has significant experience in technology development for next generation of large format infrared focal plane arrays (IRFPA) to develop the best solution for ballistic missile intercept systems such as SM-3 (IIA and future upgrades). These new IRFPAs are designed to provide improved system capabilities such as enhanced imaging for target discrimination, signature recognition, countermeasure, and clutter rejection. This effort can therefore provide risk reduction to current HgCdTe FPA approaches and be seamlessly inserted into future RVS IR&D demonstration activities. Most importantly, the results of this work can be directly communicated to AFRL customers to facilitate technology insertion possibilities. During the proposed Phase II effort RVS is therefore in a position to accurately assess and quantify the performance of the SKI MWIR 512x512 pBiBn FPAs against the benchmark of existing SM-3 performance requirements and incumbent HgCdTe large-format MWIR FPA technology that is currently being developed at RVS.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Military and industrial personnel are often exposed to RF electromagnetic energy which can cause thermal and electrokinetic biological effects. To understand these effects, AFRL is using computational electromagnetic tools to predict RF energy deposition and thermal effects in humans. Unfortunately, high resolution thermal simulations are computationally very expensive. The goal of this project is to develop fast anatomy- and physiology-based computational tools for predicting whole-body and localized thermal response of tissue to RF exposure. In phase I we have developed novel adaptive Octree mesh model of a human body and a 3D high accuracy thermal solver coupled to multicompartmental model of cardiovascular blood flow, tissue perfusion and heat transport. The model was used to demonstrate fast, whole body thermal simulations for two EM SAR exposures. In phase II we will develop additional anatomical human body models, improve computational speed on parallel CPU and GPU computers and improve the accuracy and robustness of the model. The model of human cardiovascular physiology will include central and peripheral thermo-autoregulation of vascular, cardiac, respiratory responses, skin cooling as well as fatigue effects and potential impact on human performance. A professional software framework will be established with GUI for model setup, visualization and data analysis. The software will be demonstrated on fast modeling of human body thermal and physiological responses to various RF exposures encountered in military and civilian environments.  BENEFIT:  The integrated CEM-Thermal-Physiology modeling tools will be used by engineers and health physicists to study risks of accidental and job duty RF exposure, to design active denial systems, non lethal weapons and novel directed energy systems. The same tools will have immense civilian applications such as more powerful medical imaging and diagnostics, better hyperthermia cancer treatment, laser and cryosurgery, therapeutic hypothermia in cardiac and stroke conditions, thermal comfort analysis, transcranial EM stimulation, and others.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further demonstrate the potential of LignoLink&#039;s technology for improving cellulosic biomass crops as feedstocks for the bioenergy and animal feed industries. Lignocellulosic biomass is a major renewable feedstock. A critical step in the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to energy is enzymatic digestion of the biomass to sugars. Lignin provides plant strength and is the primary and most challenging barrier to accessing and extracting cellulose for conversion to sugars. The novel Lignolink approach helps overcome this significant challenge by inserting proteins into the lignin structure of biomass to greatly enhance the digestibility of lignocellulose. The Lignolink modification of the lignin structure provides the desired benefits without hurting the strength or the health of the plant during normal growth. This is a key breakthrough. Small scale trials in the NSF Phase I SBIR resulted in increases of over 50% in yields of fermentable sugars from poplar wood and corn-stover biomass, without affecting plant fitness. In Phase II research the scope of the trials will be expanded in maize and poplar, both in the number and type of cell wall proteins being tested and in the scale of the trials with the best performing lines. This will demonstrate the general applicability of the technology in both annual cereal crops and in perennial woody biomass sources, which represent the full spectrum of cellulosic biomass feedstocks. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project extends from bioenergy to agriculture and biomaterials industries. Biobased products are an attractive green and sustainable long-term alternative to petroleum based products. Lignolink&#039;s technology, has the potential to make cellulosic biofuels more commercially viable and more environmentally friendly by permitting the use of milder pretreatment conditions leading to greater product yields and efficiency. Pretreatment is the largest single cost in biofuels production, and can be a significant limiting factor in economic viability. Increases in yields of sugar from biomass of 50% or more through facilitating biomass treatability itself holds great potential to improve commercial viability of the use of cellulosic biomass for energy, specialty chemicals and biomaterials and thus should facilitate development of economically viable commercial production technology. Lignolink&#039;s technology could similarly improve biomass for use as feed for livestock, by improving breakdown during digestion in animals. This could increase efficiency of nutrient extraction, thereby reducing the necessary land base and environmental impact of animal agriculture.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks the further development of metal-free enzymatic fuel cells (EFCs) that can completely oxidize sugar (maltodextrin) to yield electricity. Sugar-powered EFCs have received increasing interest as next-generation, environmentally friendly bio-batteries. These bio-batteries, which will be fully biodegradable, non toxic, and easily refillable, are envisioned as next-generation green power sources, particularly for portable electronic devices (e.g., smartphones, portable computers, tablets, and GPS systems to name a few). These Sugar-powered EFCs with a feed of 20% maltodextrin utilizing a proprietary synthetic cocktail of enzyme catalysts for sugar oxidation, have an energy storage density of approximately 800 Ah/kg, nearly 20-times that of lithium batteries. The technical objectives of this project are the following: (i) to further increase their power density to 10 mW/cm2, (ii) to prolong their lifetimes to months, and (iii) to develop a commercial cost competitive product. The use of a low-cost chemical ingredient along with the use of engineered redox enzymes in sugar biobatteries, could increase their power output, prolong their lifetime, and decrease their production cost. In this SBIR II project, Cell Free Bioinnovations Inc. will make prototype high energy density power banks that could charge smartphones directly by integrating synthetic biology, protein engineering, nanobiotechnology, and electrochemistry. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the demonstration of the prototype bio-inspired sugar-powered biobatteries featuring high-energy storage density (e.g., 800 Ah electricity/kg of 20% sugar solution, nearly twenty times that of lithium ion batteries), fast refilling by the addition of a sugar solution, non toxic and safe to handle and use. Because sugar-powered EFCs are based on low-cost biocatalysts and do not require costly or rare metals, they are disposable and biodegradable devices. High-energy storage density EFCs would have broad potential applications as rechargeable battery chargers (e.g., cellular phone chargers for outdoor use or for portable military devices), educational toy kits, and disposable (primary) batteries. In the future, sugar-powered EFCs could potentially replace some secondary (rechargeable) batteries and primary batteries. In addition, the innovation of EFCs equipped with this cell-free synthetic pathway would greatly promote the concept of cell-free biomanufacturing composed of synthetic enzymatic pathways.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project will develop software and a system that enables nearly automatic generation and maintenance of a global database of indoor maps through crowdsourcing and data fusion. The current state of the art in indoor mapping relies on a manual labor-intensive process to create and maintain maps as they change over time, which is difficult to scale. A dynamic map-building system will address the challenge of generating and updating key indoor map navigation data. The developed mapping software will use existing embedded Smartphone sensors to discover building features (such as hallways, elevators, exits, and stairwells) and their connectivity as a user walks through a building while carrying a Smartphone running the mapping application. Additional building signature information is collected as part of the map. The user&#039;s location, which is simultaneously being tracked using the same sensors, is used to identify the location of the discovered building features. The map accuracy and completeness will increase as the number of users increase. This indoor map database will be used for improved indoor location and routing. The broader/commercial impact of the mapping software is that it will enable map coverage to increase beyond high use environments such as malls, airports, and museums. The dynamic map-building system enables maps to be easily extended to include all commercial buildings and to help address the challenge of maintaining and updating indoor map navigation data as they change over time. The data produced by the system will complement and integrate with indoor map data being made available by leading indoor map suppliers. Indoor maps can be used to power a wide array of applications, and they are clearly essential for making location-based applications work. These applications include consumer applications as well as critical safety applications. Locating people (including children) in emergency situations becomes possible if the software can both calculate their location and show it on a clear map that includes essential floor plan data that makes it easy to reach them. Navigating out of a building in an emergency is possible if the open pathways, stairwells, entrances, and exits are clearly marked on a map.",

Prototype LED arrays and transistor devices have been fabricated, and the next step to realize this platform is the development of advanced silicon circuitry to directly control the LED arrays and color generation methods to achieve full-color displays. The anticipated results of this project are on-chip driving circuits and development of color generation methods which will be integrated with arrays of LEDs to form a commercially-ready prototype. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a light engine with a power efficiency, brightness, cost, and form factor unavailable in incumbent systems. In particular, three markets are identified where this technology significant advantages over current technologies. These include the microdisplay market, the pico projector market, and the projector market. This light engine platform offers a small form factor, long lifetime, environmental robustness, high energy efficiency, and the high brightness required for sunlight readability. These features are necessary to create truly ubiquitous display devices and enable new see-through augmented reality experiences or smaller, more integrated portable projectors, not possible with current technologies. Commercialization of this device will impact all of these areas and also enable a range of new downstream applications including other non-display industries, such as, 3D scanning and novel user interfaces.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop robust and effective imaging techniques for assessment of atherosclerotic disease severity for prognostic and longitudinal use. In the United States alone, approximately 5 million patients suffer pre-stroke symptoms of which 795,000 go on to a stroke annually. About 610,000 of these are first or new strokes, while the remainder are recurrent strokes. Despite these statistics, there is no effective test to tell who will or will not suffer acute events or to measure whether medical therapies are effective at reducing the risk. In this project, multivariate quantitative descriptors are developed using data from controlled outcome studies on a specialized model to discover and validate prognostic signatures that, in composite, perform well in both cross-sectional prognostic and longitudinal applications with high predictive value. Phase I results are extended to support histologically verifiable tissue types, expanding the functional and performance attributes of the product with a tie to localized ground truth maps made possible with co-registration of histology with MRI. The plan is to iteratively validate the developed capability under commercially accepted design controls. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the development of effective means for computer-aided prognostics using quantitative imaging phenotypes. Physicians face a complex and heterogeneous series of clinical manifestations of disease. Because disease arises through a complex interaction of multiple molecular signals and pathways often confounding the eventual effect, tools and approaches are needed to identify key pathways that reflect the underlying pathological processes. Functional imaging modalities have recently emerged for characterization of these disease processes and to obtain a better mechanistic understanding of the underlying biologic processes to distinguish more aggressive from less aggressive disease phenotypes. Computer-aided prognosis (CAP) of disease is a new and exciting complement to the field of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Since CAP approaches distinguish between different subtypes of a particular disease (as opposed to CAD schemes trying to distinguish diseased from benign processes), there is a need for more sophisticated image analysis, computer vision, and machine learning methods to identify subtle disease signatures that can separate unstable from stable disease. The chosen application in this project is a use case that has the potential to radically increase the power of applications to support clinicians in pursuit of personalized medicine.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to use an innovative approach to metabolically engineer algae that will enable low-cost, carbon-free hydrogen production at medium to large scale. The metabolic pathway for hydrogen production in microalgae is tightly regulated. Process models for hydrogen production are based on anaerobic sulfur-deprivation preventing generation of oxygen, which inactivates hydrogenases. However, hydrogen yields are too low for an economical commercial process. Hydrogen production rates are difficult to improve due to complicated metabolic pathways guarding hydrogen production. Novel proprietary Chlamydomonas strains with synthetic genes for hydrogenase and maturation proteins were created and proven in Phase I. This project will continue the metabolic engineering to increase electron availability for hydrogenase and develop stable strains for scalable and commercially viable production of hydrogen. The proposed research will expand fundamental understanding of: 1) electron flow toward algal hydrogenases under sulfur-rich conditions and sulfur-deprivation, 2) requirements for maturation of hydrogenases, and 3) requirements to protect hydrogenases from oxygen. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be the commercial generation of cost-effective, renewable, and environmentally clean hydrogen that could greatly impact the nation&#039;s ability to reduce its use of foreign oil and create many new jobs. The commercial hydrogen production currently is burdened by major dependence on electricity and carbon dioxide emission. The proposed approach provides a commercial process for hydrogen production that will generate electricity and sequester carbon dioxide. The abundance of low-cost, renewable hydrogen should expand hydrogen markets to generate electricity and fuel vehicles. Just 200,000 ha of algal ponds using improved strains could displace 20% of imported crude oil. Thus, the project will have great commercial impact by enhancing national energy security. Moreover, this technology will promote diversification and sustainability of agricultural production in the U.S. through development of algae farming, which will not require arable land. Potentially, this technology will produce the most ecologically clean biofuel theoretically available, and could have great social impact by decreasing the carbon footprint and promoting economic diversification in rural areas.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop novel &quot;caged&quot; macrocyclic chelating groups that display faster and more stable binding as compared to acyclic and mono-macrocyclic chelators currently used. Metallic radioisotopes offer versatile imaging and therapeutic properties, but loss of metallic radioisotopes from their site-directing molecules can lead to deleterious side-effects or reduced contrast and efficacy. There is a recognized, compelling need for improved chelating groups for use in radiopharmaceuticals. Such chelating groups must rapidly bind radioisotopes, so that they are compatible with the practicalities of clinical laboratory preparation. They must also stably bind the cation so that none is released in vivo, at least prior to its decay. The optimized chelating groups to be developed under this project will stably coordinate metal cations currently used for radioisotope-based diagnosis and therapy, display facile complexation kinetics, and provide a convenient synthetic handle for attachment to targeting moieties. By means of this approach, the novel chelators will both improve the utility of existing radiopharmaceuticals and permit the use of radionuclides that are at present underdeveloped in the clinic. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be that aromatic macrocyclic bifunctional chelators (AMBFCs) will be developed that will potentially change the landscape in the way cancer is detected and treated. Because the AMBFCs can be used in cancer imaging, the physician benefits from an effective feedback loop on therapeutic progress, remission, and prognosis that could further shorten the time of treatment. AMBFCs in companion radiodiagnostics also could reduce the cost of ineffectual medication, which is a strategic goal of the FDA. Plus, by employing novel radionuclides in the AMBFCs to kill tumors and their metastases, the benefit could materially cut down the time and cost of therapy. All of these features could promote better clinical outcomes and reduce the overall cost of healthcare by saving lives with earlier intervention. Through improved clinical outcomes from this unique science, AMBFCs will advance the national health, prosperity and welfare of others.",

Vestibular patients experience imbalance due to loss of vestibular feedback, which may result in an increased risk of falling, reduced activity levels, and in some cases, a significantly impaired life. Phase I of the project has successfully demonstrated a first-generation device that can be worn entirely inside the oral cavity and provide in-situ sensory feedback of head movement to patients. The prototypes to be developed in Phase II will be market-oriented, user friendly, and robust for extended use in mobile environments. Research in Phase II will include 1) implementation of a wirelessly controlled intra-oral device; 2) exploration of designs that provide more sensitive perception of the feedback, reliable contact at the palatal interface, and a robust user experience for long-term use; and 3) evaluation of the device performance on human subjects through collaboration with health professionals on vestibular assessment and rehabilitation. Market-oriented prototypes will be developed by the end of Phase II, tested by vestibular patients, and supported by medical professionals from an expanded list of balance centers/clinics. The broader impact/commercial potential of this proposed project, if successful, will be a hidden and noninvasive assistive device to treat vestibular imbalance. Currently, there is no practical device currently available to provide in-situ sensory feedback of head movement for patients with vestibular loss. The product from the proposed Phase II research will capture this great market opportunity with its unique features while assisting vestibular patients in balance control wherever they go. The benefits to people with vestibular disorders are enormous as the device has the potential to help them to gain confidence in social settings, mitigate secondary problems associated with vestibular loss, and enable them to live a healthier and more enjoyable life. In addition, the device offers new opportunities for health professionals in the field of vestibular rehabilitation to conduct research on motion, imbalance, and treatment. Also, it provides a new tool for neuroscience researchers to study the role of multisensory integration on balance and perceptual learning involving use of alternative sensory feedback. The palatal stimulation technology may have potential in other applications where hidden, noninvasive, and hands-free sensory feedback is desirable.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project uses enhanced MIMO (multiple-input, multiple-output) technology to boost capacity, coverage, and enhance link robustness in wireless communications without using additional spectrum. This is accomplished by transmitting independent data streams all at the same frequency but on different antennas. MIMO technologies have been widely adopted and have been incorporated into the 802.11n and 802.11ac WiFi, WiMax, and the LTE-A cellular standards. However, for MIMO systems, the computational complexity required to detect data symbols increases dramatically as the system size (number of antennas) and data constellation size increases. Thus, MIMO symbol detection has become a critical step for wireless communication systems. Lattice-reduction (LR)-aided MIMO equalization has shown great potential to reduce complexity and improve the performance. This research develops and transitions advanced LR-aided equalization technology to real-time, hardware implementations that meet the stringent requirements of next generation wireless communication systems. These advanced LR-aided equalization techniques can reach near-optimal performance (an additional 5-20 dB of signal-to-noise-ratio gain relative to common equalizers currently used in industry). This project will result in the creation of a commercial-grade hardware implementation capable of realizing these gains in existing systems at only a slight increase in cost. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project extends to nearly all high-speed wireless data communications including WiFi, cellular, and backhaul/infrastructure. The advanced LR technology can be implemented in MIMO receivers to improve range, power, and spectral efficiency without requiring changes to existing standards or infrastructure. Furthermore, the advanced LR technology also enables the development of future systems with higher-order MIMO for higher data rates and better reliability. This project will develop and commercialize integrated circuit designs that directly address the problem of spectrum crunch being experienced by wireless network providers seeking to supply ever increasing data rates to meet customers? demands. This project will also establish a conduit for commercialization of further advances in communications and enhance the research partnership between the investigators and the researchers in the wireless communication industry facilitating application of scientific discoveries to the application domains.",

Under NSF Phase I SBIR funding of this project, Vaporsens, Inc. successfully developed new organic nanofiber sensory materials required to achieve these goals. In Phase II, the company will design and optimize the sensor systems, electronic hardware, firmware and algorithm software required to build a handheld detector. The novel nanofiber sensory materials developed by Vaporsens will enable the proposed detector to simultaneously detect all three important categories of explosives with greater sensitivity, due to detection limits in the parts per trillion range. Prototypes will be subjected to third party testing to validate the rapid, sensitive, and selective detection of common explosives. The Phase II project will also permit the design and fabrication of new sensor materials, with the aim of further improving the sensing sensitivity and selectivity of subsequent devices through interface chemistry optimization. The broader impact/commercial potential of the project will reduce the impact of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) which are a leading cause of casualties in contemporary warfare. IED use outside of warfare is growing, with over 170 incidents reported in the US alone during the first six months of 2013. As a result, the worldwide annual sales for trace explosives detection equipment has grown to approximately $400 million. However, these technologies are limited in their effectiveness. Swabbing machines require contact; bomb-sniffing dogs are expensive, need to work with the same handler, and have limited endurance; and imaging technologies are only practical in checkpoint settings due to size and expense. In contrast, the small size and high sensitivity of the proposed detector will be used for exacting detection of trace amounts of explosives in nearly any location, without swabbing, and at a cost that meets or exceeds the lowest price of detectors on the market.

In spite of the current revolution in optical microscopy, commercial solutions to achieve resolution beyond the diffraction limit have been slow to market, lacking in flexibility, and costly. Furthermore, most commercial products are too tailored to the systems being investigated and are difficult to generalize for widespread use. The instrument to be developed is based on an integrated design of the illumination, optics, data collection, and reconstruction algorithms for fluorescence imaging. These techniques enable the determination of the 3D position of emitters with great precision leading to 3D imaging with better resolution and depth of field than competing methods.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop integrated voltage regulators (IVR) that are 10 times smaller than existing solutions. Power management ICs (PMICs) are chips in mobile electronic devices that deliver power from the battery to different chips (e.g., processor, memory). Existing PMICs use discrete board-level inductors to efficiently deliver power, but the problem is that inductors occupy a large area on the board. This is especially problematic in space-constrained mobile electronic devices. Mobile device manufacturers put tremendous amounts of effort to reduce square millimeters of board area to make room for additional semiconductor chips for new features. Using IVRs, mobile devices can have extra space that used to be dedicated to bulky discrete components for PMICs, and use that space to either include new chips for new features or increase the battery size for longer battery life. This project will first work on semiconductor test-chip prototypes that prove the idea of IVRs. Then, the next step is to demonstrate it in commercial mobile electronic devices. The goal of the project is to ship IVRs in high-volume smartphones and tablets by replacing existing PMICs. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in saving board area and processor power consumption in mobile devices, which is crucial for continued innovation in mobile devices. Mobile device manufacturers always look for new features to add in their next generation products to differentiate themselves from competitors. New features often need additional chips, but the problem is that there is simply no area left in the mobile devices for new chips. One way to solve this is to shrink the battery and leave more room for chips, but this is unacceptable since it reduces battery life. The only way to keep introducing new features and chips is to reduce the existing board area. IVRs solve this burning need of mobile devices. Using IVRs, phones and tablets will have extra space in their board to include new features such as micro-projectors and ultra-accurate motion sensing. The technology developed from this project is essential in allowing mobile devices to keep improving with new features. This project aims to have a big impact in the fast-growing smartphone and tablet market with 1 billion and 250 million in annual shipments, respectively.",

In the US alone, every year more than 1 million dental injuries occur, resulting in medical costs of roughly $500 million. The proposed technology will involve novel manufacturing methods to incorporate energy absorbing solid/liquid suspensions into novel thermo-polymer mouth guard designs to achieve enhanced impact energy absorption capacity. The specific technical objectives are to optimize the energy absorbing capacity of the formulated solid/liquid suspensions, develop the necessary manufacturing technology for incorporating such solid/liquid suspensions monolithically into the thermo- polymer, and finally to characterize the mouth guards by subjection to stress testing (chemical, physical, and thermal). This energy absorbing mouth guard will deliver on-demand, tunable energy absorption capacity that can be specifically tailored to provide superior dental protection to users in several venues including medical, sports, industrial and military. This R &amp; D effort will produce the first ever mouth guard made with material that adaptively absorbs impact energy, a stark technological contrast to the conventional (passive) mouth guard. This new technology will also contribute basic understanding to the emerging field of nanorheology. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant. In just the mouth guard arena, realizing this technologically advanced mouth guard will likely bring a novel product into the dental protection market. Then there is the untapped market to provide much needed dental protection for patients undergoing medical procedures. Yearly about 150,000 dental injuries occur just during endotracheal intubations, required when undergoing general anesthesia. Further, the new energy absorbing fluid-thermopolymer material technology to emerge could serve as the technical groundwork for a plethora of energy dampening products. In addition, the research stands to seed a new body of knowledge, small- scale (millimeter) leveraged use of energy absorptive fluids.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Cavitation which leads to head falloff and feed system instabilities are a constant source of problems for the low net positive suction head (NPSH) pumps that are needed for advanced liquid rocket engines.  Head falloff limits the pumps capability to deliver propellant at the required pressure and cavitation induced instabilities are a significant source of structural failures in rocket propulsion systems. The instabilities are particularly pronounced at low flow off design conditions and can cause severe cavitation-induced surge or oscillations in the propellant feed system, leading to mission failure.  The high mass flow gain inlet cover delays cavitation induced head falloff and it eliminates cavitation instabilities at low NPSH conditions for all flow rates, but is particularly effective at low off-design mass flows.  The cover pulls the blade tip vapor cavity and vortex away from the blades to delay head falloff and improve flow stability. The high recirculation flow rate or gain through the cover maintains an optimal flow field on the pump inducer inlet for stable operation, even down to near shut-off conditions.  BENEFIT:  Significantly improve the suction capability, stability, and flow range of rocket turbopumps operating with a wide range of fluids including liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen, methane, and kerosene. In particular the technology will eliminate the need for boost pumps, reduce turbopump stage count and weight, increase efficiency, increase margins of safety and reliability, and reduce propellant tank weights through lower pressurization requirements.  The technology will open up the turbopump/engine/vehicle design trade-off space by moving the pump suction performance constraint and allow for a better optimal total launch system design.  The cover treatment can also be used in other commercial industrial applications that require stable high suction performance like LNG transfer pumps, two-phase pumping for electronic component cooling, super critical CO2 power generation cycles, and boiler feed water pumps.",

In addition to reducing the weight of the structure, composite materials provide the ability to expand the function of the structure by tailoring stiffness and strength characteristics for numerous applications such as solid rocket motor cases, missile airframes, missile guidance housings, as well as many launch tubes and launcher primary structures.  The AMRDEC Weapons Development and Integration Directorate has identified a need to understand the operational fitness of such structures following impact events from a wide range of energy levels.  The objective of the proposed Phase II research program is to develop and demonstrate an analysis tool that allows designers to evaluate post impact residual strength of composite structures.  A user element (UEL) subroutine for use with commercially available analysis codes is proposed.  A new shell element that offers advantages in both the economy and reliability of computations is to be demonstrated. This approach will link the UEL subroutine to a nonlinear material model to evaluate progressive damage and a shear correction model that accurately predicts the transverse response of impacted composite structures. Concurrently, material characterization and database development will be conducted to support implementation.",

Existing landing systems consisting of combinations of GPS, Radar, and other radio-based communications, are prone to component failure as well as unavailability of the required RF spectrum  issues that may require abandoning an expensive asset at sea. The Image-based Navigation for Fixed-Wing Shipboard Landing (ImageNav-FW) system can act as a backup, replacement, or complementary solution and enables recovery in the aforementioned scenarios. The ImageNav-FW system generates ship-relative navigation estimates for its onboard guidance and control system during the final approach and terminal landing phases. ImageNav-FW uses existing visual landing aids on the ship deck and does not require any ship-to-platform synchronous datalink or GPS. In Phase-I, ImageNav-SL was developed for VTUAV using advanced computer vision methods. Phase II of that program is expanding on the concept design to specify a detailed system HW/SW design and test a prototype implementation using data collects and real-time open-loop flight tests.

        "abstract": "Abstract: Due to the highly variable, often clutter-ridden, and sometimes hostile environments in which Buried Explosive Hazards (BEHs) reside, the challenge of clearing areas through mounted or dismounted operations is a formidable one. The improvised nature of re-used munitions and detonating devices, as well as the variability of homemade explosives constituents requires a technology capable of detecting signatures associated with a range of threats that include deeply buried ordnance and explosives, non-metallic homemade explosive compounds, and low-metal improvised trigger mechanisms.  Existing metal detector capabilities for vehicles within the Route Clearance Squad provide limited detection for deep-buried and low-metal or non-metallic threats.  Recent advances in Electromagnetic Induction (EMI) sensor technology offer several new capabilities that could address many of the current BEH detection capability gaps.  Specifically, the development of sensors that provide rich spatial, temporal and spectral information offer unparalleled detection and characterization capabilities.  The objective of our Phase II work is to leverage several of these advanced technologies to demonstrate a modular forward-mounted BEH detection system for integration within the Route Clearance Squad.

        "abstract": "Diode Pumped Alkali Vapor Lasers (DPAL) are a promising technology for high power directed energy lasers because of several favorable characteristics, notably the small quantum defect which results in very little deposition of waste heat in the lasing medium and potentially good conversion efficiency and beam quality.   Existing diode pumps have spectra that are too wide and inaccurately controlled, so external stabilization schemes using external volume gratings is required, but the spectral narrowing and tuning range provided is too limited and cost is too high.  Building on a successful Phase I demonstration, we will develop high power internally stabilized pump diode bars for alkali pumping with sub-GHz linewidths and tuning rates of 80 pm/degree and which provide scalability to multi-kW stacks.",

The results of the Phase II work successfully demonstrated the viability of repairing Aircraft Mounted Accessory Drive (AMAD) gearbox housings. The Ph II.5 work will further expand powder development and application parameters for the KM process to perform dimensional restoration of non-structural aluminum alloy components and non-structural dimensional restoration of high-strength steel parts.

The system will quickly and accurately detect and localize GPS threats to critical infrastructure, including jamming, spoofing, advanced adaptive and cognitive threats, and natural threats such as solar radio bursts and scintillations.\n\nThe tiered system consists of ground- and air-based sensor nodes, deployed GPS equipment, smartphones, and a centralized processing capability. The new sensors will use TDOA/FDOA and angle-of-arrival technology to precisely localize GPS jammers and spoofers, including less precise but higher density smartphone data.\nThe specific product to be developed is a GPS emitter detection and localization system that can be deployed locally or over a region. The product will be available to DHS, FAA, FCC and many DoD and IC agencies. Commercial value is in transitioning the technology into the GPS test and simulation markets.

Knowledge of the battlespace is greatly hindered because available weather-scale near-surface soil moisture data, a primary indicator of soil strength, is limited by its coarse spatial resolution (125 km). Moreover, there are no adequate methods for updating weather-scale soil moisture data with sparse, in situ field measurements. Creare is addressing this critical Army need by defining, developing, and evaluating innovative physics-based downscaling and upscaling algorithms for soil moisture and soil strength prediction embedded in a modular, open standards software framework. The physics-based model predictions are being validated through comparison to in situ soil moisture measurements from domestic and foreign sites. The resulting algorithms will provide accurate estimates of near-surface soil moisture and soil strength by integrating information from disparate data sources, including low resolution weather-scale predictions; localized, sparse point measurements; and other available data that correlate with soil moisture such as topography, elevation, slope, vegetation, and soil type.

Target is to create a lighter weight material characterized by flame retardant properties with zero melt drip; provide superior water proof and petroleum oil and lubricant resistance; incorporate recycled fibers as a principle component of construction; and reduce cost by as much as 25% over the current fabric by taking advantage of the high speed processing capabilities only possible with nonwovens.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop low-temperature ion source (LoTIS) technology which uses laser-cooling to create a beam of Cs+ ions with high brightness and low energy spread. This technology will extend the utility of focused ion beam (FIB) instrumentation that is widely used for nanometer-scale precision machining tasks; it accomplishes this by addressing shortcomings in precision and speed afforded by commercially available ion sources. One primary research aim of this project is the measurement of a key ion source performance metric, namely brightness, in order to compare its value to that of incumbent ion source technologies. LoTIS may have a brightness that is tenfold to one hundred-fold larger than the industry standard liquid metal ion source. An ion source with such an improved brightness would enable superior machining precision at higher speeds over a broader range of ion beam operating energies. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop improved FIB instrumentation to empower users in a variety of research fields and industrial applications, including nanotechnology, biotechnology, semiconductor manufacturing, and energy exploration. In particular, nanomachining applications, including integrated circuit edit and rapid prototyping of nanoscale device structures, are increasingly limited by the precision afforded by current ion source technology, and the users in these areas are in need of higher-precision FIBs. FIBs employed for transmission electron microscope lamellae preparation require less precision but could benefit from reduced subsurface ion damage provided by this method, through the use of Cs+ ions at low energy. A bright source of Cs+ ions could also dramatically improve the resolution and throughput for spatially-resolved elemental mapping in secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) applications. This technique represents an order-of-magnitude ion source performance improvement that will address FIB user needs across a wide spectrum of scientific and commercial applications.",

In Phase I, POC designed all aspects of the ZoomCOTI hardware including a detailed system design for retrofitting existing rifle scopes. The Phase I prototype demonstrated optical image fusion over 1-3x utilizing Alvarez lens and see-through waveguide optics. In Phase II, POC plans to optimize ZoomCOTI design and develop two generations of incrementally improved prototypes leading to an integrated system in a compact, low-cost, lightweight, rugged packaging compatible with retrofitting Army combat optics with a 3-10x magnification range. The final prototypes will be delivered to the Army for government testing to identify any required improvements.

However, current diving equipment was not designed to operate in such conditions, much less protect divers from exposure to contaminants in the water. These environments are so severe that equipment deteriorates to the point of breakthrough and failure in a matter of minutes, threatening the safety of the diver as well as the mission. Divers working in these conditions need robust equipment, such as Paragon&quot;s proposed Regulated Surface Exhaust (RSE) system, that provides reliable protection and isolation from hazardous materials.  Phase I results from laboratory tests and analysis of critical components show that the Navy&quot;s dive equipment can be modified to act like a spacesuit, completely isolating the diver from the water. Further, extensive material compatibility and permeability testing conducted by Paragon identified materials that can be used to replace the vulnerable exposed soft parts of the diving system. Existing Navy diving equipment can be cost effectively modified with a field deployable retrofit kit, providing reliable isolation from contaminated, hazardous environments. The Phase II objective is to provide a tested prototype retrofit kit.",

Such a system will then be able to provide a comprehensive and consistent tactical picture that will: (1) generate torpedo threat alerts, (2) reduce risks to friendly units, and (3) permit optimization of counter-fire in response to a torpedo attack.

Using existing aircraft status data, users can maintain situational awareness by visually scanning the actual RAMP situation.  Co-located data and performance statistics aid decision makers working in real-time to assess the current RAMP situation for all aircraft, providing updated performance data on RAMP operations and support what-if scenarios.    Two technologies form the basis of the ARViSS visualization and decision aiding system:  Advanced, User-centric Visualization and Stochastic Simulation.  User-centric graphical depiction of data frees users of tabular/spreadsheet-based data that forces them to maintain a complex process model mentally.  The user can engage in active status monitoring, zooming in and out on details, while data is represented in a consistent form with the mental modeling of the process.    The ARViSS stochastic simulation approach embeds RAMP production system models, providing operations management decision support by allowing the users to view actual operations support, management reporting systems, and full process simulation results data simultaneously within an advanced GUI to support optimal RAMP throughput.    BENEFIT:  This research is applicable to any human operator supervised, distributed multi-step, collaborative process, from maintenance and repair production lines to command and control processes, seeking to optimize throughput.  This technology will transition to other Air Force Aircraft maintenance operations to allow more efficient operations and greater Situational Awareness of aircraft maintenance operations.",

Authorized users will be able to search for and access these data collections and retrieve data relevant to their business needs, such as performing engineering analyses and studies.  \n\nTEDAR will support a variety of T&E/M&S and analysis data users and provide access to T&E/M&S data sources providing essential support to engineering, acquisition, and operational decision-making. The TEDAR will also provide each data collection and analysis organization a standard interface for sharing T&E data and lessons learned.  \n\nThe Phase I effort was focused on developing and demonstrating highly innovative solutions to these issues that involve: (1) developing TEDAR such that it is easily customizable to meet the varying needs of a broad range of government and commercial applications; (2) significantly reducing the potential Operations and Maintenance (O&M) costs for a large repository system; (3) providing a very flexible and intuitive interface for the system users; (4) providing an effective and efficient search mechanism via a rich and comprehensive set of metadata that is integrated and linked across the many disparate data collections in the repository; and (5) protecting the T&E/M&S data collections from unauthorized access, change, or corruption. \n\nThe Phase II effort will build on the Phase I baseline to complete out the system to an initial product, ready for use by DNDO and to proceed with commercialization. Significant Phase II objectives are to: (1) Improve usability and robustness to a production state, (2) scale up for very large collections and a very large number of collections, (3) design and implement a collection manifest capability; (4) enhance search capabilities; (5) implement support for M&S collections; (6) enhance security; and (7) address commercialization.  As required by the SBIR process, these objectives will be addressed over two contiguous 12-month periods.  The base capability for DNDO production use will by necessity be addressed in the first 12-month period of Phase II. \n\nA key aspect of Phase II will be standup of a \u201cBeta Test\u201d version of TEDAR for the personnel that DNDO assigns to represent the intended TEDAR user community.  These users will be able to access and use the system functionality to become familiar with TEDAR, explore its capabilities, and identify enhancements and added capabilities that are desired.  Thus an additional objective for Phase II will be to incorporate user-requested enhancements/functionality as approved by the DNDO system owner within time and resource constraints. ",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The main objective of the MALRD SBIR Phase II research is to develop design alternatives to collect atmospheric data using a novel concept whereby a F-16 fighter aircraft equipped with a ALE-47 countermeasure dispenser system (CMDS) may alternatively serve as an air-launched instrumentation-dispense platform. Specific atmospheric data will be collected by the dropsonde sensors including pressure, temperature, humidity, and GPS-derived wind vectors. This atmospheric data set is usually denoted as PTU+winds in technical literature. The F-16 dispense conditions for Phase II are 45,000 feet altitude and 0.9 Mach airspeed.      During the MALRD Phase I effort, we successfully demonstrated two static firings of the MALRD dropsonde design in the MJU-7 flare-canister configuration. Successful operation of all key functions including GPS, datalink, ARM processor, and support electronics start-up operations and parachute deployment and initial flight were demonstrated in the launches. The successful demonstration of two back-to-back dropsonde static firings provided a solid foundation for proceeding on to a Phase II development of a pre-production prototype. While the static firing demonstrated miniaturized dropsonde operations, the stressing dispense envelop posed by the expanded Phase II requirements mandate a complete reassessment of the Phase II baseline design.    BENEFIT:  The weather and flight test communities actively use dropsondes to measure pressure, temperature, humidity and winds data as it descends from an in-flight dispense point to the ground surface. The dropsondes transmits this data to a ground station equipped with a transceiver and computer processing equipment. These dropsondes are typically launched by hand through an opening or via a specially designed launch tube. The opportunity exists to air-launch miniature dropsondes from the existing on F-16 aircraft equipped with the ALE-47 countermeasure dispenser systems (CMDS). The launch envelop will be expanded to release conditions up to 45,000 feet and 0.9 Mach. Given the miniaturization and ruggedization of the core MALRD dropsonde circuit card assembly and associated sensors, commercialization and rapid market absorption will be driven by the low unit production costs gained by high production rates of the MALRD dropsonde core engine. A pre-production prototype will be developed in this Phase II effort.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Current space COMSEC units are quite large (not suitable for NanoSats or CubeSats), are based on 1980s technology, and do not take advantage of modern protocols or data standards.  They are also predicated on unique communications equipment and built to only meet the Space-Ground Link System specification, which is not at all designed to be compatible with modern interfaces or networking solutions.  Furthermore, not only are these units bulky and dated, they are extremely limited in configurability and require unique drivers and software protocol stacks to be written and added for practically every adaptation of a radio or processing device that interfaces to it.  As a result, the cost to implement a secure communications system can be rather severe.  The overall objective of this SBIR project is to develop a highly-miniaturized and smart COMSEC End Cryptographic Unit (ECU) that is an independent and configurable subsystem with built-in Command and Data Handling (C&DH) features for Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constrained aerospace applications.  The solution will replace much more expensive, larger, and specialized communication packages used on aerospace systems with a single CubeSat form factor board.  The design leverages an existing commercial COMSEC unit as part of Innoflight's CubeSat Software-Defined Radio (SDR) but will now embed a recently certified Type 1 AES256-GCM Suite B cryptographic ASIC. Based on this approach, certification costs will be minimal and the unit will maintain compatibility with less expensive and more readily available ground COMSEC systems.  BENEFIT:  Anticipated Benefits: (1) Provide a low SWaP Type 1 certified cryptographic unit for DoD CubeSats and other small spacecraft by the end of Phase 2; (2) Provide an integrated Radio Aerospace Vehicle Equipment (AVE) that is compatible with existing ground networks, including both AFSCN / SGLS and CCSDS ///// Potential Commercial Applications: (a) The MECU can be used to provide encryption or a full secure communications system for all DoD CubeSats (there is nothing available in the CubeSat form factor today; (b)The MECU can be used for virtually any SmallSat wanting an advanced, flexible and affordable COMSEC or full Radio AVE subsystem; (b) The MECU also can be used for NASA small spacecraft, which represent national assets that require secure communications; (3) Some commercial small space missions also will be interested in low-SWaP secure communications systems such as that provided by the MECU; (4) Launch vehicles and missiles can utilize the MECU and integrated radio to provide secure communications at Low SWaP as well; (5) This technology is directly applicable to similar remotely operated vehicles such as small/micro UAVs",

In that effort we recognized an opportunity to inform the intuitive system by expanding the set of decision attributes that are immediately accessible to the user. This proposed Phase II effort will build on the intuitive systems natural ability to process data in parallel and will employ technology to mitigate the risks posed by the systems tendency to overweigh information that is right in front of us. More specifically, we seek to enhance implicit learning opportunities during scenario-based training by revealing what experts would attend to in like situations. Our approach provides a low-cost and practical means of improving the volume of feedback students can obtain during scenario runs. In a similar way, we seek to enhance intuitive decision making in work contexts (e.g., UAV control) by providing access to the expertise of others and displaying additional contextual cues as well as data describing the users emotional and cognitive state.

In recent years important breakthroughs have been realized as TOMO has been applied to the production of advanced ceramic cores for investment casting of turbine airfoils. For large IGT components, Mikro technology is currently at a high readiness level. This effort would work to adapt the advanced core success TOMO has made for large industrial gas turbine components to advanced smaller scale aerospace airfoils. This Phase II will complete a critical development phase which will address the remaining technical challenges of adapting the technology.  This development is in preparation for a follow on production effort in which Mikro Systems will produce ceramic cores for complex turbine blades for an OEM&quot;s turbine platform. These turbine blades will be delivered to a planned engine test that will demonstrate a technology readiness increase for TOMO and significant component cost reductions.  BENEFIT:  This effort will demonstrate Mikro&quot;s ability to significantly compress the design-to-production time, reduce manufacturing cost, and improve product producibility/quality of aerospace turbine airfoils. Successful transition of the TOMO technology through this program will reduce system costs and improve component performance for the targeted platform.  Mikro&quot;s technology will also enable rapid program scale-up, reduce acquisition costs and improve surge production capabilities.    TOMO is a dual use technology and has opportunities for commercialization in military unique, dual use, and civil aerospace turbines. Additionally, given the flexibility of the TOMO process, advancements can be developed for other turbine components increasing the positive impact and ROI of the technology. These benefits will improve turbine specific fuel consumption, improve thrust performance, and reduce emissions for turbine engines. Successful transition would present significant growth for Mikro Systems and benefit the local economy though significant job creation.",

Each year military reservations spend large amounts of resources in time, materials, and manpower in identifying if endangered or threatened species are present. Current methods of determining presence of endangered and threatened species are labor intensive and may cause stress and habitat disruption. In addition, based on the surveyor&quot;s skill level, attention to following procedures, and record keeping, can introduce more unwanted variables into the reliability and accuracy of the field survey. An alternative method of species identification is needed that is more economical with increased accuracy, while minimizing impacts to the environment. An acoustical signal identification approach that has proved successful in identifying marine mammals will be implemented for terrestrial applications. CTSi and Cornell University&quot;s Bioacoustics Research Program have identified an innovative approach which will deliver accurate field surveys for any desired species that can vocalize, locate the emission position, use less labor, use ordinary people as survey scientists, and operate in rugged environmental conditions. Our team will provide a rugged autonomous acoustic DRP system that can consistently and accurately identify and track animals that emit sounds. This system operates autonomously and produces an acoustical emissions map for the end user. The system can easily accommodate other acoustic emission identification and location applications.  BENEFIT:  The anticipated benefit of this effort is automating environmental compliance fauna site surveys by using species unique acoustical identification methods. A by-product of this automation is enhanced species detection while reducing manpower to conduct the survey and minimizing intrusion into environmentally sensitive areas.  This technology can be adapted into many applications especially in the DOD surveillance market, where detecting target sounds and the emission origin provides the warfighter with enhanced situational awareness capability.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project from Nanofiber Separations, LLC will establish an innovative type of bioseparation media utilizing electrospun nanofiber felts/mats of regenerated cellulose with high specific surface area as the support for protein adsorption ligands. Compared to competitive products (e.g., packed resin beads or microfiber adsorption membranes), these nanofiber membranes/felts will provide greatly enhanced throughput (i.e., shorter processing times), reduce the amount of waste generated, and decrease the volume of media required (i.e., lower costs and smaller operating footprints) for purification of high-value biopharmaceutical products. The SBIR Phase I project was completed successfully by developing a manufacturing process for the functionalized nanofiber felts and proving superior performance compared to commercial products. This SBIR Phase II project will focus on further optimization of the formulations used during production of the nanofiber adsorbents for bioseparations. This will include two scale-up steps needed for the commercial manufacturing effort anticipated during the Phase II timeline (nanofiber felt production, surface functionalization, and module development). Key technical improvements, including greater product stability and a broader array of functional ligands needed in bioseparations, will continue to be made to the nanofiber felts/mats. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project goes well beyond bioseparations. Due to the many advantages of the surface-functionalized electrospun nanofibers made from regenerated cellulose, this innovative adsorption material has tremendous commercial potential. Customers will come from companies within the biopharmaceutical industry, as well as from the established manufacturers of bioseparations adsorption media. Additionally, the underlying fundamentals associated with nanofiber adsorption media will have a wide range of implications, including more efficient separation processes in the water purification industry and the blood products and/or blood purification industries. The advantages achieved through this innovative work will lead to more efficient separation technologies across many sectors and include faster processes, reduced energy consumption, lower materials requirements, and less waste generation.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovative Research Phase II project is focused on the development of a copper chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) slurry. An important step in semiconductor manufacturing is CMP, which uses an aqueous slurry containing abrasives and chemical components in conjunction with a polishing pad to remove material and to planarize the wafer. As device sizes decrease, next generation CMP slurries must achieve planarization on increasingly higher aspect ratio structures. Current copper CMP slurries have a limited planarization efficiency (PE) (ratio of step height removed to thickness removed). Without an improvement in PE, CMP is going to become an increasingly expensive and limiting step in the semiconductor manufacturing process. The proposed effort aims to develop a copper CMP slurry containing nano-sized contact release capsules (nano-CRC). Nano-CRC based slurries consist of a core-shell nanoparticle where the mechanical and chemical components are combined into a single entity. Use of the nano-CRC slurry yields simultaneously high PE and high material removal rate, which will improve planarity and decrease processing costs for semiconductor manufacturers. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes advancing the state-of-the-art in CMP slurry formulation and enabling the continued scale down of next generation microelectronic devices. The copper CMP slurry market is currently $340M, and expected to grow to greater than $500M by 2016 due to the increase in the number of Cu CMP steps as devices continue to shrink. Additionally, a copper CMP slurry that can achieve both high through-put and high planarity would yield a product with a very high return on investment for semiconductor manufacturers. The nano-CRC technology can be used to impregnate nanoparticles with different chemical payloads, and different base nanoparticles can also be used (i.e. alumina). The technology has potential to be used as a platform to provide solutions for a variety of industries, both within the realm of CMP where it may be possible to use on other CMP polishing steps, and also for other non-CMP polishing processes, including optical materials, glass polishing, cleaning, etc.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will revolutionize the manufacture of ultrahigh precision, x-ray diffraction gratings. Mechanically ruled, x-ray gratings are used at synchrotron radiation and free-electron laser facilities, where they define the wavelength of x-rays used for chemical analysis and imaging studies in the fields of photovoltaics, electronic materials, catalysis, structural biology, environmental science, and others, serving a wide variety of industries and academic disciplines. This effort will advance a new approach to fabricating such gratings that uses a pair of atomic force microscopes (AFMs) operating in tandem - one for scribing and the other for in situ imaging. This combination provides unprecedented control over feature shape and positioning, and will allow scribing of features with nm-scale precision over areas exceeding 400 square centimeters. If successful, the result will be a new approach to fabricating holographic optics for use not only at synchrotron and free-electron laser facilities, but for a variety of other applications. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project stems from the fact that, between 2009 and 2011, a crisis occurred in the x &amp; #8208;ray grating market. The only two world suppliers of mechanically ruled gratings ceased to take orders, either because their technology was obsolete or because of severe infrastructure problems. This vanishing of world capacity has taken place when demand for x &amp; #8208;ray gratings is at an all-time high and growing. Extensive market research via direct communication with x-ray facilities has revealed a current need for 430 gratings worldwide, which at a sale price of $60,000 implies a global market opportunity of approximately $26 million. If successful, it should be possible to capture this market and bring this area of manufacturing back to the U.S. Gratings aside, this project presents a new approach to creating holographic optics that could enable new technologies based on the engineering of customized, optical wave fronts. This approach can scribe curved lines, forming arcs or ellipses, providing lateral focusing, or exhibiting topological defects that create electromagnetic vortices having high angular momentum. These features may find use in microscopy, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, or the creation of masters for the mass market for optical grating replicas.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new soluble small molecules (SSM) and device architectures for organic (plastic) photovoltaic (OPV) technology. SSMs are low-cost plastic semiconductors that can be printed as an ink or spray painted onto conventional plastic sheets to fabricate extremely inexpensive, lightweight, and flexible solar cells. Development of organic solar cells has primarily been based on small molecules deposited from vapor (an expensive and constraining process) or solution-processed polymers; semiconducting polymers by nature are inherently impure and are limited to small batch sizes with inconsistencies between batches. SSM-OPV technology removes these critical development and manufacturing barriers. In this project we will further increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of our SSM-OPV cells by developing SSM-OPV tandem cells, which will increase the theoretical PCE limit as well as directly improve the actual PCE. Unlike conventional solar where the fabrication of multi-junction solar cells is complex and cost is prohibitively high, SSM-OPV is well suited for low cost tandem cell fabrication. Therefore this project will be addressing one of the most critical barriers to the commercialization of OPV technology. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the promise of very low-cost solar cells that are extremely lightweight and flexible, and which are domestically manufactured via low-cost roll-to-roll processing. These plastic solar cells promise to be substantially lighter and more flexible than existing technologies, with competitive efficiencies and lifetimes for the niche portable solar market and PV integrated roofing. The market for niche solar applications made from lightweight flexible photovoltaics includes stand-alone portable chargers for military and retail users as well as integrated systems including integration with tents, awnings, recreational vehicles, and membrane roofing. This market is relatively new and is quickly growing despite the fact the market needs are poorly met by currently available technologies. Currently available photovoltaics in the portable solar market have limited flexibility thereby increasing their collapsed volume and weight. While still new, the niche flexible/portable solar market is predicted to surpass 420MW and reach $600 million by 2020. The market for flexible building-integrated PV (BIPV) roofing products is projected to reach $3 billion by 2018. There is also potential that SSM-OPV technology could make inroads into the much larger utility scale market in the future.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Electronic Warfare (EW) will be a critical aspect of potential future conflicts.  After years of facing threats without significant EW threats, many EW operators are left with atrophied skills.  This lack of real-world experience, combined with the rapid pace at which new threat technology is developed, makes EW training crucial to military operations, and the EW debrief is one of the most effective means to evaluate the effectiveness of our training.  The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate a cost effective, but high fidelity, solution to add a simulation environment that can consume EW data sources, assess an output, and then record, display and potentially communicate a more combat realistic environment to airborne operators, range control personnel and EW threat operators, while at the same time recording the info for immediate After Action Review (AAR).  If this EW/AAR Phase II is successful, it will open the door to providing more realistic and higher fidelity EW training and debriefing, while also providing a more cost effective and extensible way to create the combat environments our military will potentially face in the future.  BENEFIT:  In Phase II, BSI believes this is a unique and innovative approach to improving the realism and cost effectiveness of Live-Virtual-Constructive EW training and debrief that could be applied at many ranges and simulations across the DoD.  In the course of our research we have identified more applications for improvement in EW/AAR and expanded and targeted our objectives for future EW/AAR development.  The results of our Phase I research has created a road-map for the implementation of advanced jamming technique simulation, visualization tools and gives insight into the vast possibilities of advancing EW/AAR if an EW simulation environment could interact with live ground and air systems.  The market for distributed military simulation is vast and increasing as more and more training moves into the simulated realm, due to the cost of live training and the pressure to reduce the number of live training ranges.  Many hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on DIS-capable simulations, including weapon system trainers, full-motion trainers, image generators, and a wide variety of SAFs.  In short, the market is many orders of magnitude larger than required for BSI to thrive with just a small market share.  The first product that will incorporate the Live Range Plugin (LRP) Phase II capabilities is BSI's Modern Air Combat Environment (MACE).  MACE is BSIs flagship product, a DIS-based entity generator and threat environment.  Within six months of the initial release of MACE in April of 2011, MACE had been sold to USAF, ANG, USAFE and USSOCOM units, educational institutions and to companies in the private sector.  MACE is also registered with the Department of Defense Trade Controls and ready for international sales.",

        "abstract": "Ballistic and blast protection of both the crew and vital equipment onboard U.S. Navy surface ships and carriers is a critical component in the design of topside structures on these vessels. Materials such as glass, Plexiglas and polyurea are being considered and implemented for protection in these applications due to their low density and inherent damage mechanisms which absorb large amounts of energy under high-velocity impact or blast loading conditions. Likewise, these material systems are being used in layered or laminated configurations to exploit the benefits of each individual material. However, the ability to numerically simulate these materials constitutive and damage behavior does not readily exist in traditional analysis tools. Therefore, for this effort we have proposed to utilize and implement three new constitutive material models for conventional glass, PMMA, and polyurea/polyurethane. The material models will initially be implemented within the shock hydrocode CTH and will allow for more accurate simulation of ballistic impact events on the material systems of interest and also offer a more efficient armor system design approach.",

The antenna system will be a multi-layer electronic device with a number of antenna elements.  The electronics will not be mounted to the wing structure, they will become part of the wing structure.  This implies an impact to Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) for UAVs.  The payload will become part of the wing structure allowing the rest of the UAV to be utilized for more fuel for longer flights.  The electronic portion of this must operate in the RF regime and the success of Phase I demonstrated a numbering of working devices utilizing 3D printed materials and including ring resonators and multi-bit phase shifters.  This is the first time a complex RF system will be printed utilizing 3D printing and Direct printing approach.  This will enable UAVs but also enable a vast number of 3D RF products.      BENEFIT:  The anticipated benefits will be enhanced capabilities in smaller UAVs that could rival the large complex, expensive crafts.  These small UAVs with printed phase array system wings will provide more intelligence and surveillance capabilities to a broader range of war fighters at less cost to the DoD.  This will be a significant savings to the DoD when this is fully utilized and expanded beyond UAVs and into other electronic devices that are deployed.  This will transition beyond the DoD and move to enable consumer electronic products.  The complexity of this project is significant as compared to more simplistic but mass produced consumer electronics.  Next generation consumer electronics will be customized, personalized and be enabled via 3D printing.  The potential of manufacturing in the U.S. will become a reality when this matures.",

This system included high performance components integrated with printed substrates and printed antennas to support data processing and wireless communications in a flexible and conformal format. FleX silicon-on-polymer integrated circuits and printed devices such as the antenna demonstrated in the CLAS Phase I program have provided a feasible solution for flexible electronics and wireless applications.

        "abstract": "Underwater ship hull inspection platforms routinely check for damage, corrosion, and suspicious objects. Highly accurate position information is required to properly register hull inspection data with previously collected data to monitor the progression of structural anomalies and other changes and ensure complete hull coverage. Conventional underwater localization methods are inadequate for hull inspection. For example, fixed-source signal triangulation systems do not function well in shallow water, and inertial dead-reckoning systems accumulate unacceptable error over time. Alternative vision-based techniques, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), have shown some promise for underwater platforms. However, the underwater environment and hull inspection task present several challenges to these techniques, such as poor visibility and limited scene structure. We propose Precise Underwater Localization Using Sonar and Electro-Optics (PULSE), an approach that uses optical and acoustic imaging sensors to offer greater flexibility under these conditions. In our preceding Phase I effort, we demonstrated the concept of underwater SLAM using a video camera and imaging sonar together. In this Phase II effort, we will enhance the PULSE system by introducing a stereo camera and 3D sonar to improve navigation accuracy, and perform extensive testing over a wide range of representative operational environments and scenarios.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This Phase II SBIR program seeks to develop a new thermal barrier coating (TBC) system with a diffusion barrier coating and low thermal conductivity (k) top coat for alleviating oxidation of the bond coat alloy and moisture induced delayed spallation (MIDS), along with increasing the thermal efficiency. TBCs have been applied to the hot sections of aircraft turbine engines to increase engine efficiency and to extend the life of metal components; however, they have not been fully integrated to the engine design due to the potential catastrophic failures at the interfaces where crack formation takes place. This failure is closely linked to the thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer on the bond coats during  thermal exposures.  Due to this fact, current efforts are focused on  developing new bond coat alloys or top coats, but only minimal benefits have  been achieved. We propose the development of new barrier coatings and a low k  top coat to achieve a longer lifetime and a high thermal insulation.  BENEFIT:   Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are used for the hot sections of the aircraft engines to allow for higher use temperatures; however, the coating effectiveness is limited by unpredictable lifetimes and poor reliability. A new diffusion barrier coating along with a low k top coat could significantly reduce the TGO growth and adverse effects of water (MIDS).  This would increase the  TBC lifetime and predictability; the full incorporation of the new TBC into military aircraft and commercial engines is expected.",

However, the cutting edge capabilities offered by these packages could have a substantial commercial impact and value.  One of the main reasons for the limited presence of these libraries in commercial settings is their  complex delivery system and lack of commercial support. We will improve the delivery system of these numerical libraries to make them easier to use for com- mercial customers.  We focus on the Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc) from Argonne National Laboratory and two packages, TAO and SLEPc, derived off of PETSc. Since these libraries are difficult to build and install, easy-to-use installers will be developed.  Furthermore, several external packages that plug into PETSc will be ported to the common platforms to increase the value of the derived open source product. We will create a new product called PTSolve that will consist of PETSc and two open source packages, TAO and SLEPc, derived from PETSc. We will also include several new external packages that provide greater value for PTSolve.  We will have easy-to-use single-click installers and focus on the performance of these libraries on multi-core architectures.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: We are targeting commercial customers who desire efficient libraries on a variety of platforms.

        "abstract": "Improvements in cost and performance of conventional multi-\u00ad\u2010petabyte data storage systems are failing to keep up with the growing needs of both commercial and government users.  The ever-\u00ad\u2010 accelerating demands of big energy data have lead the DOE to solicit proposals for advanced large scale data storage, especially disruptive new technologies which can integrate into the sophisticated and mature infrastructure already in place.  Principal existing technologies include magnetic disk drives and SSDs which offer high performance but at high cost, and magnetic tape libraries which offer low initial cost but require special maintenance and suffer shortcomings, especially from data access latency (1 \u2013 2 minutes to find and access a particular piece of information).  Akonia Holographics is leveraging its recent advances in holographic data storage (HDS) systems and storage media to develop a commercial technology offering a 10x latency improvement over magnetic tape while matching or exceeding tape\u2019s storage capacity, archival performance, and total cost of ownership.  Furthermore, Akonia aims to implement HDS media and drives in a form compatible with existing tape libraries\u2019 media handling systems, thus taking advantage of prior commercial and government investment in these supporting technologies.  Specific objectives of this Phase I/II proposal are: (1) to develop a baseline holographic storage archive library design that meets commercial and DOE requirements and provides a detailed framework for development and engineering of subsystems that will be the starting point for Phase III product engineering, (2) achieve and demonstrate R&D advances in HDS storage media and key drive components and subsystems that will enable Phase III productization, and (3) create specialized modeling and design tools to enable more effective R&D, optimization, and engineering of HDS technologies.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Holographic archive storage libraries will compete directly with tape archive libraries, currently a multi-\u00ad\u2010billion dollar market.  Due to the 10x advantage that holographic libraries enjoy over tape in terms of latency, there is the additional commercial potential for this technology to capture a large portion of the backup market, which has been moving from tape to magnetic disks over the past decade.

        "abstract": "The National Academy of Sciences issued a report in February 2008 detailing isotope replacement priorities in the interests of national security [National Research Council, 2008] .  137Cs used  in  \u201cself-contained\u201d  irradiators  was  identified  as  the  single  most  dangerous  isotope  in  the inventory, owing to its long half life (30+ years) and production as cesium chloride salt, which means it can be easily dispersed in a radioactive dispersal device (RDD).  Of the 1,350 Cs irradiators in the U.S., approximately 650 are used for irradiating transfusion blood bags to inactivate leukocytes and thereby prevent transfusion-associated  graft versus host disease (TA-GVHD), a gruesome condition in which  active  donor  leukocytes  attack  the internal  organs  of immuno-suppressed  patients,  with fatality rates of over 90%.   Replacement of blood irradiators with 60Co sources has been attempted, but has been unsuccessful.   X-rays are the obvious alternative to isotopes.  Previous attempts at using x-rays for blood irradiation, however, have been unsuccessful due to their reliance on inappropriate sources.  Point-source X-ray tubes are not meant to be operated for several minutes, the time need to deliver the FDA-recommended dose of 25 Gy (min 15 Gy, max 50 Gy) to the blood bags. Stellarray proposes the development and deployment of a new type of self-contained blood irradiator (SCBI) to replace isotope irradiators.   The heart of the SCBI is Stellarray\u2019s patented flat panel x-ray source (FPXS), which is designed for continuous operation and is ideally suited for blood and other irradiation systems.  In the FPXS, arrays of cathodes below a top exit window emit e-beam showers at high voltage to a large metal anode target assembly.  This anode, the top window and side walls form the vacuum enclosure of the source.   SCBI will be about the size of a microwave oven, compared  to the refrigerator-sized  irradiators  now available,  weigh  between  200 and 500 lbs. (as opposed to 1.5 \u2013 2 tons), be operable with 110 AC power for the small and medium sized models and with 220 single phase for the large conveyor model; require no external cooling, and be extremely reliable.  Stellarray will develop and offer SCBI in three sizes:  small (for two 400 ml bags or similar volumes), medium (four 400 ml bag equivalent), and large (three pairs of panels, with either tray or conveyor  belt operation).   Multiple  interlocks,  self shielding  of the sources, and lead wall linings ensure  safe  operation.    All  three  models  will  have  dose  rates  > 8  Gy/min;  closed  loop  oil  heat exchangers; less than 10% dose variation in x, y or z directions; operation up to 160 kV; >4,000 hours lifetime; and full compliance with radiation safety standards.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  SCBI  can  become  a substantial  business  since  it  has  been designed  with user needs clearly  in mind.     It is well-suited for use in crowded blood banks and hospitals and requires no special security measures or changes to room utilities.    It will be priced attractively, for a substantially lower cost of ownership compared to the alternatives.    The use of the right source will make it highly reliable, so it can displace isotope irradiators.\n",

        "abstract": "Neutron detectors for well logging require stable operation in an extreme environment of high temperatures, (175\u00b0C up to 260\u00b0C), high mechanical vibration, and shock. Helium-3 tubes have been the preferred solution, as they satisfy these requirements to 175\u00b0C, can be configured in small packages, are easy to fabricate, have low power requirements, and offer high detection efficiency. The supply of 3He gas has dwindled in recent years, however, and this medium can no longer support the demand in well- logging and other fields. Proportional Technologies Inc. (PTI) has developed boron-coated straw (BCS) detectors that have been shown to successfully replace 3He tubes in homeland security and neutron science applications. PTI has also developed a detector designed to withstand extreme temperatures. With recent developments PTI's straws are ultrasonically welded into all metal tubes and formed into corrugated structures that enhance the straw wall area by as much as two fold.  The new construction is virtually impervious to temperature extremes.  The basic Boron coated foil can be taken to 1000\u00b0C and -200\u00b0C repeatedly with no effect on the integrity of the coating nor foil structure. The corrugated structures lock together and substantially stabilize the straw walls against extreme vibration and shock. For this project, we propose a Fast Track development of a commercially attractive BCS-based neutron detector  for  well  logging.  The  detector  will  share  many  of  the  attractions  of  3He  tubes,  including compact size, high efficiency, low power consumption, and reliable operation in extreme environments. (of at least 250\u00b0C). This will take the straw detector well beyond the temperature and robustness capabilities of 3He detectors and open new horizons in well logging.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Neutron detection is of substantial importance to US and world economy by aiding in discovery of new oil and gas fields. As newer oil field exploration is moving into depths where temperatures easily reach 250\u00b0C, we expect the proposed straw neutron detector will provide a substantial increase in operational temperature and also to provide unexcelled reliability reducing the high cost of oil and gas exploration. As such, this development is very important to US economy moving forward.",

        "abstract": "Nitrous oxide is the third most important greenhouse gas (GHG,) with an atmospheric lifetime of ~114 years and a global warming impact ~300 times greater than that of CO2. The main cause of nitrous oxide\u2019s atmospheric increase is anthropogenic emissions, and over 80% of the current global anthropogenic flux is related to agriculture, including associated land-use change. An accurate assessment of N2O emissions from agriculture is vital not only for understanding the global N2O balance and its impact on climate and also for designing crop systems with lower GHG emissions. Such assessments are currently hampered by the lack of instrumentation and methodologies to measure ecosystem-level fluxes at appropriate spatial and temporal scales. Southwest Sciences and Princeton University will develop new open-path eddy covariance techniques and instrumentation for continuous and fast (10 Hz) measurement of nitrous oxide emissions.  Once tested and validated, the method will transform the ability to measure and understand ecosystem-level nitrous oxide fluxes at multiple scales. The  work  plan  includes  assessment  of  key underlying technical issues supporting the technique during the Phase I budget period, followed by development of prototype flux instrumentation that will be tested extensively in field environments during the Phase II budget periods.  At the conclusion of the Fast Track project, Southwest Sciences will develop and market a commercial instrument to the atmospheric research community.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The results of this research will be commercialized as a product for N2O measurements that is truly portable and cost- effective. The technology is especially groundbreaking as it could be widely applied across CO2-based FLUXNET sites (>1200 worldwide) for direct measurements of N2O exchange. The technology can be more broadly applied to a wide range of gas monitoring requirements in industry, environmental monitoring, health and safety, etc.",

        "abstract": "As supercomputing speeds increase and storage costs drop, scientists running applications in various disci- plines, such as high-energy physics, genomics, climate studies, etc., generate datasets of ever-increasing sizes at distributed locations around the world.  Backbone Research-and-Education Network (REN) providers such as DOE\u2019s Energy Sciences Network (ESnet) and Internet2, provide high-speed, reliable network services to support these scientists located at various US Department of Energy (DOE)\u2019s national laboratories and universities. Our work will identify, in real-time, very large data flows across these networks, moving them to alternative network paths or queues so that interactive applications such  as voice, video, and applications can retain a high quality of service thereby extending the interval to the next inevitable costly equipment upgrade cycle. We are developing a system called real-time Hybrid Network Traffic Engineering System (rHNTES) which will tap the traffic between networking installations to determine which network flows are large, ongoing, and of high bandwidth; i.e. elephant flows. We consider the timely completion of these elephant flows less important than interactive network traffic such as voice, video or applications and as such, change the network priority such that elephant flows are lower priority than other more import network traffic. Our elephant flow identification is accomplished in real-time, using off-the-shelf network processors and innovative software algorithms. Once identified, we will reprogram the switching infrastructure to ensure these flows do not impact the higher priority flows. This project will develop a software packet processing engine using readily available commodity network processors which will be able to analyze network packets at up to 100 billion bits per second. We will use this software engine to develop our real-time HNTES (rHNTES) system based on prior HNTES algorithm work. The network routers will be reprogrammed on-the-fly to mitigate the impact of each of the elephant flows we identify.  This system will then be integrated into existing network performance monitoring tools to help identify where network bottles occur.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  This work will enhance collaborative science making more efficient use of existing and future networking technologies that will help usher in scientific breakthroughs.",

        "abstract": "In the USA there are 15 synchrotron and free-electron-laser facilities, funded primarily by the Department of Energy (DOE); and 52 similar facilities in other countries.   Synchrotrons and free-electron  lasers  are  extremely  bright  sources  of  x-ray  and  vacuum-ultraviolet  (VUV) radiation. These intense beams are used to study the binding among atoms and many other topics that relate to the energy problem, human health and materials in general.  The fundamental knowledge gained from these studies has a direct impact on the US economy.  Currently, DOE facilities and others are inhibited in their research by the high cost and long delays in obtaining key components required by the bright x-ray and VUV experiments. These components are called  diffraction  gratings;  they  enable  researchers  to  separate  the  beams  according  to wavelength, and to study in fine detail how materials, when they are irradiated, modify the wavelengths of radiation that impinges on them, giving clues to internal binding mechanisms. Diffraction gratings are made by lithographic techniques capable of sub-micron resolution. At present there are no US sources of such gratings. The objective of this SBIR Fast-Track proposal is to improve the precision of a relatively new form of lithography, invented in the USA, called Zone-Plate-Array Lithography (ZPAL), and to demonstrate that gratings and diffractive-focusing optics make by  the ZPAL technique are superior in precision and performance to what is available today commercially from overseas.  The ZPAL technology will significantly lower the cost of diffraction grating and shorten the delivery time from months to days.  In Phase I, grating placement errors will be measured via phase-shifting interferometry and error sources such as stage rotation minimized.  The effect of scan direction on microscopic errors in gratings will be studied as well as the effect of optical polarization on the lithography. In Phase II, corrections of phase errors in gratings will be made via hardware improvements and by correction in software for systematic, repeatable errors.  Environmental effects that have a detrimental effect on grating fidelity will be studied and improvements made to the ZPAL instrument and the temperature control. In addition to so-called linear-phase gratings, variable-line-space (VLS) gratings will be fabricated and tested to evaluate the degree to which the improvements made to the ZPAL instrumentation have improved the quality of the gratings it produces.  The instrument will be modified to handle the thick substrates that gratings for use in synchrotrons require.  The improved grating technology that will result from this SBIR will significantly enhance basic research at DOE facilities and elsewhere, stimulate scientific innovation and aid the economy. The company submitting this proposal envisages that, as a result of this SBIR, it can capture the major share of a highly profitable international market.",

The ability to manufacture higher quality mirrors is directly limited by the accuracy and efficiency of the systems used to measure them.

The combined Phase I/Phase II will achieve the object of improving the measurement technique and providing a complete system that can be used for production of x-ray mirrors. In Phase I we will demonstrate the capability of this measurement technique in a controlled environment for a limited range of mirrors.  In Phase II, we will take a systematic approach to understand sensitivities and improve the source, alignment, and imaging systems for phase measuring deflectometry.  We combine this understanding with a systems engineering approach to create a robust system that can measure a wide range of x-ray mirrors to the highest possible accuracy.

        "abstract": "This  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  proposal  presents  AutoPHY,  an autonomous, virtualized layer 0 interconnection  service for data centers and cloud computing. The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) stack representing the Internet infrastructure consists of  layers  0  to  7.    Today  all  layers  can  be  automatically  configured  and  managed  through software, with the exception of the physical interconnection layer 0, which is still managed manually.  More than 60% of data center outages are now attributed to human errors occurring at layer 0.  The AutoPHY service will for the first time automate the management of the millions of physical interconnects in a typical network, at a scale and cost previously impossible.  Unique robotic   fiber  optic  cross-connect   hardware   married   with  sophisticated   Knots  and  Braids Switching  (KBS)  algorithms  enable  a breakthrough  switch  technology  that, for the first time, scales in complexity as N, the number of ports, rather than N2.   This technology offers unprecedented  capabilities  in network  provisioning,  emergency  failover,  network  partitioning and bandwidth grooming for flexible management of network interconnections at scale, with seamless federation across geographically dispersed, separately managed centers.   AutoPHY improves  the flexibility  and simplicity  of cloud network  management,  secures  networks  from human error, and enables a scalable, efficient and resilient network infrastructure. The  broader  impact  of  this  project  includes  the  advancement  of  standards-based network infrastructure and open source Software-Defined Networking (SDN) networking technologies,  and more  specifically  the development  of hardened  physical  layer  management tools and services for deployment in production multi-tenant and mega data centers.   The technology to dynamically  control and optimize the physical network topology will be used by the AutoPHY global manager, in coordination with SDN controllers, to build high level network services  including  Automated  Smart-Hands  and  Automated  Failover.     AutoPHY  will  reduce cross-connect  and provisioning  times from days to minutes and eliminate the errors resulting from manual intervention.  These developments will be a significant contribution to the same important  goals that drive the SDN movement.   Whereas  current SDN efforts are focused on layers 2 and 3 of the network, AutoPHY enables software programmability to be cost-effectively extended to the physical network topology.   By improving  the economics  and performance  of layer 0 at the cloud scale, AutoPHY  has the potential  to transform  cloud computing  through higher utilization and support the broader Department of Energy mission.",

        "abstract": "\"Liquid fuel produced from dried plant material (i.e. lignocellulosic biomass such as wood chips, straw, switchgrass, and corn stover) is nearly cost competitive with corn ethanol. Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant, readily available, and renewable material on Earth to produce biofuels. However, lignin, a key component of plant material necessary for growth and protection against pathogens and pests, is a very tough substance that prevents accessibility to fermentable sugars present in biomass. Lignification makes biomass processing for biofuels very difficult and expensive. Previous efforts to develop low lignin plants have failed due to weakened stalks and stems and poor growth. In this project, we will validate the combination of two traits (cell-\u00ad\u2010specific low lignin and increased fermentable sugar accumulation) that were successfully proven in model plant organisms. In Phase I, we will develop synthetic biology tools for plant transformation and generate low lignin/high sugar switchgrass transgenic lines. During Phase II, these lines will be extensively characterized for their optimized properties in greenhouse trials, and the best engineering strategies will be selected for field trials for a Phase III effort. \n \nCommercial Application and Benefits. This engineering technology will enable healthy switchgrass plants to grow with 20% more fermentable sugars and 40% less lignin (but reduced only in selected internal fiber structures so that stalks and stems remain strong). Consequently, biorefineries using this low lignin switchgrass can reduce their initial investment, lower their ongoing operating expenses, and increase their annual revenue. Low lignin switchgrass would give cellulosic biofuels an economically competitive advantage compared to corn ethanol. This project will demonstrate healthy, low lignin switchgrass if approved for the full Phase I and Phase II. The combined phases are necessary due to the long time required for switchgrass engineering and characterization because plants need to grow to maturity and at least two cycles are required to show that the desired traits are reproducible. Demand for low lignin switchgrass will significantly increase in the next few years. Construction is already underway to expand annual production capacity of cellulosic biofuels from 25 million gallons (ethanol equivalent) in 2012 to over 650 million gallons in 2016. Biorefineries benefit most directly. Farmers benefit from the increased demand and diversity \nof planting options. Additionally, once the low lignin switchgrass is demonstrated, this technology could be used to enhance the productivity and profitability of other commercial crops such as grazing and forage crops.  \n \n\"\n",

The real-time image enhancement algorithms mitigate backscatter, surface effects, and platform video motion using single frame and temporal processing techniques. Additionally, the autonomous algorithms optimally control the UUV illumination through statistical sampling techniques and dynamically compress imagery to match limited bandwidth transmission. The proposed effort includes trade studies for a suitable processor architecture meeting SS-DTE requirements, a detailed real-time algorithm implementation, and SS-DTE system integration. Capability demonstrations progress from demonstration in a lab environment to a tank demonstration and finally a real-time demonstration on the SS-DTE test bed.",

A large-scale model of the RMCP mounted on an INLS/RRDF platform along with similarly scaled and instrumented models of the LMSR stern ramp will be tested on both a purpose built 3-DOF test apparatus and in a wave tank test facility. The capability of the RMCP to safely support the transit of vehicles from the ships ramp to the RRDF platform will be evaluated under a broad range of ship and platform motions.

Beam transport was also studied as an integral part of the Phase-I program to ensure that the individual beamlets can be transported through the small beam tunnels required for efficient beam-wave interactions in Ka-band for a variety of magnetic field configurations. In addition, the beam optics from the electron gun and transport system were used to investigate beam-wave interactions with our novel three-beam cascaded serpentine traveling-wave tube.

The proposed effort to extend the SURVICE-developed framework fills a capability gap that exists in non-destructive testing of vehicle hulls in Forward Operating Bases (FOB) and combat outposts. Due to time restraints and environmental factors, existing inspection methods are often inadequate. Many vehicles that could be returned to service are currently scrapped or sent to a depot because of the inability to accurately assess damage, while vehicles that are returned to service could pose safety risks to the operators if damaged areas are not identified and repaired.

Traditional commercial pilot training is conducted with hexapod-based motion systems that are limited in their ability to replicate the motion cues associated with these events.

The ARCTES will rely on an initially-frozen cryogen to absorb heat from the passing helium gas through a heat exchanger device. As the working cryogen continues to absorb heat, it will warm to its melting point, melt, and then continue to warm as a liquid and evaporate to the vapor phase. The ARCTES provides a compact, lightweight, and simple means of passively storing cooling capacity. For purposes of comparison, the current state-of-the-art backup cooling system relies on the heat of vaporization of liquid nitrogen, which provides approximately 200 joules per gram (J/g) of cooling capacity. The ARCTES system will improve upon this figure by 50%, approaching 300 J/g of cooling capacity. The ARCTES system has the additional advantages of requiring neither LN2 resupply nor a vent to atmosphere for boil-off gas, and of being passively reversible.

In turn, this combination gives a high level of adaptability and puncture proof operation in a variety of terrain while maintaining rolling resistance, ride, handling and other performance characteristics related to conventional pneumatic tires. This technology will eliminate the need for run-flat elastomer insert and provides ballistic capability.    A key to this AEG unique design is the improved wheel and tread design that allows more efficient use of tire sidewall & tread carbonfiber reinforcements.  AEG proposes to further study, optimize and develop this zero-pressure wheel-tire concept to ultimately achieve a rugged zero-pressure wheel-tire system This Phase II will be a follow-on effort from the Phase I feasibility study on SOCOM11-004 entitled Improved Tire Technology for Special Operations Vehicles. This design will be evaluated and optimized based on military standards regarding performance, durability, manufacturability, and weight. AEG will develop and make prototype tires size LT265/65R17 and alternate size of LT245/45R17 with load rating for a minimum vehicle corner weight of 2500 lbs.   AEG will make six (6) run-flat 17inch tires each from both sizes with wheel assemblies for  a 2012 Toyota Hilux pickup truck.",

        "abstract": "The DoD requires an increase in performance and density of solid propellants for use on boost, strategic and tactical missile systems. Attaining ingredients with higher energy and density while simultaneously maintaining satisfactory physical properties is extremely challenging. Current low-cost oxidizer ingredients such as Ammonium Perchlorate (AP) are incapable of imparting the desired performance and insensitivity. Focused efforts are needed to identify, synthesize, and characterize new ingredient oxidizers that can be produced commercially at low-cost while meeting required attributes such as hazard classification, lifetime, cost, and performance. This proposed effort, lead by Nalas Engineering in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Flanagan Research, focuses on synthesis, characterization, and testing of a novel caged nitramine coined Aurora to determine its viability as a propellant ingredient. In addition to the evaluation of Aurora, Nalas proposes revisiting existing oxidizers using cocrystallization technology. Thus Nalas proposes to synthesize and investigate cocrystals in propellant formulations.",

Based on work in Phase I, it was concluded that the design of existing COTS linear-detector arrays was insufficient to achieve a range of 300 m in a profile sensor. It was determined that this limitation in the COTS arrays was due to the size of the pixels and the insufficient thermal isolation of the pixels. The existing linear arrays are designed for spectroscopy rather than imaging. A pyroelectric-detector array that overcomes these limitations was designed in Phase I. A sparse-array configuration that uses fewer pixels than COTS arrays, and thus has lower power consumption, was also designed. In Phase II complete prototype sensors using these designs will be built and tested.",

Their long-range, speed-of-light-attack capability provides unique benefits for area defense, precision attack, and covert strike, but lasers introduce new elements of airspace deconfliction to the battlefield.  HEL systems require a clear line of sight to the target as conventional munitions do.  Even though modern laser weapons can maintain the HEL beam on a specific aimpoint on a moving target, they still require clear airspace beyond the target for safety considerations.      Existing airspace deconfliction approaches lack key features necessary to transition weapons from the test range and onto the battlefield.  These features include: real-time whole-airspace deconfliction, simultaneous multi-target deconfliction, and the ability to consider dynamics and damage thresholds in calculating potential collateral damage.

Our team, Delcross Technologies, LLC and Magus (Pty) Ltd, proposes to expand the capabilities of an existing antenna design tool so that it is capable of producing CAD models and associated configuration information for representative antenna designs. The user provides a set of available antenna specifications to this tool and a prototype is generated and iteratively refined to meet the specifications. A computational electromagnetic (CEM) model containing the antenna prototype is generated by the tool and a full-wave optimizer is used to further refine the model. The final result is a CEM model representing the antenna that is ready for use in installed antenna performance simulations.",

MiTi and its engine company subcontractor will establish simulator designs of two candidate engines representative of near and longer term applications of the advanced bearings to be demonstrated under this program.  The engine subcontractor will establish engine modifications needed for bearing integration.  Under Phase II the full scale high temperature bearings will be tested in a relevant environment including expected loads, speeds, temperatures and pressures.  Testing will also include non-operating and operating vibration environment.  In assessing  both journal and thrust bearing requirements, the limitations of and/or engine modifications needed to make the technology suitable for use in engines will be identified.  MiTi will use high temperature bearing alloys in the candidate bearings for operation at relevant high temperatures and will test possible alternative approaches to meeting the requirements.  After testing in the test rigs with substantially different load/speed characteristics MiTi will assess the range of scalability possible with the advanced bearing designs.  Finally, an updated transition plan for engine integration and testing will be provided, including engine modifications needed to integrate the bearing technology.  BENEFIT:  This effort will directly support the US Air Force initiative for propulsion systems and components to enhance advanced gas turbine engine performance normalized to cost specifically directed at advanced cruise missile engines.  Research performed during this SBIR will result in new design capabilities and methodologies for wide ranging applications such as Integrated Power Units (IPU), gas turbine engines for use in UAVs, missiles, drones and both General and Regional Aviation aircraft.  Key markets for the foreseeable future that will be served by foil bearings will include energy and environmental areas, including turbine powered generators as well as waste heat recovery systems and compressors for transportation and delivery of natural or/or hydrogen gas.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The United States is increasingly reliant on space-based technologies for surveillance, communications, and navigation. However, our satellites face significant threats from failures, space weather, and orbital debris and must become more survivable. A key component to more survivable satellite systems is on-board autonomy. However, autonomy faces challenges in trust from satellite operators. This proposal addresses this issue by developing an operator interface for autonomy software. This interface allows operators to interact with and understand the autonomous satellite system. Our system, called I-HAMMER, interacts with components including the Mission Planner, Threat Response Planner, and Executive. Each component has different responsibilities in the autonomy architecture and each interface is customized for those responsibilities.  BENEFIT:  Trusted autonomy will result in satellite systems that are more robust, responsive, and cheaper to operate. This will increase their usefulness to the warfighter and analyst while reducing their operations cost. A modular and extensible operator interface will increase the useability of satellite autonomy software. This will dramatically improve the economics, effectiveness and survivability of military satellites. Commercial applications of autonomy software include unmanned vehicles, oil exploration and production rigs, and NASA space missions.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Dual-mode scramjet engines must operate over a wide range of flight Mach numbers.  Closed-loop engine control is necessary to maintain thrust and flame stability while preventing unstart over the large flight envelope.  High-frequency sensors and actuators will be a key component of future scramjet Full Authority Digital Engine Controllers (FADECs) due to the short time scales associated with these engines.  These sensors and actuators must be rugged, simple, lightweight, low power, and minimally intrusive.  Creare and its partners propose to develop passive optical combustion sensors for closed-loop control of scramjet engines.  These sensors are high frequency and rugged, and they will be easy to integrate with flight engines.  In Phase I, we demonstrated the ability of these sensors to provide useful data for engine control and combustor R &amp; D.  In Phase II, we will optimize the sensors for scramjet conditions, apply them to high fidelity combustors, and determine how to use the signals for closed-loop engine control.  BENEFIT:  Technology derived from this program will be in the form of high-frequency passive optical sensors optimized for scramjet conditions and methods for using them in closed-loop engine control schemes.  These sensors and control schemes will enable optimal performance of scramjet engines over a larger flight envelope.  This sensor technology could also be used for combustion control in augmentors to enhance flame stability or industrial furnaces to reduce harmful emissions.",

Although the prototype USV has proven its utility during initial test and evaluation, several key technological hurdles remain. Increasing the top speed and extending the endurance through efficiency improvements would greatly improve this X-class USVs utility in the littoral battlespace. Such a vehicle could provide tireless autonomous forward scout capability for intelligence gathering operations in high-risk shallow water environments, among many other missions. Work done by PMS-406 has established the foundation of the X-class USV, and subsequent efforts funded through this SBIR opportunity will serve to increase its operational envelope by addressing the technological hurdles. The competing requirements of this vehicle necessitate innovative concepts to meet the performance goals. SeaLandAire in conjunction with Maritime Research Associates will optimize both the energy storage and power delivery approach to provide an efficient propulsion system thus increasing the top speed and extending its endurance.",

        "abstract": "On todays battlefields, vehicles are at risk of encountering improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Fortunately, not all of these result in complete vehicle loss. Following events at both ends of the severity spectrum, Battle Damage Assessment and Repair (BDAR) and event reconstruction efforts lack the fidelity that predictive simulations have begun to offer. Sending a vehicle back to the depot for overhaul when it could have stayed in operation, wastes precious resources. Conversely, leaving a damaged vehicle in operation without some level of confidence that it can withstand a second blast places a higher risk on the soldier. As such, the Marine Corps needs more reliable and informed methods to gauge post-IED hull damage. Leveraging expertise in ballistic armor damage and structural response, Corvid Technologies proposes the evolution and commercialization of an approach that virtually recreates events in order to fill in the information gaps and answer the what if questions regarding BDAR. In Phase II, Corvid will validate Phase I results on the test range, examine repair techniques, and field test virtual event reconstruction for BDAR applications. Corvid expects to have additional BDAR support services and analysis tools that are TRL 7 or greater by the end of Phase II.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Thermal barrier coatings (TBC) are currently employed to protect gas turbine engine components. Thermally exposed TBC systems have been observed to be affected by moisture. This spallation mechanism, Moisture Induced Delayed Spallation (MIDS), occurs at room temperature while the coatings are not exposed to the thermal-mechanical inputs that typically drive TBC failure. Future TBC systems will benefit from improved TBC reliability which can be achieved by development of an advanced high temperature protective coating system designed to improve, among other characteristics, the durability of coating in the presence of moisture. In Phase I, DVTI demonstrated TBC systems which included modification of the TBC elastic modulus, incorporation of an advanced TBC bond coat having an improved CTE mismatch between the bond coat and the TGO, reduced TGO growth rates and also modifications to TBC top coats which potentially limit access of moisture into the bond coat. In Phase II, based on positive effects shown in Phase I, these enhanced coating properties will be more fully developed into an advanced TBC system which will then be systematically varied to create an analytical model which explores the effects of these elements on the reliability of TBC systems subject to moisture exposure.  BENEFIT:  This research is anticipated to result in thermal barrier coating systems with enhanced resistance to hydration induced coating failure and thus improved reliability. Development of advanced TBC coating systems using DVD processing techniques will not only enable new TBC coating systems that will meet the needs of current and future engines used in military aircraft, it will also enable low cost deposition of these coatings.  The DVD deposition technique enables coatings not previously possible with existing processing approaches. DVD coaters can be small with low capital costs and tailorable volumes so that small volumes of parts can still be coated at low cost. The high deposition rates of DVD and the soft vacuum required (with quick pump down times) can provide nearly assembly line like part coating. These features also facilitate quick and easy repair options at repair depots. It is also envisioned that a single piece of equipment could be used to deposit the entire TBC system (both bond coat and top coat) in a single step. DVD&quot;s compositional and morphological flexibility also enables other advanced TBC systems and other functional coating such as those for erosion protection, hot corrosion resistance and environmental barrier coatings.",

This process is both cumbersome and prone to error. The objective of this proposal is to provide a complete paradigm for application development and deployment as well as offer device agnostic and rendering environment agnostic Open Source APIs. This approach allows multiple organizations to contribute their best of breed features to a common geospatial environment that will save time and cost of transitions. The Phase I efforts were focused on research and development of a common Visualization Framework that may be used to assemble customizable tactical display applications from tactical feature modules that are re-usable across programs.

During the Phase I effort, work was focused on documenting workflows for the CTP, identifying the information needed at the decisions points and how this information will be carried.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The cleaning of aircraft maintenance facilities requires a detergent to remove soils including hydraulic fluids, fuels, oil and grease.  The wastewater must be treated to remove toxic heavy metals (particularly chromium and cadmium) before it is discharged to a municipal wastewater treatment facility.  Unfortunately, current detergents interfere with the standard methods to remove heavy metals by precipitation, leading to environmental problems and costly procedures to remain in compliance.   In the Phase I project, TDA Research, Inc., (TDA) identified a new detergent formulation that cleans effectively and does not interfere with the processes that remove heavy metals.  The new material is cost effective and environmentally friendly.  During the Phase II effort, TDA will optimize the detergent formulation, documenting its performance for current applications and expanding the range of Air Force needs that it can address.  The Phase II effort has five technical components: optimize the cleaning formulation, qualify the product for widespread use at Hill AFB, implement its use across the base, identify additional uses and document compliance with OSHA expanded standards.  TDA has a simple, robust commercialization plan in place, and the new product will be available to Air Force customers before the end of the Phase II project.  BENEFIT:  TDA has previously developed detergent products that are effective for routine aircraft cleaning as well as the decontamination of chemical and biological warfare agents.  The same technology provides an excellent multipurpose product for facilities cleaning.  Phase II will lead to an additional product for facilities cleaning that provides improved safety and environmental compliance.  Additional benefits of this qualified multiuse product to the Government include simplified ordering, reduced stocking costs, simplified logistical demands, reduced inventory and lower costs through economies of scale.  Because cleaning products like this are used in large quantities, the savings can rapidly repay the cost of Phase II development.",

The CLRF needs an all-light-level day-and-night visible to Short-Wave-Infrared (SWIR) imager for simultaneously detecting the visible and infrared target/scene and tracking infrared laser energy on the target. Of particular importance is night vision capability for CLRF operation under low-light-level conditions such as overcast starlight.   Building upon proven nano-technologies, the proposed Photon Counting Integrated Circuit (PCIC) Hyper-Spectral Night-Vision Camera offers: (1) Hyper-spectral imaging from visible to SWIR; (2) Low-light-level photon-counting imaging with night vision sensitivity; (3) Day-and-night all-light-level imaging with glare control using automatic gain control (AGC); and (4) Resolution of 1,024 x 1,024 pixels delivering 0.12 mRad resolution over 120 mRad field of view.  During Phase I, we have demonstrated a 2-dimensional PCIC array with highest pixel sensitivity, hyper-spectral response, and saturation control for all-light-level day-and-night imaging in CLRFs. In Phase II, we will optimize the PCIC focal plane array (FPA) to full specifications, integrate the PCIC FPA with readout integrated circuit (ROIC), and prototype day-and-night all-weather photon-counting PCIC imagers for CLRF systems.

        "abstract": "Compact, efficient, mega-watt power level lasers are being developed by the MDA for the mission of destroying targets over a range of many hundreds of kilometers.  A candidate laser technology with the promise of meeting this mission goal is based on alkali gas that is optically pumped by multiple, electrically driven diode lasers.  One current problem limiting the potential operational lifetime of these Diode Pumped Alkali Lasers, or DPALs is that the windows of the cell containing the alkali vapor, become fouled with deposits or fogged by damage from chemical reactions with the gas, reactions that increase as the laser optical power is scaled up.  In addition, DPALs cannot operate efficiently in the presence of laser cavity losses such as reflections from the gas cell windows, and therefore some form of anti-reflection (AR) treatment must be applied.  Conventional thin-film material coatings designed to suppress reflections are typically less resistant to chemical attack from alkali compounds than the cell window material, and thin-film AR coatings suffer optical damage at laser power levels well below the mission requirements. A roadblock to major increases in the power output and reliability of DPALs can be removed by development of a more robust AR treatment for the windows of the gas cell.  The innovative solution proposed is to eliminate thin-film coatings completely, creating the critical AR function by fabricating microstructures directly in sapphire windows that have been shown to be naturally resistant to alkali chemical attack.  AR microstructures (ARMs) etched in sapphire windows have exhibited higher transmission and pulsed laser damage thresholds 2-5 times higher than thin-film AR coatings.  This Phase I project proposes to demonstrate high transparency ARMs textures built in sapphire and other chemically resistant window materials suitable for DPAL vapor cells.  Multiple ARMs design variants will be fabricated in sapphire coupons and subjected to standardized pulsed laser damage testing and alkali vapor exposure testing using the flowing DPAL system at Kirtland AFB.  Additional ARMs treated vapor cell windows will be delivered to the Government for further evaluation.  As part of a Phase I Option, a design for a microstructure-based, all sapphire output coupler will be investigated and prototyped as a means for eliminating other DPAL cavity thin-film coatings. Potential DPAL manufacturers such as General Atomics, Northrup Grumman, and Boeing will be engaged to enable the new robust AR treatment to be integrated into MDA test platforms during Phase II and Phase III commercialization projects.",

The GPS-SP is a self-contained military Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) module. It securely communicates with the Android operating system platform, which is planned for use in the new US Army Handheld Computing Environment (Handheld CE) End User Device (EUD). This decouples the GPS receiver from the handset, allowing each technology to evolve separately, while still ensuring standards-based data-centric interoperability between them. The result will be a more open architecture approach, enabling flexibility, innovation, and cost-savings over the current DAGR-centric military GPS paradigm. In addition, the GPS-SP is versatile enough to allow secure connections to other sensors, and will have a natural migration path to future M-Code receivers. Because of our previous experience integrating SAASM PPS P(Y) GPS receivers -- along with prior work on Android and other embedded/real-time operating systems -- we are confident that we can accomplish this ambitious challenge.

        "abstract": "With increasingly tighter budgets, reuse of software and hardware in DoD programs has become essential for delivering capabilities to warfighters. The current military aviation community procurement system does not promote the process of software and hardware reuse across different programs. In addition, the current aviation development community has not created sufficient standards to facilitate the reuse of software components across the military aviation fleet. To counter these trends, NAVAIR has developed FACE; designed to address the affordability initiatives of todays military aviation community. This is where DEXTER steps in, as a set of tools that enables software interoperability by allowing users to visually build a communications bridge between applications that normally have no means of exchanging data. Development of plugins that incorporate FACE interfaces and plugins for currently unsupported communications mechanisms within the FACE would allow a variety of legacy and untapped software components to be reused with little to no effort in updating them to the FACE standards. This capability not only enables users to ensure data is routed correctly but also gives the user a very powerful debug and risk reduction tool. DEXTER can remove the need to redesign, rewrite, and retest software when integrating components and systems.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  With shrinking facility budgets and increasingly stringent environmental regulations, United States Department of Defense (DoD) weapon system maintenance facilities are faced with the difficult challenge of maintaining regulatory compliance with limited resources.  Moreover, the growing diversity in DoD workloads as well as the increased use of low volatile organic compound industrial cleaners has increased the presence of chelating substances found in industrial wastes and wastewaters. During industrial wastewater treatment, these chelating substances form highly stable complexes with heavy metals thus inhibiting them from being effectively removed from solution.    Recently, a new sulfur-based redox industrial wastewater treatment method has been developed that has the potential to consistently meet water quality compliance standards for regulated heavy metals in the presence of chelating substances.  The new sulfur-based redox chemistry method utilizes a proprietary chemical mixture (Compliance MX), which is added to industrial wastewater under controlled pH and oxidation-reduction conditions. The chemical mixture, which is applied to negate the effects of chelation, results in the rapid destabilization of heavy metal ions leading to the subsequent formation of metal precipitates that are easily removed through sedimentation.    BENEFIT:  Beyond having the capability of treating electroplating and metal finishing wastewaters in the presence of chelating substances, the sulfur-based redox chemistry method provides a number of other potential benefits to both DoD weapon system maintenance facilities as well as private industry including; 1) elimination of the need to employ the acidic reduction process for hexavalent chromium removal, 2) elimination of the need for chlorine and/or other chemical oxidants for treating chelating substances, 3) significant improvements to the occupational health and safety environment for facility employees, 4) lower compliance and regulatory risks to the wastewater treatment facility, 5) significant financial savings with regard to reducing hazardous waste disposal costs and 6) elimination of capital improvement expenditures required to achieve industrial waste source segregation.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Currently, there is no certified, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)-based solution for cross-domain voice and video.  More specifically, combatant commands and other agencies have requirements to enable users across different security networks to initiate and receive direct cross-domain audio and videophone calls, and to participate in audio conference calls.  To address this need, Trident has developed the Voice and Video Cross Domain Solution (V2 CDS), which is a system that enables secure voice and video communications between differently classified networks.   This initial V2 CDS system has been developed under previous SBIR funding.   V2 CDS is currently at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5.  A TRL 9 Initial Operational Capability (IOC) is required at the EUCOM site in Stuttgart, Germany to interconnect their Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) and US Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation Systems (BICES) networks.  Under this proposed effort, Trident will design and implement requisite security controls, additional functional requirements (VoSIP, multiple LDAP servers), as well as implement changes to ensure interoperability with currently deployed infrastructure.  Trident will also address findings identified during Security Design Review (SDR) and Technical Exchange Meetings, as well as findings identified during testing.     BENEFIT:  The anticipated benefits of this proposed work includes the development of a certifiable solution for secure, cross-domain voice and video calls based on industry standard protocols.  V2 CDS provides a new capability and will benefit the warfighter by significantly improving mission effectiveness and reducing the cost of redundant equipment used for different classified networks.",

In addition, an algorithm framework was developed using field data and simulated data. In the Phase II effort, the conceptual design will be implemented to generate a full system design. The assembled system prototype will be evaluated through field testing and refined based on the Army&quot;s evaluation and feedback. By the end of the Phase II program PSI will develop and validate a TRL 5 prototype system capable of on-the-move (~10 mph) detection of contaminant particles with surface density of 0.5 g/cm2 with Pd&gt;90%.",

        "abstract": "In modern electronic warfare, network-centric tracking systems must be able to identify and track multiple objects within hostile, jamming environments, and then coordinate forces to take action. To meet this challenge, Numerica proposes to use Multiple Frame Assignment (MFA) and Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (MHT) methods to develop a state-of-the-art distributed tracking system that handles passive angle measurements in a network-centric context. Numerica will leverage geometric diversity, coverage area and complementary sensor information to significantly improve the track picture in the presence of advanced counter-measures. New track initiation schemes promise to address ghosting, advanced fusion and filtering algorithms offer reliable track maintenance, and alternative architectures provide superior performance in angle-only scenarios. Numerica is developing new algorithms that simultaneously assimilate low- and high-dimensional measurements in a passive tracking scenario. The algorithms combine low-dimensional and other types of degraded measurements from compromised sensors to generate a high-dimensional track picture. Numerica will develop an approach for the insertion of these algorithms into the Army IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) Track Manager, providing a seamless, enhanced solution for the warfighter.",

        "abstract": "Arrays of vector velocity sensors provide major system gains over legacy arrays of omnidirectional hydrophones in bottom moored and submarine/unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV) towed applications. For example, the left-right ambiguity of legacy devices is eliminated and an array sensitivity null can be steered at a noisy source of interference making much quieter targets detectable. The exceptionally sensitive, compact accelerometers made possible by the new relaxor piezocrystals are the key enabler for this performance enhancement. Since these sensors are only millimeters in size and are required in large numbers, a major technical hurdle for this technology is to devise cost-effective ways to manufacture the vector sensor. A cost model, relating the component and touch labor costs, is needed for the various design options. Once the dominant cost drivers have been identified, approaches to reducing costs, either through reducing component or labor costs, are essential if the Navy is to benefit from the new technology.",

With the innovation in dual-wavelength energy delivery to a desired location, the RESLIFE precisely and independently controls the light and acoustic effects of the detonation while providing substantially stronger visual and auditory deterrent compared to current LIPD systems. As a result, this system offers a strong deterrent comparable to existing flashbang systems and also gives the opportunity to deliver audible messages using eye-safe wavelengths, which directly address the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program requirements for nonlethal effects without permanent retinal damage to human targets. In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of RESLIFE through analytical modeling of the system and a bench top demonstration of a laser system for laser-induced plasma detonation.

Through system scalability based on varying in-theater priorities, the variable VCI system capabilities and fidelity are adaptable on a component level, for maximum value and reduced logistics.  Phase II will build on this foundation in order to fully develop, prototype, validate, and commercially implement the technology developed in Phase I. In addition, technologies that may compliment the variable VCI solution (such as those that would improve overall dynamic system response time) will be investigated.

Of particular interest to the Navy is the potential use of ultrafast lasers for aircraft self-defense applications. One key component in the generation of laser pulses with sub-picosecond durations is the optical compressor. Compression systems used in commercially available ultrashort pulse lasers are typically bulky as they are an array of mirrors that form a path length of up to several meters. In this Phase II SBIR, Raydiance proposes to enhance a proven alternative technology known as a Chirped Bragg Grating such that they will compress 3 ns pulses down to 500 fs. In addition to a greatly reduced package size (where the beam path is just several centimeters), these devices have the benefit of stability as the beam path is largely through a solid state device. Key tasks in the base and option phases will demonstrate progressively capable gratings. In addition, architectures will be designed, built and environmentally tested to ultimately provide as a deliverable a proven, ruggedized compressor module that will greatly improve the USP lasers SWaP characteristics.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project addresses a critical national need for more expansive and hands-on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education by developing a mechatronic and robotics construction kit for teaching and learning engineering design synthesis. The research objective is to develop a teaching tool to interest young learners in engineering design, encourage and engage them in engineering practices specifically, creating appealing technology through exploring STEM topics that meets or exceeds national standards. The goal is to engage young people regardless of prior technical experience or STEM exposure in designing mechatronics and robotics systems, and through this to gain interest, experience, and confidence in engineering design synthesis. The work comprises developing construction kit hardware, a software environment for children to program their mechatronic constructions, and materials for using the kit to teach and learn STEM topics and engineering design. As the hardware advances, the project will develop software and learning resources that scaffold the construction kit with educational materials. It aims to support teachers and other educators incorporating the mechatronics kit into classroom and out-of-school learning, addressing national STEM standards while advancing research on how children learn complex design concepts and how educators can best support this progression. The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase II project is in engendering in young learners innovation, design, and creative problem solving among the most important skills for tomorrow&#039;s workforce. These skills are addressed within STEM disciplines, however, too often the use of technology in education is limited to skill based computer operations, and engineering is neglected altogether. The teaching and learning tool and its ensemble of software and learning resources truly integrates every letter in the STEM acronym, while inviting students who have no background in robotics, engineering, design, technology, or computer programming to begin creating immediately. This leverages their creativity as motivation to continue learning in these fields. Precisely because kit removes the need for advanced fabrication skills or programming knowledge, this kit and its accompanying activities will promote broader inclusion of students who may have traditionally felt intimidated from more complex STEM engagement. As more students succeed with the kit and its ensemble of learning activities, this enhances a future workforce, an informed citizenry, as well as supporting teachers and educators to explore what all students can achieve when given motivating and confidence building STEM activities.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Environmental protection coatings are required to provide oxidation and hot corrosion protection to hot section turbine components.  Unfortunately, the current generation of such coatings can degrade the fatigue resistance of the coated alloy. It is increasingly recognized that, due to the detrimental effect of the coating on low cycle fatigue (LCF) performance, the LCF life of a coated superalloy, not the stress/creep rupture strength, limit the design of a turbine component. As a result, the development of a new generation of environmental coatings optimized to not only provide oxidation and corrosion resistance, but also to limit any detriment to the fatigue performance of the alloy would greatly improve the current state-of-the-art.  Thus, a strong need exists to develop novel environmentally protective coatings that are also relatively ductile and strong, as well as coating deposition processes that provide defect-free and dense microstructures. In this work, advanced environmental coating compositions having high strength and toughness will be developed and applied onto engine components using an advanced vapor deposition approach. Additionally, the use of thermodynamic modeling approaches will be used to enable the coating compositions to be chemical activity matched to minimize inter-diffusion with the underlying substrate and retain performance during service.  BENEFIT:  The development of a strong, fatigue resistant, environmental coating that matches the temperature capabilities of third- and fourth-generation Ni-base alloys will allow reduced cooling flow in airfoil designs providing improved overall engine efficiency/higher thrust designs and hence, reduced specific fuel consumption (SFC). It will also provide improved component durability. Payoffs with a 50\u00b0F temperature capability increase as sought in this program are considered to be highly significant by the gas turbine engine companies. Such an increase has been historically been achieved only after 10 to 15 years of extensive development effort in both design and material technologies. Several government and industry funded programs are aimed at developing turbines within the next ten years that will operate at firing temperatures about ~300\u00b0F higher than the current generation of high-performance gas turbines. Such temperature requirements can be significantly aided by reducing to fatigue debit of the current environmental protection coatings to enable the current generation of nickel-based superalloys to be used to their full capability. This will lead to turbine engine performance benefits in future gas turbine engines resulting in very significant SFC reductions. Civilian transportation and power generation sectors will be aided as well as air and sea based military vehicles.",

        "abstract": "Effective communications and data sharing between the platforms in a Carrier Strike Group (CSG) are critical for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), force protection, and situational awareness. The data links to convey this information must have low latency and high reliability. An effective communications architecture should employ multiple paths for critical ASW data to mitigate against limitations in any one communications system. Many platforms employ one or more radar systems that could be leveraged for this purpose. Utilizing an existing radar for communications could lead to lower lifecycle cost since much of the hardware can be reused or shared. Also, with ship space at a premium, in many cases adding another antenna specifically for a communications system simply may not be feasible. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) effort focuses on the development of a low-cost, real-time network for sharing the ASW Common Tactical Picture (CTP) using a high-power, high-bandwidth radar with excess duty cycle as a broadcast transmitter and a low-cost digital receiver system that can be installed on receiving platforms. The transmitting radar propagates ASW CTP elements automatically to other platforms for prosecution.",

        "abstract": "A holistic system approach is developed for wideband spectrum recognition and management for dynamically adapting the EW system to operate in the presence of large narrow- and wide-band interference. At RF, strong interference is suppressed below the LNA and AD saturation limits. Adaptive attenuation and bandwidth channelization for precision analysis maximize SNR and measurement quality. Post AD interference detection and characterization functions (previous NAVSEA SBIR), measure and report BOTH signal and interference, maintaining high POI in the presence of interference when time and frequency overlaps occur. Strong signal front end RF detectors monitor interference levels for indications and warnings and support emitter de-interleaving and ID. When available, knowledge of own-ship interferers (radar and SATCOM) is employed. The approach does not rely on a particular wideband technology, but rather on reconfigurable processing to enhance system performance.  In Phase I, RAS modeled key ARFSM functions in the wideband EW system architecture. Processing functions were described, and end-to-end performance estimates provided showing the efficacy of the approach. On Phase II, RAS will develop and demonstrate an ARFSM EDM using RF, FPGA, CPU and/or GPGPU processing elements, interface protocols, framework and concepts in the Navy Next Generation EW System architecture planned for BLQ-10 (IV/V).",

Resulting Q-switches will not only perform better, but will be less costly because they can be batch fabricated on silicon wafers.  In Phase I, MTI focused on achieving a thorough understanding of overall requirements and trade-offs for an&quot;eye-safe&quot;1535nm Er:glass laser which must provide on-demand pulse firing. A prototype Q-switch with a fully functioning dielectric-coated mirror device and a USB Controller hardware and software was completed and delivered for tests.

        "abstract": "The innovations in engine and drivetrain lubricants are mainly driven by ever more stringent regulations, which demand better fuel economy, lower carbon emission, and less pollution. Many technologies are being developed for the next generations of vehicles to achieve these goals. Even if these technologies can be adopted, there still is a significant need for a \u201cdrop-in\u201d lubricant solution for the existing ground vehicle fleet to reap immediate fuel savings at the same time reduce the pollution. In recent studies, including the Phase I of this proposal and other related projects carried out by Pixelligent, metal-oxide nanocrystal additives have demonstrated results that significantly improved both friction and wear. Dramatic CoF and wear reductions were observed when Pixelligent\u2019s proprietary, mono-dispersed, and highly scalable metal oxide nanocrystals were added to the base oils. The dispersions in base and formulated oils are clear and without any change of appearance and viscosity. However, the benefits provided by the nanocrystals were limited to the base oils due the interference of exiting additives in the fully formulated oils.  Developing a prototype formulation including the nanocrystals that can demonstrate the same improvements observed in the base oils is a critical step toward the commercialization of these advanced nano-additives. A \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach will be adopted to develop a prototype lubricant formulation to avoid the complicated interactions with the multitude of additives, only minimal numbers of most essential additives will be added, step by step, into the formulation, to ensure that they are compatible with the nanocrystals and do not compromise their tribological performance. Tribological performance will be characterized to come up with the best formulations that can demonstrate the commercial potential of the nano-additives.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits If the Phase II Project is successful, through a combination of continued government support and a joint development agreement (JDA) with a major formulator, a fully formulated drop-in advanced lubricant package for the existing ground vehicle fleet will be developed and commercialized. The major potential benefit to the public would be the much improved fuel economy, up to 3.1% as estimated, if adopted by the existing ground vehicle fleet. The nanocrystal additives also provide an alternative to the sulfur and phosphor containing additives to reduce the pollutants in the emissions. The nano-additives can also find specialty applications where no proper additives have been found and improve the efficiency of machinery operating at extreme conditions. The growth of Pixelligent will also revitalize the local infrastructure create high quality jobs in the local economy. \n\n",

        "abstract": "To meet the environmental regulations mandated by governments world-wide, the diesel vehicle industry requires improved NOX sensors capable of quantifying total NOX (NO and NO2) at low ppm levels. Furthermore, regulations dictate a sharp decline in NOX emissions from both mobile and stationary sources, impacting a wide range of applications, including heavy duty diesel trucks and passenger cars. Currently, only one sensor is commercially available, and it lacks the low concentration accuracy and fast response time to meet these growing needs.  NexTech Materials has developed a new NOX sensing technology that leverages a unique electro-catalytic effect to rapidly and selectively measure NOX in diesel exhaust streams at concentrations as low as 1 ppm and with response time less than 200 milliseconds.  Additionally, NexTech has demonstrated the potential for tuning its sensor to also detect ammonia emissions, enabling quantification of both NOX and ammonia in a single sensor device. In the Phase I project, NexTech improved the response magnitude, long- term stability, and dual ammonia sensing capability of its baseline sensor through materials formulation and sensor design modifications. A prototype package and controller was designed and fabricated to support product demonstrations which generated tremendous interest among diesel vehicle manufacturers and Tier-1 automotive suppliers.  In Phase II, NexTech will build upon the core technology improvements developed in Phase I, focusing on further improving ppm-level NOX sensitivity, dual NOX and ammonia sensing, and long-term stability. Guided by input from target OEM customers, the dual NOX/NH3 sensors will be evaluated under a comprehensive set of test conditions and fully packaged prototype sensors will be provided to customers for engine evaluation.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits Successful completion of this project will result in a sensor with improved performance and lower cost than commercially available NOX sensors, enabling lower emissions and improved competitive pricing to vehicle manufacturers.  Additionally, the low ppm accuracy will have applicability in off-road and industrial applications, which are becoming increasingly regulated.  The dual ammonia sensing capability offers  further  benefit  in  exhaust  systems  employing  selective  catalytic  reduction  (SCR)  abatement systems, in which ammonia slip into the exhaust stream is a common issue.  Accurate quantification of both NOX and ammonia will allow exhaust system developers to operate SCR systems more effectively, enabling significantly reduced NOX emissions over traditional approaches.",

        "abstract": "The United States economy and the American way of life rely heavily on transportation by cars and trucks. This transportation  is  dependent  almost  entirely  on  oil,  which  creates  vulnerability  to  supply  chain  disruptions, potential for fuel price shocks, and exposure to emission of air pollutants. Reducing vehicular fuel consumption is critical for sustaining United States economic and environmental well-being. Under this program, the Department of Energy is supporting the development of innovative engine-boosting technologies that will provide these fuel- saving benefits for both passenger cars and commercial trucks. A hybrid-electric turbocharger that incorporates an integrated motor/alternator onto the turbocharger shaft is being developed that is capable of generating electrical power at high speed/load conditions or during deceleration, improving transient response (turbo lag), and broadening the effective range of the turbocharged engine. The overall objective is to demonstrate a functional prototype and production-level design at the conclusion of Phase II that exceeds Department of Energy targets for fuel economy, operating range, and cost. A hybrid-electric turbocharger design was completed during the Phase I effort. This effort included design and analysis of an 11 kW integrated motor/alternator capable of the required torque assistance to the turbocharger for transient lag reduction. A complete housing for the motor/alternator was designed, computationally optimized, fabricated, and experimentally tested during the Phase I effort as well. Detailed engine/vehicle simulations showed that a commercial truck equipped with the hybrid-electric turbocharger met the Department of Energy goals for fuel economy improvement and operating range expansion. During the Phase II effort, the Phase I design effort will be built upon by fabricating the motor/alternator and assembling the hybrid-electric turbocharger. A power electronics system for controlling the turbocharger will be developed, and the completed prototype will be tested on an engine. A control strategy to optimize fuel consumption, control emissions, and improve drivability will be investigated. The design will also be optimized for production-level manufacturing methods.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits The market for automotive turbochargers is large and growing; the global market size was approximately $1.9B in 2010 and is expected to grow to $2.9B by 2015. Taking advantage of the trend toward downsized turbocharged engines, a next-generation turbocharger with unparalleled benefits to the consumer in terms of both fuel economy and driving experience will be provided.",

The success of Li-ion batteries (LiBs) in such markets strongly depends on the cost, energy density, power capability, cycle life, and safety of the battery cells, which are largely dominated by the electrode materials used. While LiB technologies have advanced significantly, the DOE EV Everywhere program EV cell target of 400 Wh/kg with 1000 cycles, at cost of ownership comparable to conventional ICE vehicles cannot be met with current LiB chemistries, especially with graphite as the anode due to its low capacity.

Silicon is considered as the most promising anode material due to its high capacity and proper working voltage. XGS proposes to develop a high performance Silicon (Si)/graphene composite anode via a low cost process to enable EV and HEV LiB applications. With a combination of a composite Si/graphene anode structure design, LiB electrode engineering with grapheme nanoplatelets, and a proven low-cost material manufacturing process, XGS is well positioned to mass produce and sell this material in large volume once the technical barriers in battery performance are overcome.

New low temperature catalyst materials are needed for exhaust after-treatment systems that can meet the increasingly stringent emission regulations. TDA Research proposes to develop a new catalyst that will reduce nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and carbon monoxide from diesel engine exhaust.  The catalyst bed operates under the lean operating conditions of diesel engine exhaust at all times, providing a one-step solution that eliminates a wide range of air pollutants.   The high activity of the catalyst also assures effective VOC abatement during cold starts. In Phase I, TDA developed a new catalyst for NOx and VOC removal. We showed the catalyst activity and contaminant removal efficiency under representative conditions.  We also demonstrated the catalyst life through a 540 hr test without observing any signs of degradation in performance. The VOC oxidation capability of the catalyst was demonstrated across a wide range of contaminants ranging from CO, to olefins (e.g. ethylene) and alkanes (e.g. methane, propane). In a preliminary engineering analysis, we also showed the economic viability of the exhaust treatment system including the new catalyst. During Phase II we will continue to improve the performance of our catalyst by optimizing its chemical composition and mechanical integrity.  We will scale-up its production using commercial manufacturing techniques.  We will demonstrate the effective catalyst operation integrated with a small diesel engine (passenger car engine) using actual exhaust gas.

Sim MD provides ready access to valuable data without risk of technical, methodological or political challenges.  At the core of Sim MD is the training capabilities assessment tool (TCAT) through which warfighters and subject matter experts (SMEs) provide subjective ratings of a simulators training capabilities targeting specific Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) events and Mission Essential Competency (MEC) experiences. TCAT also captures valuable diagnostic information about the deficiencies of the simulator (and/or its supporting components) that hinder training capabilities. The resulting data can be examined in various interactive reports that readily facilitate certification decisions about the use of the simulator for training.   Sim MDs reports are enhanced by complementary data (when available) such as simulator usage data, objective performance data and mission-level ratings of realism and proficiency. Sim MD automates much of the data collection and makes data readily accessible to decision-makers. Sim MD puts information directly into the hands of practitioners who make decisions about simulator certification and needed engineering modifications to maximize return on investment in order create an efficient and effective training environment.  BENEFIT:  The outcome of the Phase II effort will be robust, comprehensive Sim MD prototype, a multi-dimensional simulation certification system to easily assess the training capabilities of LVC or DMO combat mission training and rehearsal systems.  The ultimate Phase II solution will provide the following innovative capabilities:   Automated collection of training capability and diagnostic deficiency data via a secure, web-based training capability assessment tool (TCAT). TCAT will be ready to administer surveys for the A-10, F-16, F-22, F-15C, F-15E, and B-1 platforms.   Automated collection of mission frequency and objective mission and event profile information documenting simulator usage (Profiler). The Profiler will be installed at a representative site for each of the targeted platforms (A-10, F-16, F-22, F-15C, F-15E, and B-1).   Incorporation of data from other sources when available, e.g., Profiler, PETS, or STAT.   Generation of unclassified reports (based primarily on TCAT data and incorporating STAT data if available) from any location using web-based reporting functions.   Generation of classified reports from a centralized classified location where unclassified and classified data have been merged.   Future exchange of data with other sources (e.g., LMS components).  Sim MD, with its vast, multi-dimensional dataset, will provide unprecedented research power for the US Air Force. Sim MD will enable a large variety of operational field studies, including objective studies of the effects of trade-offs with changes in simulator and live-fly training hours, studies of the optimal mix for LVC training, skill retention studies, transfer of training studies, return on technology investment studies, training effectiveness studies, etc.  These possibilities are all in addition to the primary benefit of being able to certify a simulation for various training tasks, diagnose the deficiencies, and prioritize recommended upgrades to improve training.  Sim MD can provide valuable data that can help to address congressional-level, national budgetary issues facing the entire US military, as all services are facing the same challenges of reducing live training and certifying simulators.",

Game-based training can provide a powerful, personalized approach to addressing individual training needs, but without accessible development tools, game updates can remain costly. To harness the full power of game-based training for maintenance proficiency, we propose to develop Maintenance Training based on an Adaptive Game-Based Environment using a Pedagogic Interpretation Engine (MAGPIE). Based on our successful Phase I, we propose a full-scope Phase II development effort focused on four elements: (1) a suite of intuitive authoring tools that enable course designers to construct scenarios, performance metrics, and game configurations for training; (2) instruction tools that cognitively merge observation, tracking, and training tasks for instructors to manage training exercises; (3) a realistic and extensible game engine that adapts COTS products to provide immersive gameplay for trainees with realistic aircraft models that address maintenance training objectives; and (4) an integration framework that seamlessly merges authored training content with both the game engine and the instruction tool.  BENEFIT:  We will transition the MAGPIE technology to courses at Sheppard AFB, providing instructors with a C-130H and C-130J trainer that can augment their current classroom-based training mechanisms. MAGPIE will also benefit Government agencies that train personnel using computer-controlled immersive scenarios (e.g., air traffic controllers, emergency responders, medical teams) by pursuing licensing arrangements with producers of similar or existing training systems for those domains.

With similar energy density and better aging effects than nanoaluminum, silicon is an excellent candidate for use a metal nanofuel. In Phase I, Systems and Materials Research Corporation (SMRC) demonstrated a scalable method for production of nanosized silicon. By the end of Phase I, we have demonstrated that a 5kg/day production rate at a cost of $177/kg is possible. By the end of Phase II, SMRC will have demonstrated a continuous flow process that generates >99% pure silicon with a narrow size distribution around 85nm. The as-produced materials will be passivated and be transported as micron sized powders with no hard agglomerates. SMRC will also demonstrate a path to large scale production at a cost nearing $50/kg. We will first commercialize nanosilicon as a propellant additive and green pyrotechnic materials with the help of our scale-up partners ATK and Esterline. As the purity of these materials increases with process and feed stock controls, we will explore uses such as ink-jetable nanosilicon suspensions for low cost, disposable electronics.",

In the Phase I feasibility study, Mayflower developed and analyzed the system architecture of a highly integrated Iridium/GPS Anti-Jam Antenna System (iGAASTM) solution, designed to mitigate jamming in the GPS and Iridium bands, that can be packaged within the size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements of this SBIR solicitation. The proposed GPS/Iridium AJ solution will be developed, implemented, and tested in the Phase II program and will offer a highly integrated GPS/Iridium anti-jam protection system solution that is self-contained in a CRPA solution and is a direct replacement for a standard FRPA antenna on the platform. The Phase II program will develop a form factor prototype system that will be tested at Government test facilities. The proposed iGAAS system will be qualified for the selected Navy platform and commercialized in a follow-on Phase III program.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Radio-frequency (RF) transmitting devices are found nearly everywhere today, ranging from lower-power cell phones to radar equipment to high-energy weapons systems. Accidental exposure of humans to the RF radiation emanating from these devices can cause harmful thermal effects including tissue damage or death. Modeling these thermal effects across a whole population of humans is difficult and time consuming using todays tools and can constitute a very expensive phase during the design of RF transmitting equipment. We will meet this industry need by converting the faster-than-real-time algorithms we developed during Phase I into high-quality commercial software products. We will extend our prototype thermal tool using out-of-core techniques to solve very large, high-resolution problems on diverse computing platforms containing one or many graphics processing units (GPU). We will also implement any remaining physics and diagnostics that are important for biological modeling, including computing cumulative exposure endpoints on the GPU, in real time. Furthermore, we will design and implement a user-friendly graphical user interface that will enable the thermal analyst to quickly and efficiently setup an RF exposure scenario, launch the analysis tools, monitor the progress of the simulation, and visualize the results.  BENEFIT:  These new algorithms and tools will enable the RF device manufacturing community to rapidly assess the possibility of RF overexposure caused by new device designs. They will be used in guiding new hyperthermia treatments for malignant tumors. The tools will immediately give feedback to physicians about possible under or overexposure of target tissues as well as the surrounding tissues, making the treatments more effective and safer for the patient. Our tools will also be used for thermal comfort design by the HVAC and technical fabric communities. In this context, the tools will help the designers evaluate the effects of design decisions on not just one thermal manikin, but across a whole population of individuals having different metabolisms, sweating rates, fat contents, etc. The third community that will benefit from these next-generation thermal modeling tools is the cell phone industry. Our tools will help cell phone tower operators to design safer operating and maintenance procedures when RF exposure may be necessary for the job. The tools will also be useful for determining temperature distributions in humans when they are using a cell phone. In particular, the fast speed of the tools will finally make it easy for manufacturers to predict and correct for exposure levels during the design phase of new cell phones, long before the FCC certification process.",

This SBIR Subsequent Phase II proposal describes a program to improve and enhance the Compact Magnetic Detection Set (CMDS) in its role as the principal detection instrument on a UAV platform for air ASW. The CMDS laser magnetometer is an innovative light-weight, compact, low-power helium metastable magnetometer capable of measuring scalar DC and ELF magnetic fields with high sensitivity in the frequency interval 0.01-100 Hz. A design goal of the CMDS was to reduce the system volume and weight by a factor of two with respect to AN/ASQ-233 system parameters. The CMDS has been successful in realizing this goal. The CMDS is intended for use on UAVs (vertical take-off and fixed wing) employed for ASW and land-based target detection such as buried weapons caches and IEDs. The proposed approach of the Subsequent Phase II effort includes (1) miniaturization of the CMDS electronics, (2) a CMDS helicopter flight test, (3) expansion of MGP algorithms to accommodate non-stationary noises, (4) temperature, shock and vibration testing of the CMDS sensor and electronics, (5) the construction of a test/backup CMDS, and (6) integration of the CMDS system to the platform.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The goal of this SBIR program is to develop a validated model that predicts ignition of composite aircraft fuel tanks when engaged by a High Energy Laser (HEL).  The primary focus of the Phase I research and development program was to develop a baseline capability for modeling laser-initiated fire ignition and sustainment for composite aircraft fuel tanks.  The SURVICE Engineering Company team developed and demonstrated an engineering level, stand-alone module based code that will run on common desktop personal computers thereby proving the approach feasibility.  A combination of new research and development with previously developed methods and technologies minimized development risk and efficiently supported the key Phase I objectives.  The goal of the Phase II effort will be to demonstrate  through research, experimentation, optimization, and validation  that the Phase I baseline code can be further developed into a limited distribution beta code that can be used for initial studies supporting program efforts.  Phase II efforts continue the code module development and enhancement by performing detailed testing, research and development of enhanced simulation equations, detailed validation, integration with higher level codes, and lastly distribution of a beta code version with user interface and operation instructions.  BENEFIT:  If a laser initiated fire analysis capability existed today, it would certainly be used within the DoD and industry markets to further understand the High Energy Laser (HEL) threat lethality, understand critical damage modes, and support development of mitigation techniques for air and potentially land and sea platforms.  The market sector of DoD agencies and industry supporting both weapons and platform development, will grow rapidly as tactical HELs become more prolific.    The research, testing, and development conducted during this SBIR in the short term (immediately) will benefit the HEL vulnerability and material/system development organizations for further understanding laser effects, specifically on composites materials and for systems with composite structured fuel storage tanks.  This is evident by the major HEL test and evaluation programs currently in progress.  In the long term, it will be applicable to commercial air carriers as HEL weapons evolve and become a significant terrorist threat.",

(PSI) will provide ORS, the Air Force, and other customers with a low-cost, rapidly-fabricated deployable antenna for use in a wide range of potential RF missions. The PSI team will use a combination of commercially available manufacturing techniques and a design-for-fabrication approach that will provide ORS with a versatile, scalable, deployable, high-gain antenna technology that can meet the needs of missions from 500 MHz to 8 GHz.   During the Phase I program, PSI fabricated a deployable, multi-layer membrane antenna, demonstrated its stowage and deployment, and verified its performance in an RF test range. The Phase I testing data shows that the core approach is robust and effective, and that the design tools and rapid manufacturing approaches worked as anticipated.   During the Phase II program, the antenna design and manufacturing will be improved, and a deployable structure architecture based on existing hardware will be developed. The combined structure and membrane will be applied to a 6U flight demonstration payload that will enable the technology be utilized for a wide range of low-cost missions.    BENEFIT:  The PSI approach is to develop an inherently low-cost and thus commercially viable antenna technology. The technology provides substantial benefits in both cost and schedule thus reducing overall program management risk. The early application to high gain cubesat antennas will provide a first market with a low threshold barrier and a track record of accepting novel technologies. Once the technology has been flight-demonstrated, the approach can be applied to larger, more-traditionally sized spacecraft for ORS and the Air Force as well as commercial spacecraft missions.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  An opportunity exists to develop methodologies and tools to objectively assess the overall training effectiveness of a simulation and pinpoint specific system characteristics such as fidelity and training strategy support which contribute to the training effectiveness or lack thereof.  To address this, Design Interactive (DI) proposes to develop the d-FOUR Electronic Toolkit (d4ET), a Training Effectiveness Evaluation (TEE) software support tool which allows users to: 1) determine how well existing simulators are addressing training objectives, 2) diagnose specific system characteristics (e.g., fidelity specifications, training strategy support) which impact training effectiveness, 3) develop recommendations for system certification (e.g., maintain, improve or decertify system), and 4) compare training effectiveness of different systems to determine the most cost effective system to train target objectives. The d4ET achieves this utilizing a tiered approach to training effectiveness evaluation that focuses on performance-outcome requirements and is tied to a Training Effectiveness Readiness Level taxonomy which prescribes a hierarchical training effectiveness scale providing an objective definition of the true efficacy that a training system has been demonstrated to achieve. d4ET will facilitate a less resource intensive and more objective evaluation of training systems which is flexible enough to be performed anytime in the training system life cycle.  BENEFIT:  The d4ET software support tool has the potential to lead to significant benefits with respect to cost, schedule and performance.  Specifically, d4ET has the potential to reduce costs by reducing the resources necessary to conduct a TEE and reducing training system costs by identifying most cost effective training system(s) to meet training objectives.  D4ET has the potential to reduce schedule impacts by reducing the time it takes to conduct a TEE and the decision time for training system certification by providing objective and quantifiable metrics of training effectiveness.  Finally, d4ET has the potential to improve performance through an increase in Training and Readiness Levels by increasing the quality of training simulators and thus opportunities for learning to occur while decreasing training time by eliminating simulation training which does not lead to significant gains in transfer performance.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  An ability to reduce the weight of cables has the potential to provide significant cost savings, reduce maintenance and improve reliability of satellites. The costs of developing and producing satellites are linearly proportional with the satellite&quot;s weight, with each kilogram costing around $1 million when delivery-to-space costs are included. With global satellite launches expected to double in the next decade, reducing satellite weight would be a tremendous boon to governments and the commercial sector. Wire is a prime target for reducing weight; for example, copper wiring makes up as much as one-third of the weight of a 15-ton satellite. Furthermore, wires that use current aerospace insulations deteriorate with age, largely due to environmental conditions and inflight vibrations that cause chafing. Using a Phase I SBIR grant, Minnesota Defense and the University of Minnesota used carbon nanotubes (CNT) to create Coax and Ethernet cables that weigh 23.2% and 42%, respectively, less than commercial off-the-shelf cables. This Phase II grant will fund the optimization of the cables, validation of the physical performance of the wires, and conduction of accelerating aging tests to ensure full-life-cycle performance.  BENEFIT:  Reducing the weight of coax and ethernet cables using carbon nanotubes (CNT) has the potential to provide significant cost savings, reduce maintenance and improve reliability of satellites. These cables would be impactful for government as well as commercial satellite applications.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  To address the Air Force need for airborne high-speed video (AHSV) capability in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to advance the development of the Crash-Hardened Airborne Overhead High-Speed (CHAOS) video system. CHAOS is based on POC&quot;s proprietary lossless optical segmenting hardware, parallelized image acquisition hardware, FPGA-based processing, and crash-ruggedized nonvolatile memory sufficient for 16 seconds of AHSV. The innovative design prototyped and shown feasible in Phase I eliminates the need for computationally intensive image registration software through optical image segmenting. The innovative design provides 2000fps imaging at 19201080 resolution, and can be expanded to support color and IR imaging. The parallelized image acquisition electronics are fully scalable allowing the design to support higher resolutions or frame rates as the client needs dictate. In Phase II, POC will work with the Air Force to define a comprehensive test plan for the Phase II prototype. We will then refine and finalize the CHAOS design and proceed to fabricate a TRL-5 prototype. The prototype will be demonstrated to the Air Force in keeping with our defined test plan. Concurrently, we will define certification and productization roadmaps for Phase IIe/III follow-on efforts.  BENEFIT:  The proposed CHAOS video system with its unique capacity to fuse sensor devices will make possible new classes of imaging technologies, such as high-resolution, high-speed, low-cost imager systems. Conventional approaches to fabricating large imaging arrays have either been based on stitching of smaller arrays or actual physical construction of large arrays. Both approaches have drawbacks that are directly overcome by the CHAOS video system, thereby allowing POC&quot;s CHAOS to directly extend the capabilities and lifecycles of military and commercial imaging technologies.  The CHAOS video system can employ existing lower-cost, poorer-performing imaging components to provide high-performance operation. This approach breathes new life into current mature technologies, and directly reduces fabrication and design costs of various technologies.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Thin film flexible cells based on IMM architecture require a protective optical coating  that maintains optical and mechanical integrity when rolled and unrolled for deployment. The multi-functional coating will be deposited on flexible substrates such as polymers and thin glass, and the combination must be stable to the space environment, namely: temperature changes, ionizing radiation, and atomic oxygen, while providing ESD protection. Stability to ground-storage humidity is also necessary. Our team will apply the radiation resistant and space qualified deposition process and materials technology that we established and demonstrated on previous SBIR and other R &amp; D projects. Samples of our UVR,  wide band AR, and ESD coatings on flexible polymer substrates flown on MISSE-7 suffered little or no loss of transmission. A larger number of candidate substrate materials will be coated, and their properties more extensively evaluated. Integrated assemblies consisting of functional cells and coated covers will be subjected to simulated space environmental exposure elements, and the effect on power output will be evaluated. Compatibility with cell integration and assembly procedures for panel construction will be addressed. The new coating and substrate combinations will be useful for all DoD, NASA, and communications spacecraft power, and terrestrial applications that employ flexible arrays.  BENEFIT:  The ability to package and stow solar cell arrays in a rolled configuration provides large reductions power-per-weight and power-per-volume performance.  Coupled with higher solar energy conversion efficiencies, flexible MJ IMM cells will soon replace conventional arrays.  Our flexible optical and protective coating will maximize photon throughput to the solar cell and protect the assembly from the harsh space environment.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Silicon carbide based power devices has several advantages because it can be used in very high power, high temperature, high frequency applications, where conventional silicon devices cannot be used. Despite significant advancement in SiC semiconductor technology in the past 3 decades, the presence of device killing defects in the epilayer has impeded the rapid commercialization of SiC-based power devices such as MOSFETs, bipolar-mode diodes and thyristors. Current state of the art methods to reduce these defects have made incremental progress and primarily rely on improvements in conventional growth techniques. A new substrate defect engineering technology has been proposed and demonstrated to reduce defects in SiC epilayers. The reduced defect density epilayers based on the defect engineered substrate will increase the performance SiC devices, device yield and hence can reduce the cost of manufacturing.  BENEFIT:  The high performance, low cost SiC devices will enable its applications in high power, high frequency and alternative energy applications. Silicon carbide (SiC) power devices can be used in applications such as solar inverters, power conversion in computing and network power supplies, variable-speed drives for industrial motors and hybrid electric vehicles, and products used in high-power, harsh-environment military and aerospace environments.",

Airmen crawl into ducts looking for defects, trace suspected sites on Mylar sheets noting their position relative to cavity features, and manually enter the data into an aircraft assessment system.  Technology that can reduce inspection times and eliminate sources of human error will benefit the Air Force by significantly increasing aircraft reliability and availability while reducing lifecycle maintenance costs.  To address this critical need, Intelligent Automation, Inc. proposes to develop AUTO-SCAN, a damage registration sensor that will automatically characterize and register defects in the aircraft coordinate system.  The Phase I effort demonstrated the feasibility of the AUTO-SCAN concept through the design, development and testing of a Phase I prototype.  Phase II will develop the AUTO-SCAN system to TRL 8/MRL 6 maturity, integrate it with current aircraft health assessment systems, and validate the utility of the system via multiple user operational evaluations.

        "abstract": "The U.S. Navy is interested in improving the capability and reliability of towed arrays by embedding low power telemetry electronics into the same package as the hydrophone/sensors. The telemetry electronics will be located inside a pressure housing that will contribute to increased reliability. This project requires both advancement/miniaturization of the telemetry circuits and the hydrophone to keep the overall size small (goal of 0.5&quot;OD x 2.0&quot;length) with the same or increased acoustic performance and lower power consumption. The smaller size allows for more hydrophones per unit length which improves array performance. Embedding telemetry with the hydrophone opens up the possibility of transmitting the response of every hydrophone to the processing system. Increased sensor count with embedded telemetry will result in higher data rates for these oversampled arrays, requiring innovative approaches to accommodate the resulting increased data bandwidth. Having multiple sensors and telemetry channels will result in inherent redundancy and graceful degradation in the event of a sensor failure. Innovative concepts will be developed to increase the number of channels per unit length in sonar arrays to improve system performance while simultaneously reducing the power required and improving reliability.",

Knowing now, what SK didn't know prior to Phase II testing, the working area on the deck space of the trailer, is not sufficient to safely operate the working system. Components are too close together to adequately perform routine maintenance or repair. The water tanks are too tall preventing easy site availability to the operator.

We will extend on-going work in the area of multi-satellite, multi-frequency GNSS signal processing with novel and original algorithms to improve navigation performance.  In addition Echo Ridge will apply a unique and highly processing efficient vector tracking algorithm which will improve robustness against GPS outages and multipath effects.  The developed algorithms will be evaluated using a hardware-in-the-loop RF environment emulator, capable of synthesizing arbitrary signals both at digital baseband and at RF.  In addition a characterization of performance will be carried out in realistic emulated and field propagation environments which include fading, multipath, and interference.  BENEFIT:  Commercialization opportunities for the subject navigation technology are numerous in the commercial location sector, the public services, and the DoD sectors.  In the public sector, emergency first responder personnel lack a robust location system which hampers search and rescue operations.  There are also equally compelling needs in the commercial sector, where wireless mobiles equipped with GPS for E911 positioning suffer from very poor yield indoors and in dense urban areas, even with&quot;assisted-GPS&quot;augmentations.  The last few years have witnessed explosive growth for revenue-bearing location-based navigation technology and applications, all of which suffer from poor performance for the same reasons and ultimately cost companies in lost potential revenue.  One of the most promising developments that will aid in bringing the subject research technology to broad commercial use is the increase in portable computing devices that now contain built-in GNSS and subsystems such as GPS, in addition to accelerometers, gyroscopes, WiFi, and multi-band radio frequency transceivers.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  To address the Air Force need for a miniature infrared (IR) camera that can provide image-based quantitative measurements from engine combustors at high-temperature (HT) and high-pressure (HP), Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to advance development of a new Miniature Infrared Radiation Detection Camera (MINC). The MINC system is based on simultaneous multispectral filtering combined with an HT/HP survivable IR probe. During Phase I, we successfully completed the development of a prototype and demonstrated feasibility by imaging a laboratory flame at AFRL to obtain 4 simultaneous multispectral video images with microsecond shutter time. Infrared imaging through an IR fiber bundle (demonstrated to be survivable over 800\u00b0F with air cooling) was also accomplished. Based on these results, we formulated a clear path to the Phase II design for in-situ measurements using a HT-survivable lipstick-sized probe coupled to an adjustable periscope that will be developed in collaboration with AFRL and attached to a remote camera. Innovations in optical design and multi-spectral image registration enable the MINC system to provide quantitative radiation measurements and high temperature gas flow patterns inside the combustor. This data is essential for designing the next generation of engines and facilitates troubleshooting, saving time and money.  BENEFIT:  The MINC system&quot;s unique capacity to obtain infrared radiation data from high temperature environments at multiple wavelengths will make possible a new class of sensor technologies for engine combustor, power plant, and environmental sensing. Conventional approaches to infrared sensing have either been based on laboratory IR cameras or spectrometers, neither of which can obtain the thermal imaging data achieved by MINC. MINC&quot;s approach of transferring radiation data from regions of harsh environment to a remote imaging sensor opens up new applications and markets including industrial furnace control, coal power plant reactors combustion control, and engine diagnostics and test. MINC&quot;s capability to measure physical quantities of high temperature gas flows makes it suitable for numerous commercial applications. These include commercial aircraft jet engine testing, power plant turbine measurements, auto engine design and quality control, forest fire gas and flame sensing, gas pollutants remote sensing, incinerator gas emission testing, and rocket engine design and test.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Air Force is facing severe budget cuts which force the need to cut operating costs of aircraft and manpower. One way to do this is to increase reliability of systems and components which would reduce maintenance and increase operational availability, which reduces the number of aircraft needed to complete missions. The Air Force desires a new prognostic health management (PHM) approach that applies advanced diagnostic and prognostic algorithms to systems and components of vehicles operated under harsh or off-design conditions typical of military platforms. In Phase I, MSI developed and prototyped a PHM system that will provide accurate prognosis of propulsion system health and, as much as possible, preempt loss of control, in-flight shutdowns and cut down on false removals and maintenance time caused by inadequate information from the aircraft. The demonstration included real time data collection, signal conditioning, cognitive processing, and data offload from the EPIC; and probabilistic decision support information for maintenance troubleshooting assists. The RTS operating engineer flew simulated missions and seeded faults that typical of hard to isolate problems experienced in RPA propulsion systems. All the seeded faults introduced by the Rolls-Royce RTS engineer were successfully identified.  BENEFIT:  The COSMOS PHMS three tier approach,  implemented with passive embedded processing nodes offers cost effective advantages that go beyond data recording to provide in-flight diagnostics and prognostics and also support O-level troubleshooting and data mining of fleet data. Being on-board and real time COSMOS can programmed to alert the maintainers not only of the diagnosed cause of a red tag events but also predict probabilistically the progress of degradation of components to indicate those what actions can be taken to preempt future failures. The probabilistic information from the COSMOS PHMS will also provide actionable decision support during maintenance by providing diagnostics and backup data. COSMOS will provide root cause analyses to wiring electrical or other cause which will reduce No Fault Found.   COSMOS PHMS will improve existing logistic support processes by providing information not currently available.  All this translates to reduced maintenance time, lower operating costs and higher operational availability.",

        "abstract": "This program will accelerate transitioning of high-throughput versions of JENTEKs MWM Array eddy-current sensors and GridStation impedance instruments to the U.S. Navy. The proposed systems will have between 350 and 600 fully parallel impedance channels. With greater data acquisition speed from each channel and with substantial increase in the number of fully parallel channels, larger surface areas, such as webs, bores and large parts can be inspected far more efficiently and quickly. Furthermore, multiple features, such as all the holes at a given mounting surface on a disk, can be inspected simultaneously.   The inspection capability will be enhanced by a data archiving function which records component conditions, historical crack growth rates (determined from MWM-Array mapping and tracking methods), and residual stress relaxation.  The overall program focus is on achieving a 20 times increase in the inspection throughput (compared to conventional Eddy Current Testing, ET). This throughput improvement should enable one system to replace three conventional systems for many inspections providing an additional reduction in acquisition and operating costs.",

During Phase III we will work with the selected-engine OEM to develop a certification plan, perform Category A (ground) and B (flight) testing.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Global Positioning System (GPS) is relied upon as a source of accurate Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) information by both civilians and the military.  Ideally, GPS receivers receive navigation signals from the satellites, process the information, and provide correct PNT solutions.  As GPS has now become ubiquitous in weapon platforms, increased vulnerability due to the advances in enemy jamming and spoofing techniques must be protected against. As additional navigation bands become available, a new generation of receivers, which receive and process multiple bands, will become the standard for high precision navigation, jamming resistance and spoofing mitigation. The Nu-Trek team will develop a high performance, universal, wideband GNSS front end called NT/GNSS/01 which will be transition ready at the end of Phase II.  Key considerations for the feature set of the NT/GNSS/01 include: (1) Wideband, to receive all available bands; (2) Common, to work with most GPS/GNSS receivers; (3) Upgradable, to enable the incremental addition of bands without changing the RFIC, which significantly reduces the risk and cost associated with receiver upgrades; (4) Jam resistant; and (5) Low power and low noise.  BENEFIT:  In the next 5 years, 10-20 new navigational signals will become available to the user.  There are many advantages to utilizing multiple bands. This includes higher precision, cross-checking for jamming and spoofing, mitigation of multi-path effects and ionospheric effects, etc.  Currently the military has no means of receiving the broad bandwidth of GNSS signals.  Although GNSS front-ends have been developed in the commercial sector they are composed of one RF front-end per band.  Nu-Treks solution provides a single front-end ASIC which covers all GNSS bands and is characterized by high linearity, flexible frequency plan, low power and low noise.  The flexible architecture enables the Nu-Trek front end to support most military receivers as well as the incremental addition of navigation bands.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The proposed project will enable the realization of a low size, weight, &amp; power directional antenna for CDL. A preliminary design of such a system was shown in the Phase I SBIR. Here, a small CTS (continuous transverse stub) antenna was shown to meet the CDL requirements provided in the original solicitation. A spoiled beam in elevation allows continuous illumination of the ground from directly below the aircraft to 110 NM on the horizon, all while maintaining more than the required gain. No elevation scan is required. This allows for an extremely light weight and low cost gimbal that only needs to move the main antenna beam in azimuth. The design of this unique gimbal was illustrated in the Phase I project. A DTUPC study (for qty 100 units) was included which showed the production cost to be well under the maximum goal. This was validated by a complete list of the parts required for the product, each priced by similarity or actual vendor quotes. The Phase II SBIR will enable completion of the detailed design, procurement and assembly of the entire antenna system, as well as RF, mechanical, and environmental testing. The delivered prototype will include the radome and be suitable for prototype flight testing.  BENEFIT:  ThinKom has already successfully fielded antennas at C, X, Ku, Ka, Q, E, and W bands, including dual-band and wideband variants. Further, ThinKom, alone, and in cooperation with various partners, is developing various SATCOM On-the-Move antenna systems, including pointing and stabilization subsystems, readily adaptable to CDL Line-of-Sight (LOS) needs.  Current and potential applications for the particular proposed CDL-variant of the CTS antenna technology, include SATCOM, Point-to-Multipoint (PTMP), Point-to-Point (PTP), and various Asset-Tracking applications where a truly low-cost high-gain low-profile steerable antenna is a strong commercial enabler.",

        "abstract": "Landing gear systems are one of the more problematic subsystems on Naval aircraft. Landing gear failure can be caused by hard landings due to actual severe high sink rate with high enough GW to exceed the design strength, but are extremely rare. More common are fatigue and environmentally caused failures. Aircraft managers address this issue by making estimations of operational loads, and doing detailed fatigue analysis as appropriate to ensure safe landing gear operation. These estimations are conservative by nature, and frequently necessitate assumptions about landing, ground or braking conditions that may be different in actual operational service. The ability to measure, record, and possibly process the operational loads data for each aircrafts landing gear would give Aircraft Program Offices the ability to make more intelligent management decisions about operational limits, inspection intervals, and removal & depot overhaul cycle values. Additionally, landing gear failures can be caused by mis-servicing of the landing gear, resulting in much higher loads (even for a \"normal\" landing events or cause excessive fatigue damage than originally assumed). This phenomena is present and problematic for multiple aircraft platforms. The proposed SHM system would address this issue at two levels - detecting and prevent mis-servicing gears hence eliminating higher peak load failures, and also minimize/avoid unnecessary inspections due to perceived \"hard landings\". ES3 proposes to address all these issues through the use of an on-aircraft miniaturized data acquisition system, with sufficient data storage and processing capabilities to utilize multiple sensor inputs. During the Phase I SBIR effort, ES3 evaluated several of these systems, and numerous applicable sensors for their suitability in a SHM system. During the Phase I activities, prototype hardware was laboratory tested for various SHM functionality. The N121-043 Phase II effort intends to capitalize on the significant opportunity to resolve problems with the current SHM systems/datavia the integration of new technologies for sensors, communication devices, and miniaturized Data Acquisition Systems (DAQ). In Phase I, ES3 demonstrated the technical feasibility of developing this type of multi-function SHM system that could address four main categories 1) fatigue life management, 2) safety, 3) maintenance reduction, and 4) mission impactin order to aid in the technology evaluation process The primary focus of the Phase II solution will be development/demonstration/validation on the P-8 (PMA-290) acquisition program. However, the proposed solution will be directly transferable to other acquisition programs included in the N121-043 SBIR topic, currently including V-22 (PMA-275), C-130 (PMA-207), and H-53K (PMA-261).",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In Phase I, PRA working with FLIR modified the command and control (C2) software for their Ranger series of perimeter surveillance radars to meet requirements for flightline boundary surveillance. These radars are ideal for this mission with a 30 cm range resolution, >97% probability of detection, and low false alarm rate (less than 3 per 24 hours). The C2 software was modified to allow the creation of a boundary encompassing a protected zone with designated entrance and exit points and to classify target tracks as friendly or intruder based upon entry through a designated entrance or over the boundary respectively.    In Phase II, PRA will develop and implement an advanced tracking algorithm that combines detection data from multiple networked sensors to provide a single uniform target track. This will involve minor additional modifications to the FLIR C2 software to interface with the PRA tracking module. An extended deployment of the system with security personnel will be performed, allowing in depth evaluation of system performance in an operational setting.    With over 700 FLIR Ranger R-350s deployed, the results of the PRA effort can be leveraged in existing assets with an upgrade to the C2 software located at the security station.    BENEFIT:  Maintaining security at airfields has traditionally been performed with ported coaxial cable radars. People, animals, and vehicles cause disturbances in the fields generated by the cables, allowing them to be detected. This can result in a number of false or nuisance alarms when the object is near but not actually crossing into a protected area. PRA is proposing a modified FLIR Ranger series of perimeter surveillance radars as the ideal solution to the flightline surveillance mission. The FLIR Ranger series are high range resolution (HRR) radars sporting range resolution as little as 30 cm (1 foot), high probability of detection (> 97%) and low false alarm rate (less than 3 per 24 hours). With over 700 FLIR Ranger series radar deployed at air bases globally, the PRA solution is a cost effective means to secure the flightline at various air bases.     The Phase I resulted in modifications to the FLIR command and control (C2) software to allow the user to define protected areas by defining boundaries around the area. Openings left in the boundary define designated entry and exit locations. Targets that enter the area through a designated entry point are classified as friendly and are displayed as a green track. Targets entering the restricted area by crossing a boundary are classified as an intruder and their track is displayed in red. This allows security personnel to rapidly identify friendly and nonfriendly targets within the restricted area for interception. In addition, by tracking the intruders security personnel can identify and inspect locations within a protected area visited by an intruder.     Currently the FLIR C2 software can manage multiple sensors, however for each target there is a separate track resulting from each sensor. For Phase II, PRA will develop advanced track processing that will ingests the measurements from the different sensors and forms a single uniform track. In particular, PRA will develop a multiple hypothesis tracker (MHT), generating hypotheses for each measurement as to whether it is a false alarm, new track or associated with an existing track. Probabilities associated with the hypotheses are generated and the assignment problem is performed. The hypotheses are propagated in time allowing an assignment to change based upon future information.      In Phase III, PRA will design and implement a hardware and software upgrade option for potential Government and commercial customers that will identify specific boundary regions of interest for intruder identification.      Perimeter surveillance and anti-personnel surveillance sensor systems have application in base and border security by identifying and characterizing possible threats before they become an issue and alerting personnel when a threat becomes an issue.  This work supports and enhances the ongoing research program at PRA in the areas of perimeter surveillance, clutter mitigation, automatic target recognition, and target tracking. This ongoing work can lead into the development of new and innovative techniques for clutter mitigation (adaptive processing for non-array systems), new features to exploit for target characterization, and new methods to accelerate ATR processing, providing target characteristics and types faster and more accurately to security personnel.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Cyber-attacks are increasing in frequency, impact, and complexity, which demonstrate extensive vulnerabilities of networks with the potential for catastrophic damage. Defending against these cyber-attacks requires network security situation awareness (SA) through distributed collaborative monitoring, detection, and mitigation. In the Phase I project, IFT team has developed a Network Sensor-Based Defense Framework for Active Network Security Situation Awareness and Impact Mitigation. The framework features five elements: distributed network sensors (both passive and active), effective anomaly detectors, cyber-attack scene investigation, game theoretic cyber-attack formalization, and Google Earth based multi-view and multi-layer visualization. The preliminary yet promising results obtained in the Phase I study clearly demonstrate that IFT&quot;s network sensor based defense framework provides innovative and effective SA techniques for active network security and proactive impact mitigation against cyber network attacks. In the Phase II research proposed, we will revise, extend, and optimize the Phase I research results with the focus on enhanced detection techniques, privacy-preserving, insider attack detection, game theoretic intent inference and impact mitigation, trust/assurance of network sensors, system resilience/agility, social-cultural factor modeling, traceback for anonymous attacks, and coordination between passive sensors and active sensors for a holistic cyber assessment testbed to enhance strategic and operational capabilities.  BENEFIT:  The innovations that we are developing will improve situation awareness, planning, data theft protection, and decision support for many military applications contending with complex malicious network attacks. The first near term DOD application target is the Cyber Warriors program, which is an Air Force stringent need. The second near term DOD application target is Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) program and other programs where Raytheon-IIS is the Prime Contractor. Raytheon-IIS is prime contractor on the DCGS, Universal Control System (UCS), and next generation GPS control segment (GPS OCX). IFT has developed a strong and realistic plan to transition our technology to Raytheon programs. The cyber technology is also applicable to commercial systems.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  To address the Air Force need for a spatial and spectral beam combiner that integrates separate collimated ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) image sources into a single co-aligned image identical to the size and shape of both input images while preserving spectral characteristics of both, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to advance development of the new UV IR Image Combiner (UVIR) whose concept was successfully demonstrated to be feasible in Phase I by a scaled-down working prototype. We plan to develop a new Phase II UVIR device by integrating spectrally dispersive optics with broadband optics and innovatively combining dispersive components with broad band optics. This innovation enables the UVIR system to conjoin separate extended IR and UV collimated images into a co-registered single image. During Phase I, based on a detailed design modeling, optical materials and coatings selections, POC constructed testing prototypes, and successfully demonstrated UVIR with&gt;70% optical transmission and&gt;80% uniformity with resolution better than 100\u00b5rad at 60 cm and minimal ghosting. In Phase II, POC plans to develop and demonstrate a full-scale prototype, and validate the spectral and spatial goals of the 6-inch aperture UVIR device combining a minimum of one UV and one IR image.  BENEFIT:  The UVIR system will be useful for many commercial applications, such as multiband sensors for gas plume detection, high-power laser beam delivery systems, including laser eye surgery, hyperspectral projectors and displays, and imaging spectrometer systems, as well as differential absorption LIDAR for measuring volatile organic compounds, aerosols, particulate matter, and other pollutants. UVIR also has potential for fluorescent imaging of cellular structures and biological tissue, industrial inspection equipment for product verification and test, laser machining and drilling, microlithography, tissue welding and wideband imaging systems. Potential customers include aerospace, biomedical, pharmaceuticals, environmental testing and monitoring, and other industries in the hyperspectral sensor market.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Color coding of symbology can improve operator performance and reduce workload by reducing display clutter and aiding visual search. For example, all enemy symbols could be colored red, and all friendly symbols colored green allowing the distinction between enemy and friendly to be made at a glance.     For the most effective operation, the specified color set must be unambiguous and resistant to being washed out by the color of the out the window (OTW) environment, be it a blue sky, desert scenery, setting sun or night vision green when the symbology is overlaid in the eyepiece of the night vision goggle. Symbol luminance and chromaticity are two components that determine the effect of daylight on color naming and discrimination.    In our Phase I efforts SA Photonics has developed a color set which is robust to ambient environments and to night vision goggle imagery.  We also evaluated dynamic colors, which can be changed depending on the coloration of ambient light.  This Phase I work paves the way for our Phase II efforts to quantify acceptance and performance using this color set and to develop a method for optimizing colors depending on the HMDs color gamut.  BENEFIT:  The benefits of SA Photonics work on color symbology are:   Increased performance and situational awareness due to preservation of color cues   Uniform visibility across multiple backgrounds including blue skies and oceans, red sunsets, brown desert scenery and green vegetation   Optimization of color contrast for any HMD   Ease of setting up and testing any HMD to ensure colors look the same from unit to unit",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In the Phase I effort, IFT proposed a Holistic networking Infrastructure for tactical Satellite Communication Networks (HISCoN). It supports optimal network resource management and cross-layer cooperation that allow satellite communication networks to intelligently accommodate the communication needs of various missions/tasks with diverse traffic characteristics and drastically different QoS requirements. Novel enabling technologies have been developed at the physical layer for RF situation awareness, efficient QoS-aware spectrum allocation, and anti-jamming communication, and at the network layer for QoS-aware routing and scheduling. The Phase I effort has provided convincing results of proof-of-concept designs that enable the development of a holistic integrated system for space-borne communication network technology transition.   In Phase II, our goal is twofold: to refine and expand the HISCoN algorithms by addressing a broad scope of issues in practical implementations, and to integrate the proposed technologies and tools for extensive performance evaluation and visual demonstration in realistic mission scenarios. There are three major milestones: 1) implementation and testing of the main components (i.e., the proposed communication/networking algorithms, CR hardware testbed, the co-simulation platform and the 3D simulation/visualization engine); 2) integration of all the components into an operational demonstrator; and 3) simulations of realistic scenarios to obtain desired results.    BENEFIT:  The proposed RF cartography-enabled cognitive airborne system (RC-CAS) has tremendous potential in many military applications. The cognition infrastructure such as the RF cartography and its application to cognition-enabled tactical wireless networking is a research area critical for national security and battlefield information collection. RC-CAS can also be directly used for developing of advanced mission planning and emergency preparedness decision support systems such as extensions to Net-Enabled Command Capability (NECC), the Space Situational Awareness Fusion Intelligent Research Environment [SAFIRE], JSPOC Situational Awareness Response System (JSARS), JSTARS, and DCGS programs. The technologies developed under our mission-oriented cross-layer analyses and designs will enhance the capabilities of the Objective Force Warrior (OFW) and the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) programs with novel power control, scheduling, routing, mobility management and resource allocation algorithms for communication/networking functions. In addition to the USAF, prime contractors (e.g., Raytheon, Boeing) and DoD partners (e.g. Navy and Army) are also very interested in assisting in the technology transfer.    IFT&quot;s research thrusts on RF environment map estimation algorithms will have direct implications to random field estimation tasks for wireless sensor networks in various monitoring applications, such as structural health monitoring for critical national infrastructure, habitat monitoring, homeland security, and remote sensing. Other potential commercial applications include police and first responders for NASA, US Coast Guard, Department of Homeland Security, multi-layered sensing, disaster assessment, air traffic control system, the national weather service, physical security systems, law enforcement agency, emergency control center, border and coast patrol, pollution monitoring, remote sensing and global awareness. Cisco and Hughes Network Systems are also interested in IFT&quot;s routing algorithms. We expect the aggregated market size will be similar to that of military applications.",

        "abstract": "During carrier-based aircraft mission planning, threat data is currently subject to repeated, manual transcription as it is repeatedly hand-typed into Joint Mission Planning Software (JMPS), Microsoft Excel, and other tools. This creates several mission risks, including:  Data transcription into some software takes an enormous amount of time, in some cases well over an hour. As a consequence, strike package route selection can be delayed. This poses an obvious mission risk.  Additionally, manual data transcription introduces the risk of typographical errors in key parameters such as a threat&quot;s GPS coordinates.  Finally, to mitigate transcription risk, the mission planning process includes a final manual Quality Assurance (QA) pass over the plans. This is time consuming and inefficient, significantly contributing to the 6-hour planning time.  Jaybridge Robotics develops the Strike Assisting Planning Software (STRAPS) tool. STRAPS provides a modern, collaborative network-based toolchain addressing key information management problems to increase mission planning efficiency and reduce risk of error and omission during planning.  In this Phase II.5 project, Jaybridge will develop a new component for STRAPS, the Threat Manager (THM) component, which is designed to address the threat data management problems described.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  To address the Air Force need for an omnidirectional imaging sensor with a reconfigurable architecture for space surveillance, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to complete development of a new Agile Field-of-View (AFOV) sensor. It mimicks the vertebrate eye, providing a global view with hemispherical coverage and capturing local details with high-resolution in the direction of gaze. The AFOV sensor integrates an innovative adaptive superlens into a hemispherical FOV objective to enable smooth zooming up to 1:25 of regions of interest selected anywhere within the FOV without mechanical movement. The Phase II prototype will operate in the IR spectrum to make imaging independent of external light conditions, provide remote temperature characterization of space objects, and resist sunlight blinding. Object identifications are also supported by proven computationally efficient algorithms for image super-resolution and quality enhancement, allowing us to reach resolution better than 10 microradians, precise ranging and tracking. These capabilities, integrated into a compact design with low power consumption and functionality in low earth orbit (LEO) environments, directly address the Air Force requirements. In Phase II, POC will complete tests of system components in simulated LEO environments, fabricate and assemble a full-scale prototype, and demonstrate acquisition and tracking of ground-based objects.  BENEFIT:  Successful completion of the AFOV sensor development will bring benefits to military surveillance; situational awareness; and navigation and aiming for missiles, cruise missiles, and artillery shells. The AFOV sensor can be applicable to all autonomous air, land, and sea vehicles where payload, size, and weight are at a premium. The improved video enables such platforms to produce high-resolution imagery, which is becoming vital to various DoD and commercial applications involving surveillance, situational awareness, and tracking. The POC solution can be adopted in commercial video surveillance systems because of its advantages in terms of coverage and cost. This approach greatly simplifies problems of data fusion in multicamera video surveillance systems, drastically reducing setup and maintenance costs, and computational complexity too. The distinguishing features of the AFOV sensor will make it commercially attractive in multiple civilian applications, such as academic research, training and simulation, virtual design, education, robot navigation, and biomedical imaging. It will also find application in airport security, car traffic surveillance, emergency management, and natural disaster relief.",

The proposed project will extend and transition the telemetry, packaging and iPEN technologies developed under SBIR Topic N111-075, and N04-138. The specific emphasis of this technology transition is improved reliability for the TB-29A Towed Array. Optimal TB-29A performance and availability requires a balance of design ruggedness, improved resilience, and improved reliability. The use of previous SBIR technologies has the potential to increase all of these. These reliability improvements are based on simplified architecture and corresponding connector reduction, lower power, and the use of pressure vessels to protect the telemetry components from towing and handling stresses while also allowing for failure analysis and repair. A collateral benefit is improved monitoring from additional sensors built into the telemetry components. 3Pi plans to build one (1) TB-29A Reliability Upgrade (RU) Towed Array and test through array harness testing, factory acceptance testing, lake and sea trial testing during this effort.",

        "abstract": "The future net-centric military provides enhanced battlefield awareness through wireless links between unmanned aerial vehicles, high-speed aircraft, rotary-winged platforms, and soldiers on the ground. To support this, platforms must accommodate a variety of antennas, not to mention traditional payloads such as sensors, fuel, weapons, and personnel. The integration of antennas on rotary-winged platforms is particularly challenging since performance can be greatly impacted depending on mounting location. The ideal mounting locations are thus over-crowded with antennas that pose a cosite and blockage problems. This dictates the need for a wideband efficient antenna that can operate over various frequency bands and waveforms while sharing a single mounting location. These frequency bands and waveforms include SINCGARS 30-88 MHz, VHF AM / ATC 116-174 MHz, UHF-AM / HAVEQUICK 225-400 MHz, Public Safety 450-512 MHz, and WNW / SRW 1200-2500 MHz.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The ThermoReg thermal model was developed to solve for tissue temperatures resulting from radio frequency (RF) heating using a voxel-based, heterogeneous tissue description of the human body. Although ThermoReg has been parallelized to run on high-performance computer clusters, the time-dependent nature of a thermal solution (especially for tissue temperatures resulting from high-power, short duration RF exposures) can lead to excessive run times that subsequently limit the extent to which parametric studies can be conducted. We propose a set of tasks that will be accomplished by implementing solution techniques that take advantage of the massive parallelism that is provided by modern GPUs, improving the underlying thermo-physiology model and by implementing techniques that reduce run-times by reducing model fidelity when appropriate. The performance of these tasks will result in software and associated work flows that will demonstrate substantial decreases in run-time while maintaining model fidelity. In addition, the accuracy, applicability and lifetime of the ThermoReg software will be greatly extended.  BENEFIT:  The product of this SBIR will be a valuable tool for existing DOD activities directed at: 1) establishing health effects and safety standards for exposure to electromagnetic fields; 2) development of non-lethal weapons; and 3) evaluating human thermal comfort and health risks in extreme environments across a population of people. We have successfully marketed the use of human thermal models in a number of areas: Automotive and aircraft passenger thermal comfort and safety models; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) designs for vehicles and buildings; protective clothing design; and optimization of garment designs for thermal safety and comfort.

MGRAM, a form of graphene and magnetic memory, promises to satisfy these requirements and to provide a solution path to achieving low cost, high reliability solid state drives for personal computers and systems. MGRAM is based upon a nano scaled bar magnet which is oriented normal to the plane and state bit is defined by the orientation of the magnetic charge. The charge state can be set to a 0-1-2 by directly addressing the bit. Memory state sense is performed by a non-destructive means of sensing the field using a graphene Hall device located at one end of the magnetic bit. Magnetic storage has been proven in space applications, and offers distinct advantages in temperature, longevity, and density. Being a true non-volatile memory MGRAM does not require a refresh or maintenance cycle.  MGRAM is able to hold state value during read cycles, increasing overall speed and reducing power. This effort will result in a design for manufacturing process of the memory cell elements, fabrication of test cells, and electrical characterization of completed modules which promise to scale beyond the 16nm technology node.  BENEFIT:  Initial applications of this technology will be in satellites and space vehicles. Following space applications will be critical systems in commercial aircraft and other life safety systems.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Hypersonic propulsion systems, such as supersonic combustion ramjets (scramjets) are generally expected to operate from Mach 3.5 up to Mach 7-8 and are designed for specific flight Mach numbers to achieve optimum performance. However, realistic flight vehicles will experience a wide range of flight conditions during a typical mission. These off-design flight conditions degrade the performance of the hypersonic propulsion system because the engine is not actively controlled. In an effort to increase engine performance, while simultaneously enabling system weight reductions, PM &amp; AM Research, in collaboration with our strong collaborative team, propose to demonstrate the feasibility of depositing energy using&quot;plasma&quot;actuators within a hypersonic propulsion system to increase the performance of these high-speed platforms.  BENEFIT:  If successful, this novel solution would allow increased thrust and robustness. Military applications for this innovative system include high-speed propulsion systems and technologies applicable toward various time-critical weapon systems, strike/reconnaissance vehicles, and space launch applications. Additionally, commercial applications include enhancing current scramjet system designs to enable access to space applications to compete with existing rocket platforms.",

The Navy wants to take advantage of all available corrosion knowledge, methods, models and algorithms to fulfill this vision. The overall concept here is to develop a tool set which has a library of different material microstructures, damage models, solving routines to simulate corrosion fatigue failure. In addition, it will allow users to integrate their individual computational damage models or their solving routines in the software tool.

The CCMS will be designed for manufacturability and ease of installation, and will provide reliable, long service life operation at a low cost. The health monitoring system will output a direct pass/fail measurement of coating damage, damage location, estimated remaining service life, and CP system condition.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The goal of this proposed effort is to develop intelligent automation that can improve the Air Force&quot;s process of scheduling contacts between Satellite Operations Centers (SOCs) on the ground and satellites in orbit.  The current process for selecting supporting resources (&quot;supports&quot;) is largely manual and can require substantial effort as conflicts are resolved both locally and then globally at the 22nd Space Operations Squadron (22 SOPS).  This process is currently handled by crews operating 24/7 to manage satellite telemetry, tracking and commanding (TT &amp; C).  This SBIR effort is seeking to reduce the required manpower and eventually transition to&quot;lights out&quot;operation at the SOCs.  Our system, called Synth, will improve efficiency by intelligently prioritizing the available supports and considering a wide range of constraints that are currently cross-checked manually.  Additional improvements will be made by integrating with Stottler Henke&quot;s MIDAS, an intelligent scheduling agent that deconflicts schedule requests across all SOCs.  Synth will transmit additional information for more general scheduling rules such that MIDAS can automatically adapt the global schedule without always needing to wait for approval from each SOC.  Phase I proved the concept and has set the stage for full implementation of Synth in Phase II.  BENEFIT:  The most direct target for the results of this effort is, of course, providing intelligent automation for the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) and more specifically SOCs.  By Stottler Henke both demonstrating significantly improved performance during Phase II and ensuring that the ultimate results can be integrated into the operational scheduling systems with the proposed Synth system, the Air Force will have a strong incentive to operationalize the Phase II development of the proposed system.  Beyond the Air Force, there is strong commercialization potential for this technology with NASA and private sector satellite operators.  Additionally, there are many similarities between communication scheduling and sensor scheduling.  Thus the algorithms developed here could be marketed to our existing Air Force and Navy sensor customers interested in sensor scheduling and coordination.  Finally, there are the commercial applications for the technology developed for the Scheduler.  We are already marketing Aurora, our general intelligent planning and scheduling framework, and we are customizing it for a variety of domains.  The additional capabilities developed for communication scheduling can be synergistically marketed to the same clients.  We anticipate that this effort will result in additional scheduling algorithms that we will be able to incorporate into our existing scheduling products, thus increasing the benefits they provide and their value.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  A key problem in the rapid and lower cost development of spacecraft is that the various devices that comprise the spacecraft bus do not typically provide a single standard interface and/or communications protocols. This forces a design-to-order paradigm in which a spacecraft bus is developed on a per-mission basis with little reuse of existing software. Efforts such as SOA have defined an interface adapter that translates between the native protocols and standard protocols. To date for SPA, that adapter has been an ASIM. While serving an important role in the early development of SPA, ASIMS are inefficient in their design due to the lack of an appropriate COTS device to fulfill the needs of this domain. They add significant power requirements, weight, cost, and software development effort to as project.  Design Net Engineering has developed a solution to the standard interface problem, enabling component manufacturers to create SPA-complaint devices rapidly with significantly lower usage, mass, costs and effort than the exiting alternatives.  BENEFIT:  Space Plug &amp; Play Avionics (SPA) has been designed to enable rapid, lower cost development of spacecraft. Adoption of SPA by the wider industry to reach a critical mass of available components is vital to its success. The development effort, hardware costs, power usage and mass of existing SPA interface solutions have served as deterrents to wider adoption to date. Design Net Engineering&quot;s solution provides a cheaper, low effort, low power and low mass solution to the problem thus enabling and encouraging component manufacturers to provide SPA compliance to their hardware with minimal impediments. This will enable wider adoption of SPA as a standard and allow the full benefits of using SPA to be realized, resulting in faster development and lower cost spacecraft for DoD, NASA and commercial spacecraft.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The image generating surfaces of existing displays are rectilinear and fabricated on flat glass plates or silicon wafers due to the constraint of lithography and processing.   In digital visualization applications such as near-eye advanced helmet mounted systems (HMS), three-dimensional (3D) and other projection designs, the flat image must be transformed into a curved image wavefront representation for projection to the eye.  The optics to this transformation are expensive and bulky when the field of view (FOV) is large.  If the image generating surface is curved, the transforming optics can be simplified and made light weight.  This SBIR Phase II program is aiming to develop a fully functional focal plane OLED array on a curved substrate with R=2.5cm and FOV=40o.   A top emission OLED array will be integrated on top of pixel driving array made of metal-oxide thin film transistor on the same substrate.   2T1C pixel circuit will be adopted.  The array is in 220x200 format with 50m pixel pitch.  The process developed during this SBIR program will also enable commercial display products in non-flat forms, either conformable or flexible.  BENEFIT:  We anticipate that the proposed work will have an immediate impact on military and commercial applications.  The curved broadband flat focal plane array (FPA) will revolutionize imaging devices with large FOV and with low weight and size.  In addition to military applications, such a device will also find broad applications in next generation automobiles and security systems.  For example, the automatically driving vehicle recently demonstrated by Google requires such a large FOV image sensor as its sensing unit (electronic eye).   Broad band, large view cameras and sensors are also needed for general vehicles as a driving aid in foggy or rainy environments.  We anticipate that the technology developed during this SBIR program will create new business opportunities for commercial electronics.  For example, the area of the display pixel (50umx50um, ~500 pixels per inch) is very close to that in advanced 3G/4G mobile phones under development.",

In environments where size and power conservation is of high importance, power consumption and heat dissipation in the power amplifier (PA) must be minimized. However, it is widely accepted that linearity and efficiency are competing constraints. To address these challenges, MaXentric Technologies proposes a cost-effective linearizer, ALASTx (Adaptive LineArizer for Satellite Transmitters), for high efficiency satellite transmitters, capable of better than -50 dBc ACPR and &lt;2.5?/dB AM-PM using multi-tone signals with modulation bandwidths up to 52 MHz while operating the PA at peak efficiency (0dB backoff) to achieve high linearity while simultaneously maintaining high efficiency on Ka-/Q-band PAs (30-31 GHz and 43.5-45.5 GHz). ALASTx offers exceptional linearization capabilities for wide-band systems and, as compared to other schemes, has become very cost-efficient by utilizing a small set of additional resources in an already-existing signal processing unit used for signal generation. One of the major advantages of using ALASTx is that this solution is independent of technology, power amplifier classes, power levels, and environment.",

Running trainees through realistic exercises on cyber ranges is a highly effective method for preparing warfighters for cyber operations.  However, training platforms and cyber missions are numerous, varied, and rapidly-evolving.  What few tools exist to assess student performance in training exercises have only basic functionality, and lack the flexibility to work with the wide array of training environments.    To improve the effectiveness of cyber exercises, ATC-NY will build the White Team Training Suite (WITTS), a flexible system for objectively monitoring cyber training events and generating briefings and debriefings for instructors and trainees.  WITTS uses agents deployed on an exercise network to collect exercise data and features interactive dashboards that assist white team members with planning and monitoring exercises, and with assessing trainee performance.

Its modular agents support a wide variety of cyber platforms and missions, eliminating the need for expensive or inadequate custom-built solutions.

Stereo graphics and imagery have benefited molecular modeling, medical visualization microscopy, and engineering design. What has not been studied is the potential for stereoscopic interactive displays, where the depth of stereo graphics and symbology alerts the operator and declutters the display.    Stereo symbology in the JSF HMD could help organize visual information and direct operator attention to improve performance and lower workload. Our concepts for stereo HMD symbology include offsetting a warning symbol in depth, modulating this change in depth as a function of time, grouping symbols and information in depth, and guiding the operator in 3D space.    In our Phase I effort, we worked with the JSF symbol set to derive appropriate symbology to examine stereo cueing, reviewed eyestrain data and developed stereo concepts with input from pilots and engineers familiar with HMDs.  These Phase I efforts set the foundation for the development of stereo symbology for aircraft use in a Phase II effort.  BENEFIT:  We believe the benefits of stereo symbology, if proven effective, are:   Increased pilot situational awareness, with direction to target/friendly/wingman/base illustrated in 3 dimensions   Reduced accidents due to missed warning symbology presented on the HMD   Quicker and safer egress due to better pathway in the sky symbology   Reduced disorientation in poor visibility",

Risk reduction testing will be carried out to mature these technologies in preparation for flight testing in Phase III.  BENEFIT:  The saleable product resulting from this research will be a low cost marketable test and evaluation capability not readily available for ramjet/scramjet powered vehicles.  The traditional approach to full-scale hypersonic engine development often begins with subscale component development ground tests leading to full-scale engine ground testing prior to full-scale flight-testing.  Moving from subscale to full-scale or ground to flight both incur significant costs. Our modular low cost flight test technique will permit developers of hypersonic propulsion systems to flight test their vehicle and/or engine in sub-scale early in the developmental cycle to assess thrust and operability performance among other things.  In a synergistic application with computational simulations and ground testing, this crucial flight data will provide a clear path to full-scale flight testing and development with reduced risk and cost. In addition, our modular system could allow testing at more than one scale by moving up in booster class to determine any scale effects early in the program.  Our primary target market for this test capability product is the developmental programs for hypersonic airbreathing propulsion systems that have recently started or will be starting.  Expansion of the applicability of the technology beyond hypersonic airbreathing propulsion is a natural extension of this effort.  Many technical areas including aerodynamic decelerators, re-entry vehicles, and other non-propulsion fields will benefit from the results of this modular design architecture and these customers will be actively pursued.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  CubeSats provide a new, low-cost platform for space weather missions.  They enable new mission paradigms, such as the ability to perform multiple measurements of the same physical phenomena globally from several satellites, in contrast to high-accuracy measurements of multiple phenomena on the same spacecraft.  Flight-tested neutral wind sensors must be miniaturized to fit into these much smaller platforms.  Creare and its partners propose to develop a CubeSat-compatible neutral wind sensor for making vector neutral wind measurements in the thermosphere from a single CubeSat platform.  The proposed sensor builds on demonstrated sensing concepts and innovative technology to significantly reduce size, weight, and power.  Our proposed sensor will fit into a 1U cube (10 cm by 10 cm by 10 cm) volume for integration into a 3U CubeSat, which would include all of the required subsystems necessary to obtain accurate vector neutral wind measurements from orbit altitudes between 90 and 500 km.  BENEFIT:  This technology represents a breakthrough advancement that will enable the gathering of scientific data about the neutral winds in the thermosphere that was previously very difficult or expensive to achieve.  This data will enable improved modeling of satellite drag and radio wave scintillation as the neutral wind drivers are better understood.  Potential spinoffs of the sensor technology include application of the space-compatible field-emission technology to other space environmental and industrial sensors.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In our Phase 1 SBIR effort (Discourse Analysis for Insights into Group Identity and Intent), SAE conducted a pilot study to assess whether its suite of natural language processing techniques could be adapted to automatically extract meaningful discourse measures from extremist group literature (cognitive complexity, idea density, vocabulary diversity, and sentiments expressed toward in and out-groups). We also demonstrated that these discourse indicators significantly increased our ability to predict future extremist group attacks, at least in the case of the Peoples War Group (PWG) in India.  In Phase 2 of the project, we propose to extend this line of work by (1) refining our measures and assessing their generalizability to other English-speaking groups (2) assessing the extent to which we can automatically process discourse in multiple western (French and Spanish) and non-Western (Urdu, Pashto, Mandarin, and Arabic) foreign languages and (3) developing a prototype system that will allow analysts to apply our techniques themselves in useful ways to enhance their missions.  BENEFIT:  Military and intelligence analysts (i.e., the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), routinely scrutinize statements, blog postings, videos and other literature generated by extremist organizations for clues about their future potential and intent to engage in violent attacks on US interests.  This is a painstaking, labor-intensive process to identify what are often subtle shifts in rhetorical expositions.  Moreover, even well-trained analysts will have difficulty systematically assessing how changes in one discourse indicator interact with changes in other discourse indicators, and how these interactions are likely to affect the probability of increases in violent attacks.  If current trends continue, volume of extremist literature should continue to increase, while budgetary pressures reduce manpower allocations required to keep up with it. Our automated Discourse analysis system could be a significant asset to the extent that it could be applied in near real time to monitor trends and shifts in the use of discourse mechanisms across multiple organizations using multiple languages, and cue the analysts to specific document clusters that may require a more thorough examination and a more focused, nuanced interpretation.  Thus, rather than spending 90% of their time collecting data and 10% of their time assessing it, with the aid of our tools, we can alter this ratio in a more cost-effective and useful direction.",

It is radiation-hardened, passively and actively, to minimize damage during orbit while still maintaining spacecraft power requirements during/after fault events. In Phase I POC conducted system-level analyses and conducted trade studies to validate the electronic circuit design, source selection, thermal and radiation shielding architecture, and overall power management concept. We demonstrated system capability with a TRL-2/-3 prototype and conducted in-house testing. In Phase II, POC will fabricate and deliver a flexible engineering demonstration unit capable of delivering reliable power with variable loads and identify radiation-sensitive components and methods of shielding for spacecraft applications. POC will demonstrate multiple SPM units managing a variety of space-qualified battery sources such as those from Yardney Lithion and integrate shielding on the component and system levels. In-house testing will include exposure to radiation sources to validate, at TRL-5, RHAMP&quot;s ability to withstand the rigors of space flight.  BENEFIT:  The RHAMP system provides a modular and flexible, radiation-hardened, power management system for a variety of spacecraft and satellite applications that will ultimately reduce high life-cycle costs that are crippling current space programs. This technology has applications in a variety of military sectors, including power management of the myriad of wearable electronics currently used by the dismounted warfighter.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Glint Photonics will develop advanced prototypes of the Spatially Controlled Opto-Fluidic Attenuator (SCOFA), a new type of optical element that can addressably and selectively block incoming light over arbitrary areas. The SCOFA is an array of shutter pixels, each of which contains a small droplet of light-blocking fluid. Electrowetting actuation is used to modulate each light valve, toggling the light-blocking fluid between two states: a round droplet shape that leaves most of the pixel area transparent, and a thin opaque film that blocks incident light with&gt;50dB attenuation. In this Phase II program, arrays of optimized shutter elements will be designed, fabricated, and tested.  BENEFIT:  The Spatially Controlled Opto-Fluidic Attenuator (SCOFA) is designed to improve the imaging capabilities of airborne and space-based camera sensors in sun-facing orientations or high-glare situations. Optical sensors have a limited dynamic range, so the presence of bright sources in the field of view can prevent the sensor from resolving other, dimmer, elements in the scene. By selectively blocking out the light from bright sources, the SCOFA will allow sensors to devote their full dynamic range to the remainder of the scene. The ability to provide high-quality data in these difficult imaging conditions would expand intelligence-gathering and targeting capabilities, allowing US forces to operate with greater speed, flexibility, and accuracy. Numerous other applications are also possible, in both military and civilian uses. Airborne imagers are increasingly used by domestic law enforcement agencies, and also find application in agriculture, forestry, and other fields. Each of these applications could benefit from the SCOFA in order to provide better imagery in high-glare situations.",

There is a need for thermal batteries that have higher energy density and power density, and longer run time than the state of the art batteries, which use micron-scale particles in the cathode, anode and electrolyte. In the Phase I program, we demonstrated the advantages of using engineered nanoscale particles as the cathode. High purity, nanosized iron disulfide was produced using both a wet chemical method and a solid state process. Cell level testing showed a greater than 50% decrease in impedance when nanoparticles were used, implying that substantially higher power densities are possible in the nanomaterial-enabled thermal battery. Nearly 20 percent increase in run time was also observed. The goal of the Phase II program is to advance the Technology Readiness Level to 5 by scaling up the cathode nanoparticle synthesis process, and fabricating and testing prototype thermal batteries of specifications currently used by the US Navy.Additionally, the structure and composition of the cathode will be optimized to maximize performance. The proposed effort is collaboration with a leading US manufacturer of thermal batteries.

During Phase II, we will accomplish four technical objectives. First, we will complete development of a fully functioning software system with tailored teacher and student user interfaces. Second, we will conduct pre-pilot usability testing with K-5th grade students and teachers. Third, we will conduct field testing to pilot the full product with K-5th grade students and teachers in authentic educational settings. The fourth and final objective will\nbe preparing the Assess2Progress system for commercial dissemination.",

        "abstract": "Scoliosis, a condition where there is lateral curvature of the spine, affects an estimated 6 million people in the United States. There is widespread use of bracing for treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, and recent studies have begun documenting its efficacy. These studies have indicated that user compliance is a large, yet largely unquantified, factor in successful outcomes.  There are two factors that comprise wear compliance: (1) the quantity of wear (i.e., wear time) and (2) the quality of wear (i.e., tightness of fit). Without both criteria being met, the effectiveness of the brace treatment is compromised. The Intelligent Brace for Scoliosis will utilize advanced MEMS technology to measure the pressure applied by the brace to determine both the quality and quantity of fit. The goal is to provide real-time monitoring and data logging to help both the patient and clinician determine if, and when, a brace is being worn effectively.  The patient will get immediate feedback if the brace is improperly adjusted to help them obtain optimal fit and maximum benefit from the brace. The daily wear time will be logged and available to the clinician, enabling them to ensure the prescription is being followed and intervene when necessary.",

        "abstract": "Pongee Channa sp. are an esteemed freshwater food fish in Asia, Hawaii, and domestic Asian seafood markets. Traditional customer preference is for a live product. However, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service banned the import and interstate transport of live Channidae in 2002. Therefore, the only options to market Hawaii-grown pongee outside of its established range on Oahu, Hawaii are as fresh chilled, frozen, and value-added products. Hawaii Fish Company (HFC) &amp; #39;s long-term marketing goal is to have Hawaiian pongee become recognized as the world &amp; #39;s finest Channa, in the way that Copper River salmon is marketed as the world &amp; #39;s finest salmon. HFC &amp; #39;s Phase I research confirmed the feasibility of marketing fresh and processed Hawaii-grown pongee products to local Asian seafood markets and restaurants and to fine-dining Hawaiian fusion cuisine restaurants in Honolulu, in lieu of the now prohibited live Channa imports, and to the Hawaii visitor industry with the development of a shelf-stable product line. It also confirmed the feasibility of addressing two customer-identified pongee appearance issues, fish coloration at harvest and management of post-harvest slime release. The Phase II research and development effort will examine options to improve the production protocols and nutritional value of Hawaii-grown pongee, to develop humane slaughter procedures, to develop and assess alternative processing options and products, to conduct sensory evaluations to refine processing procedures, and to develop, test, and evaluate packaging, logo, and branding options appropriate to specific premium pongee products for carefully identified markets. These research and development efforts will support HFC &amp; #39;s Phase III commercialization plans to produce and market Hawaii-grown pongee to Honolulu &amp; #39;s Asian seafood &quot;niche markets&quot; and fine-dining restaurants, to Hawaii &amp; #39;s large visitor market, and, in the future, to similar domestic and regional export markets.",

        "abstract": "Low Crawling Fruit: High Quality, Clean, Sustainable Protein Created From Insects Food reserves are the lowest they &amp; #39;ve been in 40 years. As the human population grows, it is ever more important to sustain rather than increase our levels of consuming and harvesting materials from the earth and its ecosphere. Animal based nutrients, specifically protein, are critical for health, yet already about 70% of agricultural land, and 30% of the total land on earth, is used to raise livestock. Amid the ever expanding human population and demand on natural resources, the market for protein is exploding. The global market for protein products was over $15 billion in 2012 and growing by 30% in 5 years. Fortunately, insects provide a fantastic solution to meet the world &amp; #39;s nutritional needs. In contrast to the large land footprint required to create other sources of protein, insects can be grown in small, clean facilities. Additionally, insects require far less food and water per gram of protein produced while giving off much less greenhouse gas emission compared to traditional livestock. Insects are also a very clean and healthy source of protein rich nutrition. They are very high in complete, highly digestible protein, high in omega 3 fatty acids and low in unhealthy fats. Additionally, common food borne pathogens such as Salmonella, E. coli, Listeria and Staphylococcus aureus have not been detected in US farmed insects to date. Best of all, consumers are interested. Media outlets, such as Fox News, Huffington Post, New Yorker and Washington Post have all published articles about this promising nutrition source. We expect that our project, and the overall success of insect-based foods, will revolutionize the food and agricultural industries while spurring economic development and job creation in both rural and urban communities.The current USDA SBIR Phase II project is intended to support the development of All Things Bugs LLC &amp; #39;s patented processes for turning insects into a high quality protein ingredient that is substantially richer in nutrients than other alternatives at a comparable price. We will optimize the high quality protein product developed during Phase I and address barriers to market. This project will address several critical aspects of All Things Bugs LLC &amp; #39;s insect-derived ingredients toward addressing customer, regulatory and industry interests including: 1) shelf-life of insect powder as well as food products containing it, 2) performance of insect powder in the context of multiple end products and formulations, 3) improving insect powder production efficiency and cost, 4) food safety aspects such as allergen, microbe and toxin content and 5) improving overall insect powder ingredient quality (texture, functionality, etc.). These (powders, pastes or liquids) have a very wide range of commercial applications in the human food, animal/pet feed and nutraceutical industries including: fortified dry goods, fortified protein supplement powders, high protein fortified porridges and cereals, &quot;meat&quot; substitutes, chitosan (nutraceutical derived from chitin), high protein beverages, protein fortified bars and powders for athletes as well as numerous types of snack foods. Synergy between our high quality insect-based food ingredient research and our marketing strategies will overcome market barriers, both cultural and technological, to the utilization of insects as a cleaner, healthier and more sustainable protein source. These innovations by All Things Bugs LLC will incentivize the growth of an entirely new area of agriculture in the US: farming of insects for human consumption.",

        "abstract": "Low dissolved oxygen levels are the most frequent cause of catastrophic fish mortalities in aquaculture farming, resulting in substantial dollar losses of valuable aquaculture crops annually. To address this problem, the U.S. aquaculture industry most often uses floating paddlewheels and/or aspirating aerators for nightly or continuous aeration and circulation of aquafarm waters. However, power consumption with the use of these powerful devices results in high electrical operating costs whichnegatively impacts farm operating costs and profitability. Low-energy submerged diffuser aeration and destratification systems have been shown to be a very efficient and economical means of pond and lakebed destratification and aeration. The greatly reduced power requirement of such systems provides an opportunity to combine an appropriately sized diffuser aeration system with a suitable renewable energy power source, and significantly reduce or eliminate the high recurrent electrical cost of operating traditional aquaculture pond aeration systems. The Phase I feasibility research effort investigated the performance ofselected off-the shelf renewable energy aeration components. The Phase II research and development effort will investigate two renewable energy aquaculture and aquaponic aeration systems, and design, construct, and field-testing non-optimized working prototypes of each.

        "abstract": "Well over 50 % of US land area constitutes low wind-speed sites, yet current wind turbines are not effective in low winds. To extract significantly more energy from such DOE Class 1 or Class 2 wind sites requires substantially increasing turbine blade rotor diameter (wind power is proportional to the square of the blade diameter).Recently, we have successfully demonstrated advanced low-RPM generators for small wind turbines that can be utilized with significantly extended length blades to economically produce power in currently un-served low to moderate windspeed sites, and to significantly lower generation costs and increase energy production in higher windspeed sites as well. However, for such oversized blade rotors, adequate and efficient overspeed control (which is a critically important turbine function), is both more difficult and more important than usual, and there are currently no durable cost effective means of doing this.To address this problem, we propose to further investigate an innovative overspeed-resistant blade design and construct and test a demonstration turbine with significantly extended length blades utilizing a novel 2-stage overspeed control method that is robust and inexpensive, and that is facilitated by the new blade design. The overall project goal is to develop a horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) to:1. Cost-effectively operate within low to moderate windspeed sites where other wind turbines are impractical,2. Provide substantially shorter payback periods within higher windspeed sites as well,3. Operate more quietly as a result of the lower RPM (turbine noise is proportional to the fifth power of the blade tip speed),4. Provide less variable power generation from the daily and seasonal wind speed variations.",

        "abstract": "ORPCproposes a project that will alter fossil fuel use and energy economics in remote off-grid river communities. The project will allow conversion of hydrokinetic river energy, a vast renewable resource that is underutilized, into an economical, reliable source of clean electricity for river communities. ORPC will accomplish this by optimizing the prototype RivGen &amp; reg; Power System design for the lower speed river currents that are prevalent throughout the world. The proposed new design will also significantly improve the prototype system &amp; #39;s overall efficiency, making it a viable alternative to fossil fuel generation in river communities.This project directly results in reduced greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprints. A distinguishing feature of ORPC &amp; #39;s RivGen &amp; reg; Power System is that it can be incorporated into isolated power grids that currently rely on diesel generators, which have a disproportionately high carbon output compared to other power generation systems. By harnessing river currents and delivering the power to community grids, the RivGen &amp; reg; Power System offsets the use of diesel fuel and can allow the diesel generators to shut off entirely. Because the RivGen &amp; reg; Power System uses no fossil fuels and produces no emissions, its use can greatly reduce a community &amp; #39;s greenhouse gas emissions and overall carbon footprint. For example, when fully commercialized, the use of a single RivGen &amp; reg; Power Systems to replace electricity generated using diesel fuel would result in the annual production of 190,000 kWh of electricity (utilizing resource data from Kvichak River at Igiugig, AK), and the yearly avoidance of 315,000 pounds (157.5 tons) of CO2 emissions per year.

        "abstract": "Female rainbow trout show improved uniformity of growth, more desirable carcass traits and reduced expression of sexual maturation compared to mixed-sex stocks, thus improving efficiency and return for the trout farming industry. As a result, all-female stocks are much more desirable, and currently comprise the vast majority (over 90%) of the rainbow trout sold in the US. Current methods of producing all-female stocks involve the use of small amounts of hormones to effectively convert genetically female trout into functional males, which in turn are used to create all-female offspring. The use of hormones for this purpose is continually being evaluated by the FDA, however the ability to use the hormones long term is not certain. Thus, an alternative method for production of all-female stocks is needed to ensure future efficiency and stability of rainbow trout aquaculture.In our rainbow trout breeding populations we have identified rare individuals who are genetically female yet they produce functional male gonads despite having never receiving hormone treatments. They are thought to contain a genetic variant which, through selective breeding, we have harnessed and intend to utilize for production of all-female rainbow trout. Crossing these rare males with normal females produces 100% female offspring. This alternative method of producing all-female rainbow trout will be evaluated for large scale production, and identification of the genetic mechanisms involved will offer insight into sex differentiation in trout and other species. Should the new method prove viable for production of all-female rainbow trout without the use of hormones, it would ensure continued efficiency and stability of rainbow trout aquaculture.",

The overall goal of our project is to test the feasibility of combining selected new technologies for the commercial production of walleye for food fish and for extended growth fingerlings for stocking. For food fish production we propose to compare the growth, production traits and production costs of hybrid walleye raised to food size in one year in RAS using intensive tank versus conventional pond/tank fry-fingerling production methods. For extended growth fingerling production we propose to compare: 1) the growth and production traits of walleye raised in RAS using advanced versus normal intensive fry-fingerling production methods; and 2) the growth, production traits and production costs of walleye using intensive tank versus conventional pond/tank fry-fingerling production methods. For both food fish and extended growth fingerling production we will determine which method, the intensive tank or the traditional pond/tank method, is the most efficacious and cost effective for producing small fingerlings. We will determine the extent to which advanced spawning, compared to traditional in-season spawning, is an effective method for producing larger extended growth walleye fingerlings. Finally, we will develop accurate and detailed break-even production cost information of using RAS to raise hybrid walleye to food size and extended growth walleye fingerlings for stocking. We are convinced that our results will lead to new, profitable aquaculture strategies in the North Central region.

        "abstract": "Aquaculture is the fastest growing segment in U.S. food production, and in 2011 NOAA estimated that the U.S. aquaculture industry was worth $1.2 billion. The FAO estimates that aquaculture will soon overtake captured fisheries as a source of food fish. The rapid global expansion of aquaculture has led to a corresponding increase in demand for fish meal protein, the primary ingredient in aquaculture feeds. Meanwhile, the harvest of species used to produce fish meal has been on a steady decline over the last decade due to the same over-exploitation that has impacted fish/shellfish production. These trends are unsustainable, as aquaculture will soon consume the entire fish meal resource. This is reflected in the rapid escalation of fish meal prices (exceeding $2,000/MT in some cases) which are already affecting the profitability of aquaculture operations. Adding to this problem are competing uses for fish meal in other livestock and companion animal feeds. Consequently, there is a significant market opportunity for a high quality, economical plant protein concentrate to replace fish meal in aquaculture and other feed markets.Distillers &amp; #39; dried grains with solubles (DDGS) has been tested as a partial replacement for fish meal, however the relatively low protein content and less than desirable amino acid profile have limited inclusion rates to low levels. In our Phase I study, Prairie AquaTech showed that our High Protein DDGS (HP-DDGS) performed substantially better in relative growth performance compared to unconverted DDG. Recent modifications to our microbial conversion process resulted in enhanced HP-DDGS protein levels that we expect will result in growth performance metrics more comparable to fish meal. This Phase II project will further develop and commercialize this innovative process through the following objectives: &amp; bull; Optimize the HP-DDGS production process, and scale-up to the pilot scale level; &amp; bull; Test the resultant HP-DDGS as a replacement for fish meal in grower diets; &amp; bull; Validate process costs and energy requirements for the pilot scale system; and &amp; bull; Complete initial steps for commercial scale-up and deployment.This will involve the coordinated efforts of our experienced team of scientists, engineers, and business development specialists whose comparable work to develop a high protein soybean meal replacement for fish meal (PisciZyme &amp; trade;) has already received national awards and is transitioning through an NSF SBIR Phase II award into commercialization.Commercial deployment of the proposed HP-DDGS product will further increase the availability of plant-based proteins as direct replacements for animal-based proteins, which are costly, over-exploited, and generally unsustainable. This technology will also bring more value to and higher use of the chief by-product of U.S. corn ethanol production, of which one third is currently exported. This innovation will increase U.S. food supply security by providing domestic aquaculture producers with a lower cost and more sustainable replacement for imported fishmeal, while increasing their economic competitiveness. This will encourage industry expansion as supported by current USDA, NOAA, and Department of Commerce initiatives.",

        "abstract": "Worldwide, there is ever increasing demand for quality milk products and its consumption crosses all nationalities and socio-economic classes. Milk is the cornerstone of a balanced diet and is consumed abundantly in both developed and developing countries providing a source of nutrients in a vehicle that is easily consumed. Additionally, in the United States, hundreds of thousands of jobs are created through milking, processing and distribution, both for domestic and international sales, creating a $30 billion dollar a year industry. Safe, desirable milk is at the core of this industry.Mastitisis the persistent, inflammatoryreaction of the udder to an irritant, which is many times caused by teat bacterial contamination.It affects milk production, causes milk to be unsuitable for consumption or export and is potentially fatal. It is the most common and costly disease in the dairy industry both in the United States and worldwide and accounts for a significant loss of milk. The treatment protocols currently used may render milk unsuitable through high antmicrobial or antibiotic residue. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations predicts that there needs to be a doubling of the global food production by 2050 to satisfy the increasing population. Milk represents a vital nutrient source and maintaining chemically and biologically safe milk in the face of ever increasing demand will be difficult. With milk production an integral part of the world &amp; #39;s food supply, it is apparent that control of Mastitis and environmental bacterial contamination demands innovative methods to stem or reduce the loss of cows, milk and associated products.Working in conjunction with the clinicians and researchers at Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, a premier Mastitis research facility, I2 Air Fluid Innovations will evaluate the effects that I2infusion has on reducing microbes on cow teats and in fluids. I2infusion is the introduction of low dose iodine vapor, as a bubble, into a fluid to inactivate microbes. Although iodine is a well accepted antimicrobial for dairy applications, it has never been used in this manner. We will use approved and conventional methods to determine the protocol &amp; #39;s efficacy using conditions similar to those found on both industrial and rural farms. We will determine if I2 infusion improves current disinfectant techniques and minimizes antimicrobial residues thus reducing the occurances of Mastitis whileproviding more desirable milk. Blending varied commercially available disinfectants with I2 infusion may improve their efficacy thus providing a new weapon for use against resistant microbes. The Quality Milk Production Services (QMPS) at Cornell University, with whom we will becollaborating, is a significant source for Mastitis research and information. This relationship provides an excellent conduit for the data generated by this study to other educational centers and industry. The protocols developed through this study could reduce the incidence of Mastitisworldwide, along with its associated costs, and improve the availability of safe, desirable milk for all societies. The technology would have the far reaching benefits in other industries and sciences where microbe control, without high biocide use, is desirable.",

        "abstract": "Intramammary infection (a.k.a., mastitis) is the largest attributable cause of lost productivity, discarded milk, chronic morbidity, and prophylactic antibiotic use in the dairy industry. The majority of new infections are associated with the dry period, during which the udders are temporarily engorged with milk that often leaks from the teat ends. Furthermore, the three major agencies of the U.S. government with responsibilities associated with food safety (USDA, FDA, CDC) have clearly articulated the concern that antibiotic use in agriculture to treat and prevent mastitis, poses threats to food safety, and to the health of agricultural workers. The technology described in this proposal enhances the naturally occurring dry-off signals within the mammary glands, and will reduce the engorgement of the udder, lowering the risk of mastitis. Our development of a rapid dry-off agent is expected to have two salutary effects on animal health: enhance the effectiveness of therapeutic antibiotics used in cows with subclinical mastitis at dry-off, and prevent new infections in cows that enter dry-off without mastitis. The overall objective of this Phase I SBIR project is to continue the development of an effective non-antibiotic dairy cow dry-off formulation. Results from the Phase I SBIR project identified additional candidate compounds with the desired physiological effect. For the Phase II grant, we intend to conduct field studies on a newer, second-generation formulation to begin an iNAD application with the FDA. We predict the second-generation formulation will be economically viable and a more effective formulation. Furthermore, testing of the formulation will identify a target dose for large scale manufacturing efforts.",

        "abstract": "Respiratory tract infection in pigs, commonly referred to as &quot;Porcine Respiratory Disease Complex (PRDC)&quot;, is a major challenge for the swine industry as it causes significant production and economic losses to producers worldwide. Timely detection of causative agents is required to minimize the spread of infection and reduce economic loses. Current diagnostic methods such as ELISA and PCR are not suitable for field use because of the need for expensive equipment, highly-trained personnel, and a specialized laboratory. At present, no rapid molecular diagnostic kit is available for veterinary use in the field or in small clinics that lack infrastructural support. To address this unmet need, we propose to develop an easy to use &quot;sample-to-answer&quot; molecular diagnostic device for penside detection of the three viral pathogens associated with PRDC: porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSv), swine influenza virus (SIV), and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2).The proposed assay will be based on loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) using Lucigen &amp; #39;s proprietary thermostable OmniAmp &amp; reg; polymerase, and performed on a simple, easy to use automated molecular detection platform currently being developed by Lucigen. Total assay time will be 40 minutes with minimal hands-on time and without need of any additional equipment, such as pipettes, centrifuge etc. Results will be displayed on-screen as positive or negative for a specific pathogen, minimizing error &amp; #39;s caused by user interpretation. This diagnostic device has been designed keeping in mind that people without any specialized training can use it to perform the assay. Once developed, this technology will be used to rapidly develop diagnostic assays for point of care detection of additional veterinary pathogens.During Phase I, we demonstrated feasibility of LAMP assay to detect PRRSv (NA and EU), PCV-2, and SIV (H1N1 and H3N2). The sensitivity of the assays was equivalent to respective real time PCR assays. To facilitate penside testing, we also developed a rapid sample preparation method for extraction of nucleic acid from serum and oral fluid samples. For Phase II studies, our goal is to further optimize the sample preparation method and integrate it with the molecular detection platform being developed. The proposed molecular diagnostic device has three components:1). a sample collection module containing extraction buffer.2). a reaction cartridge.3). the instrument.The cartridge contains the port for nucleic acid extraction, a port for dried LAMP master mix and 16-wells which can be filled with target-specific primers. The cartridge is placed into the instrument which automatically performs all the necessary steps such as sample extraction, thermal incubation and fluorescent detection to generate a positive or negative result for the specific target, or an invalid run.Successful completion of this project will lead to:? Development of molecular diagnostic device for penside detection of PRRSv, SIV, and PCV2.? Total assay time of 40 minutes including sample preparation.? Detection of up to 3 pathogens (PRRSv, SIV, and PCV-2) in a single run.? Dried reagents for storage at ambient temperature.? Simple, easy to use device, with digital read-out and no user interpretation required.? A technology platform that can be used for detection of other pathogens.Development of this innovative molecular diagnostic device will significantly improve the ability of producers to monitor the health of their animals in real time without incurring significant testing costs. Use of this technology will be economically beneficial to producers as this will allow them to test samples penside, saving them money in terms of testing and shipping costs as well as time. Also, enhanced access to in-the-field diagnosis of pathogens will improve",

SGS is comprised of a set of informative markers distributed sparsely (in order to keep the cost to $20) and evenly throughout the genome. We envision that imputation from the genotypes produced from a SGS can replace most of the other types of genotyping that seedstock breeders currently invest in (parentagetesting or determination, genetic defect testing, qualitative trait testing, and prediction of genetic merit for quantitative traits). With information from SGS, inheritance can be tracked throughout the genome and throughout a large, pedigreed population.

        "abstract": "Use of high-concentrate diets in cattle production is a common practice in the United States to maximize production efficiency, enhance meat quality, and minimize meat and milk cost of production. Transition from high-fiber to high-concentrate diets is challenging and put the animals at risk for acidosis. Megastarter LLC is commercializing a liquid Megasphaera elsdenii culture, Lactipro, helping cattle during that transition. Several key factors have limited Lactipro widespread adoption by beef and dairy producers, including the current short shelf life of 14 days and the large dose volume. Phase I research demonstrated cold storage of Lactipro with osmoprotectants and concentration with a filtration system to be feasible. The objective of our Phase II program is to develop a concentrated, lyophilized, second generation Lactipro with extended shelf life and reduced dose size. Phase II research will first implement the filtration system in our production line to concentrate the culture and then investigate optimal freeze drying protocols and storage by testing different combinations of cryoprotectants, freezing treatments, freeze drying cycles, and storage conditions. The most promising combination will then be tested in vivo to confirm efficacy in feedlot cattle.Success of the Phase II research will lead to the commercialization of a second generation Lactipro, which will facilitate adoption by our customers. Extended shelf life and decreased dose size will allow for easier logistics and administration, considerably enhancing end user satisfaction. Additionally, it will permit shipping to non-domestic markets, hence protecting manufacturing trade secrets, creating jobs, and benefiting the American economy.",

        "abstract": "Whenever biodiesel is made, ten percent of the reaction is the by-product glycerol (also called glycerin). Glycerol has many uses, but it is not a fuel: burning glycerol in any engine will cause irreversible damage. So glycerol must be removed from biodiesel before it can be sold or used. ASTM Intermational, the trade association that sets standards for purity of many industrial products, has set the limit of glycerol in biodiesel at 0.02 percent. There is no wuick and easy way to measure the glycerol content of biodiesel. NECi has identified an enzyme that can do the job. In order to make the test practical, commercial quantities of enzyme of consistently reliable quality is needed. The goal of this project is to develop protein expression processes for making pure and stable enzyme. At the same time, we will develop reagents and simple test kits. Reagents are targeted to biodiesel process development groups and producers. Simple kits for use on site are aimed at small scale producers such as on-farm sites, and fuel testers. The goals will help producers design better fuel production processes, help regulatory personnel monitor fuel QC, and prevent engine damage from partially purified biodiesel.

        "abstract": "The expansion of the ethanol industry has led to the wide spread availability and economic pricing of distillers grains (DGS), resulting in significant amounts of DGS being commonly included in animal diets. DGS typically replaces corn and protein supplements in the ration, but is has a much higher phosphorus concentration than corn. Therefore, the inclusion of DGS in livestock rations can significantly increase the phosphorus content in the excreted manure. Reducing the concentration of phosphorus in DGS would reduce the amount of excess phosphorus being fed to livestock, thereby decreasing any risk of surface water pollution from manure phosphorus.This project aims build upon the success of the Phase I project by conducting further research and development aimed at recovering excess phosphorus from ethanol condensed thin stillage (CTS). The system will remove soluble phosphorus from CTS, by converting it to the insoluble magnesium phosphate compound. The removed phosphorus would be a useful fertilizer for field crops or horticultural use. Similar technology has already been successfully used to remove phosphorus from liquid manure at confined animal feeding operations. Removing phosphorus at the ethanol plant would be more efficient, and impact a larger number of livestock operations at minimal (if any) cost to the livestock producer. Phase I results indicate that a reduction of soluble phosphorus in the CTS by 72% could decrease the excreted phosphorus at a beef feedlot by 36% when fed at 40% dry matter inclusion rate in common feedlot rations. There is no other beef feedlot management practice or technology available to reduce the excreted phosphorus so substantially while maintaining the same ration.This project will determine the reactor configuration, equipment needs, and operating conditions required for successful operation at an ethanol plant, as well as determine the fertilizer production at those optimal settings and normal conditions. The project will also test the fertilizer efficacy relative to common commercial fertilizers. Successful completion of the project would put KEMA in a position to license the technology for full-scale, commercial production.",

        "abstract": "In the United States population increases and economic growth are imposing ever-increasing demands on limited water resources. It is critical that the demand for food is met, and that precious water resources are protected for the agricultural economy to be robust and growing. Protecting and restoring surface and ground water resources for drinking and other uses is a major challenge while maintaining the increasing demand for higher crop yields and increased meat production through confined animal feeding operations (CAFO &amp; #39;s). The USDA and EPA recognize that CAFO &amp; #39;s, if not managed responsibly, can negatively impact human health and the environment (USDA/EPA, 1999). This is particularly important for nitrate and nitrite contamination resulting from agricultural operations that are contaminating groundwater supplies for drinking water in rural community well systems.Micronic Technologies &amp; #39; innovative water treatment system, MicroDesalTM, has treated drinking water and wastewater significantly reducing pollutants including heavy metals, which are found in animal feed, as well as nutrients such as nitrates and nitrites and phosphorus. This new technology also effectively removes bacteria and other toxic contaminants. The removal of nitrates and nitrites is critical for the agricultural community, as the EPA has identified these as major pollutants for a number of the nation &amp; #39;s major watersheds such as Chesapeake Bay, Great Lakes, Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi River watersheds (EPA, 2013). The application of this technology in agricultural operations could benefit the farm community &amp; #39;s challenge in finding cost-effective solutions to protect and restore the water resources on which they depend.In Phase I of this program Micronic Technologies &amp; #39; MicroDesalTM demonstrated the capability to significantly reduce nitrate and nitrite levels from eight selected nitrate and nitrite contaminated wells in central and southern Delaware using its bench prototype (2.1) with a capacity of 25 gallons per day (GPD). Water samples were collected, processed, and evaluated for the summer, fall and winter seasons at each well. The results of the treated water achieved reductions of &amp; gt;95% of the amount of nitrates and nitrites substantially below EPA drinking water standards.The purpose of the Phase II project is to increase the throughput capacity of the bench prototype, increase efficiencies and establish an ROI. Micronic will customize, engineer, build and test a field pilot with a capacity of 1500 GPD. Micronic has partnered with Tidewater Utilities, Inc. to install the 1500 GPD field pilot system into their rural community drinking water well at Laurel, Delaware known to have levels of nitrates above EPA drinking water standards. Other Phase II partners include the Delaware Office of Water and the Delaware Environmental and Natural Resources Enforcement Agency. Micronic Technologies &amp; #39; new flow bench will be used to evaluate scalability of the current system and optimize system components for final configuration. Tidewater Utilities will work with Micronic to develop a detailed plan for integrating the field pilot into the Laurel, DE community well. Testing will be conducted for a period of three to four months followed by an in-depth performance analysis; lessons learned will facilitate the construction of a commercialized unit. Phase II also includes development of a detailed commercialization plan that will lead to sales and manufacturing. A principal market will be rural community wells with contaminant levels exceeding EPA drinking water standards. Other markets in rural areas include treatment of hydraulic fracking water, acid mine drainage and landfill leachate all with negative environmental impacts and disposal issues. Micronic has identified large markets for 1500, 5000, 15,000 and 150,000 GPD units.",

Our technology offers an economic and practical alternative to fumigant soil disinfestation, offering pathogen/weed removal as effective as now provided by methyl bromide (MB) and more effective than alternative fumigants. MB has been classified as a Class I stratospheric ozone-depleting chemical whose continued use in the U.S. is only prolonged by critical use exemptions. The major exemption has been for the California strawberry industry, whose exceptionally high productivity is due to MB. A tractor-pulled high heat rate steam generator also offers potential for a range of other crops, organic production, and restricted sites that cannot be treated with fumigants.In Phase I we developed the design and demonstrated operation of a lightweight, low pressure catalytic combustor/steam generator. The catalytic combustor operates lean with very low emissions of CO and NOx, measured at &amp; lt;10 ppm each. Advantages include very high heat rate, the ability to use well water, low emissions, and high fuel efficiency due to the direct fire design, wherein the exhaust directly heats the water.

Trends in food, cosmetics, and textiles show consumers are concerned over the use of synthetic, petroleum-derived dyes and seek a more environmentally friendly option. However, manufacturers cannot compromise on quality, stability, or functionality of colorants in their products. Natural colorants from plants have been used as dyes for thousands of years, yet many potential dye crops and by-products of agricultural processing are not currently exploited as sources of textile colorants. This project seeks to determine the most efficient, environmentally friendly, and economic process to convert low-value raw plant material into an industry-ready, high quality colorant. The natural colorants produced as a result of this research will be safer for the environment, &quot;green&quot; the textile industry, and benefits U.S. farmers and foresters with access to a new market. We will develop storable, stable, shippable colorants from black walnut hulls and indigo plants. We will improve the technical extraction process and creating production protocols for these alternative crops. Stony Creek Colors will facilitate the entry of these value-added colorants, grown by small and medium size U.S. farmers and foresters, into the U.S. and export natural colorant market. The U.S. company that can create cost effective, machine-ready, andsustainably sourced dye extracts from known dye plant resources will open up high-growth markets by linking agricultural producers and the raw material supply chain with the end consumers demand, including textile and sewn-product manufacturers and dyehouses. Dozens of native and cultivated species contain natural colorants. However, raw material must be extracted intoa standardized and high quality colorant in order to reach industrial textile market, which has very specific product and performance needs. This project works across the natural colorant value chain to reach our commercialization goal: high quality U.S. grown colorants used in the textile industry. Reaching our goal of commercialization and market adoption of U.S. sources of natural colorants allows us to reach our desired outcomes: new and diversified income for farm and forestry communities and increased competitiveness of U.S. textile firms and rural industries.Stony Creek Colors is developing the compete agronomic supply chain for producing and processing U.S. grown natural colorants into reliable, high purity colorant through a scalable manufacturing process that will extend the reach of bio-based dyes into the industrial textile industry while benefiting small and medium size farmers in the Mid-South. Indigo will be a profitable and reliable crop for farmers in the Mid-South tobacco producing states, as it is well suited as a small acreage, high value crop.

        "abstract": "Commercial farms growing high value fruits and vegetables use shade structures to create protected environments. These growers benefit from bigger yields, better quality produce, fewer pests, timed crop growth, and resource conservation. Unfortunately, shade structure use is limited for many small and medium size farms who lack economy of scale. Commercial shade structures available today are very expensive to purchase and install as well as difficult and time-consuming to move. Thus, this SBIR project addresses an important need by evaluating the performance of a novel modular shading structure (MoSS) with a fabric management and hardware system that is affordable and adaptable to a variety of agricultural uses for high value fruit and vegetable production. The project objectives target improvements in production of these crops. Trellis Growing Systems (TGS) and its research partners will evaluate new methods using photo-selective nets in short-day and day-neutral strawberry transplant production for utility in timed fruit production. The use of MoSS toreduceenvironmental and biotic challenges will be appraised in southern highbush blueberry production. The effect of colored nets on yield, fruit quality and plant diseases will be assessed in bell pepper production. Shaded northern organic fruits (blueberry, raspberry, and blackberry) will be evaluated for quality, marketable yield and pest pressure. Research and field trial work will use different types of fabrics and MoSS configurations to meet a range of tasks such as changing light intensity and light quality, reducing wind and temperature effects, and excluding crop pests. Finally, performance evaluations and recommendations from the growers and researchers involved in this project will be used by TGS to finalize product design and costs.The expected outcome of this SBIR project will be commercialization of a modular shading structure with innovative features engineered as a result of research and development efforts by the USDA, university scientists, agricultural producers, and TGS. The MoSS system will use a family of components economically manufactured, easily configured to requirements, and distributed directly to growers of high value produce. The potential commercial applications are diverse. Strawberry nurseries can use this technology to manage transplant growth traits, such as plant height and flowering time, in a programmed fruit production system to meet periods of high consumer demand with far less reliance on chemical control techniques and costly labor-intensive practices. Blueberry producers can use this technology for temperature management in growing areas where current methods depend, many times, on the extensive use of harmful chemicals and valuable water resources. Such growing areas are found in central Florida and southern California, where high winter temperatures can prevent plants from getting dormancy requirements needed for good fruiting while low spring temperatures can cause crop loss due to frost and freeze damage. Growers of small fruits and vegetables, such as blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, and bell peppers, can use this technology to improve fruit yields and quality. Additionally, the low environmental impact and practicality of using MoSS to prevent damage from destructive birds and invasive pests, such as the Spotted Wing Drosophila (SWD), make it a valuable tool for many producers of healthy foods--especially small to medium size farmers who are the vast majority of the conventional and organic producers growing for local and regional markets. These applications will contribute to sustainable and profitable rural agricultural growth, especailly for small and medium size farming operations.",

        "abstract": "USDA secretary, Tom Vilsack, has urged the Forest Service to &quot;develop new markets&quot; for forest by-products, which encourage healthy timber management. WholeTrees &amp; reg; Structures (WT) is launching a manufacturing system that sources small diameter round timber from timber management cullings, tops, diseased and invasive trees, and urban forests. Whole Trees, a woman-owned company, markets these innovative round timber structural products as greener alternatives to steel and concrete in non-residential construction.This Phase II grant builds on WT &amp; #39;s previous SBIR efforts, in partnership with the USDA Forest Products Laboratory (FPL), at digitally mining the superior structural intelligence of trees. It is leading the development of the supply-chain, manufacturing and marketing of non-uniform round timbers. WT is applying new digital technologies to locate, scan and screen trees in forests, then inventory, engineer, and precisely manufacture them into structural assemblies. These tool and techniques will flow-through into marketing WT products in cloud-based Building Information Modeling (BIM) inventories for specification by building professionals. US forests, indeed world forests, have fewer large straight trees and increasing numbers of non-uniform small trees. Taken together, the tools and techniques WT is developing will catalyze restorative forestry businesses and innovative products in new green building markets.",

The goals of this contract are to advance the usefulness of phosphatidylethanol (PEth), an alcohol metabolite, as a clinical biomarker of alcohol consumption, by designing an antibody-based method of quantitation that ischeaper and more accessible to small hospitals and clinics than currently used chromatographic/ spectrophotometric methods. This contract is a continuation of a Phase II SBIR contract with Echelon Biosciences, Inc. It was awarded under SBIR solicitation PHS-2008-1, Topic 031. This effort is deemed to be non-severable.

According to WHO, 525,000 to 2.0 million African children die from Malaria every year. The current gold standard for diagnosis is examination of Giemsa stained smear by microscopy. However, when parasite levels are very low, or in mixed infections, the information obtained by examination of Giemsa stained smear by microscopy is limited. Under SBIR Phase II we have developed 3 kits, P-Genus, PF and PV FISH assay kits. These kits detect malaria parasites on blood smears prepared with a special reagent by Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization (FISH) technique, using specific fluorescent labeled DNA probes targeted to ribosomal RNA of viable parasites.

HSV-2 infection in the adult population has increased substantially in the past two decades despite the availability of antiviral drugs. Although long-term antiviral drug treatment can lowerthe frequency of viral shedding and severity of recurrences, compliance and potential decreases in HSV-specific immune responses are problematic. The failure of antiviral drugs to prevent the spread of HSV-2 and the sheer magnitude of the public health problem associated with HSV-2 infection indicates a need for a safe and effective vaccine.

Host defense proteins(HDPs) are naturally occurring, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents that have been examined recently for their utility as therapeutic antibiotics and antifungals. Chief among their strengths is that microbes do not generally develop resistance to these agents. Unfortunately, they are expensive to produce and are often sensitive to protease digestion.

Despite significant progress in our understanding of this disease and advances in the development of new therapeutic approaches, DMD remains a fatal disease.

While useful for mechanistic studies, dystrophic mice fail to develop the muscle weakness phenotype that is typical of DMD in patients. The canine models are more representative of human DMD, but are difficult to study due to extreme phenotypic variability. The canine models also suffer from a limited choice of mutations, significant expense, and social acceptance concerns. Therapeutic strategies that have shown promise in these m",

Preliminary findings in the ongoing NIH/SBIR Phase II study, after enrolling 258 patients in a single-site trial at the DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) in Houston, indicate a positive trend for the ABS to reduce the clinical incidence of prosthesis-related infection in hip replacement, posterior spinal fusion, and prosthetic vascular graft procedures.

Improvement in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of heart failure, along with the development of novel and safer vectors for gene delivery, have led to the identification of novel targets that are difficult to manipulate pharmacologically but may be more amenable to gene therapy. In the last few years calcium cycling abnormalities and specifically deficiencies in sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake have been hallmarks of advanced heart failure.

It is refractory to standard analgesic therapies, with all current neuropathic pain drugs providing relief to approximately 30% of patients. In addition, these drugs all have significant side effects. Consequently there is a clear unmet medical need for new safe and effective drugs to treat this serious and growing disorder.  Acadia Pharmaceuticals has discovered highly selective estrogen receptor beta (ER )-agonists that are highly efficacious in animal models of neuropathic pain. Because of their high selectivity for ER , they do not produce the feminizing side effects attributed to estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) activation and display many desirable attributes for a drug candidate: no apparent cardiovascular liability or mutagenicity risks, and little or no potential for drug-drug interactions. No apparent side effects were seen in rats receiving doses 10",

        "abstract": "Over one million women worldwide are diagnosed with breast cancer each year. Roughly 20% of all breast cancers overexpress the human epidennal growth receptor 2 (HER2-positive subtype). HER2-targeted therapies, including Herceptin and lapatinib, account for 55% of the breast cancer therapy market in 2011 (or $5 billion annually). Response to HER2-targeted therapies typically average about one year due to developed resistance. This represents an area of unmet clinical need. HER2 over-expression has been clearly linked to aggressive and abnonnal tumor growth, rapid metastases, and drug resistance in this cancer subtype. siRNA for knocking down HER2 offers a new treatment modality to overcome drug resistance. We are developing a novel nanoparticle platform for therapeutic siRNA delivery. Novelty lies in the hybrid polymeric-inorganic nanoparticles that take full advantage of both classes of materials to overcome siRNA delivery barriers (e.g., poor bioavailability, poor cellular uptake, and off-target effects) and enable large-scale manufacturing of the nanocontruct. This Phase I portion will optimize the nanoparticle platforms to achieve >70% knockdown ofHER2 in three HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines, leading to programmed death of the cancer cells, while having no adverse effect on HER2-negative cells or nonnal cells. The most optimized nanoparticle platform will undergo further in vivo evaluation in Phase II SBIR project.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop integrated voltage regulators (IVR) that are 10 times smaller than existing solutions. Power management ICs (PMICs) are chips in mobile electronic devices that deliver power from the battery to different chips (e.g., processor, memory). Existing PMICs use discrete board-level inductors to efficiently deliver power, but the problem is that inductors occupy a large area on the board. This is especially problematic in space-constrained mobile electronic devices. Mobile device manufacturers put tremendous amounts of effort to reduce square millimeters of board area to make room for additional semiconductor chips for new features. Using IVRs, mobile devices can have extra space that used to be dedicated to bulky discrete components for PMICs, and use that space to either include new chips for new features or increase the battery size for longer battery life. This project will first work on semiconductor test-chip prototypes that prove the idea of IVRs. Then, the next step is to demonstrate it in commercial mobile electronic devices. The goal of the project is to ship IVRs in high-volume smartphones and tablets by replacing existing PMICs. \n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in saving board area and processor power consumption in mobile devices, which is crucial for continued innovation in mobile devices. Mobile device manufacturers always look for new features to add in their next generation products to differentiate themselves from competitors. New features often need additional chips, but the problem is that there is simply no area left in the mobile devices for new chips. One way to solve this is to shrink the battery and leave more room for chips, but this is unacceptable since it reduces battery life. The only way to keep introducing new features and chips is to reduce the existing board area. IVRs solve this burning need of mobile devices. Using IVRs, phones and tablets will have extra space in their board to include new features such as micro-projectors and ultra-accurate motion sensing. The technology developed from this project is essential in allowing mobile devices to keep improving with new features. This project aims to have a big impact in the fast-growing smartphone and tablet market with 1 billion and 250 million in annual shipments, respectively.",
