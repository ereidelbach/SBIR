THE THERMAL DEGRADATION OF POLYMERS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IN POLYMER PROCESSING AND IN FIRE SAFETY, WHILE THE BIODEGRADATION BEHAVIOR IS AN IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN.

THIS DEVICE WOULD MONITOR THE ACOUSTIC ENVIRONMENT IN ORDER TO DETECT AND SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL SOUNDS FROM BACKGROUND NOISE AND FROM EACH OTHER. IT WOULD IDENTIFY FAMILIAR SOUNDS. IT WOULD DESCRIBE UNFAMILIAR SOUNDS IN TERMS OF THEIR SIMILARITY TO KNOWN SOUNDS AND IN QUALITATIVE TERMS RELATED TO PERCEPTUAL NOTIONS SUCH AS LOUDNESS, DURATION, PITCH, AND ABRUPTNESS. PHASE I HAS TWO GOALS. THE FIRST IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A NOVEL TECHNIQUE FOR LOCATING ACOUSTIC EVENTS IN A TIME-FREQUENCY-AMPLITUDE CONTINUUM. THE TECHNIQUE CLASSIFIES SMALL REGIONS OF THIS REPRESENTATION INTO FOUR FUNDAMENTAL CLASSES AND MERGES REGIONS INTO ACOUSTIC EVENTS USING RULES DERIVED SOLELY FROM PHYSICAL ACOUSTICS. THE SECOND GOAL IS TO VERIFY THE UTILITY OF A PERCEPTUALLY BASED REPRESENTATION FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF SOUNDS. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED REPRESENTATION WILL BE COMPARED TO THAT OF A TWO-DIMENSIONAL CEPSTRAL REPRESENTATION, WHICH HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE USEFUL FOR ACOUSTIC PATTERN PROCESSING. IF SUCCESSFUL, THE RESULTING TECHNOLOGY WOULD PERMIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE POWERFUL ASSISTIVE LISTENING DEVICES THAN ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND OF ACOUSTIC MONITORS FOR OTHER MEDICAL AND WORKPLACE APPLICATIONS.",

THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A SIMPLE, RELIABLE, MEMBRANE-BASEDSYSTEM THAT ALLOWS THE RECOVERY, PURIFICATION, AND REUSE OF THE TRANSPIRED WATER VAPOR THROUGH CONTROL OF TEMPERATUREAND HUMIDITY LEVELS IN THE PGC. THIS SYSTEM HAS CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAKE IT IDEALLY SUITED TO USE IN SPACE:MINIMAL POWER REQUIREMENTS, SMALL VOLUME AND MASS, SIMPLICITY, RELIABILITY, AND VERSATILITY. IN PHASE I, AN ACCURATE, PREDICTIVE MODEL OF THE FIRM'S TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY-CONTROL SYSTEM WILL BE DEVELOPED, BASED ON PARAMETRIC TESTS OF MEMBRANE MODULES. THIS MODEL WILL BE USED TO DESIGN SYSTEMS FOR SELECTED PGCS. PHASE II WOULD FOCUS ON THE DESIGN, FABRICATION, TESTING, AND DELIVERY OF ABREADBOARD UNIT TO NASA FOR TESTING ON A PC.",

RECENTLY IT HAS BEEN LEARNED THAT TILAPIA HAVE TWO DISTINCT PROLACTINS AND A SINGLE GROWTH HORMONE. IT IS THE GOAL OF THE WORK PROPOSED HERE TO DEVELOP IMMUNOASSAYS CAPABLE OF MEASURING THESE THREE CLOSELY RELATED GROWTH REGULATORS. TWO STRATEGIES WILL BE PURSUED: SYNTHETIC PEPTIDES CORRESPONDING TO UNIQUE EPITOPES IN EACH OF THE THREE ISOFORMS WILL BE SYNTHESIZED, AND USED TO GENERATE IMMUNOGENS FOR ANTIBODY PRODUCTION. INADDITION, THE NATIVE MOLECULES THEMSELVES WILL BE USED TO INDUCE THE ANTIBODIES. PHASE I EFFORTS WILL BE DEVOTED TO PRODUCTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF POLYCLONAL ANTIBODIES. IN PHASE II, THE EFFORT WILL BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, AND THE ANTIBODIES WILL BE UTILIZED TO GENERATE ISOFORM-SPECIFIC IMMUNOASSAYS FOR MEASUREMENT OFTHE HORMONES. THESE ASSAYS WILL BE OF TREMENDOUS VALUE FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE ENDOCRINE CONTROL OF GROWTH TILAPIAIN PARTICULAR, AND TO DEVELOPING A BETTER APPRECIATION OF THE ENDOCRINE CONTROL OF GROWTH IN FISH IN GENERAL. ENDOCRINE CONTROL OF GROWTH IN FISH IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF ASSAY STSTEMS CAPABLE OF ACCURATELY MEASURING CANDIDATE GROWTH REGULATORS.

IN THIS RESEARCH, POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR) ASSAYS WILL BE USED TO EXAMINE THE LYMPHOCYTES OF BABIES BORN TO HIV-1 SEROPOSITIVE MOTHERS FOR THE PRESENCE OF THE HIV-1 GENOME. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY SENSITIVE DIRECT TEST FOR THE VIRUS; IT IS CAPABLE OF DETECTING EVEN 10 VIRAL GENOMES IN LESS THAN 1 ML OF BLOOD. PERIPHERAL BLOOD LYMPHOCYTES WILL BE COLLECTED FROM ABOUT 80 BABIES BORN TO HIV-1 SEROPOSITIVE MOTHERS. SAMPLES COLLECTED AT BIRTH AND AT 3-MONTH FOLLOWUP INTERVALS WILL BE TESTED BY PCR AND WESTERNBLOT ASSAYS. THE RESULTS OF THE PCR WILL BE CORRELATED WITH THE SUBSEQUENT LOSS OF MATERNAL ANTIBODY AND SEROCONVERSION TO BABY ANTIBODY. THESE RESULTS WILL DETERMINE WHETHER PCR DATA CAN BE USED AS A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF ACTUAL INFECTION AND A PREDICTOR OF SUBSEQUENT SEROCONVERSION. THESE STUDIES WILL PROVIDE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA FOR THE INCIDENCE OF HIV-1 INFECTION IN BABIES BORN TO SEROPOSITIVE MOTHERS AND PROVIDE A BASIS FOR PREDICTIVE TESTS FOR AIDS IN THESE BABIES.",

CONVENTIONAL ELUTION CHROMATOGRAPHY CAN BE CONVENIENTLY SCALED UP TO THE LEVELS REQUIRED IN MANUFACTURING, BUT IS EXPENSIVE, POORLY UTILIZES COLUMN CAPACITY AND IS DIFFICULT TO REPRODUCIBLE OPERATE. THE DISPLACEMENT MODE IS PERFORMED UNDER CONDITIONS SIMILAR TO CONVENTIONAL HPLC OPERATIONS, BUT INSTEAD OF A GRADIENT IN ELUENT STRENGTH THE FEED COMPONENTS ARE DISPLACED FROM THE COLUMN BY A CAREFULLY CHOSEN SOLUTION CONTAINING A COMPONENTTHAT IS MORE STRONGLY ADSORBED THAN ANY OF THE FEED COMPONENTS.

        "abstract": "DEEP UV AND I-LINE LITHOGRAPHY WILL BE USED EXTENSIVELY THROUGHOUT THE 1990'S TO BUILD SUBMICRON INTEGRATED CIRCUITS. RECENT STUDIES WITH COMMERCIAL DEEP UV AND I-LINEPHOTORESISTS HAVE SHOWN THAT THEIR PERFORMANCE FALLS DRAMATICALLY WHEN PRINTING OVER REFLECTIVE SUBSTRATES SUCH AS POLYSILICON AND ALUMINUM. THE FORMATION OF STANDING WAVES AND STRAY REFLECTIONS CAUSES A SEVERE LOSS OF RESOLUTION AND CD CONTROL. THE SIMPLEST APPROACH FOR CONTROLLING REFLECTIVITY PROBLEMS IS TO APPLY A LIGHT ABSORBING POLYMER FILM, OR ANTIREFLECTIVE COATING (ARC), BENEATH THE RESIST. ARCS HAVEBEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY FOR THE PAST DECADE BY CHIP MAKERS WORKING AT G-LINE. THE HIGH ABSORPTIVITY OF THE ANTIREFLECTIVE COATING IS OBTAINED BY THE ADDITION OF DYES TO THE POLYMER COATING. TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH SUBMICRON PROCESSING, ANTIREFLECTIVE COATINGS FOR I-LINE AND DEEP UV LITHOGRAPHY MUST BE EXTREMELY THIN ( 0.1 MUM) AND PLASMA ETCHABLE. OBTAINING ADEQUATE ABSORPTIVITY WITH SUCH THIN FILMS IS DIFFICULT USING A CONVENTIONAL DYE-FILLED POLYMER COATING. THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM IS TO DEVELOP POLYMER COATINGS WHICH ARE INTRINSICALLY ABSORBING AT THE EXPOSURE WAVELENGTH. THIS INNOVATION ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR DYES AND ALLOWS THE OPTICAL DENSITY OF THE ARC TO BE INCREASED. DURING PHASE I WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE PREPARATION OF NOVEL INTRINSICALLY ABSORBING POLYMERS FOR I-LINE AND DEEP UV ARC APPLICATIONS. THE POLYMER STRUCTURES WILL BE DEVELOPED USING RESULTS FROM PHYSICAL PROPERTY DETERMINATIONS AND REALLIFE LITHOGRAPHIC TESTING.",

THE CONVENTIONAL APPROACH USES A VALVE PLACED AT THE END OF SEVERAL FEET OF EXHALATION TUBING. OUR NEW NOZZLE WILL JET GAS DOWN THE PATIENT'S ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE FOR INSPIRATION AND CONTROL OF EXPIRATORY PRESSURE. THE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES OF THIS INNOVATIVE DESIGN ARE THAT ONE VENTILATOR CAN BE USED: 1) FOR PATIENTS RANGING IN SIZE FROM THE VERY LOW BIRTH WEIGHT PRETERM INFANT TO THE 30 KG CHILD; 2)IN EITHER THE PRESSURE-LIMITED TIME-CYCLED MODE OR A VOLUME CONTROL MODE; 3) AT BOTH CONVENTIONAL RATES AND HIGH FREQUENCY RATES (RANGING FROM 1 TO 660 BREATHS/MIN); 4)TO REDUCE CO2 IN VOLUMES MAY BE USED; 5)TO ASSIST THE PATIENT'S OWN BREATHING EFFORT, EVEN IN THE TINY PRETERM INFANT, BECAUSE OF ITS RAPID RESPONSE TIME CAPABILITIES. COMPLETION OF THE RESEARCH PLAN WILL RESULT IN A VALVE-NOZZLE SYSTEM WHICH WILL SIMPLIFY AND IMPROVE GAS DELIVERY TO INFANTS AND CHILDREN WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON MECHANICAL VENTILATION.

THE PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE CONSISTS OF A PASSIVE IMAGING SENSOR DRIVING A FLOW-FIELD COMPUTER, WHICH GENERATES MEASUREMENTS FOR A STATE/TIME ESTIMATOR AND DOWN-STREAM TERRAIN MODELER. A VIRTUAL IMAGE HELMET-MOUNTED DISPLAY PROVIDES THE PILOT WITH COMPUTED TERRAIN-RELATIVE ALTITUDE, AND AN IMAGE OF THE LOCAL TOPOGRAPHY. WE PLAN AN INITIAL APPLICATION OF ATAS TO TERRAIN-FOLLOWING FLIGHT AND PROPOSE A PHASE I FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT COMPRISED OF FOUR TASKS. WE WILL: 1) DEFINE THE OVERALL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE FOR ATAS; 2) DEVELOP A SIMULATION OF BOTH THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE PROPOSED SYSTEM; 3) SIMULATE OVERALL OPERATION, CONDUCT PERFORMANCE TRADES, AND SPECIFY SENSOR, SIGNAL PROCESSING, AND COMPUTATIONAL REQUIREMENTS; AND 4) DEFINE REQUIREMENTS FOR PHASE II DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF A WORKING PROTOTYPE.",

TO ALLEVIATE THESE DIFFICULTIES,THE HYBRID INTEGRATION OF ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS (ANNS) AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED EXPERT SYSTEMS (KBS) IS BEING OPTIMIZED TO PROVIDE INTELLIGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SAFE NUCLEAR PLANT OPERATIONS. THE INTEGRATION OF ANNS AND KBS IS AN IDEAL STEP IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS. IN GENERAL, ANNS PROVIDE \"SOFT\" CONSTRAINTS, WHILE KBS ALLOW \"HARD\" CONSTRAINTS. THE TWO METHODS COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO THE HEMISPHERES THAT CONTAIN THE HUMAN MIND. ANNS, CORRESPONDING TO THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE OF THE BRAIN, PROVIDE ADAPTABLE PATTERN RECOGNITION AND CLASSIFICATION CAPABILITIES THAT CONTINUE TO PERFORM EVEN IF SOME PROCESSING UNITS FAIL; KBS, WHICH RELATE TO THE LEFTHEMISPHERE, INVOLVE A STRUCTURED, RULE-BASED REPRESENTATION OF EXPERT KNOWLEDGE AND STEP-BY-STEP DECISION STRATEGIES.

THE PROJECT WILL PROVIDE A DESIGN AND LIFE TEST FOR THE SUSPENSION SYSTEM AND A COMPLETE CONCEPTUAL-PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF THE ASSOCIATED ALTERNATOR. CURRENTLY, BEARINGS ARE THE MOST UNRELIABLE COMPONENTS AND ALTERNATORS THE MOST MASSIVE IN A FREE-PISTON MACHINE. IMPROVEMENTS IN BOTH RELIABILITY AND POWER-TO-MASS ARE REQUIRED TO SUCCEED WITH STIRLING SPACEPOWER UNITS. COST AND RELIABILITY IMPROVEMENTS ARE REQUIRED FOR TERRESTRIAL COMMERCIALIZATION.",

MANY CBR SYSTEMS DO A GOOD JOB OF HANDLING STATIC CASES (I.E., CASES THAT REPRESENT A SINGLE POINT IN TIME), BUT DO NOT HAVE FACILITIES FOR DOING TEMPORAL REASONING ACROSS A SET OF CASES. COGNITIVE SYSTEMS PROPOSES TO EXTEND ITS CURRENT CBR SHELL (SEE SECTION F. RELATED WORK) TO INCLUDE USER-FRIENDLY FACILITIES FOR DOING TEMPORAL REASONING. COGNITIVE HAS ALREADY DEVELOPED A GENERIC CBR SHELL WHICH IS CAPABLE OF LIMITED TEMPORAL REASONING (SIMPLE SEQUENCING) AND HAS USED THAT TOOL TO DEVELOP A CASE-BASED NATURAL LANGUAGE PARSER. WE ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN ONGOING DEVELOPMENT OF A MACHINE FAULT DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM WITH LOCKHEED AND OF A NETWORK FAILURE DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM WITH APPLE. BOTH OF THESE PROJECTS HAVE TEMPORAL ISSUES THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED. COGNITIVE WILL USE THE EXPERIENCE GAINED FROM THESE PROJECTS TO GUIDE DEVELOPMENT OF POWERFUL NEW FEATURES TO AID TEMPORAL REASONING. NEW FEATURES WILL INCLUDE INTERFACES TO FACILITATE SPECIFICATION AND MANIPULATION OF TEMPORAL LINKS, AND ENHANCEMENTS TO INDEX GENERATION TO FULLY EXPLOIT ANY TEMPORAL INFORMATION WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE.

THE APPROACH USED HERE INVOLVES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A GENERIC, REDUCED-ORDER MODEL (ROM) WHICH CAPTURES THE DOMINANT STATIC AND DYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF POWER PLANTS. THIS MODEL IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO PREDICT THE PLANT BEHAVIOR. SINCE THE MODEL WILL NOT EXACTLY MATCH THE TRUE PLANT STRUCTURE, THE PARAMETERS OF THE MODEL MUST BE ESTIMATED USING PREDICTION ERROR METHODS OR NONLINEAR LEAST SQUARES. THIS MODEL WILL THEN BE USED IN A KALMAN FILTER TO ESTIMATE PROCESS STATES IN REAL-TIME. THESE ESTIMATED STATES ARE USED FOR PREDICTION, ENABLING THE COMPUTATION OF THE OPTIMAL CONTROL SEQUENCE. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH BUILDS ON THE RESULTS OF A PRELIMINARYSTUDY WHICH ATTEMPTED TO DEMONSTRATE FEASIBILITY OF THE APPROACH. THE RESULTS WERE ENCOURAGING BUT MUCH MORE WORK IS NEEDED TO MAKE THE APPROACH PRACTICAL. IN PARTICULAR, THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF THE ROM DOES NOT ADEQUATELY MODEL THE BEHAVIOR OF A PLANT AND THUS MORE MODELING WORK IS REQUIRED. ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THE COMPUTATIONAL BURDEN, WHICH CURRENTLY PRECLUDES REAL-TIME OPERATION ON A MICROCOMPUTER. SEVERAL APPROXIMATION TECHNIQUES CAN POTENTIALLY REDUCE THE BURDEN BY A FACTOR OF TEN. FINALLY, PARAMETERS OF THE MPC ALGORITHM (WEIGHTING AND CONTROL STEP SIZE) MUST BE EVALUATED TO ACHIEVE THE BEST PERFORMANCE.

IN THE PHASE I FEASIBILITY STUDY, A ROBUST O(N(4/3)) THREE-DIMENSIONAL VORTEX PARTICLE METHOD IS BEING DEVELOPED. THIS METHOD, BASED ON THE PROPER TREATMENT OF THE NEAR- AND FAR-FIELD VORTEX INTERACTIONS, IS AN IMPROVEMENT OVER THE CLASSICAL O(N(2)) APPROACH. IT USES BOTH LOCAL ANALYTICAL CORRECTIONS AND FAR-FIELD APPROXIMATIONS. THE METHOD IS BEING IMPLEMENTED ON A MULTIPROCESSOR COMPUTER, USING TWO SETS OF COMMUNICATION STRUCTURE. THIS STRUCTURE ALLOWS THE LOCAL AND GLOBAL INTERPROCESSOR COMMUNICATIONS, USED FOR THE NEAR- AND FAR-FIELD VORTEX INTERACTIONS, RESPECTIVELY, TO BE TREATED SEPARATELY. IN THE GLOBAL COMMUNICATION PROCESS, THE USE OFTHE FAR-FIELD APPROXIMATIONS IN THE COMPUTATION ALLOWS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN COMMUNICATION TIME. THE COMPLETED COMPUTER CODE WILL BE TESTED ON CLASSICAL PROBLEMSIN PHASE I, AND THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE METHOD AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PARALLEL ALGORITHM WILL BE INVESTIGATED. IN THE PHASE II EFFORT, FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS WILL INCLUDE THE COUPLING OF (1) A HIERARCHICAL DATA STRUCTURE TO IMPROVETHE ORDER OF THE METHOD TO O(NLOGN) OR O(N) AND (2) A CONSERVATION EQUATION TO INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS.

A METHOD TO ENHANCE AND PROLONG THE DYNAMIC LIFT BY COORDINATED, SMALL-AMPLITUDE MOVEMENTS OF THE LEADING AND TRAILING EDGE FLAPS IS PROPOSED.

COMPARED WITH THE CASE WITH NO FLAP MOTION, THE RESULTING SMALLER LEADING EDGE VORTEX AT THE END OF THE PITCH-UP MOTION WILL TAKE A LONGER TIME TO GROW TO THE CRITICAL STRENGTH FOR DYNAMIC STALL TO OCCUR AND THUS THE ONSET OF STALL IS DELAYED. A COORDINATED OSCILLATION OF THE TRAILING FLAP CAN RESULT IN AN EFFECTIVE CAMBER CHANGE WHICH DELAYS THE CONVECTION OF THESE VORTICES DOWN THE WING SURFACE AND FURTHER INCREASES THE DURATION OF DYNAMIC LIFT ENHANCEMENT.

IN ADDITION TO SAVING TIME AND COST OF TESTING, UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENCES IN MODELS, FACILITIES, AND TEST CONDITIONS ARE ELIMINATED. THEBALANCE CAN ALSO PROVIDE A CAPABILITY FOR COMPLICATED DYNAMIC MEASUREMENTS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO PERFORM IN A WINDTUNNEL. THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP AND TEST A SIX-COMPONENT FORCE-AND-MOMENT BALANCE SYSTEM AND RELATED CALIBRATION EQUIPMENT THAT CAN BE MANUFACTURED AND PRODUCED COMMERCIALLY FOR OTHER WATER TUNNEL USERS IN THIS COUNTRY AND ABROAD. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF PHASE I IS TO DEVELOP PRELIMINARY DESIGNS FOR VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF A FORCE-AND-MOMENT BALANCE. MAJOR IMPROVEMENT AND REFINEMENT EFFORTS WOULD BE CARRIED OUT IN PHASE II TO DEVELOP AND CONSTRUCT A PROTOTYPE OF A FINAL DESIGN, AND EXTENSIVE STATIC AND DYNAMIC TESTS WILL BE PERFORMED TO VERIFY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SYSTEM AND TO DEVELOP TECHNIQUES FOR VARIOUS APPLICATIONS.",

THIS PROPOSAL OUTLINES A WAY THAT THE DETECTION OF THESE TOXINS CAN BE MADE MUCH MORE SENSITIVE WITHOUT USE OF EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT OR HIGHLY TRAINED PERSONNEL FOR THE FINAL PRODUCT. THE BASIS OF THE METHOD LIES IN THE USE OF COAGULATION-ACTIVATING SNAKE VENOM ENZYME CONJUGATES OF ANTIBODIES AND ANTIGENS AND THEIR DETECTION BY A NEW, ULTRASENSITIVE COAGULATION ACTIVATOR ASSAY CALLED ENZYME-LINKED COAGULATION ASSAY, OR ELCA. WE EXPECT THAT WE COULD MEASURE TOXINS WITH 100-1000X HIGHER SENSITIVITY THAN OTHER CURRENT METHODOLOGIES, BASED ON OUR CURRENT SUCCESS IN APPLYING THIS ASSAY TO OTHER ANTIGENS. DURING THIS PHASE I EFFORT, WE WOULD DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL OF THE TECHNOLOGY FOR TOXINS OF INTEREST TO THE ARMY, BY LABELING THESE TOXINS AND/OR ANTIBODIES TO THEM, AND DEMONSTRATING THE SENSITIVITY OF DETECTION USING THE ELCA ASSAY.

A CENTRAL PROBLEM IS THE LACK OF RELIABILITY OF ON-THE-JOB MEASURES. HOWEVER, TESTS WHICH POSSESS ROBUST PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES (STABILITY, RELIABILITY, ETC.) HAVE BEEN SHOWN TOBE SENSITIVE TO ALCOHOL, SLEEP LOSS, HYPOZIA, HALON, AND DRUGS. IN PHASE I, THROUGH EXPERIMENTAL WORK, WE WOULD INDEX HUMAN PERFORMANCE DECREMENTS TO ALCOHOL DOSAGE (FOR WHICH FEDERALLY MANDATED STANDARDS ALREADY EXIST FOR SOME OCCUPATIONS). THEN WE WILL DERIVE CALIBRATION ALGORITHMS FOR COMPARING PERFORMANCE CHANGES IN BLOOD ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION UNITS TO LOSSES FROM OTHER AGENTS, TREATMENTS AND STRESSORS. LASTLY, WE WILL PRODUCE A FULLY UP-AND-RUNNING PROTOTYPE SPECIAL PURPOSE TEST STATION WHICH WILL CONTAIN THESE ALGORITHMS SO THAT THEY CAN BE SET TO PREDETERMINED LEVELS. IN PHASE II, ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL WORK WILL BE CONDUCTED TO REFINE THE ALGORITHMS, ADD OTHER TREATMENTS, AND IMPROVE THE DESIGN OF THE TEST STATION BY CONDUCTING TEST AND EVALUATION AT LABORATORY AND WORK SITES.",

THE TEST WILL BE AN ELISA CONSTRUCT THAT EMPLOYS MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY THAT SPECIFICALLY RECOGNIZE GLYCATED LDL, AND DO NOT REACT WITH UNGLYCATED LDL MOIETIES. GLYCATION OF LDL, THE MAJOR CARRIER OF PLASMA CHOLESTEROL, IS A STRUCTURAL MODIFICATION THAT AFFECTS THE ATHEROGENIC POTENTIAL OF LIPOPROTEINS, AND THAT INCREASES THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF DIABETIC SUBJECTS TO ATHEROSCLEROTIC COMPLICATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, EXPOSURE TO GLYCATED LDL LEADS TO INTRACELLULAR ACCUMULATION OF CHOLESTEROL ESTERS, COMPROMISES THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ABILITY OF LDL TO BE METABOLIZED BY THE LDL RECEPTOR PATHWAY, AND PROMOTES UPTAKE BY ALTERNATIVE RECEPTORS LEADING TO MORPHOLOGIC TRANSFORMATION OF MACROPHAGES INTO FOAM CELLS. THUS, MEASUREMENT OF GLYCATED LDL IN PLASMA OR SERUM MAY BE DIAGNOSTICALLY AND PROGNOSTICALLY IMPORTANT IN PATIENTS WITH DIABETES MELLITUS.

IN PHASE I, FOSTER-MILLER WILL DEMONSTRATE THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE CONCEPT: THE ABILITY OF NEW HIGH OPTICAL QUALITY SAPPHIRE FIBER SENSORS TO OBTAIN IR SPECTRAL DATA IN BOTH THE LOW TEMPERATURE CURE CYCLE OF CARBON/PHENOLIC PEPREGS AND IN THE HIGH TEMPERATURE CARBONIZATION PROCESS. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM IS CAPABLE OF OBTAINING DATA AT TEMPERATURES UP TO 1400C AND SHOULD PROVIDE THE FIRST IN-SITU REAL-TIME INFORMATION IN BOTH INITIAL CURE AND THE CARBONIZATION-PYROLYSIS REACTIONS OF CARBON-PHENOLIC MATERIALS. CRITICAL DATA ON REIMPREGNATION WILL ALSO BE OBTAINED. THESE TASKS WILL LEAD TO THE RESOLUTION OF KEY ISSUES OF PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION SO THAT THE SYSTEM WILL BE READY FOR IMMEDIATE INTEGRATION INTO A CARBON-CARBON REACTOR. THIS SYSTEM WILL BE BASED ON FOSTER-MILLER'S HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL REMOTE FIBER OPTIC FTIR POLYMER REACTION MONITOR. THIS TOOL WAS DEVELOPED BY FOSTER-MILLER TO MONITOR AND CONTROL CHEMICAL KINETICS IN ORGANIC RESIN SYSTEMS IN HOSTILE ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS AUTOCLAVES AND HIGH TEMPERATURE PRESSES AND MOLDS. IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED TO THE CURE OF COMPOSITE PARTS MADE FROM EPOXIES, BISMALEIMIDES AND POLYIMIDES. IT WON A 1990 R&D-100 AWARD. IN PHASE II, FOSTER-MILLER WILL INTEGRATE THE CARBON-CARBON MONITOR INTO A COMMERCIAL PROCESS REACTOR. REPRODUCIBLE PRODUCTION OF CARBON-CARBON STRUCTURES WITH IMPROVED STRUCTURE/MICROSTRUCTURE/PROPERTY RELATIONSHIPS IN PHASE II WILL FORM A FIRM BASIS FOR A COMMERCIALLY SUPPORTED PHASE III PROGRAM.",

THE THRESHOLD SYSTEM IS OF INTEREST TO THE U.S. ARMY FOR A RANGE OF APPLICATIONS, BUT TO BE OF VALUE AS A FIELD DETECTOR, THE UREASE CONJUGATES REQUIRED MUST BE STABLE TO STORAGE AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS. METHODS WILL THEREFORE BE INVESTIGATED FOR PRODUCING HIGH ACTIVITY UREASE-ANTIBODY CONJUGATES THAT ARE STABLE TO SHORT TERM STORAGE AT 37 DEG C. PARAMETERS WILL THEN BE INVESTIGATED THAT AFFECT LYOPHILIZATION OF SELECTED UREASEANTIBODY CONJUGATES, AND THEIR STABILITY TO SHORT TERM STORAGE AT 60 DEG C. IT IS PROPOSED THAT ONE MONOCLONAL AND ONE POLYCLONAL MODEL SYSTEM ANTIBODY BE STUDIED. THE DATA OBTAINED FROM THESE PHASE I STUDIES WILL PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION ON PROMISING AVENUES OF APPROACH FOR PHASE II, WHEN FURTHER REFINEMENTS WILL ENABLE PRODUCTION OF HIGH ACTIVITY, STABLE CONJUGATES, FOR USE IN U.S. ARMY APPLICATIONS OF THE THRESHOLD SYSTEM.",

THE DEMAND FOR BLOOD PRODUCTS FOR SUPPORT OF IMMUNOSUPPRESSED PATIENTS UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY AND ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION INCREASES THE RISK OF TRANSFUSION ASSOCIATED VIRAL DISEASE. THE LONG TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM TO INACTIVATE PATHOGENS IN BLOOD PRODUCTS. A PHOTOCHEMICAL DECONTAMINATION (PCD) PROCEDURE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED WHICH UTILIZES 8-METHOXYPSORALEN (8-MOP) AND LONG WAVELENGTH ULTRAVIOLET (UVA) LIGHT TO INACTIVATE PATHOGENS IN PLATELET CONCENTRATES (PC) WHILE MAINTAINING ACCEPTABLE PLATELET FUNCTION (LIN ET AL., BLOOD 74\"517, 1989). WE SEEK TO DEVELOP A SIMPLE MEANS TO VALIDATE INACTIVATION OF HUMAN PATHOGENS AFTER TREATMENT BY PCD. WE WILL USE INHIBITION OF THE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR) AS A MEASURE OF THE EXTENT OF THE PHOTOREACTION BETWEEN NUCLEIC ACID AND PSORALEN IN A PCD TREATED PLATELET CONCENTRATE. THE INITIAL DEMONSTRATION OF THIS TECHNIQUE WILL BE A CORRELATION OF THE INHIBITION OF PCR AMPLIFICATION OF CELLULAR DNA FROM A PCD TREATED PC WITH THE KINETICS OF INACTIVATION OF HIV-1 AND THE LEVEL OF PHOTOMODIFICATION OF THE CELLULAR DNA. THIS OBJECTIVE WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE FOLLOWING INDIVIDUAL SPECIFIC AIMS. 1. HIV-1 INFECTED H9 CELLS WILL BE SEEDED INTO PLATELET CONCENTRATES. THE CONCENTRATES WILL THEN BE TREATED WITH 8-MOP PLUS UVA LIGHT FOR VARIOUS TIMES. THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF HIV-1 WILL BE MONITORED BY A RAPID MICROPLAQUE ASSAY (HANSON ET AL., J. CLIN. MICRO. 28: 1990). THE INACTIVATION WILL UTILIZE HIGH INTENSITY UVA LAMPS TO DECREASE THE IRRADIATION TIME BY A FACTOR OF 10. 2. THE EXTENT OF PHOTOMODIFICATION OF CELLULAR DNA WILL BE DETERMINED USING 3H-8-MOP. 3. THE INHIBITION OF PCR WILL BE CORRELATED WITH THE LEVEL OF 8-MOP MODIFICATION OF CELLULAR DNA AND WITH THE LOSS OF BIOLOGICAL TITER OF HIV-1. 4.

A CONCOMITANT OBJECTIVE IS TO EMPLOY THE KNOWLEDGE SO GAINED TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING INSTRUMENTATION TO BOTH DIAGNOSE AND CONTROL THE LITHOTRIPSY PROCESS. POLYVINYLIDENE FLUORIDE PRESSURE TRANSDUCERS WILL BE USED TOACQUIRE SHOCK PRESSURE AND SCATTERED WAVE DATA. THE DATA WILL BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH NUMERICAL SHOCK DYNAMICS CALCULATIONS TO UNDERSTAND THE PROPAGATION PROCESS AND IN DEVELOPING AN EMPIRICAL SCATTERING MODEL.

WHILE THESE METHODS HAVE BEEN PUSHED TO ACHIEVE A REASONABLE LEVEL OF SUCCESS, RESEARCHERS HAVE VERY NEARLY REACHED THE LIMITS OF SUCH METHODS AND LABOR-INTENSIVE HUMAN INTERVENTION BECOMES LESS AND LESS FEASIBLE WITH THE GROWING INFORMATION EXPLOSION. ADVANCED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES OFFER THE BEST HOPE OF BREAKING OUT OF THESE LIMITS BECAUSE THEY WOULD BRING TO THE RETRIEVAL TASK HUMAN-LIKE UNDERSTANDING CAPABILITIES. THESE INCLUDE DISAMBIGUATION OF WORD SENSES, IDENTIFICATION OF MAJOR PARTICIPANTS IN REPORTED EVENTS, ASSIGNMENT OF TEMPORAL AND CAUSAL RELATIONS BETWEEN REPORTED EVENTS, AND IDENTIFICATION OF TOPICS AND SUBTOPICS.

TO MINIMIZE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS OF TOXIC CADMIUM, AND TO ACCOMPLISH IN SITU CADMIUM MANAGEMENT, A RECLAIM METHOD WAS ALSO DEVELOPED. THE USE OF CADMIUM IN DRY PLATING COULD BE FURTHER REDUCED BY SUBSTITUTING A ZINC-CADMIUM ALLOY FOR CADMIUM. THE AIMS OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IN THE PHASE I ARE (1) TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEPOSITING ZINC-CADMIUM ALLOY OF THE DESIRED COMPOSITION USING THE DRY PLATING TECHNIQUE AND (2) TO MEASURE THE LEVEL OF CADMIUM DUST RELEASE IN THE ENVIRONMENT, IF ANY.

THE REMOVAL OF PYROGENS FROM WATER BY DISTILLATION IS EXPENSIVE. ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVES TO DISTILLATION REQUIRE METICULOUS MAINTENANCE, EXTENSIVE PRETREATMENT OF THE WATER, AND COSTLY (OFTEN REDUNDANT) BACKUP SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THE REMOVAL OF PYROGENS FROM SOLUTION. THESE HIGH COSTS HAVE FORCED MANY HOSPITALS TO ABANDON IN-HOUSE WATER PURIFICATIONIN FAVOR OF PREPACKAGED SOLUTIONS. THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO ESTABLISH THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF A LOW-COST ELECTROCHEMICAL DEVICE FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF PYROGENS IN WATER. THE DEVICE WILL BE BASED ON A SOLID POLYMER ELECTROLYTE AND WILL GENERATE OZONEAT THE ANODE AND AN ADDITIONAL CATALYTIC OXIDANT (H2O2) AT THE CATHODE; BOTH PRODUCTS WILL BE GENERATED DIRECTLY IN THE WATER STREAM. WHEN OZONE IS USED TO TREAT WATER IN COMBINATION WITH A SUITABLE CATALYST, THE LEVEL OF ORGANIC MATERIAL IN SOLUTIONCAN BE REDUCED TO BELOW PRESENT DETECTION LIMITS, AND PYROGENS ARE DESTROYED BY THIS TREATMENT. OZONE IS ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE IT DECOMPOSES RAPIDLY IN WATER TO FORM OXYGEN.

LYNNTECH, INC., HAS DEVELOPED AN ELECTROCHEMICAL DEVICE FOR THE PAIRED SYNTHESIS OF OZONE AND HYDROGEN PEROXIDE FROM WATER AND OXYGEN IN A PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE-BASED ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL. THIS PROCESS FOR GENERATING OXIDANTS ELECTROCHEMICALLY CAN ELIMINATE MANY OF THE PROBLEMS IN MAKING AOPS COMMERCIALLY ATTRACTIVE. THE ADVANTAGES OF PAIRED ELECTROCHEMICAL SYSTHESIS OF O3 AND H2O2 IN ELECTROLYTE-FREE WATER INCLUDE; (A) LOWER OPERATING COSTS, AS TWO OXIDIZING AGENTS CAN BE OBTAINED FOR THE PRICE OF ONE; (B) LOWER INITIAL CAPITAL COSTS OF OZONE GENERATION; (C) THE ELIMINATION OF THE NEED FOR TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE OF OXIDANTS BY GENERATING THEM ELECTROCHEMICALLY WITHIN WATER ON DEMAND AT AN AMOUNT THAT IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE WASTE CONCENTRATIONS, AND (D) THE PROCESS CAN GENERATE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AQUEOUS PHASE OZONE CONCENTRATIONS THAN CAN BE OBTAINED USING TRADITIONAL METHODS OF OZONE FORMATION.

THIS TECHNIQUE EMPLOYS THE INDUCTIVE EROSION PHENOMENA TO ERODE THE CURRENT RISE TIME OF THE AURORA BEAM PULSE, BY PROPAGATING IT THROUGH A PRE-IONIZED PLASMA CHANNEL ALONG THE AXIS OF THE EXISTING AURORA DRIFT TUBE. INDUCTIVE EROSION IS AN EXPERIMENTALLY VERIFIED PHYSICAL MECHANISM IN WHICH THE BEAM FRONT, IN EXPELLING THE CHANNEL ELECTRONS TO ESTABLISH CHARGE NEUTRAILITY, CONTINUALLY LOSES KINETIC ENERGY AND ERODES AWAY. SINCE THE CHARACTERISTIC TIME SCALE IS THE ACTUAL TIME TO EXPEL THE CHANNEL ELECTRONS TO THE DRIFT TUBE WALL, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE RESULTING FINAL BEAM RISE TIME WILL BE ABOUT 2 NANOSECONDS. IN FACT, SUBSTANTIAL RISE TIME REDUCTIONS DUE TO THIS MECHANISM HAVE BEEN CONCLUSIVELY OBSERVED IN MODERATE CURRENT ( KA) PRE-IONIZED CHANNEL EXPERIMENTS. FURTHER, THIS MECHANISM IS ALSO SUSPECTED TO BE THE DOMINANT EROSION MECHANISM IN THE RECENT AURORA LOW PRESSURE NEUTRAL GAS CELL TECHNIQUE IN WHICH THE CHARACTERISTIC TIME SCALE IS THE CHANNEL ELECTRON EXPULSION TIME PLUS THE BEAM-INDUCED IONIZATION TIME ( NS).

MEASUREMENTS ARE BEING MADE ON VARISTORS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THEIR LIFE AND TO PERFORM CIRCUIT SIMULATION STUDIES IN ORDER TO DEVELOP TECHNIQUES THAT CAN IMPROVE THE FIELD PENETRATION OF VARISTORS ON FAST TIME SCALES. A NOVEL VACUUM TUBE REGULATION TECHNIQUE IS ALSO PLANNED THAT MINIMIZES OR ELIMINATES UNDESIRABLE VOLTAGE FLUCTUATIONS CAUSED BY CURRENT FLUCTUATIONS. THIS TETRODE TECHNIQUE CAN ALSO BE USED FOR ZERO-ORDER SWITCHING OF THE PULSE POWER SYSTEM AND FOR FINE CONTROL OF THE VOLTAGE. NUMERICAL ELECTRON OPTICS STUDIES OF THIS TECHNIQUE ARE BEING PERFORMED DURING PHASE I, LEADING TO A DETAILED DESIGN OF A PHASE II EXPERIMENT. IF SUCCESSFUL, A COST-EFFECTIVE SOLUTION TO THE LONGITUDINAL INSTABILITY WILLRESULT FROM THIS WORK.",

        "abstract": "SPREAD SPECTRUM TECHNIQUES ARE WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED TO PROVIDE LOW PROBABILITY OF INTERCEPT (LPI) CAPABILITY. CONVENTIONAL DIRECT SEQUENCE SPREADING, HOWEVER, SUFFERS FROM THE SHORTCOMING THAT AN INTERCEPTOR REQUIRES ONLY VERY SIMPLE PROCESSING TO COLLASPE THE SPREAD SIGNAL TO A NEADILY DETECTABLE UNMODULATED SIMUSOID. FURTHERMORE, HIGH LEVELS OF LPI ARE ONLY ACHIEVED BY USING HIGH SPEED GENERATORS FOR THE SPREADING SIGNALS, NECESSITATING COMPLEX SYNCHRONIZATION ALGORITHMS. THE APPROACH DESCRIBED HERE ELIMINATES THESE UNDERSIRABLE CHARACTERISTICS BY REPLACING THE SINUSOIDAL CARRIER WITH A PURE NOISE WAVEFORM. THIS PREVENTS AN INTERCEPTOR FROM USING NON-LINEAR TECHNIQUES TO EXPLOIT SOME DETERMINISTIC ELEMENT OF THE SIGNAL BECAUSE THERE ARE NONE TO EXPLOIT. IN ADDITION, SINCE THE SPECTRAL SPREADING IS NOT A FUNCTION OF THE RATE AT WHICH THE TRANSEC GENERATOR IS CLOCKED, VERY SLOWLY CHANGING (OR FIXED) TRANSEC CAN BE USED, THEREBY GREATLY SIMPLIFYING (OR ELIMINATING) THE SYNCHRONIZATION PROCESS. THE OBJECT OF THIS EFFORT IS TO INVESTIGATE THIS BASIC CONCEPT, DETERMINE THE LPI PERFORMANCE ACHIEVED FOR A WIDE RANGE OF DESIGN PARAMETERS, AND DEVELOP A BREADBOARD FOR EVALUATION.

SINCE THE SATELLITE RADIOMETERS MEASURE SEA-SURFACE SKIN BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURE, VERIFICATION SENSORS SHOULD MEASURE THE IDENTICAL SKIN TEMPERATURE TO ACHIEVE OPTIMUM SATELLITE RADIOMETER ACCURACY. BULK AND SKIN SSTS CAN DIFFER BY AS MUCH AS 2 DEGREES CENTIGRADE, WITH THE SKIN TEMPERATURE TYPICALLY 0.6 DEGREES CENTIGRADE COOLER THAN THE BULK TEMPERATURE. A 5-BAND, SHIP-MOUNTED, DOWN-LOOKING INFRARED RADIOMETRIC CALIBRATOR WILL BE DEVISED TO MEASURE SEA SURFACE BRIGHTNESS-TEMPERATURE TO WITHIN 0.02 DEGREES CENTIGRADE. IT IS AN EVOLUTIONARY EXTENSION OF AN EXISTING 4.25-3.7MUM AIRBORNE RADIOMETER.

SURFACE EMITTING LASERS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN DEVELOPED AT UC SANTA BARBARA WITH SUBMILLIAMPERE THRESHOLDS AND VERY HIGH MODULATION RATE CAPABILITY. THE LOW THRESHOLD AND HIGH OPERATING EFFICIENCY MAKE THESE LASERS IDEAL FOR ARRAY APPLICATIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH ASYMMETRIC FABRY-PEROT SURFACE NORMAL REFLECTION MODULATORS. UP TO THIS TIME, HIGH SPEED, SURFACE EMITTING LASER ARRAYS HAVE NOT BEEN TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE I RESEARCH IS TO DESIGN AND EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF SEL ARRAYS. BECAUSE OF THE LOW VOLTAGE AND LOW CAPACITANCE OF THESE SELS, THEY ARE CAPABLE OF OPERATING AT VERY HIGH SPEEDS, ESTIMATED TO BE 30 GHZ OR GREATER. BY COMBINING THE SELS WITH ASFP MODULATOR ARRAYS (WHICH CAN ALSO FUNCTION AS DETECTOR ARRAYS, AND AS OPTICAL LOGIC ELEMENTS), POWERFUL OPTICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS ARE POSSIBLE, WITH MULTICHANNEL, MULTI-GHZ PERFORMANCE AT MODEST POWER AND STRAIGHTFORWARD OPTICAL INTERFACES.

        "abstract": "IDENTIFICATION OF DISTANT, PASSIVE THREATS IN A COMBAT ENGAGEMENT WHERE LARGE CLUTTERED BACKGROUNDS ARE PRESENT IS OF MAJOR CONCERN TO INFRARED SENSOR SYSTEMS. THE IDENTIFICATION OF BOTH THREAT, FRIENDLY AND NEUTRAL, TARGETS IN A CLUTTERED SCENE ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE ADDED EDGE NEEDED FOR SMART BATTLE MANAGEMENT AND SURVIVABILITY. IN MANY CASES THE DETECTION AND DECLARATION OF A DISTANT POINT CAN GIVE THE ADDED TIME TO MAKE AN INTELLIGENT RESPONSE OR NON-RESPONSE TO A SITUATION. IN THE SPACE COMBAT ENVIRONMENT THE THREATS SUCH AS AIRCRAFT, DECOYS, MISSILES, ETC., JUST TO NAME A FEW, HAVE UNIQUE SPECTRAL SIGNATURES. MEASUREMENT OF THESE SPECTRAL SIGNATURES WILL ALLOW POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF THE POTENTIAL OR NON-POTENTIAL THREAT. EARLY DETECTION OF THREATS USING INFRARED SENSORS IN A CLUTTERED ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES A HIGH SIGNAL TO CLUTTER NOISE RATIO, I.E., EFFECTIVE CLUTTER REJECTION. THREE GENERIC CLUTTER REJECTION TECHNIQUES THAT ARE USED ARE: (1) SPATIAL DISCRIMINATION, (2) SPECTRAL DISCRIMINATION, (3) TEMPORAL DISCRIMINATION. THE USE OF SPECTRAL ANALYSIS BESIDES BEING AN EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUE FOR IDENTIFICATION OF TARGETS ALSO ENABLES DIFFERENTIATION OF TARGET FROM CLUTTER. WE PROPOSE IN THIS SBIR TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING A NEW INNOVATIVE TECHNIQUE. \"POINT MULTI-SPECTRAL SENSING\" (PMSS), FOR MEASURING THE SPECTRAL SIGNATURES OF DISTANT POINT-LIKE OBJECTS. THIS TECHNIQUE USES LIGHT WEIGHT INEXPENSIVE DIFFRACTION OPTICS, COUPLED WITH SIMPLE DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING ALGORITHMS IMPLEMENTED WITH A PARALLEL PROCESSOR. THIS PROPOSED TECHNIQUE CAN IDENTIFY TARGETS AT RANGES COMPARABLE TO OR EXCEEDING THE RANGE AT WHICH THEY MAY BE DETECTED WITH MONOCHROMATIC INFRARED SURVEILLANCE AND WARNING SYSTEMS.

FOR DOE, THE NEW TECHNIQUE IS TO BE APPLIED TO THE FABRICATION OF TUNGSTEN TUBING. SUCH TUBING IS NEEDED TO HANDLE CORROSIVE LIQUIDS USED DURING THE PROCESSING OF NUCLEAR FUEL FOR SEVERAL ADVANCED NUCLEAR REACTOR CONCEPTS. AT PRESENT, TUNGSTEN TUBING FOR THIS APPLICATION IS FABRICATED ONLY BY GUN DRILLING, IN WHICH A LONG DRILL BIT BORES OUT A HOLE IN A CIRCULAR BAR. GUN DRILLING, HOWEVER, LIMITS THE TUBING LENGTH TO ABOUT 8 FEET AND REQUIRES LARGER-THAN-DESIRED TUBING WALL THICKNESS. MOREOVER, GUN DRILLING CANNOT BE USED ON TUNGSTEN, THE MATERIAL OF CHOICE; A MOLYBDENUM-TUNGSTEN ALLOY IS USED INSTEAD, WITH REDUCED CORROSION RESISTANCE BEING A CONSEQUENCE. THE NEW TUBE FABRICATION TECHNIQUE IS ESPECIALLY ATTRACTIVE FOR THIS DOE APPLICATION BECAUSE IT CAN BE READILY APPLIED TO PURE TUNGSTEN, AS WELL AS TO MOLYBDENUM-TUNGSTEN ALLOY. WALL THICKNESS CAN BE REDUCED AND CONTROLLED, AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE TUBE LENGTH CAN BE MUCH GREATER THAN THE PRESENT LIMIT OF 8 FEET.

THE INNOVATIVE FIBER LASER FURNACE OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY IN THE SINGLE-CRYSTAL FIBER TESTING LABORATORY. SINGLE-CRYSTAL FIBER RESEARCH INVOLVES THE PRODUCTION OF NEW SINGLE-CRYSTAL FIBERS WITH SUBSEQUENT STRENGTH TESTING. EXTENSIVE TESTING REQUIRES HEATING THE FIBER TO THE OPERATIONAL TEMPERATURES OF THE FIBERS APPLICATION. IN THIS CASE, PROBLEMS OCCUR WITH THE HEATING OF A SMALL MASS THAT IS SURROUNDED BY A MASSIVE TESTING MACHINE. TYPICALLY, USE OF BULK-TYPE RESISTANCE HEATERS REQUIRES LARGE AMOUNTS OF ELECTRIC POWER TO REACH THE TESTING TEMPERATURES.

THE PROPOSED SLM CONSISTS OF A THIN LAYER OF LOW-VOLTAGE, FAST-SWITCHING ELECTROOPTIC MATERIAL (E.G., LIQUID CRYSTAL) SANDWICHED BETWEEN COHERENTLY-COUPLED, POLARIZATION-REFLECTION HOLOGRAMS (FORMING A FABRY-PEROT ETALON) ACTING AS A MEMORY STORAGE OF STATE VECTORS. WHEN A CHARACTERISTIC VOLTAGE IS APPLIED, A PARTICULAR STATE VECTOR IS RESONATED THROUGH FABRY-PEROT COUPLING AND IS RETRIEVED OR SWITCHED \"ON\". INDEPENDENT PHASE AND POLARIZATION MODULATIONS ARE POSSIBLE WITHOUT AFFECTING THE AMPLITUDE OF THE COHERENT OUTPUT BEAM BECAUSE RELATIVE PHASES BETWEEN STATES ARE HOLOGRAPHICALLY RECORDED IN A BIREFRINGENT MATERIAL.

CHROMIUM(VI) IS A STRONG OXIDIZER, TOXIC, CARCINOGENIC, AND IS PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO MANAGE BECAUSE CHROMIUM IS USUALLY PRESENT AS AN ANION. IT HAS LITTLE INTERACTION WITH THE SOIL, RESULTING IN WIDESPREAD GROUND-WATER CONTAMINATION, AND IT CANNOT BE TREATED BY CONVENTIONAL PROCESSES WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO REMOVE CATIONS. CONVENTIONAL PROCESSES FOR CHROMIUM REMOVAL (REDUCTION FOLLOWED BY PRECIPITATION) ARE VERY EXPENSIVE FORTHE DILUTE STREAMS TYPICAL OF GROUND-WATER CONTAMINATION. THEREFORE, TDA RESEARCH PROPOSES THE USE OF EMULSION LIQUID MEMBRANES (ELM) TO PRECONCENTRATE CHROMIUM CONTAMINATED WATER, WHICH COULD RESULT FROM PUMP-AND-TREAT, IN SITU SOIL WASHING, FOR ON-SITE EXTRACTION. BY COMBINING BOTH A COMPLEXING AND STRIPPING AGENT IN A SINGLE UNIT OPERATION, ELM IS CAPABLE OF CONCENTRATING CHROMIUM BY A FACTOR OF GREATER THAN 1000. IN PHASE I, TDA RESEARCH WOULD DEVELOP ASUITABLE EMULSION (SOLVENT, COMPLEXING AGENT, SURFACTANT, AND STRIPPING AGENT), CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS TO DEMONSTRATE PROCESS FEASIBILITY, AND CARRY OUT ECONOMIC ANALYSES TO COMPARE TDA RESEARCH'S ELM PROCESS WITH OTHER COMPETING CHROMIUM CONCENTRATION AND/OR REMOVAL PROCESSES.",

        "abstract": "RELATIVE MOTION BETWEEN AN OBSERVER AND A SCATTERING SCREEN ILLUMINATED WITH COHERENT LIGHT CAN CAUSE THE RESULTING SPECKLE PATTERN TO SCINTILLATE. THE RELATIVE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT OF THE SPECKLE PATTERN AS OBSERVED BY THE EYE IS SIMPLY RELATED TO THE AXIAL LOCATION OF THE CORRESPONDING IMAGE IN THE EYE. THE RELATIVE DIRECTION OF MOTION CAN THEREFORE BE USED TO MEASURE THE REFRACTIVE ERROR OF THE EYE. IF THE SPECKLES DO NOT MOVE BUT SEEM TO BOIL IN SPACE, THE OBJECT IS DETERMINED TO BE CONJUGATE TO THE RETINA. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A LENSLESS, MULTI-COLOR PHOROPTOR SYSTEM THAT USES LASER SPECKLE AND DIFFRACTIVE OPTICS TECHNOLOGY. WE PROPOSE TO DESIGN EYE-SAFE INSTRUMENTATION THAT CAN BE PRODUCED IN VOLUME AND AT LOW-COST. THE INSTRUMENT MUST BE EASY TO OPERATE AND THE DATA SHOULD REQUIRE LITTLE OR NO FURTHER ANALYSIS. THE VISION TEST SHOULD REQUIRE THE PATIENT TO PROVIDE ONLY SIMPLE ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS REGARDING SPECKLE MOTION. WE PLAN TO IDENTIFY INNOVATIVE DESIGNS THAT EMPLOY A MINIMUM OF OPTICAL ELEMENTS WITHOUT SACRIFICING PERFORMANCE OR LIGHT EFFICIENCY WHILE MAINTAINING MECHANICAL STABILITY. DURING PHASE I, WE PROPOSE TO GENERATE DETAILED OPTICAL DESIGNS AND FABRICATE A BREADBOARD MULTI-COLOR LASER PHOROPTOR. WE ALSO PLAN TO INVESTIGATE INNOVATIVE USES OF CONVENTIONAL AND DIFFRACTIVE OPTICS IN NEW DESIGNS FOR FUTURE-GENERATION SYSTEMS THAT UTILIZE RED, GREEN AND BLUE VISIBLE LASER DIODES. THE MANUFACTURABILITY OF THE SYSTEM COMPONENTS WILL BE STUDIED. A FIRST-ORDER TOLELRANCE ANALYSIS WILL BE UNDERTAKEN FOR THE MOST PROMISING DESIGNS. WE ALSO PLAN TO HELP DEFINE IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING STABLE MATERIALS AND RUGGED MECHANICAL MOUNTING TECHNIQUES. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WILL CONCENTRATE ON FABRICATING SYSTEMS USEFUL TO THE ARMY. IT IS EXPECTED THAT BOTH PHASE I AND PHASE II DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS WILL LEAD TO VERSATILE AND COMMERCIALLY VIABLE PHOROPTOR SYSTEMS.",

THE LACK OF GRAVITY IN SPACE WITH THE ASSOCIATED PHASE SEPARATION PROBLEMS, AS WELL AS EFFICIENCY AND RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS CAUSE SEVERE PROBLEMS WITH VAPOR COMPRESSION AND LIQUID-VAPOR ABSORPTION CYCLES. LIQUID-VAPOR ABSORPTIONCYCLE EFFICIENCIES ARE LIMITED BY THEIR STAGING AND DO NOT BENEFIT FROM LOW LIFT APPLICATIONS AS ENCOUNTERED IN THE ENVISIONED APPLICATION. IN THIS STUDY, A CONSTANT PRESSURE,ENGINE-STAGED, SOLID-VAPOR HEAT PUMP, IS BEING DEVELOPED WHICH DOES NOT DEPEND ON GRAVITY, HAS NO PHASE SEPARATION REQUIREMENTS OR MOVING PARTS, AND CAN BE HEAT OR COMPRESSOR ACTIVATED. STAGING IS BEING OBTAINED WITH A VARIETY OF COORDINATIVE COMPLEX COMPOUNDS WHICH LEADS TO CYCLE EFFICIENCIES SUPERIOR TO CONVENTIONAL SYSTEMS AND PERFORMANCE INCREASES WITH DECREASING TEMPERATURES LIFT REQUIREMENTS. THE RESEARCH IS FOCUSING ON THE CYCLE AND MEDIA DEVELOPMENT FOR HIGH EFFICIENCY OPERATION. IN THIS EFFORT, THE NECESSARY WORKING MEDIA, ARE BEING IDENTIFIED; APROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE HARDWARE DEMONSTRATION IS BEING PERFORMED; AND, THE HEAT PUMP PERFORMANCE IS BEING DETERMINED BY COMPUTER MODELING.

WE WILL USE EITHER A THULIUM LASER, WHICH IS CONTINUOUSLY TUNABLE FROM 1.85 UM TO OVER 2 UM, OR AN ERBIUM LASER, WHICH HAS SEVERAL EMISSION LINES BETWEEN 2.6 UM AND 2.9 UM. THE LASER WILL BE ALTERNATELY TUNED ON AND OFF A STRONG ABSORPTION LINE, AND BOTH THE SHIFTED FLUORESCENCE EXCITED BY THE LASER, AND THE BACKSCATTERED LIGHT AT THE LASER WAVELENGTH WILL BE COLLECTED. AT HIGH ALTITUDES, BOTH SIGNALS WILL BE DUE TO WATER-VAPOR FLUORESCENCE, AND THE H2O CONCENTRATION WILL BE CALCULATED FROM THE INTENSITY. AT LOWER ALTITUDES, WHERE THE FLUORESCENCE IS QUENCHED, THE [H2O] WILL BE CALCULATED FROM THE DIFFERENCE IN THE BACKSCATTERED INTENSITY WHEN THE LASER IS TUNED ON OR OFF THE ABSORPTION PEAK. MEASUREMENTS OF THE H2O FLUORESCENCE QUANTUM YIELD AND RADIATIVE LIFETIME AS A FUNCTION OF PRESSURE, AND A DEMONSTRATION OF RAPID TUNING BETWEEN AN ABSORPTION PEAK AND MINIMUM WILL BE CONDUCTED.

IN THE PROPOSED PROGRAM, NEW ALL-SOLID-STATE ARF LASER DRIVER TECHNOLOGY WILL BE DEVELOPED TO REPLACE THYRATRON-BASED DRIVERS USED IN CURRENT, COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE ARF LASERS. THIS NEW ALL-SOLID-STATE TECHNOLOGY WILL EXTEND DRIVER LIFETIME BY A FACTOR OF 20 (TO 6 X 10(10) SHOTS) AND WILL FEATURE NOVEL CIRCUITS WHICH RECOVER ENERGY REFLECTED FROM THE TIME-VARYING DISCHARGE LOAD.

THE PHOTOMETER MUST HAVE HIGH SENSITIVITY, OPERATE WITH A DUTY CYCLE OF ABOUT 100 PERCENT ON-SOURCE DURING CHOPPING, AND SAMPLE DATA CONTINUOUSLY FOR ONE HOUR AT 100 HZ. THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A COMPACT INSTRUMENT THAT CAN OPERATE TWO STATE-OF- THE-ART INFRARED DETECTORS (INSB AND SI:AS) SIMULTANEOUSLY IN THE SAME CRYOGENIC DEWAR. THE PHASE I OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP DETAILED CONCEPTUAL AND ENGINEERING DESIGNS OF A PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT AND CONSTRUCT A WORKING LABORATORY- BENCH MODEL. EXPERIENCE GAINED IN THE LABORATORY MODEL WOULD BE APPLIED DIRECTLY TO DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT DURING PHASE II. THIS PROJECT COULD LEAD TO APPLICATIONS IN GROUN- AND SPACECRAFT-BASED ASTORPHYSICAL AND PLANETARY SCIENCE; REMOTESENSING APPLICATIONS FOR GEOLOGICAL MAPPING AND FORESTRY; AND MONITORING MANUFACTURING AND INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES WITH EMITTED RADIATION SIGNATURES.",

WE SHALL INVESTIGATE A NOVEL, THREE-DIMENSIONAL, SILICON-ON-INSULATOR (SOI) GUIDED-WAVE STRUCTURE THAT WILL ALLOW OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS ON TWO STACKED LEVELS WITHIN A LARGE-AREA SILICON WAFER. TO DO THIS WE SHALL USE MULTIPLE IMPLANTS OF OXYGEN IONS BASED ON SPIRE'S UNIQUE EXPERIENCE IN PRODUCING MULTI-LEVEL SEPARATION BY IMPLANTATION OF OXYGEN (SIMOX) STRUCTURES. IN ADDITION, WE SHALL EXAMINE WAYS OF FABRICATING LOW-LOSS SOI WAVEGUIDES AND HIGH-SPEED ELECTRO-OPTIC (EO) DEVICES INTEGRATED IN SOI WAVEGUIDES. LOW-LOSS GUIDING AND PRACTICAL EO COMPONENTS ARE TWO KEY AREAS THAT NEED TO BE RESEARCHED TO ESTABLISH THAT SILICON IS A VIABLE AND VALUABLE OPTICAL MATERIAL.

AN ELECTRODE-LESS DEVICE IS EXPECTED TO BE MORE ACCURATE THAN A CONVENTIONAL DEVICE DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF ANY METAL ELECTRODES THAT TEND TO DISTURB THE FIELDS. THE KEY TO THE PROPOSED EFFORT IS THE TECHNIQUE OF SELECTIVELY REVERSE POLING A CHANNEL WAVEGUIDE SECTION IN THE CRYSTAL MATERIAL, LITHIUM NIOBATE, BY APPROPRIATE CHOICE OF CRYSTAL ORIENTATION AND TITANIUM DIFFUSION CONDITIONS. A MACH-ZEHNDER WAVEGUIDE INTERFEROMETER IS THEN CREATED USING A LOW TEMPERATURE PROTON EXCHANGE PROCESS IN WHICH ONE LEG OF THE INTERFEROMETER IS SUPERIMPOSED ON TOP OF THE REVERSE POLED CHANNEL CREATED IN THE PREVIOUS TEP. THE EFFECT OF AN EXTERNAL ELECTRI FIELD IN AN ELECTRODE-LESS DEVICE IS EQUIVALENT TO APPLYING VOLTAGES OF OPPOSITE POLARITIE TO THE ELECTRODES IN A CONVENTIONAL DEVICE. A NOVEL COMPLEMENTARY PHOTODETECTION SCHEME IS PROPOSED THAT REPLACES THE OUTPUT Y-BRANCH OF THE INTERFEROMETER WITH A DIRECTIONAL COUPLER. THIS GREATLY REDUCES THE EFFECTS OF LASER INTENSITY NOISE AND THUS LEADS TO TENS OF DB IMPROVEMENT IN DYNAMIC RANGE (>40 DB FOR A 1 GHZ BANDWIDTH).

HOWEVER, PREVIOUS EFFORTS HAVE HAD THE DISADVANTAGE OF REQUIRING A RELATIVELY LARGE PHYSICAL VOLUME AT THE ANTENNA LOCATION, WHICH PERTURBS THE FIELD BEING MEASURED. IN ORDER TO OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM, TACAN HAS RECENTLY DEVELOPED AND TESTED A NEW APPROACH FOR HIGH FREQUENCY FIELD MEASUREMENTS USING REMOTE OPTICAL POWERING TO ELIMINATE BATTERY OPERATION OF THE ELECTRONICS AND ELECTRO-OPTICS. A SPECIAL ELECTRO-OPTIC INTERFACE HAS BEEN DESIGNED, CONSISTING OF PASSIVE ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS TO COMPLETE A BIAS TEE NETWORK AND PROVIDE IMPEDANCE MATCHING. THE TOTAL VOLUME FOR THE ELECTRO-OPTIC INTERFACE UNIT CAN BE LESS THAN 1 CM3. NO BATTERIES ARE REQUIRED, AND THEREFORE OPERATION IS CONTINUOUS WITHOUT INTERRUPTIONS FOR BATTERY REPLACEMENT. NEW TECHNIQUES ARE DESCRIBED TO EXTEND THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE TO 100 GHZ. THE ACCURATE MEASUREMENT OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS WOULD BENEFIT A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING ANTENNA DEVELOPMENT, MONITORING OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS FOR POTENTIAL HAZARDS, AND EMI AND RFI MEASUREMENTS.

FOR PULSE POWER APPLICATION, U.S. ARMY REQUIRES PROJECTED CURRENT DENSITIES OF HUNDREDS OF AMPERES PER SQ.CM. IN THE MILLISECOND RANGE AND TENS OF AMPERES PER SQ.CM. IN THE FRACTIONS OF SECOND. CATHODES FOR SUCH MOLTEN-SALT LITHIUM BATTERIES MUST HAVE HIGH THEORETICAL ENERGY DENSITY AND GOOD REACTION RATES. PROPOSED PHASE I PROGRAM OBJECTIVES ARE ORIENTED TOWARDS IDENTIFYING AND DEVELOPING CATHODE MATERIALS WHICH CAN OPERATE IN A RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM MOLTEN-SALT BATTERY FOR DELIVERING EXCEEDINGLY HIGH PULSE POWER LEVELS. THESE NOVEL CATHODE MATERIALS ARE EXPECTED TO YIELD OPERATING CELL VOLTAGES OF 1 VOLT HIGHER THAN THOSE FOR THE LITHIUM/METAL SULFIDE HIGH TEMPERATURE SYTEMS. PHASE I PROGRAM CONSISTS OF STUDYING ELECTROCHEMISTRY OF A VARIETY OF PROMISING CANDIDATE MATERIALS IN THE LICL-KCL MOLTEN SALTS. THE CHEMICAL AND ELECTROCHEMICAL STABILITY OF THESE CATHODE MATERIALS WILL ALSO BE INVESTIGATED. CELL STUDIES WITH TWO MOST PROMISING CATHODE MATERIALS WILL BE CARRIED OUT TO ESTABLISH THE RECHARGEABILITY, DISCHARGE PULSE POWER PERFORMANCE AND CHARACTERIZATION UNDER REPETITAVE PULSING REGIMES.

THE DESIGN IS A VARIATION OF THE INTERSCIENCE RADIAL FLOW (IRF) FUEL CELL USING OXYGEN DIFFUSION TO PROVIDE OXIDANT RATHER THAN FORCED CONVECTION. THE TWO KEY PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SINGLE MANIFOLD IRF DESIGN (SMIRF) ARE POROUS, PARTICULATE ELECTRODES AND THE SINGLE MANIFOLD. PARTICULATE ELECTRODES ELIMINATE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THERMAL EXPANSION COEFFICIENT MISMATCHES BY ALLOWING THE SEPARATOR, SEALS, AND ELECTROLYTE TO EXPAND AT DIFFERENT RATES, AND CHANGE POSITION WITH RESPECT TO THE ELECTRODE WITHOUT LOSINGELECTRICAL CONTACT. SIMPLE, INEXPENSIVE MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED, SUCH AS TAPE CASTING AND STAMPING.

CATHODES MADE OUT OF PERFORATED ALUMINUM OR STAINLESS STEEL ARE MECHANICALLY SOUND, BUT LIGHT TRANSMISION IS NO BETTER THAN 60%. IF THE WORK BEING PERFORMED IS SUCCESSFUL, THE USE OF SCREENS IN BETWEEN THE PHOTIONIZATION SOURCE AND THE MAIN DISCHARGE WOULD BE ELIMINATED BY INTEGRATING THE PHOTOIONIZATION SOURCE TO THE CATHODE SURFACE. A SECOND MORE IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGY BREAKTHROUGH IS THE ABILITY OF THIS CONCEPT TO WORK AT VERY HIGH FREQUENCIES, FROM A FEW KILOHERTZ UP TO HUNDREDS OF MEGAHERTZ. THESE HIGH REPETION RATES ARE POSSBIEL DUE TO THE EXTREMELY LOW INDUCTANCE OF THE CONCEPT AND THE WAY THE COUPLING WITH THE DRIVING CIRCUIT COULD BE CHANGED FROM CAPACTIVE TO RESISTIVE OR A TUNED COMBINATION. DEVELOPMENT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IN THE LARGE SURFACE, HIGH CURRENT DENSITY REGIMENS WOULD REPRESENT A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN CATHODE TECHNOLOGY.

THE PHASE IWORK EFFORT WILL INCLUDE THE DESIGN, FABRICATION, AND TESTING OF A DEMONSTRATION-MODEL FURNACE ELEMENT TO PROVE FEASIBILITY. PHASE II WOULD INCLUDE THE FABRICATION AND EXTENSIVE TESTING OF A FULL-SCALE MODEL. BEGINNING IN THE 1970S NUMEROUS EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED IN SPACE IN NEAR-ZERO-G ENVIRONMENTS TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF CRYSTAL GROWTH IN THE ABSENCE OF GRAVITY. THESE TESTS WERE CONDUCTED ABOARD SKYLAB AND DURING THE APOLLO-SOYUZ TEST PROJECT. EVEN THOUGH THE RESULTS PROVED THE ADVANTAGES OF MATERIALS PROCESSING IN SPACE, LIMITATIONSIN THE EQUIPMENT, SUCH AS THE PROCESSING FURNACE, WERE REALIZED. A MORE VERSATILE, HIGHER-TEMPERATURE, VARIABLE-GRADIENT FURNACE IS REQUIRED FOR FUTURE SPACE VENTURES. THE CRYSTAL-GROWING FURNACE MUST HAVE A UNIFORM TEMPERATURE PROFILE WITHIN THE WORK AREA. THE PROFILE MUST BE VARIABLE WITHOUT PHYSICALLY ALTERING THE FURNACE SYSTEM. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DESIGN AND DEMONSTRATE A VARIABLE-TEMPERATURE-GRADIENT HEAT PIPE TO BE USED IN A MICROGRAVITY ENVIRONMENT. THE VARIABLE-TEMPERATURE PROFILE WILL BE CREATED BY THE DIFFUSION OF THE HEAT-PIPE WORKING FLUID INTO A NON-CONDENSIBLE GAS. THIS CONCEPT WILL PROVIDEA WIDE RANGE OF UNIFORM TEMPERATURE PROFILES AND, AT THE SAME TIME, MINIMIZE MASS AND POWER CONSUMPTION.

TO REDUCE THIS PROBLEM, REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS ARE PLANNED BASEDON THE USE OF HYDROGEN ABSORBED AND DESORBED BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT METAL HYDRIDES. BECAUSE THESE MATERIALS STORE EXTREMELY LARGE VOLUMES OF HYDROGEN, THEY HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL FOR COOLING AND REFRIGERATION, WHICH OCCURS WHEN HYDROGEN IS DESORBED FROM ONE OF THE HYDRIDES IN THE SYSTEM. HOWEVER, NO CURRENT HYDROGEN SYSTEM DESIGNS HAVE A COEFFICIENT OF PERFORMANCE (COP) LARGE ENOUGH TO COMPETE WITH CONVENTIONAL CHLOROFLUOROCARBON (CFC) SYSTEMS. DURING SOME RECENTLY COMPLETED RESEARCH WORK, AN APPROACH THAT ALLOWS A HYDRIDE-DRIVEN REFRIGERATION SYSTEM TO EXCEED THE COP OF CONVENTIONAL CFC SYSTEMS WAS DISCOVERED. BASED ON CALCULATIONS, THIS INNOVATIVE SYSTEM, WITH A CHOICE OF CERTAIN METAL HYDRIDE PAIRS, APPROACHES THE EFFICIENCY OF A CARNOT CYCLE, AND THE COP CAN BE AS HIGH AS 1.0. THE PURPOSE OF THE PHASE I RESEARCH IS TO TEST A LABORATORY WORKING MODEL OF THIS INNOVATIVE HYDRIDE-DRIVEN REFRIGERATORAND TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE APPROACH. EXPERIMENTALLY DETERMINED COPS NEAR 1.0 WILL CORROBORATE THECALCULATIONS AND PROVE THAT METAL HYDRIDE SYSTEMS CAN BE MADE TO BE VERY COMPETITIVE WITH CONVENTIONAL REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS.

IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MANIPULATION OF PHOSPHOLIPID ANTIGEN CONCENTRATION OR OF PHOSPHOLIPID-LIPID MIXTURES IN AN ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA) SYSTEM MAY ENABLE MORE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENTS WITH APS. WITH A VIEW TO PREPARING A MARKETABLE ELISA KIT SPECIFICALLYDESIGNED TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS WITH APS, THIS STUDY WILL COMPARE ELISA SYSTEMS WITH VARYING CONCENTRATIONS OF NEGATIVELY CHARGED PHOSPHOLIPIDS AND PHOSPHOLIPID-LIPID MIXTURES TO DETERMINE THE SYSTEM THAT IS MOST SENSITIVE AND SPECIFIC FOR IDENTIFYING APS PATIENTS. MATERIALS USED IN THE ASSAY SYSTEMS WILL BE EVALUATED FOR THEIR STABILITY OVERTIME TO DETERMINE THEIR UTILITY IN AN ELISA KIT.",

THE FUNDAMENTAL ARCHITECTURE OF CERTAIN MULTICHANNEL STRUCTURAL ANALYZERS MAY BE AUGMENTED WITH APPROPRIATE REAL-TIME, MICROCODE FUNCTIONS. THIS WILL ALLOW BOTH CONTROL DESIGN RESEARCHERS AND STRUCTURAL DYNAMICISTS TO USE A SINGLE PLATFORM FOR DEVELOPING TEST METHODS TO IMPLEMENT CONTROLLERDESIGNS AND SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION. THE FINDINGS WILL AID IN THE ANALYSIS AND SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH GROUND TESTING OF LARGE SPACE STRUCTURES, AND ULTIMATELY CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN THE DESIGN OF SUCH STRUCTURES AND THEIR CONTROL SYSTEMS. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO SOLICIT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE TWO TECHNOLOGIES OF CONTROLS AND STRUCTURES, AND INCREASE THE SHARING OF TEST REQUIREMENTS. PHASE I WILL DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF SUCH AN ADAPTATIONAND WHAT, IF ANY, MODIFICATIONS TO HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WILL BE NECESSARY TO CONDUCT AN INTEGRATED DEMONSTRATION ON A NASA TEST STRUCTURE DURING PHASE II.

THE PRESENCE OF KEROSENE IN THESE WATERWAYS IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE FLUSHING AND DISPOSAL OF THIS SOLVENT FROM THE COCAINE PROCESS. ADVANTAGES OF THIS TECHNIQUE OVER DIRECT CHEMICAL VAPOR DETECTION ARE: CHEMICAL VAPOR DETECTION IN JUNGLE SETTINGS HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN DIFFICULT DUE TO TERRAIN AND INTERFERENCES (METHANE FOR EXAMPLE). MOST PROCESSING CHEMICALS HAVE HIGH VAPOR PRESSURES, HEAVIER THAN AIR. THIS CAUSES THE MAJORITY OF THE VAPORS TO REMAIN CLOSE TO THE GROUND, WITH LITTLE OR NO CONCENTRATION OVER THE JUNGLE CANOPY.
