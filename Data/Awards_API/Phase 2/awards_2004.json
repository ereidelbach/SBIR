        "abstract": "Improved capacitor technologies are required for future power electronics and pulsed power systems being considered by the Navy as part of the All Electric Ship initiative.  Using a single electrical generation system to supply power to both drive and auxiliary ship systems will enable much more efficient use of power, allow for damage tolerant distributed power systems, and provide high energy pulsed power delivery to electromagnetic weapons and electromagnetic aircraft launchers.  The key components to these systems are power electronic building blocks (AC/DC and DC/DC converters) and pulse forming networks.  In both systems, capacitors are critical components in terms of volume and weight.  Reducing the size of these systems requires capacitors with much higher energy density than conventional polymer film (1 - 2 J/cc) and ceramic capacitors (0.1 J/cc).  In the Phase I program TRS Technologies and the Pennsylvania State University demonstrated composite dielectrics of glass and antiferroelectric (AFE) ceramic with reliable energy densities in excess of 10 J/cc.  For the proposed Phase II program, TRS will lead a team to develop large glass-AFE composite capacitors for use as DC bus, decoupling, circuit protection (voltage clamping), and snubber capacitors in 100 kW, 5 kHz power control modules such as DC/DC converters.",

The primary proposed objectives for Phase II are to design and implement a fully operational \"version 1.0\" of our innovative WRAP decision aid, building upon our successful design and prototyping activities conducted during Phase I.  We anticipate this yielding a unique, commercially viable product that will effectively meet the needs of the DoD community as well as a wide array of commercial users in a diverse set of weather-sensitive businesses.  One other key objective is to formulate a viable approach for the calculation of weather forecast uncertainty for incorporation into the WRAP framework including:  a) development of algorithms to compute probability forecasts from an operational weather model (such as GFS) and its ensemble members; and b) development of algorithms to be used to calibrate the probability forecasts.",

        "abstract": "Advances in imaging infrared (IIR) technology and demonstration of this technology as a capable means of target discrimination, automatic target recognition (ATR), and auto-tracking have led to the development of numerous IIR weapon systems.  Although excellent analysis tools exist for describing the imaging sensors themselves, no adequate method or tools exist for characterizing the auto-detection and tracking performance capability of the sensors against targets in a variety of backgrounds.  This is complicated by the fact that auto-detection and tracking techniques are difficult to characterize.  It is impossible to generate a single generic metric that will accurately predict the performance of all imaging auto-trackers.  Typically auto-trackers can be categorized based on their fundamental algorithm.  With knowledge of the detection or tracking algorithm, an appropriate metric can be used to predict performance.  This effort identifies the common detection algorithms and tracker routines and uses the fundamental algorithms as metrics.  These metrics will be used to analyze real imagery from various IR sensors.  A methodology for a performance metric will be developed that accurately predicts auto-detection and tracker performance and a validation plan will be developed comparing actual auto-detection and tracker systems to the metric results.",

The considerable scatter in stress-rupture life exhibited by fiber reinforced composites, coupled with the lack of reliable life prediction methods, have led to the requirement for low operating pressures in relation to the design burst pressure.  This leads to overly conservative designs and limited service life.  Without a more reliable methodology for predicting stress-rupture life and proven accelerated test methods, a large number of tests over long periods of time are required.  An improved approach for predicting the stress-rupture life of composite pressure vessels, based on actual fiber stress history, is needed.  Under the proposed Phase II SBIR program, an improved methodology for predicting the stress-rupture life of filament wound composite pressure vessels based on actual fiber and matrix stress history is developed.  The methodology includes an analytical model for predicting life based on the time-dependent behavior and failure mechanisms associated with fiber reinforced composites.  The analytical model is supported by short-term and long-term testing of fiber properties, accelerated testing using time-temperature-stress superposition (TTSSP) as applied to dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and stress-rupture testing of composite pressure vessels.",

These volumetric data sets and a high fidelity generic 3D model of the human body provide active computer assistance to the medic by displaying the way the ultrasound probe image plane moves toward the specified anatomic location as the ultrasound probe is manipulated over the soldier's body. We employ Digital Human Technology (DHT) and image guided external registration techniques to measure the 3D motion of the probe and register its location to the precise features of the patient's body.",

An innovative fuel delivery device is proposed that will generate fine aerosols of logistics fuels to promote rapid vaporization with limited preheating.  The device will be compact and consume only minimal electric power, making long-term battery operation practical.  The technology behind the micro-atomizer has been demonstrated for other aerosol generation applications and can be readily integrated with a wide range of combustion devices.

Phase II will involve fabrication and testing of prototype fuel delivery devices culminating in the delivery of hardware for initial field-testing and demonstration.",

The domes must transmit infrared and visible light with high resolution and low signal loss while being exposed to extreme conditions.  Sapphire is one of the few materials whose mechanical and optical properties meet operational constraints. Unfortunately, sapphire domes are very expensive because of the excessive shaping needed to produce a dome shape.    Spinel has been qualified for domes in several missile systems and can be hot-pressed to near net shape, significantly reducing the grinding needed and thereby greatly reducing cost. Unfortunately, impurities in the starting materials adversely affect the yields and quality of the transparent spinel domes.  In the Phase I project TDA developed precursor powders that we used to make a transparent spinel part of high quality.

        "abstract": "Despite the extensive research expended on developing high Tg resins for composite filament winding applications, these resins require heated processing which limits their general acceptance in current production facilities. New filament winding matrix resins are therefore under development to overcome this limitation. TRI/Austin developed preliminary hybrid resin formulations in Phase I that are low viscosity at room temperature and have glass transitions of over 300C. In addition, it was found that thermal stability and char yield was in excess of the predicted values. This may be attributable to a synergistic char formation mechanism between the two polymers in the hybrid during decomposition. The improvement in thermal stability is potentially relevant in terms of eliminating the secondary thermal barrier coating that is sometimes necessary on rocket motor casings. The overall objective of the Phase II research effort will be the transition of the developed resins system to a production environment. Working closely with ARC and AMCOM, TRI-Austin will fabricate and test representative pressure vessels for Phase II demonstration. These composite pressure vessels will be fabricated utilizing candidate materials, and the degree to which the resins are compatible with current processing techniques will be demonstrated.",

After bacteria have been depleted in the culture, PS is harvested and purified from the culture media, and Proteinase 1 is extracted and purified from the Dictyostelium cells.

        "abstract": "There is an increasing need for an accurate (within 2%) method for measuring the torque of a helicopter tail rotor shaft. Current methods are expensive and suffer from a number of other flaws including complicated manufacturing/installation issues, limited accuracy (5%), and so on.     International Electronic Machines (IEM) Corp., a leader in the field of sensor instrumentation technology for transportation applications, proposes to develop a non-contacting torque sensor for helicopter tail rotor drive systems. This system will build upon the results obtained in the Phase I work on this same topic; in this Phase I work IEM determined that the preferred approach will involve magnetic encoder technology. The final product of the Phase II research will be a system which is: accurate to 1% of full-scale torque (making considerable extra power available for maneuvering), inexpensive, easy to install/maintain, reliable, able to log rotor data for analysis or use in fatigue models, fast for tracking transient loads, and adaptable to various shaft locations. Boeing, the manufacturer of the Chinook  rotorcraft which is the specific subject of this research, was favorably impressed by IEM's preliminary work and has offered assistance for the Phase II effort and potential financial support for later commercial development.",

Currently, chemically contaminated hardware is decontaminated either with the highly caustic and corrosive DS2 or with peroxide foam decontaminants.  Either approach necessitates carrying sufficient decontaminant to forward bases, and therefore presents an additional logistics burden.  Furthermore, even decontaminated items may retain some agent especially around seams, and in time the trapped agent may diffuse out of the coating (desorb), exposing soldiers to additional hazards and activating alarm systems.  An ideal protective system would modify the surface of critical materials so that they offer protection from CW and BW agents at all times, with no additional operational or logistics burden.  TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes to develop a reactive coating to spontaneously detoxify chemical weapons under ambient conditions.  In Phase II, we will select the most active and stable catalysts for both hydrolysis and oxidation of chemical agents, scale up their syntheses, and incorporate them into polyurethane coatings.  These coatings will be tested to assure that the catalysts do not degrade the important properties of the coatings and to demonstrate the stability of the coating's chemical activity after accelerated weathering.",

The platform will combine IEF and SDS gel electrophoresis on a single microfluidic chip, with chip-level laser-induced fluorescence detection to record the separated protein positions, and an integrated electrospray ionization tip array to elute separated proteins from the chip onto a MALDI target for MALDI-MS analysis. This detection platform will eliminate the manually-intensive process of running standard 2-D gels, while also eliminating sample dilution associated with traditional 2-D PAGE / MALDI-MS interfacing. Furthermore, the system is designed to provide complete 2-D separations in under 15 min, and full PTM identification via MALDI-MS in under 1 hr, approximately an order of magnitude faster than traditional 2-D PAGE, with greatly improved PTM analysis capabilities in a miniaturized format.",

Replacing the historically hemispheric domes on missiles with more aerodynamic shapes results in benefits such as reduced drag, greater speeds, shorter time to target, longer range and overall greater lethality.  Conventional polishing processes used to manufacture flat and spherical optics cannot be utilized for the production of conformal optics such as ogive domes.  Some processes, such as MRF, exist that are capable of finishing the outside of an ogive dome, but the concave side still presents a challenge.  The feasibility of using MR Jet for precision finishing this class of optics was clearly demonstrated during Phase I, with the precision polishing of a steep concave sphere embedded into an ogive-shaped cavity.  During Phase II, the process will be developed further to allow for the cost effective manufacture of truly conformal shapes including cavities with large sag.  In addition, a collaborative manufacturing approach will be taken so that the ability to manufacture existing and future domes and windows for government and commercial applications with MR Jet will be clearly demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "The US Army has identified the need for a compact, lightweight, self-contained, electrically efficient, ruggedizable laser transmitter for 3-D imaging ladar applications. The transmitter cost, weight, footprint, and performance requirements (>5 W, 20-30 kHz, 5-20 ns) cannot be simultaneously met using current transmitter technology based on bulk Er, Ho, Tm lasers, OPOs, OPAs or Raman lasers.  Conventional single-mode or large mode area (LMA) fiber lasers are limited by damage and parasitic nonlinear processes to peak powers well below those required in this program.  Coherent Technologies, Inc. proposes a breakthrough approach to meet the transmitter requirements.  The proposed transmitter implements a proprietary self-imaging process in a large core fiber to retain the high efficiency, diffraction-limited beam quality and excellent thermal handling of a single-mode fiber laser, while scaling the aperture to handle much higher peak power levels.   A versatile master-oscillator power-amplifier (MOPA) architecture is adopted to meet the temporal format requirements without need for resonators or Q-switches.  The self-imaging technique and MOPA architecture are leveraged by comprehensive demonstrations and by multiple other programs.  The Phase I program has provided critical laboratory risk reduction demonstrations and developed a preliminary brassboard design to be developed, tested, and delivered on the Phase II program.",

Luna meets the need to develop conductive coatings and sealants to attain the EMI shielding needs for military vehicles, weapons, and equipment.  Coatings which possess both EMI shielding as well as prevent corrosion and material degradation in adverse environments are critical to reducing equipment downtime due to maintenance.  Owing to their high conductivity, small size, and large aspect ratio, single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have the unique ability to achieve high levels of conductivity at low loadings thus preventing deterioration of other required coating properties.  Luna has developed a comprehensive program to include highly conductive SWCNT into selected coating formulations, and to develop a transition plan toward military and commercial protective coating applications.",

        "abstract": "Black River Systems (with Dr. Tapan Sarkar of OHRN, and Stiefvater Consultants Inc.) proposes a hybrid electromagnetic modeling compute engine.  This hybrid engine will model the small features of antenna/vehicle structure simultaneously with the large environmental features, executing on both parallel processor and single CPU computers.  Traditional computational electromagnetic analysis is performed exclusively in either the frequency or time domain.  Extrapolation in either domain is sometimes numerically unstable, thus affecting accuracy.  When both small and large features are modeled, the impedance and excitation matrices need to be simultaneously and accurately computed.  Errors from using an approximate asymptotic method to characterize large structures can cause small features in the solution to be completely masked.  We avoid this obstacle by applying a hybrid approach and in estimating the characteristics of the solution.  This hybrid approach utilizes the strengths of both frequency domain and time domain methodologies and minimizes the weaknesses of each by using the frequency response and time domain for the high, greatly reducing the required processing.    We believe that this approach of hybridizing time and frequency domain solutions will allow at least a 10:1 increase in frequency over current methods, allowing analysis of targets in realistic enviroments and antennas with their support structures.",

By using the oxygen transport molecules in the electrolyte the specific capacity of the cathodes were greatly improve by better utilization of the cathode. The oxygen transport molecules will increase the amount of dissolved oxygen carried by the electrolyte in the porous air cathode.  This will increase the rate of discharge and the capacity by distributing the oxygen throughout the pores of the cathode. The oxygen transport molecules also have water repulsion properties to increase the safety of the cell. Yardney's experience and technologies in the zinc-air and Al-air power sources will be adopted in the design of the new large lithium air cells and batteries.

Monitoring provides information about a vector's spatial and temporal distribution and is essential in establishing preventive measures against the pest. Monitoring is also important in directing control efforts and as such has shown its value in the eradication of populations of medically important insects.     The system developed will be used in combination with an attractant-monitoring surface. Fortunately, within the past six months ISCA Technologies, Inc. has disclosed a novel mosquito lure, which proves to be highly effective in attracting host-seeking Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus females. Initial laboratory data suggests that under controlled lab conditions, this lure/trap combination captures mosquitoes at a rate comparable to human landing and biting collections.

A portable device ready to use anywhere that electronically scores the number of disease carrying insects.

Software can be applied to detect and qualify moving contacts and provide alarm actions accordingly. Combination of this capability with human identification software provides powerful tool for force protection. The software can provide information on many moving objects simultaneously, giving sentries advance notice of possible intrusions on a perimeter. These systems can also allow operators to set criteria to track specific contacts among other traffic. Development of this capability for floating moving platforms such as ships and offshore oil platforms will greatly enhance situational awareness and help in protecting these important assets.",

The development effort proposed here targets newer technology enabled by recent advances in miniaturization technology in order to offer the design of a complete microclimate system, the performance of which cannot be matched simply by using smaller versions of currently available designs.    In a Phase I SBIR effort, Rini Technologies Inc (RTI) has demonstrated the feasibility of this Micro-Climate Cooling system. Feasibility has been established both for the thermodynamic cycle as well as for the refrigerant compressor - the key component in the system. Initial tests of the compressor have isolated points of power loss and a plan has been put into place to make further improvements.     RTI will optimize each component so as to work together in an efficient and synergistic fashion. The proposed cooling system will produce 120W of cooling to a water vest with an average water temperature of 22 \u00b0C, weigh 3.5 lbs, and require 50W of electrical power (where an additional 2.3 lbs of batteries will last 4 hours). Following component optimization and fabrication, the unit will be tested in a \"real world\" outdoor environment.",

The widespread use of manual planning systems with disparate automated information systems only compounds the analysis and planning problems.     The Aerial Port Operations Planner (APOP) is a PC based visualization tool enabling planners to determine the optimum organization and location for aerial port operations facilities at a specific airport. APOP is a menu driven, rules based analysis tool that helps the planner evaluate alternative layouts for a specific airfield or evaluate alternative airfields. In addition to rules based analysis (e.g., ammo dump must be xyz feet from fuel storage), terrain slope analysis is performed to identify the optimum layout. Utilizing NIMA's worldwide digital data products (e.g., Digital Terrain Elevation Data [DTED]), results of the analysis are visualized on digital maps of the local terrain. APOP analysis reports allow planners to be able to project the amount of time it takes for a specific unit to occupy the selected APOE, deploy, clear the selected APOD, and be ready for integration into the battle. APOP also provides an automated interface to existing automated planning tools using DESE's digital glue concept.",

The 4 x 4 X-band switch matrix routes and combines signals at low levels of approximately 0 dBm, enabling each of the outputs to be rapidly programmed as an arbitrary combination of the inputs.  IBM's SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) technology is used to create ultra-fast active switches capable of switching times of less than 50 ps.  Gain, switching, combining and control functions are integrated to produce a complete switch matrix on a chip. The active switch provides ultra-fast switching with constant port impedances while reducing the size and component count of the switch matrix.  Preliminary switch core circuit design simulations show that the switch core offers very fast switching time of the order of 30 ps.  This short transition time substantially limits the spurious energy due to switching, resulting in exceptional switching spurious product rejection of -56 dBc.  The Phase I Study indicates that this technology offers substantial performance improvements relative to existing passive switch approaches. In Phase II, the design of the integrated switch matrix chip will be performed.  In Phase II Plus, the switch matrix prototypes will be fabricated and tested.",

The Phase I results were extremely encouraging with the battery electrodes demonstrating a capacity of 5800 mAh/g of carbon (16 times that of normal carbon!) and the ultracapacitor electrodes demonstrating an energy storage capacity that was 18 times that of normal ultracapacitor electrodes.  Projections show a full-scale prototype system will deliver more energy and power from a lighter and smaller package, and because of Mainstream's new production process, will do so for the same cost.

        "abstract": "The U.S. Military Services have urgent needs for improved technologies to detect mines, car bombs, and improvised explosive devices.  Similar technologies are needed for homeland defense. Ion Mobility Spectrometers (IMS) are already used extensively to detect trace volatiles of explosives and chemical weapons.  Developed in the 1970s, IMS has become a mainstay of explosives detection technology due to its low cost, rapid response and high sensitivity (parts per billion).  Nonetheless, there is compelling need to develop more sensitive sensors that are field-deployable to meet the challenges of countermine and anti-terror defense. Greater sensitivity will enhance ability to detect trace volatiles of explosives at greater distance from the source of emanation and will also enable detection of advanced explosives having low vapor pressure.  In Phase I we have proven that a new form of IMS instrument based on Differential Mobility Analysis (DMA) can likely meet these challenges.  Whereas IMS separates ions in time, the DMA separates them in space.  This fundamentally new approach offers important advantages including significantly enhanced sensitivity (parts per trillion) as demonstrated in Phase I.  As an adjunct to our development of the DMA, we will continue to explore use of secondary ionization by electro-spray as replacement for radioactive ionization sources necessary for conventional IMS thereby solving a significant logistical and safety problem.  Phase II will build on our success in Phase I, culminating in the development of a prototype robot-mounted DMA explosives sensor.",

We have identified an approach to structural analysis that combines a fully developed circuit board analysis program that does not address shock with structural dynamic theory that can be applied to fill the gap.  In keeping with sound engineering practice the enhanced analysis program must be test verified.  We are proposing a test program to fill the gap that is tailored to tune and verify the analysis product in a cost-conscious manner minimizing test machine and instrumentation costs.    For fragility evaluation of non-structural system elements, we are proposing an expert system module that will be bound with the structural analysis module into an integrated product, ESET.

The UAV/UGV operating environment requires any operational sensor to be optimally compact, light-weight, and have low power consumption.  In Phase I, CTI: 1) developed requirements, specifications, and a system design for a UAV/UGV coherent Doppler Lidar system, focusing on modularity, compact size, low power consumption, and pulse format flexibility; 2) demonstrated a wide range of laser pulse formats, ranging from short pulses for high-resolution terrain mapping to longer pulses for high-resolution wind sensing; and 3) demonstrated a unique proprietary lidar cavity, enabling construction of small, light-weight, reliable, and rugged transceivers.  The agile-pulse laser and the compact cavity architecture form the foundation for the ultra-compact Doppler lidar for UAV/UGV.

As in all existing automatic speech recognition systems, the recognition performances of the Phraselator can be degraded seriously by background military noises and extraneous talking. The objective of this project is to solve the problems and make the Phraselator more useful under military operations. During the Phase I of this project, LcT have successfully completed the feasibility research by introducing a 4-sensor microphone array and an advanced noise reduction/speech enhancement algorithms. Our experiments have showed that we can improve the signal-to-noise (SNR) for about 15 dB. Our solution shows the premise to outperform currently available techniques, and will significant improve the Phraselaor speech recognition accuracy under background noises. During Phase II, we will further improve the algorithms to support two-way machine translation, in which one speaker is close to the Phaselator and another one is in a few meters away. We will also improve the microphone array to suppress any extraneous talking. All the algorithms plus the microphone array will be implemented as hardware in an audio module and integrated into the Phraselator.

The proposed TIMS seals will provide >60 dB EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) in the frequency range of 10 KHz to 40 GHz even after 1000 hours salt fog exposure, and will have minimal compression set (20-40%) for good environmental sealing.

Our objective during Phase 2 is to test, validate, and demonstrate the operation of the protocol on prototype hardware. The link layer protocol provides reliable and efficient communication services by overcoming the problems associated with blockage by terrain obstacles. The protocol addresses both voice and data communication.   The protocol combines standard communications protocol techniques, such as forward error correction, selective acknowledgements, and repeat request retransmission with a novel fast switching algorithm to provide nearly seamless connectivity to a small cadre of cooperating satellite terminals. A military convoy equipped with several satellite communication vehicles would form such a cadre. By rapidly switching which terminal in the cadre is in active use, the protocol avoids the blockages and provides high capacity and reliability to the entire convoy.  Validation of the algorithms, protocols, and actual software is necessary in advance of incorporation into satellite terminal designs and fabrication in Phase 3, both to avoid costly mistakes and to attract financing for such an endeavor.

Employing the principals of terminal homing guidance, the design is ideally suited to facilitate recovery on a moving ship deck.  The concept will take advantage of the precision positioning offered by the relative navigation solution and precision path regulation offered by the hybrid control system to enable recovery on very small deck platforms. We will demonstrate that the recent technology advances in miniaturized GPS receivers, micro-electromechanical sensors (MEMS), spread-spectrum communications transceivers, and single-board computers all combine to offer a small, light-weight, reliable and affordable hardware architecture to address the shipboard recovery problem.

        "abstract": "For stationary ground-moving target indication (GMTI) radars, targets are generally isolated from clutter under the assumption that the clutter background is non-moving and therefore exists only at zero Doppler while moving targets will appear at non-zero Doppler shifts. In reality the background clutter will often have a non-zero bandwidth due to the presence of wind-blown foliage such as trees and shrubs and thus occupy Doppler filters other than the zero-Doppler filter. This results in degradation of the detection performance for slow moving targets resulting in minimum detectable velocity (MDV) performance of a radar system that varies as wind conditions change. For example, when the wind is blowing the clutter will occupy additional Doppler filters resulting in the obscuration of some moving targets that would otherwise be detectable under calmer wind conditions. The main goal of the proposed research is to develop techniques to estimate clutter Doppler spread directly from the radar data in real-time and exploit that knowledge to improve GMTI system performance. It is anticipated that the algorithms developed under the proposed effort will improve system performance by applying real-time characterization of the clutter Doppler spread due to wind-blown clutter during a given coherent processing interval (CPI).",

With the current Force Transformation objectives and the move toward NetCentric Warfare and Operations this situation will only be exacerbated.  At some point DRFMs will no longer be able to support the increased sensor resolutions and system bandwidths associated with the digital battlefield.  The ARL/SPEC Wide Band High Fidelity DRFM (HiFiD) system will arrest this decline in relative performance and provide the Army, the Joint Forces and the DoD as a whole a high performance, flexible, DRFM architecture that evolves with the digital battlefield.  Future evolutions of HiFiD derived subsystems may be incorporated into weapons themselves to facilitate System Under Test economies, improved training strategies and reduction of operator data fog on the battlefield.  An investment in test range instrumentation could yield multiple paybacks, including system test cost reductions, accelerated development schedules, improved initial and follow-on training, and improved operational system instrumentation and communications",

Phase II will continue the development of  a ladar-based imaging and surveillance system for perimeter defense against UAVs. In the successful Phase I, a characterization of two-dimensional limited-angle ladar-UAV imaging was performed. The system, Tomographic Reconstruction of Active Imaging Ladar Signals (TRAILS), will be upgraded to include three-dimensional limited-angle tomographic reconstruction, high fidelity forward simulation of ladar reflection from UAVs, atmospheric effects, target identification, and ladar specification analysis. This includes SNR and image resolution tradeoffs under various imaging conditions, including severely occluded imaging sweeps and UAV self-shadowing. Forefront SSI codes for light and atmospheric simulation, QUID and MODTRAN, will be interfaced with limited-angle 3D reconstruction algorithms. The innovative use of OpenGL buffers for the reconstruction algorithms will make the reconstruction near real time. Spectral Sciences has teamed with Kodak to measure plume absorption profiles from an airborne differential absorption lidar (DIAL) sensor, and apply TRAILS to reconstruct the plume in three dimensions. In addition to testing TRAILS for UAV threat scenarios, the collaboration will lead to new applications for TRAILS.",

This next generation integrated architecture, when implemented, will dramatically improve research quality and decrease time to biological discovery. No existing commercial solution provides as complete or as integrated a solution for the advanced analysis of array functional genomic measurements as the one defined here. Current commercial or academic solutions are mostly limited to basic analysis of array data to determine differential expression and do not practically address the advanced analysis of array data to uncover sets of associations between genes. Most of these solutions require scientists to spend their time tediously feeding data from one analytical or visualization component to the next to complete data analyses. Moreover, no commercial solutions exist to assist scientists in the critically important task of assembling testable models from the results of these advanced analyses.

        "abstract": "Converting bulk liquid fuel into a finely atomized mist is the standard method for homogeneously mixing it with the air essential for combustion.  In military field situations logistic-fuels like JP8 are easy to supply but are viscous and less filtered making them difficult to micro-atomize and combust in burners other than the large engines of heavy-equipment.  The traditional strategy for micro-atomizing any liquid is to drive it through an orifice with sufficient force that it breaks into small droplets.  Cascade Designs, Inc. believes the smallest and safest system can be made by employing a vaporization strategy.  The recently renamed state-of-the-art Capillary Force Vaporizer (CFV) developed by Vapore, Inc. (formerly called the Capillary Pump or \"CP\") is an elegant solid-state device that processes liquid fuel through the management of thermal energy.  It eliminates the need for a mechanical pressure generating device and a pressurizable fuel tank, meaning the overall device can be made lighter, safer, and smaller.  Phase I work has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach.

Typical textile manufacturing methods required specific manufacturing steps to be treated as a cell.  Whereby one cell does the cuff, one the sleeve, and another joins the two.  Complex garments could require 50 steps, any one of which could fail quality control (QC).  It is this complexity and cost that drive manufacturing off shore, labor means nothing.    LEB promises to allow modular manufacturing means with higher throughput speeds fully automated manufacturing and higher performance seam construction.  The modular manufacturing system would allow a single point of attachment.  This standard drive/attachment point allows any product or component to be fixtured and seamed with no change physically to the LEB delivery machine.  This system is based on an extrusion. We have quotes from several vendors with proposed delivery dates (6 to 8 weeks).  This modular system allows multiple loading stations, not five ladies running 5 machines, but 5 ladies loading fixtures to feed one station allowing high throughputs and fully automated manufacturing.  One single station could run circles, crotches, sleeves, and straight seams of any length with minor changes, making adaptable manufacturing to become a reality.  Maximum size and production variability in piece pattern handling is a benefit of this modular system.

        "abstract": "ISX Corporation, in conjunction with the Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratory, proposes the continued development of the Generalized UAV Associate (GUAVA).  GUAVA will address the significant military problem of a dismounted soldier attempting to operate a small UAV in a busy tactical situation.  GUAVA will be implemented as an associate system running on a personal digital assistant (PDA).  Through hierarchical, composable behavior specification GUAVA will enable the soldier to effectively task the UAV at levels of abstraction ranging from the highest level (Mission) through the most detailed level (Execution) without needing to continually interact with the PDA.  GUAVA will use innovative bandwidth-aware distributed software agent architecture based on the Distributed Agent-Based Information Dissemination System (DAIDS) and the Enhanced Mobile Agent Architecture (EMAA) to augment the capabilities of the small UAV so that the GUAVA-UAV combination has an apparent Autonomous Control Level of ACL-4.  GUAVA will leverage the Mission Effectiveness and Safety Analysis (MENSA) system to monitor and evaluate the UAV's ability to fulfill its mission. GUAVA will include a detailed model of the soldier's operational context to be used in determining information needs and in anticipatory re-planning of missions in the event of an anomaly.",

        "abstract": "Ongoing advances in technology have increased mission capabilities of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) while simultaneously reducing their size and cost.  It is conceivable that a battalion-sized Unit of Action (UA) might operate a dozen or more small UAVs simultaneously in a small area of the battlespace with missions ranging from reconnaissance, to communications, to being elements of coordinated strike missions.  The ISX/SRI/BRG team will develop a UAV Airspace Management System (UAMS) operating on a small UAV level to deconflict multiple small UAV path plans in real time using limited sensors, communications, and processing.     At the end of the UAMS Phase II effort, we will exhibite a proof-of-concept demonstration of the military operational benefits of a UAMS system that defines a hybrid airspace management system capable of adapting to changes in the airspace by dynamically adjusting the balance of centralized and distributed control over the airspace.  The benefits provided by UAMS to airspace management are continuous adaptability to variable airspace environments, support more airspace entity types, handling more mission types, and support higher UAV densities.  UAMS has been designed with the flexibility to adapt to variable airspace environments and support the promising future of UAV applications.",

All Phase I goals were met or exceeded, setting the stage for follow-on Phase II work that will allow us to research, develop, and integrate extensions to the RDBMS so that a fully three-dimensional GIS will be possible for the first time.  These extensions will include the first ISO TC211 19107-compliant implementation, an efficient 3D surface representation, and a 3D spatial querying capability to exploit a 3D spatial index.

        "abstract": "Geolocation in indoor and urban areas is an essential emerging technology to enhance situational/positional awareness capabilities of U.S. soldiers. Maintaining situational awareness in indoor and urban environments is difficult because buildings, walls and other obstacles obstruct RF propagation. Thus the key parameter for geolocation, the direct path propagation signal, is harder to detect.  The technical challenge is to develop geolocation algorithms that overcome the direct path obstructions and integrate them into a communication network that is easily deployed, low cost, and collaboratively provides accurate location information.    In Phase I, Innovative Wireless Technologies (IWT) proved that a ultra wideband (UWB) geolocation network can provide location accuracy of 1 meter for outdoor to indoor conditions.  IWT's innovative UWB ranging and positioning solution is based on multi-band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) which has inherent advantages over pulse-based UWB systems.  A key advantage is spectral flexibility which allows individual carriers and frequency bands to be avoided, thereby enhancing the anti-jam performance of the system.    In Phase II, IWT will build upon related UWB ad-hoc network projects to implement and demonstrate the performance of the geolocation algorithms. Key position and ranging accuracy parameters will be demonstrated in a mobile environment.",

To meet this objective several of the current limitations of the existing LENSO process need to be overcome.  In particular, a method must be identified and developed to overcome limited overhang capabilities available through the current LENSO process, material deposition rates should be improved, energy requirements for the process should be significantly reduced and powder utilization should be improved.  Three areas of concentration are proposed for this project to provide the necessary improvements required to meet the objective of this project.  These areas include software development, laser technology evaluation and implementation and improved nozzle designs.  Although the preliminary work proposed for each of these areas of concentration will be performed somewhat independent of the others areas, it is important to note that there is a strong linkage between the developments in each of these areas.  As such, the second half of the project will focus on integrating the best solutions from each area of concentration into a single system that will push the LENS\u00e4 process technology forward to meet the needs of TACOM.",

The technical objectives of Phase II are high cooling power, system integration, ease of operation, light weight, ruggedness, safety, and proven operation.

The TERI TM2ID has developed and demonstrated advanced interface technologies that include the combined use of speech, head/eye-tracking, touch, gesture, display and 3-D audio response technologies without adding additional weight or bulky add-ons.  The TM2ID provides a set of interactive sight and sound interfaces for high level commands and communications to conduct training, provide advanced situational awareness and to perform mission planning and rehearsal tasks.  This Phase II research will result in a fully functional prototype of the TM2ID integrated with an OFW similar HW/SW platform.  In order to support a higher level of soldier performance, these technologies will exploit Embedded Training (ET) as a means of soldier enhancement.    The TERI developed Phase II prototype will be architectured to support the design research results from Phase I creating a combined human language and gesture interactive multi-modal interface capability that has proven to far exceed the capabilities of uni-modal interface designs.  Our goal is to design and develop a multi-modal system with synergistic interface technologies that complement one another enabling us to take advantage of their inherent strengths.  A design centered around supporting interface techniques for the core spoken language technology will enable us to demonstrate improvements in error avoidance and resolution which will increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the Warrior.

Implementation of MEMtronics' proximity switch topology into phase shifter designs will substantially mitigate dielectric charging, allowing the demonstration of reliable actuation with \"hot\" switching up the one-watt level.

Application of a novel wafer-level microencapsulation strategy will eliminate die area being taken up by a seal ring and minimize packaging losses.  These innovations will be combined to result in ultra-small phase shifters with excellent loss and power consumption.  This represents a > 20x improvement in the available die per wafer compared to present-day MEMS phase shifter demonstrations.

Our research to date has shown the feasibility of modeling video motion trajectories with spatiotemporal helixes, and using this model as an indexing mechanism for storage and query of events about motion trajectories. Our feasibility demonstration shows great promise in the efficiency afforded by our approach. Our model captures the point-mass motion trajectory with an optimal number of nodes. Similarly, our threshold-based approach captures motion dynamics with an optimal set of prongs. The similarity metrics that we developed will enable us to compare different trajectories - at the coarse level - with mobility state transition metrics, and - at a granular level - with spatiotemporal distance metrics.     In this Phase II effort, we propose to develop the full-scale prototype implementation of a spatiotemporal helix based system for geospatial exploitation of motion imagery based on our Phase I research, evaluate its performance with laboratory and real-world data, refine the fundamental algorithms based on the evaluation, and transition the research to Phase III commercialization.",

(PCI), utilizing coated metallic mesh substrate technology (patented and trademarked by PCI as Microlithr) has demonstrated operation of compact, modular reactors for converting liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon fuels into a mixture of CO and H2 at exceptionally high power densities. During this Phase I, the ATR operating window was mapped out for JP-8 and Diesel fuels. The size of the 5-kWt catalytic ATR reactor was 3in3 (50cc). It demonstrated efficient reforming, lightoff in less than 1 minute in dry mode, and complete fuel conversion in wet mode with moderate steam requirement (S/C = 1 to 2). The reactor was shown to be sulfur tolerant and coke resistant for the duration of operation.  During Phase II, PCI is proposing to develop and demonstrate an integrated standalone prototype micro-reforming system operating on regular JP-8 fuel and producing sulfur free reformate suitable for directly feeding a 0.2 - 2-kWe SOFC stack. Issues associated with the ATR reactor integration with heat exchange, sulfur removal, balance of plant and system control components will be addressed. A prototype micro-reformer will be assembled, tested and delivered to ARL for further testing and integration with a SOFC stack and is expected to meet multi agency needs.",

In Phase I we cultivated relationships with three Washington State emergency management organizations that played key roles in the recent TOPOFF 2 exercise.  Drawing on their collective experience we have developed an approach that will help satisfy their need for context-relevant and timely access to information generated by dozens of cooperating agencies.  Our solution makes feasible the development, alignment, and maintenance of emergency management command and control ontologies that will be necessary to achieve effective system interoperability.  The \"hybrid\" approach we will adopt will allow each involved organization to maintain their existing information management processes and tools, while offering interoperability through a mediating ontology.  Further, the proposed system, Vista, will employ an adaptive machine learning paradigm that will leverage the same parsing/information extraction processes used to enable User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) functionality to support context-sensitive information access and continual ontology refinement.  In this Phase II we will build on the strong foundation established in Phase I to construct and evaluate an operational HLS search and discovery portal and proceed toward successful commercialization.",

Since accurate target range and azimuth location is desired to support precise location, targeting, and tracking of concealed enemy targets, future UHF GMTI systems need innovative ways to improve azimuth estimation accuracy.  The Phase I SBIR, which focused on rotorcraft UAV foliage-penetrating radar, demonstrated favorable performance of monostatic, bistatic and multi-lateration target location techniques.    In Phase II, an optimum set of advanced target location techniques using single and multiple UHF sensor platforms to locate concealed dismounted troops and ground vehicles will be developed.  Techniques to be investigated include super-resolution, STAP, DPCA, stereo and other optimal estimators.  The target angle and CEP performance of these innovative concepts will be quantified using high-fidelity radar data cubes simulated by TSC.

        "abstract": "The proposed Phase II project will develop and fully characterize self-healing composite materials and selected structural components embodying the principles validated in Phase I research, and will establish criteria for selection of self-healing composites in new applications.  Strengthening of damage zones to mitigate catastrophic failure is accomplished in the new composite through dynamic redistribution of structural substance.  This process relies on functional (piezoelectric and solid electrolyte) constituents which are introduced, in the primary system configuration, as a hybrid fiber coating.  The self-healing phenomenon involves electrolytic transport of structural substance within solid electrolyte towards the damage zone where its deposition yields strengthening effects. This process is guided by piezo-induced potential gradient, which reflects on local stress rise in the vicinity of damage zone.  The piezoelectric effect converts the mechanical energy concentrated in damage zone into the electrical energy needed to drive the self-healing process.  In short, the self-healing phenomenon makes constructive use of the otherwise destructive strain energy concentrated in damage zone for mitigation of catastrophic damage growth.  The Phase I research validated: (i) the viability of electrolytic mass transport in solid electrolytes to render strengthening effects; (ii) the ability of piezo-induced potential and charge to guide and drive electrolytic transport of mass in solid electrolytes; and (iii) the potential to integrate the piezoelectric and solid electrolyte constituents rendering self-healing effects in the context of a hybrid coating system.  The following objectives will be accomplished in the proposed Phase II project: (i) development and thorough characterization of nano-structured piezoelectric and solid electrolyte fiber coatings which complement distinctly high functional qualities (greatly benefiting the rate and extent of self-healing) with desirable thermo-mechanical attributes; (ii) development of theoretical models for integrated design of composites for both self-healing and thermo-mechanical performance requirements; (iii) design, processing and thorough characterization of self-healing composite materials; (iv) design, manufacturing and experimental evaluation (of the self-healing attributes and airworthiness) of selected helicopter components (tail cone and elevator); and (v) development of selection criteria for self-healing composites based on application-specific cost/benefit analyses.  A multi-disciplinary team of top industrial and university researchers with specialties in composites, piezoelectricity, solid electrolytes, aerospace structural systems and nano-scale processing has been assembled to conduct the proposed research.",

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses a Phase II program to demonstrate the validity of combining two techniques for solid rocket motor control: a moveable pintle for thrust control and an aerospike plug nozzle for nozzle efficiency over a 15:1 turn-down range. The goal of this program is demonstration of a solid propellant motor which can be throttled multiple times between full boost thrust and near-extinguishment, while maintaining near-optimal nozzle efficiency over this throttling range. The use of moveable pintles to control flow rate and grain burn rate for thrust control, are well developed, but nozzle efficiency suffers at low thrust due to boundary-layer separation in conventional bell or conical nozzles. Plug nozzles have long been recognized for their ability to compensate for a wide variation in altitude, or nozzle pressure ratio, which provides improved nozzle efficiency in a throttled solid motor. Results during GHKN's Phase I program to evaluate the feasibility of this approach indicate that the aeropintle design will meet the oveall program requirement. The nozzle/aeropintle contours will be optimized by CFD analysis and cold flow testing prior to design, fabrication and hot fire testing of a variable thrust solid motor using the aeropintle nozzle configuration.",

We will assess detection performance based on standard processing methods like STAP, and we will address the potential for better performance using alternative algorithms that may incorporate physical models of ocean clutter.

The model extends existing LiftFan clutch loading models to address the transient engagement dynamics, and incorporates several physics-of-failure models to address different types of component failures.  Further, our physical modeling approach addresses the unique features of this clutch, which has extremely high power density and transient loads.

RATTLER uses a variety of optimization techniques to construct missile trajectories that maximize target \"coverage\": the ability of the collective salvo of missiles to be redirected to a new set of aim-points.  A RATTLER-generated strike plan is robust against uncertain retargeting events: once a strike plan is generated and put into execution, the same optimization techniques will be applied to the problem of dynamic retargeting.  When a missile is diverted from its nominal flight path, RATTLER simultaneously perturbs the other flight paths, such that the remaining missiles maintain maximal coverage of the outstanding potential targets.  In Phase I we have demonstrated the feasibility of our algorithmic concepts for tactical Tomahawk loiter and engagement planning.  Our goal in Phase II will be to build upon this success: develop and rigorously evaluate a software tool based on these algorithmic concepts.

In the case of rotorcraft and propellers, assumptions that are made at higher Reynolds numbers, such as being able to idealize the flow over the airfoil as two-dimensional and steady, are invalid.  The project has two main efforts:  a computational effort to develop a model of low-Reynolds-number flow, and an experimental effort to obtain aerodynamic data on 2-D and 3-D wings and a rotor configuration.  The computational effort will focus on the modeling of separation bubbles common to low Reynolds number flight.  This involves modeling laminar separation and turbulent reattachment.

Enabling the system to design novel high affinity ligands, predict target selectivity, and integrate the targets' conformational flexibility into ligand design would complete its development.

Triton's proposed approach is based on in-situ capture of the metal contaminants in the combustor zone of the incinerator using novel nano-scale sorbent particles. Triton will build on their promising Phase I results, where we have shown up to a seven- fold improvement in the capture of heavy metals from the gas stream.

A major Phase I contribution was the development of a technically feasible Solid-State Active Trim Tab that holds several key advantages over hinged tabs studied by other researchers.  The Solid-State tab is significantly lighter in weight and less sensitive to centrifugal loads.  The Solid-State tab will minimize the additional mass behind the helicopter blade's elastic axis and with its smooth shape its aerodynamic performance will be substantially better!

An eight-foot diameter prototype will be designed, fabricated and tested structurally in a windtunnel and on a whirl stand.  The second prototype will be a section of a full-scale blade.

Sikorsky Helicopter, a Phase II sub-contractor, will provide relevant helicopter blade tracking and trimming engineering experience and assist with transitioning the technology.",

        "abstract": "The aggregation of entities can be a practical approach for managing large-scale simulation exercises and improving performance. However, aggregation is not easy to implement and universally apply by the players within a federation. Furthermore, models used to represent entities and interactions are not typically built with aggregation in mind. Aggregation capable models are needed, which would allow model coupling representing differing levels of resolution.     A promising technology that encourages the representation of combined model sets and the application of multi-resolution models are Base Object Models (BOMs). For the Phase I effort, SimVentions researched, designed and prototyped a BOM Aggregation Framework (BAF) to facilitate unit aggregation and de-aggregation.    For Phase II, SimVentions proposes to further develop a BAF specification intended as a web-service in order to provide automation such as dynamic distribution of BOMs dialed to a fidelity need, and the ability to perform pattern and instance aggregation.   Additional capabilities include execution monitoring for providing automatic aggregation and deaggregation triggering, transfer control support of entities extracted from partial deaggregations, and the delivery of model-to-model transformations for supporting adaptability.  In addition, a BOM Aggregate Support Server (BASS) will be developed as a BAF specification implementation to be offered to the community.",

This will permit high fidelity simulations of dynamic, missile exhaust plume flowfields that, under certain conditions, produce a condensation cloud that can obscure the electromagnetic signals utilized for guidance and targeting.  The CRAFT CFDr Navier-Stokes code used already contains much of the requisite physics (finite-rate chemistry, multiphase particulates, condensation/vaporization, etc.) in a dynamic grid framework developed to analyze extended plumes (launch to target) for tactical systems.  We will implement and demonstrate the operation of an advanced secondary smoke model that will analyze condensation of water vapor on heterogeneous nuclei in the presence of HCl.  The resulting droplets will be composed of either water and/or variable water/acid compositions.  The modeling implements both an Eulerian particulate cloud framework as well as a Lagrangian particulate tracking framework.  We will assess the potential of this modeling approach for providing high fidelity predictions that can accurately simulate secondary smoke formation in tactical missile exhaust plumes under a broad range of conditions and will perform studies for representative tactical missile scenarios.",

The Phase I work demonstrated the feasibility of the concept, using a common data format along with predicate and rule formulations that include feature, variable, and spatial representations.  This work resulted in the discovery of spatial association rules, and also identified two critical areas for further research: limiting the rules that are tested and identifying the significant variables in a rule. The Phase II work will develop a classification system for rule formulation, improve the spatial representation, perform sensitivity studies to identify significant variables, extend the data management, develop a user interface, and integrate with a GIS.

The difficulties in developing these antennas are due to the requirements of multi-band/broadband, low profile and conformability suitable for mounting on a military airborne and/or ground platform, as well as low cost. In Phase I Wang Electro-Opto Corporation (WEO) demonstrated the feasibility with a breadboard smart beam-forming traveling-wave array antenna.  In the proposed Phase-II, WEO will design, fabricate, test and deliver two airworthy prototype smart beam-steered array antennas; one with a medium gain (10 dBi) and the other with a low gain (5-6 dBi).  The array antennas, to be mounted on the belly of an airborne vehicle, are low-cost full systems including embedded GPS/INS subsystem that provides antenna heading and location data to the beam steering computer to steer the antenna beam in the WLAN environment.",

Metrology in the semiconductor industry encompasses a wide variety of techniques that perform measurements on defects and dimensions. Scanned-probe (SPM)-based techniques offer a viable approach to CD metrology even in the near-future time frame. At future nodes, at sufficiently small dimensions, current approaches to wafer metrology may simply fail and there may be no solutions other than SPM-based techniques. SPM-style instruments have great capability for very precise metrology measurements, at nanolevel scales.  To use SPM-based tools in metrology, ab-solute measurement and speed are essential, requiring guided motion, very accurate position sensing, high mechanical resonances, and advanced feedback systems.    nPoint proposes the development of multi-axis nanopositioning systems that will enable CD me-trology and lithographic-mask metrology for upcoming technology nodes in the semiconductor device industry.  These tools, based on SPM, will be routinely capable of reliable performance at sub-nanometer resolution and precision and will have increased speeds relative to present tech-nology.  Within two years, nPoint expects to develop a positioning system that is both fast enough and accurate enough to form the essential component of a semiconductor wafer or ad-vanced-lithography mask CD metrology tool, enabling a technology that may ultimately, at a fu-ture node, be the only choice.",

        "abstract": "The U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) has identified the need for a utility that will compress XML data prior to transmission over a network. This utility will address the recent proliferation of XML in military communication systems and the resulting data inflation associated with XML. No current XML compression tools available today are suitable for on-the-fly compression of XML data prior to transmission over networks. The Phase I effort successfully designed and demonstrated new techniques for efficient XML compression that performs optimally in a network environment. Analysis of Phase I efforts show that CompreX is capable of compressing XML data over 90% on average with no knowledge of DTDs or schemas of the XML content being compressed.     Building on the successful Phase I design and implementation of CompreX, Architecture Technology Corporation (ATC) will implement and demonstrate a full-scale prototype of CompreX. CompreX's flexibility allows gives it the ability to integrate seamlessly, and transparently with legacy network applications as well as optimized integration with other network systems.",

The proposed work will leverage GTRI's research in the areas of fragmented aperture antennas and frequency selective backplanes to achieve broad bandwidth high gain antennas in minimum volumetric space. Combining these technologies, the program objective will be to design an RF Tag with an optimal volume meeting pre-specified Tag cross-section, data exfiltration rates, and power efficiency requirements.    Many fielded RF sensors are operational in the X-, Ku-, and Ka-band frequency ranges. An RFCID tag compatible with all three of these commonly used military bands offers tremendous flexibility in maintaining the battlefield awareness of troop and resource location. Consolidating a tri-band tag into a single package conserves size, weight, and power consumption.

        "abstract": "The use of visible and long wave infrared (LWIR) sensors is limited in many covert environments by their unacceptably high reflectivity.  The high reflectivity makes these systems susceptible to detection by search CW laser systems.  There are many traditional methods for reducing optical reflection, but most adversely affect the final system image quality and are not cost effective for large volume applications.  CDM Optics has an innovative method for redistributing the reflected intensity while retaining high image quality.  Reflectivity reductions of 4 orders of magnitude are possible with this method.  The technique called Wavefront Coding has previously been used to realize other system benefits such as a reduction in system complexity, a reduction in system size, cost and weight, passive athermalization with a simple housing and an increase in imaging volume where the user can clearly see targets simultaneously over a large range of object distances.  The Wavefront Coding low-reflectivity concept can be fused with these other benefits to realize a system with superior performance and a favorable benefit to cost ratio.  Additionally, the methodology and the specific optical design can be applied across any platforms that use a sensor with the same geometry and can be cost effective through the utilization of moldable visible and IR materials.",

To achieve its goal, ThermoAnalytics will investigate innovative techniques to accelerate the thermal modeling process, and build a suite of tools to automate the most time-consuming modeling tasks. These tools address specific needs of designers and analysts: automated construction of meshes given CAD geometry, innovative \"meshless\" thermal solutions, and diagnostic and quick fix tools to repair meshes and models. ThermoAnalytics will also upgrade MuSES so that it is more tolerant of modeling defects, and to reduce model pre-processing time - specifically - the computation of radiation view factors. These improvements will alleviate user burden and reduce computational time. The resulting acceleration of the thermal modeling process will increase the size of the design space that can be explored during rapid design processes as well as permitting the introduction of new designs rapidly into real-time scene simulations.",

Effective  social skill assessment and training procedures largely do not exist in the Army.

All current methods are based on manual collection of cone penetrometer data, which is neither automatic nor rapid and does not provide integrated terrain trafficability data.

Accordingly, the objective of this Phase II research is to demonstrate the performance of composite pressure vessels manufactured using the high temperature filament winding resins developed in Phase I.  Specifically, the goals of this Phase II are to design and fabricate a representative pressure vessel to demonstrate its compatibility for current processing and performance.

        "abstract": "The objective of this Phase II SBIR is to develop a reference implementation and specification of the Phase 1 cross-layer wireless protocol that spans OSI layers 1 (physical) through 4 (transport) and reduces energy consumption in sensor networks; and validate its operation on a moderate-size sensor network. Phase I analysis suggests that an order of magnitude reduction in energy consumption over traditional approaches is achievable for typical UGS scenarios by optimizing services across layers. Our innovation combines novel extensions in link-layer MAC scheduling with recent network layer research in minimum energy diversity routing. The link-layer services also control power state of the radio to reduce errant listening. In all, the combination has been shown to eliminate major sources of energy consumption including idle listening, control signaling, and congestion hot-spots. The approach leverages our preliminary mock-up developed as part of the Phase I simulation testbed and related sensor network research to develop an implementation that addresses pragmatic concerns such as clock-error and computational complexity. The technology developed under this SBIR is anticipated to have broad application to DoD sensor networks as well as public commercial wireless systems and plant automation.",

In Phase II, ThermoAnalytics proposes to model viscous effects in gravity waves, empirically model sea surface temperature variations caused by mixing from propellers and hull turbulence, use adaptive scaling to efficiently render seaway radiance in the near and far fields, and integrate the thermal solver with CFD, exhaust plume models, and streamlined CAD interfaces. The tool will include options to incorporate CFD results for accurate modeling of convection off exterior ship surfaces as well as verified convection correlations tailored for ship modeling.

Many groups, including ours, have found that biological warfare agents can  stimulate inflammatory systems; the same systems found stimulated in common  inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease or  ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Development of an accurate diagnostic tool therefore requires  defining the changes in gene expression that are characteristic of these common  inflammatory diseases in clinically accessible tissue and comparing them with the  expression changes characteristic of exposure to biological warfare agents. Phase I of this  project has been completed. Expression databases for rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory  bowel disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and hepatitis were compiled and will be provided to  the Department of the Army for assessment of the disease-specific nature of the infectious  disease data sets they have compiled. Moreover, we have employed a multivariate analysis  method in preliminary studies to assess the feasibility of the approach and determined that  the diagnostic signature of a given disorder can be defined using only 36 genes in total. In Phase 2 we will continue our ongoing integrated development efforts to create a practical high throughput assay. This works includes continued development and optimization of class selection algorithms, normalization strategies, and high throughput HTPscreening methods. In preliminary investigations we have created novel class prediction methods, a sound theoretical foundation for data normalization suitable for assay development, and a HTP method for gene expression analysis. These essential components will be optimized, integrated, and a fully tested prototype assay developed at the end of this phase of the project.",

Nanocomposites prepared during Phase I with NanoSonic's advanced metal complexing polymers exhibited thermal conductivity values five times greater than nanocomposites prepared with commercially available resins.  These high performance nanocomposites offer a wide service temperature range from ~ -120 \u00b0 to greater than 300 \u00b0C and are expected to improve the reliability of systems that perform in both endo- and exoatmosphere, such as THAAD.  The nanocomposites effectively bond materials with highly mismatched CTEs, offer superior chemical resistance, and ultra-lightweight.

A novel electrochemical couple will be used for the development of a safe high specific energy lithium-ion battery system, which provides enhanced safety and can function as a charger. The proposed anode material, which delivers 50% higher practical capacity than the state-of-the-art carbon anode materials, will be used to address the safety issues. Several prototypes 16 Ah lithium-ion cells will be developed and tested for their use as charger. Five of these cells will be connected in series to build a 16 Ah, 21 V battery with control circuitry. The developed battery will then be converted to a charger with a DC/DC converter having an output of 16 A at 16.8 V.",

        "abstract": "We propose the prototype development of an efficient V-band dielectric traveling-wave tube (DTWT) that will provide high frequency radiation for rf communications applications in future military satellites.  The DTWT is based on an efficient interaction between a small-diameter electron beam and the electromagnetic fields of a traveling wave inside a very compact and novel dielectric waveguide.  During Phase I we conducted thorough analytical, numerical and computer simulation studies of the proposed amplifier which showed that the DTWT can deliver tens of watts of high-frequency radiation with high efficiency and an amazingly broad bandwidth.  Our studies also show the DTWT to be twice as efficient as conventional helix traveling-wave tubes and less sensitive to shock and vibration, making the DTWT ideal for space applications.  The DTWT can replace the current less-efficient helix TWT and will consume half of the power while offering backward compatibility with existing systems (plug-and-play).  Based on the promising Phase I results obtained, we are now ready to move towards prototype development of the DTWT.  We propose the development of an 85-watt, 50%-efficient V-band DTWT during Phase II.  Once fully developed, the DTWT should be capable of replacing conventional traveling-wave tubes in telecommunication systems for future space applications by offering substantial improvements in size, weight, and especially efficiency over its counterparts.",

We ran an exhaustive set of simulations in OPNET that demonstrate the GASR solution's superiority to conventional ad-hoc approaches.    For Phase II, we turn our focus toward implementation and deployment of the GASR networking protocol.  Recognizing the considerable momentum that the Software Communications Architecture (SCA) has acquired, we are proposing the implementation of the GASR protocols aboard an SCA-compliant software defined radio platform.    Phase II will conclude with a demonstration in a dynamic environment that will verify the results of our Phase I research.  Specific corner cases will be investigated to prove that GASR provides improved utilization of terrestrial based routes as opposed to high cost satellite channels, while still maintaining the satellite route in reserve as a viable communications route.  The GASR protocol will also be demonstrated to provide intelligent routing around jamming threats, improved load balancing to avoid network congestion, and fast hand-off times.    At the end of Phase II, the GASR protocols will be proven in the field on an SCA compliant platform, poised for technology insertion in the industry.",

After analysis of latency, compatibility with existing systems, power delivery potential, cable length constraints and bandwidth issues, Pinnacle/AST chose a UDP/IP based Ethernet network.   For most simulator components, the IEEE 802.3af specification or Power Over Ethernet (POE) can be used to deliver power over the Ethernet cable.  This will eliminate the unwieldy wire bundle and associated complicated interconnect wiring, replacing it with a tiered-star topology of Ethernet switches and high-speed digital cables.  All Phase I tasks were successfully completed, and the system was shown to operate with a deterministic latency of less than 20 mS.  The overall goal of this Phase II SBIR is to finalize the hardware and software subsystems developed during Phase I, improve modularity to allow the widest range of uses, address security issues, and to build and test a simulator that is designed entirely using the new bus architecture.

From the perspective of Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), it provides a novel opportunity for Early Launch Detection & Tracking (ELDT) of threat targets. For BMD-related development of guidance sensors for interceptors, the modulation character in a spatially resolved plume acquires increased significance. Absence of an engineering-oriented, plume signature modulation phenomenology model has hindered exploitation of this distinctive phenomenon for ELDT & Boost Phase Intercept (BPI). CRAFT Tech proposes development of a rapid turnaround hypertemporal intensity (HTI) model, calibrated by flight measurements, and demonstrated via application to liquid and solid propellant fueled threat systems of interest to MDA. The novel modeling utilizes stochastic turbulence estimation techniques for extending conventional plume signature methodology into the hypertemporal regime. The model is supported by a comprehensive HTI database of spectral characteristics derived from past/upcoming flight measurements, launch observations and restrained firings, representing liquid and solid propellant-fueled threat and surrogate systems. A seamless architecture for combined hypertemporal flowfield & IR modeling, with a GUI-driven Expert Interface, has been envisioned leading to the development of the RPFM-HTI code.",

        "abstract": "Current helicopter sonobuoy launchers are complex, heavy and will not meet future requirements for mission versatility. Because of the complexity of the launcher and its pneumatic subsystem, the launcher has many points of potential failure; its reliability is poor. Further, as in other pneumatic systems involving stored compressed air, the system is subject to vagaries of pressure which can result in uneven or incomplete expulsion of stores. Phase I proved the feasibility of an \"AGILE\" (Airborne Gas Inflator Lightweight Ejector) launcher using COTS automotive airbag inflators as a source of sonobuoy ejection energy, a lightweight, modular structure and intelligent controls. The Phase II project will validate the concept by building and testing a full-scale prototype.  The individual AGILE launcher cells are independent of external energy sources. This permits the consideration of innovative concepts for launcher design and operation. The use of inflators also imparts many other advantages.  The AGILE Launcher eliminates virtually all moving parts, thus reducing failures and simplifying logistics and maintenance. The proposed launcher will be extremely reliable, lightweight, versatile and safe, with a lower total ownership cost achieved through reduced maintenance, repair and logistics support requirements.",

        "abstract": "Rotary-wing aircraft use transmission systems to transfer power from the engines to the rotor system.  These transmissions employ lightweight high strength metals to reduce overall aircraft weight.  The Navy and the helicopter industry would like to further decrease aircraft weight, as an increase in performance can be achieved for every pound of weight reduction.  Composites offer advantages over metals in that they can achieve equal or higher strengths with less weight.    The Bell V-22 tiltrotor uses higher power, lower volume transmissions than those used in conventional helicopters.  These transmissions produce more heat and depend on the metallic transmission housing to dissipate this energy.  Typically, commercially available composites systems have low thermal conductivity properties.  While composite transmission components may be able to withstand the dynamic and thermal stresses produced by the V-22 transmission, transmission failure or premature wear could result due to the inability of the composite material system to dissipate heat adequately.    In this Phase II effort, Texas Research Institute Austin, Inc., with teaming partner Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., proposes to develop cost effective, lightweight, thermally conductive composite material systems that will meet design requirements and dissipate heat sufficiently to be used in a military helicopter transmission environment.",

Additionally, AHA has demonstrated this performance with operationally relevant passive broadband and narrowband processing and prototype displays. Acoustic performance results show that Robust Beamforming Algorithms support continued field-operations, with excellent performance, for arrays that may otherwise be deemed operationally unavailable. In addition, AHA performed a preliminary sizing and timing study to show that this technology will fit in an inexpensive hardware footprint. A Phase II follow-on contract is recommended. In Phase II, AHA will continue to design and develop RTAB algorithms, and then develop, integrate, and test real-time RTAB software and transition it to a Common Processor environment.

Currently MACs are estimated from measurements of the velocity distribution of the incident and reflected molecules in a molecular beam facility. The reflected molecules velocity and flux must be measured in all directions; hence the measurement is difficult and inaccurate.  Busek proposes a new technique that reduces or eliminates the present difficulties.  A new atomic source invented at Busek is used to produce a stream or a beam of atomic oxygen that impinges upon the test article (satellite surface sample) whose drag is measured by a unique thrust stand that resolves micro Newton forces.  The MACs are then calculated from the measured drag.  The new source of atomic oxygen with adjustable energy appropriate for orbital conditions was successfully demonstrated during Phase 1 of the program.    A complete, efficient, and widely manipulated direct force momentum accommodation coefficient measurement facility will be constructed and characterized in Phase II. Accurate drag measurements and concomitant accurate MAC predictions will lead to optimization of satellite design, including one or all of the following: increased orbital life, reduced propulsion requirements and/or increased payload.",

        "abstract": "Ship defense requires 100 kW-1MW near diffraction-limited lasers with optimal wavelength and temporal format.  Laser efficiency, beam quality, atmospheric transmission, thermal-blooming, and target interactions must be taken into account.  Navy efforts to date have focused principally on the free electron laser (FEL) to fulfill this need due to the wide wavelength tuning range and projected high electrical-to-optical efficiency.  FEL's will likely be implemented on next-generation electric ships, but for existing ships and for UAV's, the compact size of a solid-state laser makes it a very attractive option.  1 micron wavelength solid-state lasers are currently being pursued in many directed energy applications due to the maturity of this technology at high power.  CW and high peak power solid-state lasers are each likely to be optimal for different targets and different thermomechanical interactions.  With current solid-state laser technology, 1-5 kW average output power can be achieved in pulsed or CW mode at 1 micron, but typically with modest efficiency and >2x diffraction limited beam quality from a bulky system.  CTI proposes a breakthrough laser architecture (validated in proof-of-concept demonstrations) to enable development of compact, power-scalable MOPA systems.  The architecture implements a proprietary technology for achieving higher efficiencies than rod or slab architectures, with near diffraction-limited beam quality and minimal thermo-optic aberrations.  Phase I conducted laser modeling and developed an engineering design for a kW-class MOPA based on this technology.  Designs for > 100 kW power-scaled systems based on phased array of these MOPAs have been developed.",

The hardware will be used to accelerate searches and to perform HWIL parametric studies of target discrimination problems.  During Phase I, CSC demonstrated successful discrimination using a wavelet best basis search algorithm where wavelet features were calculated via simulation and objects grouped by features using linear discrimination theory.    Discrimination relies on computing multiple useful target features based upon known target characteristics.  Discrimination improvements gained by calculating ever more specific features that rely heavily on a priori knowledge leads to over-training and an over- reliance on intelligence. Under a Phase II effort, CSC will evaluate a more general, complete set of features derived directly from a large wavelet filter bank using best basis search methods to reduce the reliance on a priori information to effect target discrimination.  At the conclusion of Phase II, a method for designing optimal wavelet filter banks for target discrimination will have been developed, tested, and implemented in real-time hardware.  System development suitable for interceptor integration is planned in Phase III.",

Such control problems are too complicated for a direct solution. In this proposal, Intelligent Automation, Inc.

From the heavy traffic analysis, one can arrive at a limit system which can be used to obtain the optimal control policy. Additional advantages of the proposed approach include: First, the controls obtained from the heavy traffic analysis are effective in the practical system. Second, the heavy traffic modeling is general enough to handle a variety of configurations including TDMA, channel estimation, etc. Third, the proposed admission control design is independent of power control. Fourth, the proposed numerical methods are sound and have been theoretically justified by the convergence proofs. Phase I results have shown the feasibility and optimality of the proposed control policies for systems of reduced dimensions. Our Primary Phase II objective is to extend the proposed optimal control policy to system of practical dimensions and to carry out practical demonstrations and hardware prototype development.",

        "abstract": "High power eyesafe lasers are crucial for many military and industrial applications.  Erbium doped lasers offer the potential for direct laser operation at 1.5 microns thereby reducing the size and cost and improving the efficiency of today' frequency converted one-micron lasers.  Diode pumped Erbium lasers are typically pumped at 980-nm.  The large quantum defect between the lasing wavelength and the pump wavelength leaves roughly 30% of the deposited energy as heat.  For example, a 1-kW Erbium laser would require at least 500 Watts of heat to be removed.  This amount of heat not only effects laser performance, it also requires a large thermal management system that adds size, weight, and cost to the system.  A similar laser that was pumped at 1470-nm would require a factor of ten less heat to be removed.  Unfortunately, today's high power InP diode lasers operating at 1470-nm produce less power and are less efficient 980-nm laser diodes.  This is primarily a result of a dramatically lower differential quantum efficiency that results from both lower injection efficiency and higher optical losses.  By improving the injection efficiency we propose to improve the efficiency of high power 1470-nm InP based laser diodes to over 40%.",

The first methodology, A-SCOPE (Automatic Simultaneous Constraint Optimization for Parameter Extraction) automatically extracts optimal inputs to the government standard plume signature prediction codes that: (1) are physically realistic within their known covariance, and (2) produce signatures that are the most consistent with sensor measurements.   Enhancements to the suite of codes that compute nozzle and plume flowfields, and plume radiation are made via the use of Automatic Differentiation (AD), such that parameter sensitivities are output in addition to the standard outputs. The technique has already been successfully demonstrated for passive ranging of rocket plumes at long ranges.  The second methodology, MODEX compares plume signature predictions and sensor measurements to derive extrapolation factors, which anchor the predictions to the data.  These factors are then used at off-measurement conditions to create a database of signatures at all possible viewing conditions, flight parameters and spectral regions.  MODEX has been validated for in-band radiometric measurements and will be extended to account for spectral, spatial and temporal signature parameters. Both methodologies will be structured for use within user friendly, tested toolkits, providing optimal utility.

The use of a substrate-removed InGaAs photodiode array will exhibit high quantum efficiency from 0.4 \u00b5m through 1.7 mm.  The camera will thus be usable both for visible imaging and for the imaging of the eye-safe lasers (wavelengths longer than 1.4 mm) mandated in many ballistic missile defense (BMD) applications.  In addition, the use of the InP/InGaAs material system provides inherent radiation hardness.  Neither of these is possible with silicon-based CMOS or CCD imagers.  The FPA will feature a pixel pitch down to 10 mm, inter-pixel cross talk less than 1%, a dynamic range greater than 1000:1, and staring-mode readout as well as the ability to address individual pixels.  The bandwidth when reading out individual pixels will exceed 1 GHz.  During Phase II, we will focus on improving the quantum efficiency of the photodiode array in the visible wavelength band, expanding the array to 128x128 pixels, designing a Silicon CMOS readout integrated circuit (ROIC), and integrating the FPA into a camera.",

An experimental rocket combustor will be designed and tested, one capable of creating both pre-mixed and intentionally unmixed combustion zones.  The intentional unmixed zones used to cool combustor walls in many liquid rocket engines are responsible for the majority of the soot produced in these devices.

Key components of MCScene-Plus were successfully demonstrated in Phase I including: upgrade of the core calculation engine in MCScene to a fully three-dimensional geometry, addition of a plume definition module, full treatment of multiple scattering, refraction, and Doppler effects.  In Phase II, a new object oriented version of MCScene-PluS will be developed that incorporates the flexibility and phenomenology introduced in Phase I and additional phenomenology needed to satisfy the requirements defined by DoD's Plume Lidar Working Group, for ongoing, fielded, DoD laser/missile/plume programs, such as extension to a variety of laser system types, calculation of polarization effects and a generalized plume.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in semiconductor technology have brought the performance of materials such as Silicon, Gallium Arsenide and Indium Phosphide close to their theoretical limits; however, device requirements for many applications of power electronics are at a point that present power devices cannot meet. The requirements include higher operating voltages, cut-off frequencies, efficiency and reliability. To overcome this limitation, new semiconductor materials for power device applications are needed.     Wide bandgap semiconductors are currently being investigated by many groups. In many cases the main emphasis of these efforts is to produce devices such as diodes, transistors and thyristors with very high (several KV) breakdown voltages for power applications. The realization of microwave devices has concentrated largely on GaN/AlGaN HEMTs. We propose to use the properties of wide bandgaps to create a medium voltage (20-60 V) heterojunction bipolar transistor that will have very high-efficiency, high-frequency gain and high power performance enabled by a combination of high breakdown strength, high saturated drift velocity and just as importantly, high thermal conductivity.    Material growth, device performance and improved simulations during the Phase I period predict excellent high frequency gain, power output and efficiency. Our unique patent-pending technology will deliver X-band radar amplifiers of superior performance.",

We have applied it to develop a prototype for the early detection of bioterrorism. We demonstrated overall feasibility using a high-fidelity simulation (CMU's BioWar facility), successfully detecting simulated Anthrax attack events in an urban setting.   ATAP is composed of four components: 1) mobile agents to retrieve data distributed across various services; 2) ontology-based data modeling for integrating heterogeneous, distributed data sources; 3) Bayesian belief network (BN) technology for generating alerts based on models representing spatio-temporal interrelationships among domain concepts; and, 4) scenario-based simulation to validate the model in the absence of real data.    For Phase II, we propose full-scope development of ATAP. In the bioterrorism domain, we will enhance ATAP's data retrieval capability to include more data sources, and extend our ontology to include additional bio-agents. We will also widen the application scope to include aviation terrorism. In this respect, we have established a collaborative partnership with the Transport Security Administration (TSA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The enhanced GenSEB tool will extend the capability by allowing the users to design FIPA standard motivated Agent Interaction Protocols (AIPs). By using GenSEB, an end user can graphically associate AIPs with the scheduling algorithms to design the core of the schedule engine.

GenSEB generated elements are the essential building blocks, which can be plugged into a Generic Scheduling Engine (GSE) framework to rapidly develop flexible scheduling engines with extended life cycle.

        "abstract": "There is no technology currently available for sorting nanoparticles by particle size. Furthermore, there is no commercially viable process for removing relatively large primary particles and aggregates from a nanopowder mass. High rate nanoparticle production processes invariably produce powders that have either a wide particle size distribution, or are aggregated. This is evidenced in the characteristics of commercially available nanopowders. In either case, a nanoparticle separation tool, which removes large primary particles and aggregates from a powder mass leading to a narrow size distribution, will be highly beneficial to drastically improve the nanopowder properties. Our proposed nanoparticle separation equipment can be used either in-line with production systems, or used off-line, i.e. independent of the nanopowder synthesis reactor.     The basis for nanoparticle separation was demonstrated in Phase I by using a combination of aerodynamic focusing, external electrical field application and thermophoretic effects. The larger primary particles and larger aggregates were removed from a gas phase stream of nanoparticles by driving larger particles in one direction and the smaller particles in the other.     The primary objectives of the Phase II program are to develop and optimize a prototype nanoparticle separation system and develop scaling factors for a pilot scale unit. Kilogram quantities of samples will be processed during the course of the Phase II program and provided to the Army and our commercialization partners for testing. In addition, the design of a pilot scale unit that can be operated either in-line with a nanopowder production system, or off-line, will be delivered to the Army. Several large corporations have agreed to work with us during the Phase II program and beyond to evaluate, develop, and market the proposed nanoparticle separation equipment.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time ever that an average grain size of a few hundred nanometers has been obtained in high density tungsten samples through a powder consolidation approach. Such ultrafine grained tungsten-based materials have the potential to display exceptional dynamic mechanical behavior that is most ideal for armor piercing penetrators.

High deceleration impact during delivery places severe demands on the mechanical strength, while long term continuous operation in a wide variety of environments requires rugged components and a renewable energy source. Additionally, the unit must remain covert requiring low profile and low reflective surfaces. SensorMetrix will design and build an impact hardened, environmentally rugged solar power unit for charging onboard secondary batteries. An innovative approach to handling unpredictable lighting situations, such as local solar obstructions, oblique solar incidence and indirect lighting, has been developed to optimize solar power collection. The unit is designed to be operational in a full range of environmental conditions. A focused impact testing program using a large state-of-the-art gas gun will be conducted to test the survivability of the unit.",

        "abstract": "The use of staring infrared imaging systems provides significant advantages for military missions such as aircraft self-protection.  Monitoring of wide areas at low resolution and switching to a narrow field of view to identify and track targets are of interest.  Current systems use electromechanical zoom mechanisms that are slow, have limited zoom capability, and suffer from insufficient resolution.  Because of critical importance of these systems to aircraft safety, this problem demands a solution.  Applied Science Innovations proposes advanced development of the new Agile, Detecting and Discriminating, Infrared Electro-Optical System (ADDIOS).  The first-generation prototype system will provide for virtually instantaneous switching between wide-area, low-resolution surveillance mode to a narrow-field, high-resolution discriminating mode, mimicking foveal vision characteristics of the eye.  The high resolution area can be located anywhere in the wide field of regard.  In addition, multiple high resolution areas and simultaneous low-resolution wide-area monitoring will be possible with the proposed prototype system.  The Phase II project will produce a viable, functional first generation system.  In Phase III, commercial applications of ADDIOS will serve the needs of the Air Force and other branches of the Armed Services, as well as civilian applications such as security and law enforcement.",

With air speeds of greater than mach 4 and as high as mach 10 the environment can often be very hostile.

It should be easy to install and remove, should not require re-calibration, should not require extensive pneumatic inter connects or long electrical wiring, and should, ideally, be low cost.  Based on the results of the successful Phase I effort, Kulite is proposing to develop a miniature piezoresistive transducer of approximately .1 cubic inches in volume.  The full-scale pressure of the proposed transducer will be 5 psia and suitable methods will be established to obtain accuracies of .0025 psia.

The AIRTAP is a miniature electronics package with an innovative architecture based on unique integration of commercial off-the-shelf hardware, including generic miniature digital signal processing, SRAM, and an FPGA controller, performing two-step compression:  acoustic wavelet maxima analysis, reducing data by 25:1, and compression optimal vector entropy processing for an additional 4:1.  Therefore, AIRTAP can achieve the 100:1 compression the Army is seeking without any loss of essential acoustic signatures.  In Phase I, a demonstration prototype AIRTAP system was developed, including microphone/GPS sensor, acoustic signal processing and compression, and wireless communication.

        "abstract": "Luminescent Technologies is developing a disruptive innovation to improve sub-wavelength lithography for semiconductor manufacturing.  The company has developed a new approach for optimizing photomasks as an inverse problem.  It is a radical departure from existing resolution enhancement technologies that merely perturb the original design.  Unlike existing techniques, this technology will consider the full realm of possible mask patterns which can diffract light in such a way as to print the desired circuit. In general, the optimal mask pattern will not resemble the original design; to the eye, it will appear more like a hologram. By using an inverse problem methodology to find the optimal mask, we can create masks which provide far better resolution and higher yields than any other competing technology.  For phase II, we intend to develop our technology to the point that it can be used to print wafers with leading edge semiconductor manufacturers.",

Lighter loads will reduce SOF operator fatigue, and increase his ability to move greater distances in a shorter time than is possible today.  As a solution to this problem, we propose to manufacture a self-mobile trailer, a robotic \"mule\" capable of carrying loads up to 1000 pounds - cargo and seated or litter-borne personnel - and autonomously trailing a foot patrol over rough terrain.  The team we have assembled for this work has unparalleled experience designing robotic vehicles, and we expect to leverage work on similar vehicles to rapidly assemble and evaluate design concepts.  The Phase II work will result in a prototype system suitable for field demonstration and experimentation.  For commercialization, this is the only 1000 pound class vehicle currently under construction and we see opportunity for marketing to the Army and Marine Corp for deep reconnaissance missions that would be similar to SOCOM mission demands, as well as potential commercial applications in security and warehousing, and as a supply carrier for smoke jumpers fighting fires in rough terrain.",

        "abstract": "The DoD ranges have invested significant financial resources in optics, mainly long focal length telescopes for use in high speed cinematography with 35 mm and 70 mm film transport cameras.  With the increased demand for long-range infrared imaging, the ranges are now beginning to in-vest in IR cameras.  However, there exists a fundamental incompatibility between IR imaging and telescope optics.  OKSI has demonstrated a patent-pending solution whereby a variable cold stop is introduced into the camera to match its aperture to that of the telescope.  An additional re-lay optical assembly is used to project the telescope aperture-stop onto this camera's cold stop, thus eliminating the problems associated with parasitic radiation that degrade the imagery.    The technology will allow using an IR camera prices in the range of $50K to $100K with any telescope using a $10K optical relay, instead of investing in multiple cameras, one for each tele-scope.  Under the proposed Phase-II, WSMR will receive a high-speed, large format MWIR camera sys-tem configured with OKSI's variable cold stop and the associated optics for (i) wide field of view operations using refractive optics, and for (ii) narrow field of view operations using range telescopes.  This system will be tested and demonstrated to work with a large aperture, long focal length telescope at WSMR.  Further development will explore the adaptation of the camera to various types of telescopes.",

In the proposed Phase II program an engineering system will be built and tested.  In the proposed system solar radiation is collected by the concentrator which transfers the concentrated solar radiation to the optical waveguide transmission line consisting of low-loss optical fibers.  The optical waveguide cable transmits the high intensity solar radiation to the thermal receiver for efficient, high performance thrust generation.  The features of the proposed system are: 1) highly concentrated solar radiation can be transmitted via flexible optical waveguide transmission line to the thruster's absorber cavity; 2) the flexible optical waveguide linkage de-couples the thruster from the concentrator to provide freedom from the constraints of previous solar propulsion system designs; 3) the configuration of the solar receiver can be optimized for efficient heat transfer with minimal re-radiation loss; 4) aiming and tracking for the concentrator become significantly easier by moving the termination of the optical fiber cable to follow the focal point of the concentrator; and  5) high intensity solar radiation can be switched to different receivers to deploy several thermal thrusters as necessary.",

Reasons for this include the difficulty of simulating tactile information, limitations in hardware and software supporting haptic, and the lack of research on how best to utilize haptics. The proposed work is intended to advance the utilization of haptic technologies in virtual training environments.  During Phase I, CHI Systems, Inc. teamed with the University of Central Florida's Institute for Simulation and Training (IST) to (a) provide recommendations for haptic technologies that can be used to support training in virtual environment (VE) training systems, and (b) provide a haptics system design.  In Phase II we propose to implement and evaluate the haptic system, integrate the haptics system into a specific VE training environment, and develop a haptics system product-termed TouchDimensions.

By supplementing the chamber pressure of a solid motor with combustion gases from our smaller controlled motor, in a controlled fashion we cause the chamber pressure of the tactical motor to vary.

The use of this propellant in a dual stage chamber will provide total thrust control with no moving parts, no dependence on changing the nozzle throat area, allow controlled thrust during the ignition transient phase and the potential for multiple extinguishments and restarts of the propellant.  The propellant technology is completely compatible with the use of aerospike nozzles, which will also be tested.  These improvements will provide for total thrust management control of the solid rocket motor thereby enhancing its range and targeting accuracy.  The propellant also extremely safe in practical use, including: no spark or flame hazard, does not self sustain combustion, no toxic outgasing, insensitive to impact or ignition by blasting cap, and an environmentally \"green\" system.

In Phase I of this effort, which was called Gaze-Based Point-and-Click (GPAC), CHI Systems developed prototype hands-free interface components which interfaced to the ARDEC Combat Decision Aiding System (CDAS) to allow hands-free manipulation of the interface.  The Phase I prototype consisted of an HMD, head tracker, eye tracker, and voice interaction software.  In Phase II, using the same Phase I computational software architecture, we will fully develop the prototype interface components.  The completed prototype will abandon eye- and head- tracking used in Phase I, in favor of multi-modal interaction with an HMD-based interface using voice commands, haptic cueing, and weapon-based pointing devices.  The completed prototype will control the current CDAS FFW software application in use at ARDEC and the FFW Battle Lab, and will be capable of transition into the FFW Lead Technical Integrator Software Integration Laboratory for fielding in the FFW program.",

        "abstract": "The intelligence community suffers from information overload due to a glut of information and a dearth of analysis. With restructuring of the intelligence community, and redirection of information flow to widen dissemination, the amount of information that must be analyzed is increasing rapidly. Analysts supporting Homeland Security must mine not just the usual information sources such as the FBI and NSA, but increasing numbers of important new sources like the INS, all levels of law enforcement, and transportation and communications sources. Even with better training in detecting patterns and indicators across the universe of information, and greater depth of information management experience, analysts still require new and innovative, user friendly, data mining and pattern recognition analytic tools to effectively sort through and analyze this enormous volume of data. In Phase I, CHI Systems developed a prototype Threat Assessment and Prediction System (TAPS) that uses intelligent agents to assist in processing intelligence data and predicting threats for Homeland Defense. This prototype will serve as the basis of the Phase II TAPS effort, which will also include a fully functional mobile command post for demonstration of TAPS in an HLS context, and which can be rapidly transitioned to use by HLS agencies.",

Having advanced MATE to the stage of an in-house prototype during Phase I, ICI now proposes in Phase II to convert the prototype to a finished product for the Department of Defense (DoD) and then market it commercially.  MATE is useful to people and machines with expertise in a task and domain because it gives them a way to reuse hard experience gained in the past. It is equally  useful, however, to those who know little about a task or domain. Consider, for example, a technician  who has never done any aircraft repairs yet has been given an assignment to repair an engine. His own  maintenance experience won't help him. But if he remembered previous repairs he'd seen by others under  circumstances similar to those he has to deal with, he could use an appropriate example to get started.

DSM proposes the development of a high specific power (HSP) piezoelectric motorized actuator to command the valves for this system.  The proposed actuator makes use of novel gripping concepts and high speed power electronics to enable a 600 Watt PZT-motor actuator.  DSM uses the high power capabilities of a PZT stack vibrating at over 10 kHz to produce a macro-continuous motion at lower frequency, yet much greater stroke than possible with direct drive PZTs.  The proposed PZT-motor actuator is being designed to produce a 500 lbf stallforce, over 12 in/s speed, no power hold, low EMI interference, increased reliability, and potentially lower cost than current electromagnetic actuators.  DSM will develop the motorized actuator and efficient driving electronics for the SDACS and related applications in the Phase II effort.  The actuator system will be targeted at driving the valves for a modified 600 lbf sea level divert system, with scheduled cold gas testing on ATK's testbed.",

Building on this success, we have three goals for Phase II.  First, we will refine and extend the algorithms we have developed in Phase I.  This will be achieved through mathematical research that will lead to more efficient, precise and well-tuned algorithms.  Second, we will integrate these algorithms in an Application Programming Interface (API).  Third, we will build a development framework and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to allow a user to intuitively develop SOU models.  Our API will provide full support to Courses of Action generation with Probabilistic Relational Models, which allow the encoding of complex models that are impossible to handle with standard BNs.  The GUI will feature novel techniques for eliciting the probabilistic parameters of a model, thus increasing the users' effectiveness and efficiency in encoding the knowledge.  Finally, we propose to validate our development system and SOU algorithms with an MDA problem of interest selected from on-going Ballistic Missile Defense System programs.  In this regard, we will specifically collaborate with the prime contractors of MDA's Project Hercules and Battlespace Environment and Signatures Toolkit (BEST) project.",

Early detection of CD/PD will enable better coordination and planning of resources such as maintenance personnel, ordering of parts, etc. Most importantly, one can prevent catastrophic failures during normal operations.    In this proposal, Intelligent Automation, Incorporated (IAI) and its subcontractor, Prof. W. Lee at University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) propose an integrated and low approach to detect PC/CD. It consists of several major steps: preprocessing to remove background and sensor noise, feature extraction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Power Spectral Density (PSD), and efficient fault classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron Neural Net (MLNN) for fault detection and isolation. In addition, anomaly detection, trending, and time-to-failure prediction algorithms will be developed and incorporated into this Phase 2 proposal. The approach uses low frequency signals and hence is much cheaper (less than ten thousand dollars per unit) than existing methods in the markets.    In Phase 2 we will develop motor/switchgear test beds, develop and implement various algorithms, and perform extensive tests in both the test beds and the actual motor/switchgears at Arnold Air Force Base.",

Most recently, we invented and demonstrated an antireflection (AR) -coated tungsten IR emitters which when integrated with the other key components should make TPV systems with efficiencies over 10% practical.  However, the use of the AR tungsten emitter requires an oxygen-free hermetic seal enclosure.  During the present OSD SBIR Phase I contract, we integrated a tungsten emitter foil and a commercial SiC radiant tube burner within an emitter thermos and successfully demonstrated its operation at high temperature.  We also designed a complete stand-alone 500 W portable quiet TPV generator.  Since TPV generators operate with a continuous burn rather than the periodic explosions in an internal combustion engine, this unit promises to be one hundred times quieter than the \"Tactical Quiet Generator\" presently used by the Army.  During this Phase II contract, we plan to implement this design combining all of the key TPV components together for the first time thereby producing a functional 500 W TPV prototype for delivery.",

As the applications requiring cryogenically-cooled sensors continue to increase there is a strong interest in addressing the producibility of cryocooler designs without compromising lifetime or reliability. Space cryocoolers typically have a recurring manufacturing cost of over $1M; many significant cost drivers are included in the expander design. Manufacturing tolerances within 100 millionths of an inch are commonplace for non-contacting piston operation; the construction of the hybrid Stirling / pulse tube cold head presents manufacturing challenges that have not yet been met by industry.

Phase I focused on proof-of-concept implementation of sub-models and algorithms, creating software modules that will be incorporated into engine-plume flow simulations during Phase II.   In Phase II, we will take these concepts and prototypes to the next stage.  This will require several major tasks.  First, we will establish an equivalent reactor-network approach to coupling rocket engine/plume transport simulations into a zonal map of connected reactive regions, in which detailed soot kinetics can take place.  This approach builds on the software modules developed in Phase I, but extends their use to the practical plume-simulation environment.  Second, the physical and chemical sub-models will be refined, thoroughly tested, and calibrated against experimental data.  Third, the  software modules will be advanced while maintaining the flexible, modular nature of the programs.  Deliverables will include well defined APIs appropriate to commercial software, including end-user and programmer documentation.",

        "abstract": "The simplicity of a solar thermal propulsion system offers promise of very low cost compared to advanced cryogenic stages for earth orbit missions. Integrated solar thermal propulsion and power technology has evolved significantly over the past two decades through the combined efforts of the Air Force, NASA, and the aerospace industry. This technology is capable of offering 2-10 times the efficiency of existing chemical propulsion systems while simultaneously providing 30-100 kilowatts of electrical power at one-third to one-tenth the cost of advanced photovoltaic systems. The Solar Orbit Transfer Vehicle (SOTV) has been identified as a valuable space-based system for maintaining critical United States space assets. The upper propulsion stage for SOTV involves the storage of liquid hydrogen (LH2) on orbit. In several mission scenarios, the cryogen must be maintained for long periods, approaching up to five years. Key to enabling a stored cryogen system with this capability is the development of an active cooling system that can counteract the thermal loads due to the warm external environment of a low earth orbit. TAI is proposing to develop a hybrid cryocooler with a Brayton-cycle lower stage that is ideally suited for the cryogenic cooling needs of SOTV.",

U.S. Navy ships must be capable of receiving NPOESS data plus weather data from several heritage U.S. and foreign satellite systems, so future military weather stations must have tri-band L/S/X receive capability. Existing shipboard antenna systems receive only L/S-band downlinks and no \"real estate\" is readily available for a separate, new X-band antenna. Therefore, the need arises for a tri-band antenna system capable of operating within the same \"footprint\" as the heritage one-radome antenna systems.    The Team of Syntonics LLC and the ElectroScience Laboratory (ESL) of The Ohio State University has studied and proven the feasibility of a practical tri-band antenna system capable of separately pointing L, S and X-band receive antennas. In Phase II, the Team will design, build and test a prototype tri-band antenna system that can simultaneously receive weather and related data from satellites transmitting in the L, S, and X bands. The prototype antenna system will be designed to enable performance testing of its FSS antennas and transportation in a van or truck.",

Building upon Phase I research that demonstrated feasibility of projecting light energy through graphics projection screens, Ascension Technology will, in Phase II, develop a prototype model of its next-generation, solid state optical tracking system. Upon completion, we will demonstrate system-level capability to accurately track head motion without the placement of emitters of light energy within the cockpit.  The design will be sufficiently robust for test and evaluation in simulators with wrap-around displays utilizing rear-screen projections.  We will also address key development issues: compatibility with simulated helmet-mounted NVG goggles, laser safety, and optimal tracking coverage.  In addition to applicability in training simulators, the tracking device will have high value in tactical aircraft, tanks, and combat air operations centers.  Design features will enable it to exceed static accuracy, dynamic performance and repeatability of the best magnetic trackers while eliminating the need for costly alignment/mapping hardware and frequent maintenance. It will further overcome inherent limitations of optical trackers including  bulky, obstructive emitters and lens-based cameras that interfere with human motion, field of view, cockpit layout, and ingress/egress.    The private sector will profit in that the technology can be scaled for high volume commercial uses in real-time visualization, medical imaging, virtual reality and augmented reality. Correspondingly the military will benefit from amortizing capital equipment costs across a much larger volume of production than its applications alone can sustain.",

While DIS was a well-defined, static data protocol, HLA has many additional complexities, including the Runtime Infrastructure (RTI) and API, unlimited Federation Object Model (FOM) structures, and indeterminate low-level networking configurations.  These new variables have provided additional flexibility in the range of simulation types to which HLA can be applied, however, it has drastically increased the opportunity for network configuration errors, RTI compatibility errors, FOM construction errors, data definition errors, and interaction logic errors.  This has drastically increased the amount of time and effort it takes to correctly integrate a new federate into an HLA federation.  M\u00c4K is taking a two-prong approach to providing products to meet these requirements. M\u00c4K is developing the FOMspy federation analysis tool, and will augment the commercially selling RTIspy product with additional RTI debugging features.  Prototypes have been developed in Phase I for evaluation of the FOMspy design, and complete implementation will take place in Phase II. Additional enhancements to the RTIspy will be made in Phase II, and both tools will be tested in a large HLA exercise.",

Intangible limitations such as operator skills and tangible issues such as limited access, poor lighting and random orientation of markings make the process highly subjective and fraught with risks to crew and aircraft.    We propose the WINT System, a unique electro-optical technology consisting of three seamless steps: (a) acquire optical image of alphanumeric or barcode markings anywhere on the wire's 360-degree surface based on our patented NUVU technology;  (b) process analog alphanumeric/barcode image to display wire identification marking on a personal computer screen;  and (c) export its electronic equivalent to an electronic database for integrated electronic data management (IEDM).  WINT System will be handheld, portable and lightweight with character readability resolution of 10 to 50 microns, far in excess of the minimum character width of 250 microns. It can identify markings in-situ, non-intrusively, and nondestructively regardless of their orientation, insulation type, or method of marking. Phase I has conclusively demonstrated the ability to identify random alphanumeric wire-marking that was partially damaged. In Phase II, we will construct and validate in an AF maintenance shop-floor environment, and finally, deliver to Tinker OC-ALC, a prototype with robust and efficient character recognition software that seamlessly exports data to IEDM which then displays complete wire information includes interconnection data, tools required and maintenance history.

This attractive feature is the key differentiator that sets the proposal apart from other graphical programming packages, such as LabView or Simulink.

        "abstract": "The missile defense midcourse Exoatmospheric Interceptor Kill Vehicle (EKV) uses beryllium as the baseline material in the optical sensor mirrors and support structures to provide a lightweight, dimensionally-stable optical subsystem. Beryllium has health and safety issues related to its toxicity, which results in higher costs and producibility issues related to its fabrication long-lead time. Future advanced optical mirror systems, such as the four-mirror on-axis sensor concept for the EKV Upgrade Program, need alternative materials and designs with equivalent performance, reduced costs, and improved producibility compared to beryllium. Optical sensor performance is a function of the dimensional-stability of the optical elements, their attachment, and the structure connecting the optical elements in addition to the optical design. In the Phase I study, a Vanguard Composites Group and Schafer Corporation Team demonstrated analytically that an integrated composite mirror and structure design approach can provide an alternative to beryllium. A lightweight, high stiffness on-axis interceptor optical sensor mirror system was designed using Silicon Lightweight Foam Mirror System (called \"SLMS\", a trademark of Schafer Corporation) composite mirror materials and graphite fiber-reinforced polymer matrix composite optical component support structures (called \"OptiGraf\", a trademark of Vanguard Composites Group) in an integrated composite design. A Phase II proposed program will develop and demonstrate a SLMS-OptiGraf lightweight, high stiffness on-axis interceptor optical sensor composite mirror and support structure concept for both the mirror and support structure to provide competitive performance to alternative beryllium designs. The program scope will include developing the SLMS-OptiGraf designs, conducting component optical and structural tests, and fabricating full-scale components of an interceptor optical sensor mirror system for qualification testing.",

The capabilities of precision guided munitions and the further development of strike warfare platforms and tactics portend a huge increase in effectiveness and lethality of air operations and achieving the vision of the Global Strike Task Force concept. To fully realize the benefits of these strike-capable assets and to address the challenges inherent in time-sensitive targeting, decision-support systems are needed to assist warfighters in optimal allocation and near real-time re-deployment of air assets, and to support predictive battlespace awareness.  While meeting a specific operational need, additional benefits can accrue through the employment of such decision support systems for virtual and constructive simulation based training, experimentation, and Command and Control (C2) system evaluation and acquisition. Here, we propose a Software Toolkit for Optimizing Mission Plans (STOMP) for the Joint Synthetic Battlespace. STOMP integrates a genetic algorithm-based mechanism to rapidly generate, analyze, and visualize mission plans in tandem with software interoperability to provide the requisite interface and connectivity with AOC C2 systems and Joint Synthetic Battlespace synthetic component databases.",

        "abstract": "The DoD has undertaken an ambitious environmental restoration program.  Decontamination of soils and groundwater polluted with organics is a complex problem.  Bioremediation is widely accepted for management of contaminated aquifers.  Stimulation of bacteria by addition of electron donor species / nutrients can yield significantly faster site closure times, reducing the remediation time from 30 to three years.  However, delivery of these compounds represents a significant challenge in low permeability clay soils.  Lynntech has developed a patented electrokinetic system that allows delivery of electron donors and nutrient species to an exact location within the subsurface of the contaminated site.    During Phase I Lynntech designed a small field demonstration system (96 ft2) that will be operational at Tinker Air Force Base (Old Fire Training Area, Sector CG037) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  The first portion of Phase II research will include a 12,500 ft2 test site that will provide information on electroosmotic flow, effects of groundwater flow, and electromigration through the site.  Information learned from the initial study will used to plan and perform site expansion to 55,000 ft2.  Upon completion of Phase II research, Lynntech will determine if the site can be closed out and decommissioned or will require further treatment.",

The objective of this research project is to continue development of a practical method for quickly and accurately measuring the very low absorption in optical thin films as they are being deposited inside a vacuum chamber.  In Phase I, an attenuated total internal reflection-waveguide (ATIR-W) technique was shown to enhance the absorption of a single thin zirconia film more than 300 times, compared to its single pass absorption at near normal incidence.  Theory indicates that a film with normal incidence absorption of 1 ppm, when placed in an optimized ATIR-W instrument, will absorb 10,000 times the light or 1%, making direct measurement of the reduction in the reflected beam (absorption) practical.  With this real time information, coaters can expedite the optimization of the coating materials, processes and designs.  Phase II will continue the development of these TIR-W techniques by testing both wavelength scanning at a fixed angle of incidence and angle of incidence scanning with monochromatic light.",

This Phase II SBIR has its foundation in the recognition that condition-based maintenance (CBM) and machine health monitoring provide the highest payback when applied to the most critical machinery.  When asked what equipment qualifies for CBM, in terms of frequency and seriousness of failure, shipyard managers always point to their mobile cranes.    This Phase II will add substantial breadth and depth to the Phase I and to the NSRP/CNST work by adding many components to the list of those monitored and by supporting iterations of algorithm improvement, accomplished as the machinery is operated and history and experience grows.  Similarly, the monitoring hardware, software, and communication systems will be improved with increasing experience.  The team is comprised of RLW Inc; the Penn State University Applied Research Laboratory (ARL); and two shipyards: NASSCO (General Dynamics), San Diego; and Ingalls (Northrop Grumman Ship Systems), Pascagoula.

The proposed model will use a combined Eulerian-Lagrangian treatment for analyzing the three-dimensional gas-particle flow. Analysis of radiative heat exchange will account for specular radiation and scattering by powder particles. The temperature field in the deposition region will be determined by solving the energy conservation equation that accounts for phase change and free surface effects. Calculated thermal history will enable prediction of microstructure and residual stresses. Emphasis is placed on computational efficiency. Thus, radiative heat transfer will be calculated in the same grid used for gas-particle analysis. The Volume-of-Fluid technique will be used to predict shape evolution. A two-domain approach involving local mesh refinement and multigrid solution will be used for efficient analysis of the thermal interaction between small-scale deposition and large-scale bulk regions. The model will be validated with reference to available measurements on practical LAM units. A pilot commercialization effort will be undertaken in the later stages of the Phase II project with companies involved in the development and use of the LAM process.",

This system combines the deployability and high specific stiffness of flexible composite shell elements with the mass-efficiency of fractal isogrids.  This combination of technologies simultaneously solves the three primary issues facing gossamer reflectors: surface precision, stiffness, and deployability.  Most lightweight mirror systems use a face sheet to provide bending stiffness at the local scale, and a rigid backing structure to provide stiffness at the global scale.  MIRRORS uses the concept of the fractal isogrid to provide bending stiffness at every scale.  In addition to the improved dynamic stability, the fractal network also supports the reflecting surface at a high enough spatial frequency that the surface precision and shape control is vastly improved over that of tension based, membrane reflectors.  Furthermore, the proposed concept, known as Monolithic Isogrid Reflectors for Radio-to-Optical Remote Sensing (MIRRORS), can be applied to a variety of reflector and deployment architectures, and is therefore applicable to a broad range of missions.

        "abstract": "This study investigates the use of probabilistic data and probabilistic algorithms in the engagement planning and scheduling (EPS) function of a ballistic missile defense system's C2BMC.  EPS is the part of a ballistic missile defense system battle manager that is responsible for deciding how to use the system's resources to defend assets.  The data used by EPS is probabilistic, and is highly dependent on the current conditions and uncertainties.  By making full use of probabilistic data, EPS can effectively plan engagements against threats that would otherwise leak through, and can plan engagements with higher probability of kill using fewer shots.  However, the EPS problem is an NP-hard optimization problem.  Recently, randomized approximation algorithms have been used to provide near-optimal solutions to NP-hard problems, with arbitrarily high probability, in polynomial time.  Such a probabilistic algorithm for the EPS problem may provide near-optimal EPS solutions in real time.  Phase I of the study identified the main issues of the EPS problem, developed a mathematical characterization and a mathematical solution approach, and produced a preliminary algorithmic architecture.  The issues involve the uncertainties, actions, constraints, objectives, and heuristics for the EPS problem.  The mathematical characterization is in terms of a partially observed Markov decision process, with continuous time and mixed discrete-continuous state space whose objective is to plan and schedule engagements against threat clusters in order to maximize the expected utility of surviving asset value.  The mathematical solution approach uses approximate dynamic programming.  The transition probabilities up to the time horizon are computed from real-time probabilistic battlespace analysis (PBSA) and threat evaluation data.  The transition probabilities from the time horizon to the end of the battle are computed in terms of a stochastic game against a worst-case attacker, using an offline-generated leakage probability function.  The search through the solution space for the optimal action is a randomized approximation algorithm based on Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques, guided by heuristic policies.  Phase II of the study will implement the algorithmic architecture in Matlab and C++, evaluate the algorithms in TechFinity's ballistic missile defense algorithm testbed, and produce a detailed algorithmic architecture.  It will use real-time data from TechFinity's PBSA study - a companion MDA SBIR Phase II.  The GMD and KEI POs have endorsed our study, and we intend to develop core and generic capabilities in Probabilistic EPS (PEPS) during the Phase II Basic Contract that can be modified and tailored for GMD and KEI specific issues.  We propose an additional Option 1 Contract to address some of the key and generic PEPS issues in Midcourse MD, and an Option 2 Contract to address generic PEPS issues in Boost Phase MD, avoiding specific design issues of GMD and KEI.  Our objective is to develop detailed algorithms and tools in a spiral, evolutionary manner for potential insertion into BMDS block upgrades and for use in other domains, focusing on missile/air defense applications in Phase II.  We intend to extend our approach to non-DoD government applications and to private sector commercial markets in Phase III.",

However, attention has turned to the task of managing these QoS networks more efficiently through the handling of network traffic. Current solutions are focused primarily on the task of passive corrective traffic management, with little attention paid to active preventive network traffic management. In other words, today's networks are statically planned, and do not respond well to frequent dynamic changes in traffic levels.  In addition, there is no network management tool that provides network traffic forecasting, and offers a preventive network management tool.  To address these problems, Broadata Communications Inc.

The Phase II objectives would build on our previous work in assimilating acoustic travel time information into an ocean circulation model.  SSI has developed a preliminary method for transforming acoustic travel time information into corresponding ocean model variables.  This method has been implemented into the data assimilation scheme of the Physical-space Statistical Analysis System (PSAS).  Initial testing of this model-oriented acoustic assimilation technique at the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF), revealed that it significantly reduced the scatter of the model-predicted temperatures relative to observed temperatures.    The Phase II work will include the full implementation and testing of the COTAPS technology at PMRF.  We will develop and implement the full set of expressions for estimating and assimilating water column temperatures (T), salinities (S), and currents (U) based on acoustic arrival time information.  The work will also include establishing as part of the national ocean laboratory at PMRF an automated oceanographic/tomographic analysis and prediction system that will produce products on a daily basis.  A demonstration of the PMRF COTAPS will be conducted in which SSI will perform a comparison of model and observed T, S, and U with and without tomographic data assimilation.  We will quantify the model errors to ascertain the degree (positive and negative) to which tomographic assimilation impacts the model solutions.  This will provide the basis from which SSI will develop the specific software-hardware framework of a forward-deployable COTAPS for undersea warfare.",

Prototypes that look good in the cool isolation of development often do not support human cognition in the field. This proposal describes tools to help systems designers generate and apply cognitive metrics, measures of human cognitive capabilities critical to skilled performance.  In Phase I we created a cognitive metrics suite to augment human performance metrics and the human-systems integration process.  We developed methods for generating and using cognitive metrics.  Grounded in Cognitive Task Analysis and the concept of macrocognition, the suite demonstrated high potential for evaluating the effects of information technologies on cognitive performance.   Phase II will develop a prototype, the Cognitive Metrics Suite (CMS) Tool that enables efficient use of cognitive metrics throughout the system development process.

A single explosion using pyrotechnics contained within the device traditionally generates the flash and bang.  While effective at temporarily disabling targeted personnel, they do have some drawbacks.

Flight control design challenges include high sensitivity to the wind and limited power available for control effectors.  The critical problem of station keeping at altitude has been partitioned into the Sub Thrust Limit (STL) regime where winds are low enough to maintain station with available thrust and the Post Thrust Limit (PTL) regime at higher wind levels.  Phase I developments of a PTL control strategy that seeks to exploit features of the wind field will be further developed and assessed.  This will involve the development of a \"wind estimator\" that fuses off-board forecasts and onboard wind sensor data.  The wind estimator will interface with trajectory optimization algorithms configured to minimize energy consumption and station keeping error while enforcing control power and other constraints.

In Phase I, Advanced Fuel Research, Inc. successfully field-demonstrated an in-situ, non-intrusive optical-based method that correlated with the burdensome ARP. Also demonstrated was an optical-based extractive sampling cell for also measuring Smoke Number. Demonstration measurements on a J-85 turbojet with an 18-inch nozzle were successful. Extinction values over a broad range of smoke conditions correlated well with the traditional method, thus showing the potential of the optical method for real-time Smoke Number measurements.

These designs will benefit from a reduced number of optical components, thereby adding stability and simplifying installation in an engine test environment.

Several synthesis concepts are proposed for manufacturing and property evaluation in order to establish physical and reactive properties for consideration and insertion into the THAAD system as lethality enhancement options.    In this Phase II program scale-up and ballistic evaluation is proposed for high velocity studies (5-10) km/sec including a miniature interceptor against a simulated missile target accompanied by analysis and predictions of enhancement for real world intercepts.",

In Phase I KaZaK Composites performed work that suggested significant cost savings could result by pultruding the canister rather than filament winding. Pultrusion is a highly automated technology that replaces part by part manufacturing characteristic of filament winding with a continuous production stream of constant cross section parts. In Phase II KCI will develop a pultrusion-based processing system capable of producing single piece high performance carbon/epoxy composite containers that provide a lower cost alternative to filament winding. Phase II efforts will include the development of tooling and process hardware specialized for making very straight large cross section parts. A pultrusion-optimized canister design will be developed for a specific round, selected after discussion with the Army and Lockheed Martin. After developing an acceptable set of pultrusion processing parameters, KCI will pultrude full scale canisters, then subject these prototypes to a range of tests to verify the ability of the pultruded shell to meet geometric and mechanical performance requirements for the canister. A cost reduction of at least 25% compared to the filament wound baseline is anticipated.",

        "abstract": "A key component of any ballistic missile defense system is the decision architecture of what to intercept, where to intercept, when to intercept and which weapon system to use.  The key pieces of information that drive the decision as to the \"what\", \"where\", and \"when\" are: (1) what is the threat (its lethality and what does it threaten); and (2) what is the probability of kill.  To this end, a key building block is Probabilistic Battle Space Analysis (PBSA).  The focus of this effort determines the shot opportunities for various firing doctrines, representing BMD errors into a mean and covariance of Single Shot Probability of Kill.  Battle Space Analysis is a key component of MD C2BMC. In Phase I we developed a preliminary algorithmic architecture to determine Probabilistic Battle Space, including robust estimates of Pkill.  Our algorithmic and software architecture is modular and designed to probabilistically accommodate constraints of various weapon systems.  In Phase II we will develop the algorithmic detailed design and prototype software to Technology Readiness Level 5 (or 6).  There are uncertainties and ambiguities in the knowledge, information and data used to plan a missile defense engagement, such as the treat state vector. Existing missile defense systems base their engagement decisions primarily on mean parameter values such as threat state vectors, without systematically taking into consideration the associated uncertainties.  Decisions that do not consistently handle the stochastic nature of the engagement can be overly optimistic or overly pessimistic in their estimate of probability of kill.  Based on significant lessons learned it was found that considering the effect of these uncertainties when planning engagements can significantly enhance the overall effectiveness of a BMD system.  While the many-on-many engagement problem is key for real-time Battle Management, the proper formulation and solution of the one-on-one engagement problem is the core building block.  Our study focused on the probabilistic formulation and solution of the one-on-one engagement problem, systematically taking into account uncertainties and errors.  We are in the process of modeling knowledge representations and developing probabilistic behavior models that realistically represent the ballistic missile battle space for use in high performance and high effectiveness, global maximization of P-kill over all of battle space engagement decision algorithms.  The representation of the one-on-one engagement problem is to roll up all uncertainties into Single Shot Probability of Kill (SSPK) with its `mean' and `distribution' in multi-dimensional space, and plan engagements in optimal P-kill `volumes' in this multi-dimensional space.  The GMD and KEI POs have endorsed our study, and we intend to develop core and generic capabilities in Probabilistic Battle Space Analysis during the Phase II Basic Contract that can be modified and tailored for GMD and KEI specific issues.  We propose an additional Option 1 Contract to address some of the key and generic PBSA issues in Midcourse MD, and an Option 2 Contract to address generic PBSA issues in Boost Phase MD, avoiding specific design issues of GMD and KEI.  The Phase II implementation will focus on algorithmic methods that efficiently compute the effects of key MD uncertainties on potential engagements.  Our objective is to develop detailed algorithms and tools in a spiral, evolutionary manner for potential insertion into BMDS block upgrades and for use in other domains, focusing on missile/air defense applications in Phase II.  We intend to extend our approach to non-DoD government applications and to private sector commercial markets in Phase III.",

The standards based (IEEE 802.11) wireless LAN equipment is intended to provide reliable coverage over a limited range of approximately 100 m. However, the wireless LAN transmissions may be detected and exploited at much greater ranges, and can provide an intruder the opportunity to attack or disable the network from a remote site, outside the presumably secured facility. Enhanced standards based authentication and encryption methods will reduce the threat that an intruder will be able to access network resources. But given the resources, and time, to discretely monitor and probe the presumably secured wireless network, the intruder can ultimately compromise the network. Anntron proposes to demonstrate best of class Network Intrusion Detection software on a small field-able sensor with directive antenna called the Wireless Intrusion Detection and Location System (WIDLS). WIDLS can be placed wherever the probability is best for detecting all intruders. WIDLS uses a multi-beam antenna to add sensitivity and directionality to intruder detections. Two sensors can estimate the location of the intruder. A smart antenna algorithm can improve bearing and location estimations.

        "abstract": "The proposed Reconfigurable DAR Processor (RDP) design is a large network of FPGA-based DSP nodes (augmented with a few CPU nodes) distributed over several Multi-node DSP Line Cards (MDLCs) and interconnected by a full serial mesh backplane. The Phase II effort will result in two significant products that will directly benefit several US Navy programs developing advanced RF sensors. The first product is the library of fully-debugged and well characterized DSP algorithms implemented in Xilinx FPGA firmware. Though developed specifically to support the real-time DAR functions used by the RDP, use of these validated FPGA-based algorithms would reduce schedule and cost risk for Navy programs with very-high-speed adaptive signal processing requirements. The second Phase II product is the RDP Demonstration of the DAR system design (developed under Phase I). The RDP hardware platform could be used as the processor for adaptive DAR R&D programs and as the starting point for the design of any future Navy DAR sensor. Since the hardware platform can be easily expanded to support up to 320 channels, it could also serve as the real-time processor for US Navy Electronic Warfare and Electronic Support systems requiring support for interfaces to complicated RF sensors having a large number of output channels.",

The initial near IR laser pulse is transformed into a super broad laser pulse spanning from the UV to the IR. Important DoD and Homeland Defense applications include the remote detection of biological warfare agents as well as jamming sensors. However, for any practical application, it is important to fully understand the physical mechanism of the long-range propagation and the interaction with the optical media. Time Domain Corporation (TDC) proposes a systematic study of the laser pulse propagation under realistic atmospheric conditions including turbulence.  To determine optimum conditions, TDC will study laser pulse propagation as a function of initial laser pulse parameters such as pulse width, frequency chirp, pulse energy, beam radius, and wave-front. Measurements at long distances will include energy, beam profile, peak intensity and spectral content of the pulse. Our effort will also include the interaction of intense fs pulses with optical limiters and filters in the visible and near IR region.  This work will determine whether the limiters and filters provide adequate protection for eyes and sensors against ultra-wide band intense fs pulses as well as induced THz radiation and higher harmonic generation.",

This is a particular problem for multi-carrier signals in a very broadband channel, especially those spanning multiple octaves, such as HF (2-30 MHz).  Conventional approaches to deal with this problem are intrinsically narrow-band and of limited effectiveness.  Based on our Phase I analysis, HYPRES proposes to demonstrate a unique digital-RF approach - true RF predistortion in the digital domain. In this approach, a broadband, multi-carrier RF signal is digitized directly, and predistorted in real-time using high-speed digital electronics.  This will produce performance enhancements well beyond those achievable by conventional approaches.  First, hardware prototype test-bed will be developed using commercial silicon-based technologies, including a high-speed ADC, RAM, and DAC.  In parallel, HYPRES will implement the same predistortion techniques using ultrafast superconducting electronics, which can be extended in the future into the multi-GHz range (well beyond the capabilities of commercial silicon), for application to other RF bands.  This will extend HYPRES' projects in digital-RF receiver components, to a full set of digital-RF transceiver products for military and commercial markets.",

        "abstract": "Given two closely related pieces of software X and Y, where Y differs from X through a number of small but important (from a security point of view) modifications that were done to Y, the \"diff\" attack consists of comparing X and Y so as to pinpoint the fragments of code in which they differ.  The differences between X and Y could include, among other things, the fact that Y contains credentials-checking mechanisms that were lacking in X, such as password protection, biometrically-based access controls, challenge-response protocol with a remote server, etc.  Pinpointing those differences makes it easier for an attacker to defeat the security-related features of Y that the attacker dislikes (not only credentials-checking, but also integrity-checking and other kinds of policy-enforcement that the attacker wishes to circumvent).  Re-writing Y from scratch (rather than modifying X) as a means of increasing the apparent differences between X and Y, especially if done using a different programming language, can be an effective way of thwarting this attack, but it is obviously uneconomical. It is therefore important to develop automated tools that process Y so that even the most sophisticated comparisons between X and Y reveal a large \"diff set\" between them, i.e., X and Y appear to be largely different even though in functionality they are essentially the same. The development of such automated tools and techniques was the main thrust of the Phase I proposal.  In Phase II the team will design and develop a suite of software applications and tools, as a platform enabling resistance to \"diff\" attacks. This suite will include:    \u00b7 An advanced version of the transformation engine developed in Phase I of the project.  \u00b7 A GUI-based \"score\" application recommender system to assist users in building better protections.  \u00b7 Differential analysis attack tools to evaluate the stealthiness and resilience of the transformations.  \u00b7 A smart patch management system resistant to diff attacks.  \u00b7 Watermarking/Fingerprinting techniques to help trace software applications.",

Large planar arrays mounted on either the side, top or bottom of current airframes are impractical, if not aerodynamically unstable. Consequently, the Air Force is investing in new RF technologies to support lightweight large conformal apertures designs and is investigating approaches for mounting/integrating them into a variety of conventional, and future air vehicles including UAV\u00a1_s (e.g. SensorCraft) and mini-UAV\u00a1_s.  To meet mission objectives, these radars are expected to rely on space-time adaptive processing (STAP) techniques to achieve the interference suppression performance required. These non-conventional conformal array radar systems, however, will face unique signal processing challenges.  Many simplifying assumptions made by planar array adaptive processing approaches will be violated by conformal aperture designs.    The desire for high range resolution capabilities for ground target feature extraction and identification provides additional design challenges. These requirements drive the design to wideband STAP where the narrowband assumptions implied in most STAP approaches lead to spatial and Doppler dispersion effects and potential degradation in STAP performance. One approach for handling these effects is to decompose the wideband signal into smaller subbands, each with sufficiently small bandwidth such that narrowband STAP processing can be employed. The narrowband outputs are recombined to reconstruct the full bandwidth, high-resolution signal with the clutter interference suppressed.",

While successful demonstrations of volumetric imaging capabilities from various radar platforms have been made recently, there remains significant issues regarding data acquisition, signal processing, and product exploitation.    Under this SBIR, Vexcel Corporation proposes to build upon its phase 1 results, and address the data acquisition and signal processing aspects of SAR tomography with an emphasis on linear processing.  We will propose a realistic data collection and processing approach that will robustly yield accurate and valuable volumetric SAR imagery for NGA's utility.  Approaches will be demonstrated using real data over a large range of radar wavelengths.",

Phase II work will build upon the architecture and proof-of-concept from Phase I.  Development will focus on the two main WIDSMS subsystems which work together to detect and locate intruding signals before the rogue system is able to exchange data with the protected wireless network, and to provide recommended or automated intrusion prevention actions.  These two major subsystems include: (1) Packet-based software intrusion detection and prevention component. (2) Smart antenna null-steering component.  It will be shown in this proposal that WIDSMS is capable of filling a crucial gap in the military and throughout industry by providing a protected \"invisible fence\" around mission-critical wireless networks.",

        "abstract": "Determining the composition of future naval force architectures has never depended so critically upon understanding the emerging geo-political environment as it does today. At the same time, however, the end of the Cold War and emergence of non-state asymmetric threat entities have removed the key anchor assumptions that guided long-term naval strategic planning for over five decades. Furthermore, an explosion of data as part of the global revolution in information technology has accompanied the rise in uncertainty associated with the on-going geo-strategic paradigm shift. The combination of ambiguous future trends and ubiquitous praecognita electronica have left naval force architecture analysts drowning in data but starving for information that provides fiscally and culturally constrained alternative geo-political contexts.  Cyberneutics, Inc. and its subcontractor General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems/Veridian Systems Division, Inc. propose to address this situation with the Geo-Political Analysis and Modeling Environment (GAME), a standard methodology and decision support tool to assist long-term context development for force design and planning efforts. GAME will provide an end-to-end environment where analysts making geo-political predictions can build \"alternative futures\" using the best tool for the task of indicator construction from a library of pre-built components, including tools to support tapping external data sources.  The GAME Phase II prototype will support continuous monitoring of the future world and iterative updating of the underlying assumptions and models.",

This RFC will build upon the successfully developed and demonstrated unitized regenerative fuel cell from the DARPA/NRL Water Rocket program.  Although that hardware has been developed for operation in a zero gravity environment (for space applications) it is quite applicable for high altitude aircraft (HAA) or terrestrial applications. The requirements in terms of mission profile and duration, maximum operating pressure, etc. may be different. The impact of these differences will be investigated.  Furthermore, the trade study between discrete and unitized regenerative fuel cells will be undertaken early in Phase II.  For the high altitude airship application with charge and discharge cycles varying between 8 and 16 hours each, the optimal cell stack configuration will be investigated.  Moreover, if the performance of the unitized regenerative fuel cell proves to be limiting, the discrete regenerative fuel cell option will be considered.",

        "abstract": "The projected ballistic missile defense (BMD) threat environment is extremely challenging.  The linear frequency modulation (LFM) waveforms used by current radars have limitations in these projected environments.  The use of advanced waveforms is desired for these imaging tasks, but they require both wideband analog to digital converters and intensive digital processing.  Optical front-end receivers have been shown to have significant advantages over wideband all-digital processing.  Under previous efforts, Essex developed an opto-electronic radar signal processor, called the Advanced Optical Processor (AOP).  The AOP permits the use of advanced waveforms, such as pseudo-random number (PRN) codes and chaotic waveforms.  A second generation AOP has been developed and soon will be tested at both MIT/LL and KMR with the ALCOR radar.  The AOP characteristics indicate that this radar image formation technology can be used to support the challenges posed by modern ballistic missile defense threat environments in the near future for both discrimination and kill assessment.    This proposed effort will augment the testing at KMR with testing and data collection at selected radar site(s) in support of AOP2 demonstration for insertion into Missile Defense Agency (MDA) radars.  A second task will be to perform system testing to identify specific system components which can be improved to enhance system performance within the radars identified for potential insertion.  All such enhancements discovered shall be presented to the Government.  Those jointly agreed to as desirable enhancements shall be designed, implemented, and tested to assess AOP2 performance improvement.",

These include precision distance measurements, target detection, designation, and imaging, and wind speed measurements.  The transition of lidar technology into space will provide a powerful tool for defense and commercial applications.  For space-based measurements, lasers with a near diffraction limited beam quality and pulse energies on the order of 1 J are often required.  Higher repetition rates increase the data acquisition rate.  We are proposing to investigate 1 \u00b5m laser designs that can provide 1 J/pulse at 100 Hz in a robust and compact package suitable for space.    Our approach is based on an oscillator/amplifier design.  The design incorporates diode-pumped, conductively cooled slabs as the gain media.  The oscillator is an innovative telescopic ring resonator design that can achieve high beam quality and pulse energies on the order of 125 mJ.  By starting with higher energy oscillator pulses we can achieve a more compact overall system.  Proof of principle resonator measurements and scaling analysis have been performed in Phase I.

Our successful Phase I studies showed that the NDXA is about 1-inch long and should be able to produce 500 watts of X-band radiation with an outstanding efficiency of 85%.  We are now ready to proceed with the development of an NDXA prototype for operation at 8.4 GHz capable of delivering 500 watts of microwave power with a gain of 27 dB and 85% efficiency.  The NDXA to be developed during Phase II will be very well-suited for Ground-Based Midcourse X-band Radar (XBR) applications.

This would lead to a significant reduction in the overall manufacturing cycle as well as lower the capital requirement costs for large volume manufacturing.  In the Phase II effort Touchstone will perform production-scale foaming tests and optimization and will design and test a continuous calcining furnace on a pilot-scale.  A manufacturing plan will be developed on the results of this effort, which will allow rapid transition into the commercialization phase.  MDA will benefit from the increases in the production process that will be achieved in this effort, and this will translate into a lower cost and faster delivery for the CFOAM material.

        "abstract": "An interception of fast targets early in their flight at a long range is important for national missile defense. The Airborne Laser (ABL) system is designed to shoot down theater ballistic missiles in their boost phase using a high-energy laser (HEL). A direct attack of fast targets at long ranges with the ABL places very stressing requirements on the adaptive optics (AO) system and degrades the AO performance. Target engagement using an airship-based relay mirror (RM) can extend the operational range and increase the probability to kill. Unfortunately, when an AO beacon is created by illuminating a missile body or atmospheric volume ahead of a missile tip with an uncompensated beam, the beam becomes corrupted by turbulence. A corrupted beacon beam creates an extended pattern at the target. In deep turbulence the beacon diameter exceeds the isoplanatic patch size. This effect, referred to as beacon anisoplanatism, strongly degrades the peak performance of direct attack ABL and extended range ABL.  In Phase I, the concept of a multi-conjugate beacon compensation system (MCBCS) for correcting beacon anisoplanatism, as well as chromatic anisoplanatism associated with the wavelength difference between the beacon laser and high-energy laser, was developed and validated using wave optical simulation. In Phase II we will experimentally demonstrate the MCBCS concept at the ASALT laboratory at Starfire Optical Range at AFRL/DEC. This experimental demonstration will provide a basis for the development of the MCBCS prototype.",

The algorithms designed for this combined hardware platform use adaptive multi-channel CNN solutions for instantaneous position estimation and morphological characterization of all targets; and DSP solutions for distance calculation, gating, data association, track maintenance and dynamic target motion prediction. A special feature of the architecture is that it allows an interactive communication between the sensor-level and the digital environment.

The material, a 4-dimensionally reinforced carbon-carbon containing silicon carbide to eliminate oxidation and erosion, will offer significant benefits in comparison to the refractory metals now in use such as rhenium, columbium, and molybdenum.  Refractory and other metals used for ACS components (e.g. inconel) are high in cost and density, are difficult to fabricate into complex shapes required for ACS components, and are difficult to join to other materials.  The proposed program will develop and demonstrate a composite thruster body designed for the SM-3 ACS that is lighter in weight, is comprised of fewer parts, and has higher performance than the current refractory metal thruster body.",

This successful effort, in addition to the on-going RRAPDS program and related technology advancements, will enable real-time access of source data thus increasing efficiency for mission planning and improving overall missile system performance.  Phase II will continue the engineering system development including finalization of a Performance Requirements Document, detailed design, prototype construction, test, development of level I drawings and completion of a comprehensive Interface Control Document. Completion of Phase II will position the THAAD TRACR for Phase III competition wherein the product will be engineered for manufacture and a Low-Rate Initial Production would be accomplished.  The benefits to be derived from implementation of a THAAD TRACR Phase II have strong endorsement from the THAAD Project Office. The results will significantly increase THAAD's reliability and demonstrate the feasibility of applying such health monitoring across other MDA systems hence reducing system operating and support costs and increasing reliability.",

        "abstract": "Viscous analysis is vital for a complete understanding of missile and UAV aerodynamic properties. A high fidelity aerodynamic analysis tool capable of predicting a flow field can significantly reduce design time and cost. The success of a CFD analysis is dependent on the quality of the grid. This proposal offers a technique for automatically generating grids suitable for viscous analysis on complex configurations. The region closest to the body is divided into zones and body-conforming grids are generated in these zones. In the outer region where convection dominates, unstructured meshes can be generated efficiently and fast. A transitional grid is used as a bridge between the regions. Viscous solvers can be used for the near-body region while the faster inviscid solver can be used in the farfield. Phase I established the proof-of-concept for such a tool.  Phase II proposes to develop an automated viscous CFD grid generator with geometry recognition and dynamic adoption. It will be integrated with a graphical user interface and a visualization module. The tool will be tested using candidate missile and aircraft geometries provided by the Army. Enhancements such as parallelization of the code will be investigated for implementation in Phase III.",

While CVD offers the most cost-effective manufacturing approach for these components, further improvements in production throughput and cost are desired. In Phase I, Ultramet demonstrated that seven main thruster assembly (MTA) thrusters, instead of one, could be simultaneously coated in a single CVD reactor without increasing the deposition time. It was further demonstrated that the rhenium usage efficiency could be increased by 20% relative to the current process, and that the time required to machine MTA thrusters could be reduced by 40% relative to the wire electrical discharge machining (EDM) process currently used. In Phase II, Ultramet will continue to increase the production efficiency of MTA thrusters by further developing the CVD process to include nine thrusters, further developing the machining process to increase its efficiency, and developing/applying innovative quality assurance techniques to increase confidence in the product. The efficacy of the new processes will be demonstrated by several techniques, including hot-fire testing of several thrusters. The result will be a dramatic increase in process throughput and production capacity, an increase in product reliability, a decrease in the number of CVD reactors required for a given job, and a commensurate decrease in the unit production cost.",

        "abstract": "A wide variety of non-intrusive optical sensing techniques in the ultra-violet, visible and near infrared spectral regions have become well-established tools for fundamental studies in combustion physics and chemistry in the laboratory. While these diagnostic techniques are well suited for visualizing complex reacting flow-fields and validating combustor design codes for advanced propulsion system development, the challenges posed by real-world propulsion systems limit their transition to on-board monitoring and control applications. Non-invasive remote sensors operating in the terahertz (THz) spectral region afford the promise of circumventing several limitations imposed by the harsh operating conditions of real-world combustors such as extreme ambient heat, pressure and vibration, limited optical access, two-phase flows, soot formation, background luminosity, and scattering. In addition, they offer significant potential for monitoring the health of gas-turbine engine components exposed to severe environments in situ. Foster-Miller proposes to develop novel THz sensors based on optoelectronic generation and coherent electro-optic detection of tunable monochromatic THz radiation using commercial off-the-shelf diode laser technology. The proposed SBIR Phase II effort will integrate mature laser and materials technologies into a compact, portable, rugged sensor that can perform rapid and accurate spectroscopic measurements on practical combustors over the widest possible range of THz frequencies.

During life testing conducted at AFRL the BHT-200 operation was approximately 900 hours less than the Phase II IHPRPT Goal of approximately 1000 hours.  Concurrent with the IHPRPT demonstration test, Busek identified several design modifications in the Phase I SBIR that lessen the erosion of the dielectric insulators.  Based on measured erosion profiles during 500 hours of testing, the extrapolated life of the extended lifetime thruster is 1500-2000 hours.  Many emerging Space Test Program (STP), and orbit transfer missions require lifetime magnitudes of 3000 hours.  Therefore, the focus of the Phase II effort is to extend the lifetime of the BHT-200 to 3000 hours making it attractive to a broader range of users.  In the Phase II, Busek will continue with design modifications, primarily to the neutral flow distribution and magnetic field profiles that minimize the impingement of ions onto the insulator surfaces.  In parallel, sputter resistant materials will be evaluated as substitutes to the baseline boron nitride.  At the conclusion of the Phase II program, Busek will build an engineering model thruster and conduct an accelerated life test using results from a lifetime model being developed by our subcontractor MIT to predict erosion rates.  Pending a positive outcome of the accelerated lifetime prediction/validation the thruster will be transferred to AFRL for continued life testing.",

It allows dynamic control of the rigid-body modes of entire optical benches at low frequency (i.e. dynamic alignment) while simultaneously isolating the benches from the airframe at higher frequencies to avoid exciting their local resonances.   However this optical bench isolation system has been, for the first ABL aircraft, manufactured and hand-built largely by prototype manufacturing methods, without benefit of systematic design-for-manufacture.  It has proven to be a capable performer but costly and time-consuming to build and test and somewhat heavy.

        "abstract": "The Air Force is seeking a highly operable aerospace vehicle that can be ready to launch on demand. Hydrocarbon-fueled vehicles offer certain benefits over other propulsion systems. The vehicle is heavier when fueled with kerosene, but because of the nature of the propellant, it is lighter when empty: a benefit in reduced vehicle weight and cost. Also, kerosene costs less to produce and use. Advanced propellant injector materials and designs are required to promote stable combustion with high mixing efficiency. The potential exists to take advantage of the inherent and tailorable porous open-cell structure contained within refractory ceramic (and metallic) structural foams for propellant injection in hydrocarbon boost engines. Ultramet previously worked with the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Propulsion Directorate at Edwards AFB to establish the mechanical and fluid flow properties of open-cell silicon carbide (SiC) foam material produced by Ultramet for potential use in injector applications, among others. The flow characteristics showed promise for use with hydrocarbon propellants, but the structures fabricated previously were limited to relatively small sizes (4\" diameter x 1.0-1.5\" thick). In Phase I, Ultramet demonstrated the feasibility of process scaleup to practical injector components by producing SiC foam structures having an order of magnitude greater volume (12\" diameter). The initial material and process development and manufacturing demonstration complements ongoing design and property database development being conducted at AFRL/PRSE and Boeing's Rocketdyne division. In Phase II, Ultramet will team with Rocketdyne to perform comprehensive component design and material optimization, ultimately leading to performance demonstration through hot-fire testing of injector components using a hydrocarbon propellant. The proposed foam injector represents a significant step toward the practical use of hydrocarbon-fueled aerospace vehicles.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this proposal is to develop and demonstrate methods for extending the Battlespace Infosphere to small, mobile and embedded systems using optimized COTS technologies. The USAF Scientific Advisory Board report titled Building the Joint Battlespace Infosphere identifies XML as one of the most promising technologies for representing information objects. Many DoD organizations have adopted XML and established policies for broad XML use. However, transmitting XML over wireless data links and processing it on small, mobile and embedded systems has proved challenging due to the size and complexity of XML data. This creates a data representation rift between fixed, mobile and embedded users of the Battlespace Infosphere.     We will develop novel and uniquely efficient methods for encoding and processing XML data to eliminate this rift. These methods will enable deployment of XML solutions on small, embedded and mobile platforms that have limited bandwidth, memory, processing power and/or battery life. They will afford mobile users unprecedented access to the wealth of enterprise information encoded in XML and enable enterprise users easy access to information gathered by mobile users. They will also increase the performance of existing systems and increase opportunities for exploiting COTS software on embedded and mobile platforms.",

In the case of a misfire, the gun crew must know the bore surface temperature in order to decide if they have time to safely  remove the ammunition before enough heat has transferred from the hot barrel, possibly initiating a cook-off of the projectile or propelling charge.  In the Phase I program, we verified that ultrasonic methods could be used to measure bore surface temperature and bore erosion in under laboratory test conditions.  The method is non-intrusive and requires no modification to the gun barrel.  When combined with thermal models, the new ultrasonic sensor technology can be used to improve \"cook-off\" prediction and gun safety.  In this Phase II program we develop and test a robust, reliable, ultrasonic system capable of measuring inner bore temperature and erosion.

This Phase II program is aimed at addressing both of these issues by developing a growth process for the production of 1cm thick boules at a growth rate of 1mm per hour.  The Phase I program met and exceeded the goals of demonstrating high rate growth, in excess of 500um/hr, of 2\" diameter 5mm thick GaN boules.  The Phase II will continue optimization of the bulk growth process and will assemble a crystal growth reactor designed for high rate transport.  Computer modeling will be used to optimize temperature profile, gas flows, and crystal growth qualities.  50mm single crystal GaN substrates produced by Kyma Technologies will be used as the seed material to ensure thermal and lattice matching.  The combination of this innovative crystal growth technique and the use of GaN seeded growth, has the possibility of reducing the dislocation density to below 10^4 per cm^2 in GaN substrates.  The main emphasis of the Phase II effort will be on obtaining high quality semi-insulating GaN crystals.

A key technology need for CAV and other hypersonic vehicles is durable, lightweight insulation that isolates high temperature, shock, vibration, and acoustic loads.  In Phase I, Ocellus proposed an exceptional new composite material to meet or exceed CAV requirements, called BRIA. Phase I demonstrated feasibility of BRIA and the Phase II effort builds on this work to increase the Technology Readiness Level leading to flight readiness, integration into system design(s) and flight test.  Using the physical properties data, computational model, and new design insights from Phase I, the Phase II effort expands the number and type of BRIA forms and manufacturing, expands testing to environmentally relevant conditions, develops integration methods for BRIA, and develops an enhanced design tool. While the Phase II effort is focused on high temperature insulation for CAV, it is clear that this technology has the potential to impact broader military opportunities such as the recently announced FALCON program which is seeking technologies that can evolve to provide a near-term operational capability (CAV/SLV) and enable development of a reusable HCV and ECAV for the far-term.",

At the end of Phase II, we expect a prototype ROEO to achieve phase noise of -150 dBc/Hz measured at a 10 kHz offset from the center of an 8-12 GHz oscillator. The ROEO's small size, power consumption, and cost will make it suitable for parallel deployment in every row of transmitter/receiver modules of a phased array radar. This distributed oscillator architecture can suppress the equivalent aggregate system phase noise to below -170 dBc/Hz (at 10 kHz offset).",

It was shown that a slit emits from a series of closely spaced individual Taylor cones forming a sheet of colloids. The time-of-flight spectra associated with this sheet electrospray indicate high propulsive efficiency regimes of particular interest to this project.

The development will be supported by modeling efforts by MIT and ionic liquid propellant optimization studies by Yale University.  An array of multiple SCT elements will then be developed, allowing for convenient and precise scaling to the milliNewton range, while maintaining propulsive efficiencies of 70% and specific impulse up to 1000s.

        "abstract": "The US Navy seeks science and technology feasibility research emphasizing innovative imagery and data fusion approaches for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and exploitation (i.e., ISR). Interest includes using data from multiple sensors/systems for comprehensive and timely ISR, supporting operational users in joint force battlespace environments.    We propose to research and develop linear structural modeling methods for fundamentally advancing geospatial fusion. We plan to use the progressive technique to manage and analyze geospatial attributes that affect directly and indirectly latent and manifest battlespace dynamics. Remotely sensed imagery provides vital information for generating these models, capturing many of the primary indicators for exogenous and endogenous causal relations significant to military planning and operations.    We believe this offers a radically different geofusion approach. Among others, it is capable of utilizing the wealth of variables typically obtained when analysts work jointly on multiple tasks as per battlespace CONOPS. Furthermore, by examining complex reciprocal causation, structural relations focuses on true combined battlespace ISR attributes.     There are no known remote sensing geofusion solutions using structural relations, yet the civil and military user communities continue searching for fundamental breakthroughs along these themes, and this bodes well for commercialization of an eventual software solution during Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Precision tracking of airborne targets, atmospheric sensing, and active imaging require high-average-power, high-beam-quality laser sources.  We propose to address these requirements through the use of a diode-side-pumped, multi-pass-slab (MPS), Yb-doped laser where high beam quality is achieved by multi-passing the fundamental mode of the laser resonator several times through the gain region to efficiently extract the stored energy.  The pump sources will be coupled to the Yb-doped crystal using multimode fibers, allowing for flexibility in design and for the laser output power to be scaled to hundreds of Watts by increasing the number of fibers pumping the crystal or the pump power in each fiber.  In our design, heat is removed from the laser crystal by direct contact to heat sinks; flowing liquid contacting the crystal is not required as it is in other schemes, allowing the use of a wide variety of cooling methods.  Cooling to as low as liquid-nitrogen temperatures will be explored to improve the laser efficiency, thermo-optic properties, and reduce the possibility of optical damage when Q-switched.  Thermal lensing, which can cause aberration of the output beam, is kept low by spreading the heat load over a large area and minimizing the distance between the heat load and heat sinks.",

MIMO techniques combined with OFDM and DSSS create a virtually untapped space where anti-jamming, low probability of detection/interception (AJ/LPI/LPD) can be achieved at high data rates.     As part of the Phase II activity, SiComm will build a highly reconfigurable MIMO OFDM prototype unit that will implement the novel architecture identified in Phase I. Field testing of the unit will allow us to demonstrate the superior performance of MIMO systems for military communications. Moreover, it will pave the way for introduction of this technology into the military arena.    Simulations have shown that with the 4x4 MIMO configuration that SiComm intends to build as part of phase II effort, data rates of up to 500 Mbps are attainable. Data security is enhanced due to the three dimensional randomization that occurs in space, frequency and time via MIMO, OFDM and DSSS, respectively.    The proposed prototype will support variable bandwidths from 1 MHz to 25 MHz at the 2.4 GHz band, with MIMO configurations up to 4x4. To ensure robustness, the system will operate with a very low intermediate frequency (VLIF) with the final conversion to baseband performed in the digital domain, thus enabling advanced signal processing filtering techniques to be applied.  Furthermore, the portability of the unit will allow field tests under a host of wireless channel conditions with on board resources available to support a variety of network protocols.",

On the negative side, these features can adversely affect the performance of guided weapon systems tasked to destroy the missile if the weapon has not been designed to recognize and deal with the event.    This effort takes a first-principles physics approach to characterize the observable features of boost-phase transients that is suitable to support intelligence analysis as well as to properly test guided weapon systems.  This approach utilizes state-of-the-disciple flowfield models for low-altitude continuum flowfields using CRUNCH CFDr and high-altitude rarified flowfields using SOCRATES.  These high-fidelity flowfield models will be interfaced to the newly developed optical scene generation code, FLITES, which will be extended to efficiently perform radiance transport calculations through complex transient flowfields from any observer location, optical sensor band, and instance of time.

Efficient, low areal density protection to key structures and optical components from excessive solar (or other source) heating will be afforded by directly attaching the appropriately packaged insulation between hot and cold surfaces via satellite platform structural elements.  The new insulation system is not compression sensitive, or installation sensitive to complex shapes like Multi-Layer Insulation, the current standard for space platforms.  Rapid outgassing of water vapor (the only observable) has been demonstrated for the silica aerogel blanket materials, and water uptake when re-exposed to ambient humidity is comparable to MLI systems (about 0.2% by weight). Direct comparison of the thermal performance of the new insulation systems versus MLI will be made on a Cryotelescope during Phase II at Raytheon.   The thermal conductivity of complex shaped insulated systems in the STSS configuration is expected to be predictable to a much greater degree of confidence for aerogel composites (around 2 mW/m-K in vacuum) compared to installed MLI.  Significant reduction in modeling, design, installation, and production costs for the STSS platform should be realized in this effort.",

The first analyzer will be developed rapidly and provide extractive measurements of singlet oxygen with very high accuracy.  The second instrument will be delivered at the end of the Phase II effort and will be capable of simultaneously measuring multiple species of interest to both the COIL and AGIL including singlet oxygen, water vapor, ground state oxygen, and singlet NCl.  This system will be integrated directly into the COIL test platform to permit in situ measurement of these gases.    In Phase I, we have demonstrated technical feasibility by fabricating an Off-Axis ICOS prototype and quantitatively measuring singlet oxygen density and temperature.  The analyzer was shown to have a minimum detectable singlet oxygen density of 3e13 molecules/cm3, sufficient for COIL applications.  Furthermore, measurements of ground state oxygen and water vapor were demonstrated and theoretical calculations were undertaken to determine an expected sensitivity for singlet NCl.    The proposed analyzer will be the first-ever instrument capable of quantitatively measuring singlet oxygen and will allow COIL researchers to better optimize and understand this important laser.",

Although usable, the Phraselator is highly vulnerable to typical military environment noise resulting in significant loss of accuracy due to the limitations of existing microphone technology.  Therefore the objective of this research project is to develop an alternate microphone that is immune to the surrounding military noise. In Phase I, Mayur Technologies Inc. conducted a feasibility study and was successful in demonstrating a novel  noise-immune bone conduction microphone (here after called BF Mic) with a major breakthrough in the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) improvement and accuracy.  The proposed Phase II is to further develop BF Mic by adding wireless capability and refine the design specifically for Phraselator applications. The functional prototype of wireless BF Mic will be tested both using the civilian and military human subjects. Further, the design will be hardened for military use and batch production.    The wireless BF Mic will be ideal for operational critical applications such as military communications, air traffic controllers, helicopters, and coast guards; and personal productivity enhancement applications such as language translators and speech to text systems.",

Validated Organizational Choice examines the validity status of all claims on which models are built, discovers inter-dependencies among choices, and quantifies the degree to which choices ought to be coupled and harmonized.    Argumentation methods and new decision-theoretic calculations promote validated organizational choice. Argumentation is critical exploration, oriented by the structure and tasks of the organization. Normative calculations quantify the value of information development, anomaly resolution, options development, and coordination.     During Phase I, we integrated Synergia's technology prototypes within the Knowledge Kinetics (K2) enterprise architecture.

We demonstrated choice publication, review by others, and the discovery and quantification of coupling relations over choices.

These companies bring an extensive background in the key areas required for development of a precision delivery, soft landing capability dispenser.  During Phase 1, the design and performance of a precision, soft landing dispenser (PSLD) was evaluated and determined to be very feasible.  To minimize development costs/risks, the PSLD design drew upon proven Air Force systems and on-going Air Force development efforts.  To minimize aircraft qualification costs, the PSLD's external profile and loaded mass properties matches the SEEK EAGLE qualified CBU-104.  The dispenser itself is a new design, configured to allow easy ground access to the dispenser's interior.  To provide near-precision location delivery, PSLD uses Wind Corrected Munition Dispenser (WCMD) tail.  Soft landing is provided by a combination of a proven system of staged parachutes and a crushable section built into the dispenser.  A key feature of the PSLD design/operation is minimizing the time that PSLD descends under parachute.  This feature is important to minimize the effects of low altitude winds and potentially drawing undesired attention to the delivery point.",

Today's ballistic missile warning systems are limited in their ability to detect ballistic launches early in the flight.  Current systems operate in bands where the atmosphere absorbs most of the energy.  These systems are not able to detect the ballistic missiles until they have left the atmosphere, because they cannot discriminate against cloud backgrounds.  This means the systems is unable to detect and track the missile until 35 seconds after launch, thus decreasing the ability of defensive weapon systems to effectively intercept the threat.    DRA has developed a missile detection system that operates in the visible spectrum and does not exhibit the operational limitations.  It is able to effectively detect a ballistic missile while it is still in the atmosphere, allowing defensive weapons systems more time to intercept the threat.  In Phase I, DRA has successfully demonstrated the applicability of the sensor to the ballistic missile detection problem.

A means to extend Test Range coverage is required to support increasingly demanding test scenarios.  A medium altitude platform equipped with the appropriate range instrumentation electronics can effectively perform as a relay to significantly extend coverage.  Existing and legacy systems capable supporting the relay mission are/were either not cost effective, few in numbers, or are simply not maintainable due to obsolete components.  These factors have contributed to their demise.  A new cost effective and accessible solution is required.  Recent advances in UAV and experimental aircraft technologies have contributed to the performance and cost effectiveness of medium altitude endurance airborne platforms. COTS affordable UAV autopilots and high performance homebuilt airframes can be integrated with matured airborne instrumentation electronics to realize an affordable and high performance Test Range instrumentation system.  A network of multiple platforms can further enhance coverage and provide redundancy.  Aerocross Systems has completed a comprehensive technology survey finding highly favorable results.  The availability of an affordable all-composite high performance airframe, proven powerplant capable of extended medium altitude operations, and compact high performance telemetry tracking technology significantly contributed the feasibility of this concept.  Our initial systems design effort further reinforces feasibility.  Proof-of-concept prototyping is next leading to a successful demonstration of a robust operational system ready for production.

        "abstract": "Impact Technologies (Impact), in collaboration with Rolls-Royce (RR), proposes to further develop and demonstrate a prognostic modeling and data processing paradigm for use with drive train components such as gears, bearings, shafts and clutches. Drive train and clutch systems on modern weapons platforms are highly dynamic and have the potential for high load densities due to compact packaging and minimal design margins. There is an extensive amount of functional interaction and dependency between the propulsion and drive systems, which complicates the tracking of faults as they progress to the point of compromising function (failure). Moreover, there exists uncertainty in modeled conditions, properties and measured fault indicators. In order to develop a truly predictive capability under these conditions, Impact proposes to mature its Phase I developed system models, wear and fatigue failure mode progression (prognostic) algorithms, machinery vibration analysis techniques and advanced knowledge fusion methods within a probabilistic framework and apply it to the major driveline components of the Joint Strike Fighter LiftFanT system. The algorithms will account for specific conditions and mechanical uncertainties to determine the existence of faults and, whenever possible with sufficient historical trending, the remaining useful life of the critical, life-limited LiftFanT components. Phase II will focus on development, verification and a transition plan with consideration to the Rolls-Royce drive train development program and its Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) needs. As part of this effort, Impact proposes to provide near real-time monitoring of the JSF LiftFanT test cell (Rig 157) located at Rolls Royce's Indianapolis facility. This monitoring capability will employ advanced vibration techniques to monitor the health and detect incipient faults present in LiftFanT gears and bearings. Upon completion of this proposed Phase II effort, Impact will validate the developed software/hardware package on the available operational data and demonstrate its capabilities using a customized graphical interface. Impact will also evaluate the use of such algorithms for onboard PHM through further enhancements.",

First, utilize our understanding of filled polymer alloy coating systems gained in Phase I to optimize selected performance properties according to stringent criteria for a field-ready conductive repair coating system. Second, design and demonstrate an efficient methodology for scale-up of the final CRC system to multi-gallon volume. Third, adapt the basic CRC formulation to serve applications that currently utilize conductive elastomer and conductive putty. Achievement of these goals necessitates continued highly focused development of the Phase I conductive system. Criteria for consistent electrical conductance, adhesion, fluid resistance, elasticity, versatile hand application, and rapid dry-to-fly impose a multitude of demands on the CRC. Sufficient analysis and thermal, mechanical, physical, and chemical testing will be performed to demonstrate acceptable performance of the coating and gap-filling systems applied by methods suitable for use in the field. Primary among performance requirements is high effective medium electrical conductance. The central deliverable for Phase II CRC will be a proven rugged and versatile conductive coating system for repairing conductive coatings on extended structures and building original continuous conductive films on most types of substrates to impart efficient electromagnetic wave shielding and static charge control.",

        "abstract": "Advanced radar capabilities are crucial to missile defense systems for detection and tracking of incoming missiles.  A new generation of missile defense radars depends on distributed exciters for generation of local-oscillator signals in digital receiver arrays.  One novel design approach for frequency synthesizers for such applications is a hybrid digital synthesis approach.  In Phase 1 of this SBIR program, Hittite analyzed performance characteristics attainable of such hybrid digital synthesizers, and demonstrated the feasibility of meeting stringent requirements for switching speed, phase noise, and spurious signal.  This Phase 2 proposal describes Hittite's approach for demonstration of miniaturized synthesizers meeting those performance objectives.  The proposed synthesizer will have sub-micro-second switching time, state-of-the-art SSB phase noise of -150 dBc/Hz @ 100kHz, miniature size (6\" x 6\" x 0.75\"), and phase synchronicity for precise reproduction of the output frequency after frequency switching.  The synthesizer will operate in the frequency band of 3.5 to 4.4 GHz band for use as the first LO in a ship-board radar system.  The proposed program will be based on novel MMIC chips developed at Hittite leading to significant performance improvement, size reduction and ultimate cost reduction of frequency synthesizers compared to the synthesizers of conventional design",

This phase I SBIR researched a completely new protection concept called aim point biasing (APB) designed specifically for civilian airliner self-protection from MANPAD missiles. APB can provide airliner protection at approximately 6% the cost of the military systems. It has no explosive class B or C components as do some of the proposed protection systems. Our phase I research verified through modeling and simulations that MANPADS missiles will be drawn to the APB infrared sources thereby protecting the aircraft from being impacted at critical flight components such as the engine or wing tanks.

A critical aspect of this development is an integrated approach to interceptor allocation.  A model-based framework for optimizing multi-layer BMDS performance, developing interceptor firing doctrine, and providing for adaptive, real-time interceptor allocation was developed in Phase I.  A key feature of this framework is its ability to adapt interceptor allocation to the performance of system functions (e.g., kill assessment) and the reliability of events (e.g., booster separation) that affect the outcome of the interaction between an attacker and the interceptors allocated to kill that attacker.  The feasibility and utility of this approach were demonstrated in a desktop environment using a two-layer BMDS (notionally boost phase and midcourse layers) with imperfect shoot-look-shoot (SLS) between the layers.  The objective of Phase II is to develop (1) additional interceptor allocation functionality (e.g, by adding a model of midcourse discrimination), (2) an allocation-centric, Monte Carlo simulation, and (3) allocation functionality based on value threatened (versus the attacker-centric objective function used in Phase I).",

        "abstract": "Many important aspects of Departmant of Defense (DoD) research involve systems where plasmas interact in a complex way with neutral gas, intense lasers, or other plasma species.  Two reasons such complex plasma systems are difficult to simulate: (i) the orders of magnitude difference in, for examle, the plasma Debye length and the neutral mean free path or the size of the laser target, and (ii) the important role of  collisions, which are lost in a traditional particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulation.  Parallel computing techniques help address the first issue, and advanced algorithms like direct-simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) help address the second.  DoD researchers therefore need a code that fully implements both parallel computing and DSMC-PIC, but is also easy to use.  Currently no such code is available.  In Phase I, this work demonstrated the capability of the VORPAL code to become a parallel plasma simulation code with the ability to model complex plasmas, including neutral species and collisions.

The objective of this research is to develop a system of   active acoustic absorbers to be integrated within payload fairings to   increase acoustic damping and dissipate low frequency acoustic energy. In   the Phase I feasibility of a system of three acoustic absorbers has been   demonstrated with peak reductions of 9.7 dB using a single mode controller.   New acoustic absorbers have proven effective in lowering global acoustic   levels within a simulator of the Minotaur fairing. These absorbers provide   the ability to target multiple frequencies within the volume while   maintaining effective performance through robust control design. The Phase   II will pursue advanced development of this absorber, lowering overall   weight to below 2% of the payload allowance, while increasing structural   integrity to make this system a viable option for launch applications. The   system will progress through several generations of design and testing, and   will be evaluated on both fairing simulators and a Peacekeeper-based   sandwich composite fairing at AFRL. The final objective of this Phase II   will be the design, fabrication and delivery of a system that could be   tested under launch conditions.",

Due to the clutter characteristics, challenges exist for performing space-time adaptive processing (STAP) to separate slowly moving targets from interference.  Our Phase I effort defined a first order candidate system design, studied STAP performance and demonstrated a new approach to compensate for clutter nonstationarity in bistatic SBR scenarios. This approach overcomes some of the deficiencies of previously published techniques, including 1) the ability to align both slope and value of nonlinear Doppler-angle contours  2) adaptivity to non-clutter interference without applying a fixed range-dependent transformation 3) the ability to simultaneously compensate for different range dependencies in  higher range and Doppler ambiguities 4) compensation for terrain height variations using DTED and 5) a framework that naturally accommodates knowledge-aided STAP techniques.    The new approach based on an expectation-maximization algorithm for covariance estimation was found to outperform standard STAP as well as Doppler warping in several different bistatic SBR scenarios.  Our Phase II effort will refine the technique to produce a STAP procedure robust to a variety of environmental conditions and real world effects.",

The objective of this SBIR is to minimize the DC power consumption in mmW LNAs through the use of MHEMT device technology and innovative circuit design techniques.  In particular, the program focus is on the development of very low DC power consumption MHEMT MMIC low noise amplifiers in the frequency range between 35 and 54 GHz for application in space based receivers operating in the MILSATCOM bands.  During Phase I extensive device measurements were carried out on devices from two foundry MHEMT processes.  Device models were used to conduct a design trade study to assess the tradeoff between bandwidth and power dissipation for mmW LNAs.  A 4% bandwidth amplifier at 50 GHz was designed featuring a DC dissipation of 5 mW, gain of 25 dB and noise figure of 2.1 dB.  A similar wideband LNA (35-54 GHz) required a 72% higher power dissipation of 8.6 mW.  This demonstrates that substantial power savings can be achieved in narrow band designs.",

Currently evolving missile designs, for example the Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM), are moving towards higher pressures, higher and longer duration aeroheat temperatures, and increased maneuverability.  Future case designs will require materials exhibiting higher specific strength and stiffness than steels can provide.  The objective of this Phase II effort is to continue the development of a rocket motor case design using a fiber reinforced  aluminum (FRA) metal matrix composite (MMC) material which has over twice the specific strength of D6AC steel.  In Phase I, Touchstone Research Laboratory (Touchstone) teamed with Alliant Techsystems (ATK) Tactical Systems Company to demonstrate the feasibility of designing an AMRAAM style rocket motor case out of FRA material.  During Phase I, a trade study demonstrated a weight reduction of over 38% for FRA compared to the baseline case design without a significant reduction in internal volume for propellant.  The Phase II effort will involve Touchstone and ATK teaming up again in order to advance this technology to the level required for producing a subscale rocket motor case using this new material.",

Developments present enormous challenges to today's design and development methods, processes, and tools.  Large system developers employ a spectrum of automated tools in each system development life cycle phase.  Each tool has a data representation and data storage mechanism and, usually, no substantial interoperability exists between tools at the semantic level even for exchanging similar data structures.  Efficient cross domain or cross system essential data sharing is difficult at best.  The problems also significantly hinder using essential product assets such as source code, executables, and software components within or across complex developments.  This SBIR seeks to overcome these difficulties by research and development of a comprehensive repository capability to efficiently store, manage, use, and share such data and assets across domains and system developments.  Development will include a data/asset schema, repository, user interfaces, processes and systems to meet the need.",

In such systems, reliable target tracking is impossible without clutter rejection down to/below the level of sensor noise. In Phase I we developed novel parametric and nonparametric spatial-temporal techniques for clutter rejection and image stabilization as well as clutter simulation tools for simulation of backgrounds for various conditions. As we have demonstrated in Phase I, our spatial-temporal methods are particularly efficient for target detection/tracking in difficult scenarios when spatial-only filters completely fail. The Phase II proposal is geared towards improving performance of the clutter filtering and jitter compensation algorithms; development of a bank of clutter suppression/stabilization filters with outlier compensation and an adaptive reconfigurable architecture; target detection/tracking algorithms; and testing/demonstrating the capabilities of the developed technology in realistic environments. The developed software imbedded into a GUI interface will constitute a powerful tool for the optimization of operational target detection/tracking systems in conditions of interest.

The SWA will accept 1 to several waveguide inputs operating at their full transport capacity, typically many 100s MW each for WR650, and will illuminate arbitrarily wide, flat or curved surfaces with multiple phase-locked apertures that occupy virtually the entire aperture area.  Air breakdown is mitigated owing to relatively uniform illumination of the large aperture.  Aperture efficiency is excellent, exceeding 65% in initial studies, and return loss low, less than -20 dB.  Amplitude taper across the aperture to mitigate side-lobes is straightforward, if desired.   Depth perpendicular to the aperture is small, less than a free space wavelength.    Development and technology demonstration will proceed via stepped stages that include computational geometry optimization, low power array characterization, testing with munition mockup, and tech demo at full 1.2 GW peak power with multiple waveguide drives.  The many attributes of the scaleable SWA make it an ideal antenna for any narrowband GW source driven by 1 or more waveguides operating in fundamental TE01 mode.",

The second case is the shipyard that wishes to migrate to a new CPC compliant parts catalog and material system, but also has the requirement to collaborate with other shipyards, suppliers, and subcontractors.   This project will create an integrated environment that will build upon the research conducted during Phase I and utilizing the ISEC-EC Shipbuilding/Supplier Data Element Dictionary (DED), the ISEC-EC Shipbuilding/Supplier Taxonomy developed under previous NSRP projects, as well as the ISE III CPC project now in progress.    The new products developed during this project will be marketed to the U.S. and global shipbuilding industry and supported as standard products.",

Specifically, the technology must be capable of detecting small cracks or delaminations in an efficient, reliable, and cost effective way, providing useful information to aid in evaluating reliability and/or remaining lifetime of the component. To address the problem of flaw detection in composites, MetroLaser is currently developing Multiple Beam Laser Doppler Vibrometry (MB-LDV) predicated on the observation that changes in the surface vibrational pattern of the test subject reveal underlying structural defects within the material bulk. Measurement and analysis of the surface velocity spectrum by MB-LDV, therefore, serves to reveal the presence of subsurface material irregularities associated typically with disbonds and delaminations. This instrument would substantially increase inspection rates and provide a framework for the practical implementation of a portable, field-ready instrument that addresses inherent limitations in current scanning LDV systems.

Latencies for these systems range from tens of seconds down to sub-seconds for real-time and near-real-time elements of the system. To address these timing constraints, the Phase II effort will implement techniques that reduce latencies and bandwidth congestion for publish/subscribe environments by implementing Adaptive Routing algorithms and implementing Hierarchical Grid software components in support of the scalable management of subscriptions. Analysis has shown that use of the Adaptive Routing algorithms can result in over a 50% reduction in utilized bandwidth. Analysis of the Hierarchical Grid algorithms has shown the potential for order of magnitude improvement over brute force subscription matching methods.

Sanders Infrared Counter Measure (SICM) system is proposed for installation on commercial airliners and legacy military aircraft for protection of aircraft and personnel, during take-off, low-level flight, and landing situations. The SICM uses infrared deceptive jamming, causing MANPAD missiles to veer off course with wide miss distances without need for a missile warning system. SICM is based on low cost, proven technology, which is non-intrusive to aircraft structural integrity. The SICM is effective against single or multiple launched MANPADS available to terrorist factions, including the ubiquitous SA-7, SA-14, SA-16, SA-18, and Stinger heat seeking missiles. The SICM includes dual-band infrared (DBIR) deceptive jammers to effectively counter first generation and advanced MANPADS missiles. Compact DBIR jammers are retractable wingtip and tail-tip mounted to provide hyper-spherical coverage. Aircraft with wingspans of 50 to over 200 feet can be protected by SICM. Large aircraft (e.g., B-737 up to B-747) use combined wingtip and tail-tip mounted DBIR jammers for maximum effectiveness. Retractable DBIR jammers improve in-flight fuel savings dramatically compared to laser based systems by eliminating drag at cruise altitudes.",

        "abstract": "Compared to conventional radars, distributed aperture radars (DAR\u00a1_s) have the potential to provide significantly improved detection, tracking and discrimination performance in severe EMI and clutter environments.  Realizing this greater capability will require unique waveform selection and signal processing approaches.  The objectives of this research project are:   (1) to complete the development and validation of a computer simulation capability that will permit the analysis of these waveforms and interference rejection algorithms for DAR systems and   (2) to experimentally validate the EMI simulation of Phase I.  For example, DAR\u00a1_s can potentially provide significantly improved target tracking accuracy because of the large baseline between the various apertures.  The resulting angular resolution can be orders of magnitude better than the resolution of a monolithic system (single large radar).  The same angular resolution can provide improved interference rejection.  In Phase I, a high-fidelity sensor simulation was developed and was employed to investigate EMI rejection for various DAR concepts.  A waveform/processing approach using simultaneous orthogonal waveforms was shown to effectively reject EMI from all angles.  Phase II will extend that simulation capability to investigate adaptive processing for rejection of interference in EMI, clutter and joint EMI/clutter environments.     The ability of orthogonal waveforms and adaptive processing to reject EMI near the target will be demonstrated by a \u00a1\u00b0rooftop\u00a1\u00b1 experiment. This experiment will be performed at the Air Force Research Laboratory\u00a1_s Rome Research Site (AFRL/RRS) using their facilities where appropriate to achieve our objectives in a cost-effective manner.

Current ABL technology demonstration systems and subsystems, such as the ABL-Pressure Recovery Subsystem (ABL-PRS), use heavier materials such as titanium. Weight reductions using advanced composite materials can be substantial, with estimates of over 5,000 pounds savings for the ABL-PRS alone. A key problem in the wide-spread insertion of composites in the man-rated ABL system platform is the lack of data base and thus very conservative design knockdown factors used for composites to ensure positive design margins are achieved on these components for uncertainties such as impact resistance due to mechanical abuse during installation and maintenance of composite components.  In the Phase I study, the feasibility of using tough, impact resistant composite materials and a vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) low cost manufacturing process were demonstrated for lightweight, low cost ABL composite components in subscale tests. High strain-to-failure carbon fiber reinforced composites were used as surface laminates to provide impact resistance with high strength and modulus carbon fiber reinforced resin matrix composite materials for VARTM manufacturing processes. Mechanical property tests demonstrated that this concept will decrease the design knockdown factors associated with impact damage during installation and maintenance operations for ABL-PRS structural components. Subscale test articles were fabricated using a VARTM process to demonstrate a unitized-construction ABL-PRS subscale component.  A Phase II program is proposed to develop and demonstrate full-scale prototype ABL-PRS components using tough, impact resistant composite materials and the VARTM manufacturing process for ABL-PRS components.",

The innovative low cost ejector / diffuser system would be used for economically producing a high altitude simulation in a very long pressure chamber at HHSTT. The unique and challenging requirement here is that the operational pressure vessel total length will be thousands of feet and must be removable. The concept is low cost in that the prime movers (ejector motive fluid) are surplus turbojet engines that are available to the USAF at no cost. The maintenance costs would be minimal since the USAF has their own flight trained turbojet engine mechanics and support system. The concept would lay the groundwork for a variable pressure enclosure over the Holloman high-speed test track to simulate pressures corresponding from local ambient altitude up to altitudes of 100,000 feet. The requirement is that this very large vacuum vessel must be evacuated in a few hours time in order for a proposed sled test to be conducted economically. The proposed system would consist of portable \"pressure vessel\" segments that can be attached together to form a very long pressure vessel. The very long pressure vessel would then be connected to multiple regulated suction ports connected to a plenum, which is then connected to the ejector diffuser system. The innovative ejector / diffuser system proposed will be very energy efficient and easily maintainable. In addition, a technique to allow a sled to enter and exit the pressure vessel, while the sled is traveling at velocities up to 10,000 feet per second, without allowing changes in the pressure within the vessel has been conceptually developed in phase I.  The prototype proposed herein would demonstrate the concept developed in phase I. The innovative design will allow the pressure vessel to maintain different pressures in different parts of the vessel to simulate flight from lower to higher, or higher to lower altitudes. This capability would be invaluable for air-breathing propulsion system development and testing.",

We showed that our technology allows many discrimination tasks to be  accomplished with lower signal-to-noise ratios and significantly reduced   dwells relative to traditional processing, and our results strongly   indicate that we can discriminate any decoy but a properly deployed   realistic shell of a reentry vehicle.  During Phase II, we propose to   refine and automate the algorithms developed in Phase I and, in cooperation  with Boeing Missile Defense Systems, to demonstrate their performance  on real radar data and validated simulations.

        "abstract": "Card-to-backplane optical interconnects are required for high-speed opto-electronic packaged computing systems for military target identification, missile interception, and fast access to intelligent database. Present method of waveguide interconnection employs 90\u00b0 out of plane turn using 45\u00b0 etched waveguide mirror. Such approach greatly increases cost of manufacture and degrades backplane reliability. Furthermore, the presence of such local waveguide termination consumes optical power even when the card is not plugged in at the interconnect location. New Span Opto-Technology Inc. proposes an array waveguide evanescent coupler for card-to-backplane optical interconnection. Feasibility demonstrated in Phase I, the new coupler facilitates easy coupling between card and backplane waveguides through the use of an auto-alignment coupler hardware. It eliminates the problems of 90\u00b0 out of plane turn and local waveguide termination. Without card plug-in there is no optical energy consumption at the connector location. With card plugged-in the card-to-backplane coupling efficiency can be adjusted. The maturization of the coupler ribbon and coupler hardware at low cost in Phase II will be a milestone development to near-term commercial implementation of high-speed optical data bus. High-speed optical bus lines will be demonstrated in Phase II along with the exploration of a high-density stacked multi-board vertical optical interconnect system.",

These aptly-named \"transreflectors\" and \"twistreflectors\" are especially suitable in the design of compact and efficient antenna configurations for airborne platforms.  During Phase I of this effort, SARA conceived, analyzed, and numerically-modeled several novel trans/twistreflector combinations for potential applications to airborne HPM platforms, including UCAVs and munitions, among others.  The most promising configuration we found was for a highly-innovative antenna we call the Flat-Aperture Waveguide Sidewall-Emitting Twistreflector, or \"FAWSET.\"  A cylindrical conformal version of the FAWSET should be especially suitable for integration into an HPM-based munition. In that application, the FAWSET should provide a relatively large circumferential aperture with sufficiently-uniform illumination such that even P > 1 GW radiated pulses do not trigger surface-flashover or air-breakdown.  By leveraging internal polarization-manipulation, the FAWSET delivers a large aperture with only a modest depth, freeing precious space within the munition for use by the HPM source, pulsed-power, prime power, and other essential subsystems.  SARA proposes here to design, build, and demonstrate the successful operation, at peak power levels exceeding 1 GW, of a prototype FAWSET antenna compatible with a munition-type airborne HPM platform.",

        "abstract": "The Laser Beamrider Strobe Countermeasures (LBRSC) system is designed to address a set of threat missiles using laser beamrider guidance. The LBRSC automatically detects the laser from the beamrider missile launcher unit, and generates a directed optical beam sufficient to temporally flash blind the launcher unit operator, causing the missile to miss the target.  The LBRSC uses a non-lethal eye safe flash strobe that is reusable and rechargeable on the aircraft during operation for employment against multiple missile attacks. The LBRSC, contrasted with conventional non-directed expendable flares, avoids temporarily blinding friendly personnel in adjacent aircraft or on the ground and does not illuminate the target (platform being protected) or other friendly platforms or ground personnel. The rapid, automatic re-charging feature for the LBRSC minimizes the platforms on-board storage and logistic re-supply requirements for expendable flares. The LBRSC is totally automatic and autonomous and requires no pilot or crewmember involvement or decision. The LBRSC has multiple roles on the aircraft, with its manual steering feature, it can be employed as a continuously illuminating searchlight for landing areas, search and rescue operations, identifying targets for friendly ground forces or as a countermeasure against other threats, such as RPG's and small arms fire.",

Existing systems, however, are clumsy to use because they require two separate antennas for the transmit and receive channels. Because the antennas are large, it is challenging to mount both of them onto a HMMWV. What is needed is a UWB radar that will allow the use of a single antenna for both transmit and receive. To make the UWB radar system more compact, we propose building an entire UWB radar system using a single Impulse Radiating Antenna along with a customized high-voltage UWB directional coupler. We will also use a commercially available high-voltage solid state source. We will acquire the data with a fast single-shot oscilloscope. Finally, we will use a laptop computer running LabVIEW software to drive the entire system, and to deconvolve the system response from the raw data in real time.

        "abstract": "The purpose of this Phase-II effort is to develop filtered cathodic arc plasma deposition (FCAPD) for applying multi-layer, highly reflective optical coatings to extremely light-weight and large membrane mirrors for space and high-altitude-based high-energy laser applications where glass mirrors are not practical. FCAPD coatings are ideal for this application because the deposition ions have higher energy and thus produce denser films with fewer voids that are less susceptible to changes in environmental conditions and have better adhesion than films produced using other methods. In addition, the intrinsic film stress of FCAPD films can be controlled during deposition, which is critical to controlling the shape of the membrane mirror. To maximize the probability of success, a step-wise approach will be used where the FCAPD process will first be developed on coupon-sized membrane substrates to achieve film thickness and stress control. Once this is achieved, the process will be scaled-up to a ~10 cm diameter membrane mirror and then to an actual 0.25 m diameter prototype. Theoretical calculations will also be performed to determine the effect of substrate heating and radiation pressure on the shape and performance of the mirror system.",

These structures were shown in phase I to be very effective in absorbing energy thereby mitigating air blast and underwater shock loading, and are adaptable to protecting National infrastructure.  The phase II effort has been coordinated with the Bureau of Reclamation (BoR) who is responsible for dam safety.  Small-scale models of a generic concrete arch-type dam will be built to assess their vulnerability, and to demonstrate how the vulnerability can be overcome by a protective structure.  The detailed protective structure design developed for ease of installation can be applied to protect other types of infrastructure such as spillway gates, dry docks, and bridges against terrorist attack.  It is envisioned that by using low-cost structural steel construction, protective structure can be produced commercially at low cost to benefit ratio.",

In Phase I, GateChange developed a cycle-accurate simulator of the Dynamic-Routing Array Processor (DRAP) and demonstrated the exceptional security (1.08x10901 encryption permutations) and performance of this architecture.  The simulator was modeled on the actual silicon process selected for Phase II prototypes (design is 40% complete), insuring success in the ultimate device fabrication.  DRAP consists of an array of processor cores and supporting, peripheral functions.  Optimized communication paths between these elements are established in real-time, allowing highly efficient use and re-use of these resources.  Additionally, DRAP implements variable-length, multi-dimensional hardware encryption chains that provide custom encryption for every individual word of code/data, protecting the software and overall system.  DRAP can simultaneously operate as a streaming encryption/decryption engine, independent of the processor cores.    DRAP's high-level (C/C++) design methodology eliminates cumbersome hardware description level designs, dramatically reducing development cycles.  Development can be compartmentalized; different design teams can securely design for separate or even overlapping sections of the array.  Furthermore, system life can be extended through in-field upgrades.  DRAP's size, power, cost, high-performance, ease-of-use and security features create an excellent platform for a wide range of applications.",

The objective of this research project is to continue development of new package stacking and interposer interconnect that allows 3-dimensional arrangement of programmable logic.  This will result in a 4-fold increase in processing elements in a single seeker electronics board.  In Phase I, feasibility of novel interconnect and stacking of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) was demonstrated. Package stacking and the new array interconnect avoids the added weight, added signal latencies, signal integrity problems and reliability risks associated with the use of multiple boards and large connectors. Distributing signal routing to separate stacked interconnect elements reduces the complexity of any single element allowing these separate elements to be developed faster with higher yields and lower costs. Phase II will produce prototype hardware of the modular stacked package including the advanced distributed interconnect design developed in Phase I and testing of the hardware.  Through a subcontract from Tessera, Lockheed Martin will provide schematic design support, test support and will contribute to the project the use of existing test facilities and hardware developed with Lockheed Martin resources.",

MDA has a large collection of legacy software and algorithms in a variety of programming languages. These algorithms are useful throughout MDA, yet rewriting code is costly and risky. In a Phase I SBIR, we used eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and ontologies to develop a framework for language translation. We propose to complete the instantiation of our prototype framework, which will reduce the resources required to reuse legacy software by translating from original languages to a variety of programming languages. The heart of the framework is the definition of an abstract language, CodeML (Code Markup Language) written in OWL (Web Ontology Language) format. After translating legacy code into CodeML as an intermediate step, the framework can extract and export a numerical algorithm's semantics, analyze it for precision and correctness and export it to mathematical analysis programs using XML technologies. MDA can then share algorithms and tools across platforms. We propose a repository to store the CodeML representation with an intelligent search capability using Semantic Web technology.",

The Hybrid Kinetic method is a combination of Rela-tivistic Maxwell-Vlasov, Poisson-Boltzmann and Mixed-Collisional solvers. The core of the kinetic method is specifically designed to capture self-consistent evolution of strongly non-equilibrated gas and plasma flows with sharp gradients. Our approach combines unstructured adaptive grids for fine spatial resolution, a PIC-Vlasov hybrid for guaranteed velocity space coverage, a Boltzmann solver to treat various elastic and inelastic collisions, and a kinetic-fluid interface for mixed-collisional flows. The method has the following distinct features: adaptive high resolution mesh in space; adaptive time stepping; automatic tracking of discontinuities and regions of high spatial gradients; non-orthogonal adaptive elements to allow complex device geometry and large domains; low numerical noise and diffusion particle-mesh combination; high order finite-volume schemes for fields; non-Monte-Carlo procedures for accurate treatment of various collisions on the velocity grid; a unique interface con-necting non-equilibrated kinetic and equilibrated fluid regions; use of analytical solutions for trajecto-ries and collisions to assure stability and accuracy. The parallel hybrid code will be written with a transparent interface for easy porting with other codes, thus complementing non-kinetic techniques.",

Development of robust, necessarily complex discrimination algorithms demands a high-fidelity EO/RF signature generation capability which we propose to develop, based on the results of our Phase 1 effort.    In particular, we propose to advance the state-of-the art in three important aspects of signature generation for these objects:  spanning the space of off-nominal shapes, predicting their surface temperatures and modeling the dynamics during deployment. The signature package will produce representative signature ensembles, consistent with the fundamentally probabilistic nature of the shape, size and dynamics of off-nominal countermeasures and debris.  It will produce fully correlated Vis-IR and RF signatures, to support a very broad range of potential applications including data fusion.  We believe the commercial market for this technology includes the space-launch community, for whom the detection and characterization of off-nominal objects and general debris is a matter of growing concern.

Of particular importance in addressing this situation are new tech-nologies to measure the intent of the groups of people in riot situations, and at check-points/road-blocks, so as to determine those with commitment to harm.    Motivated by the above notion SARA is pleased to offer the Determinator system, which provides an acoustic deterrent with the potential capability to sort the bad guys from the not so bad guys, and the not so bad guys from the good guys. A man portable Phase I prototype has demonstrated the capabilities of producing a range of effects from auditory pain to warning, with safe acoustic levels. SARA proposes to refine the Phase I prototype through actual Marine Corps evaluations in the Phase II effort, producing, as an end product, a set of rugged deployable prototypes for full evaluations.",

A single Control Station would receive all the intruder data from each sensor and merge this information onto a single display.  Actual field tests using a single radar without the benefit of data from multiple sensors have resulted in reliable detection of various size targets of opportunity. This proposed project would provide the additional algorithm development to combine the overlapping intruder data from multiple independent sensors into a single target image. The system would classify objects based on course, speed, and estimated size.     The key to success of the overall program will be the development of the data fusion algorithms that combine the detection and tracking information from multiple sensors, and the reduction in false alarms caused by wave motion.

They will improve the detection capabilities in all major MDA infrared systems either as separate arrays or when used together with current mid-wavelength (MWIR) or long wavelength (LWIR) infrared systems. Building on our current expertise, the first material system to be developed in this program will be a VLWIR detector based on HgCdTe alloys. Our current technology used for MWIR and LWIR detectors will be extended towards longer wavelengths. Improved material quality, new design architectures and new fabrication techniques will contribute to the success of this development effort. We also propose to develop HgTe/CdTe superlattice systems since they possess a number of desirable properties over both alloy HgCdTe and QWIP devices in the VLWIR region.

During our earlier Phase I effort, we were successful in demonstrating that cracks could be imaged quickly and with high resolution using this technique.    Present inspection methods employ an ultrasonic testing transducer that is slowly rotated around a fastener to develop a map of the full 360 degree region.  Since a focused beam transducer is used, only a single pencil-point region is checked at a time, so the process takes minutes per fastener.  These devices also require extensive training. The combination of long inspection times and high operator skill requirements limits the overall probability of detection of any cracks or flaws. Eddy current systems are effective but only for near surface anomalies.    In contrast, the ultrasound camera shows deeper cracks than what eddy currents can generate. The ultrasound camera system will generate real time, high resolution images of subsurface cracks on an LCD or monitor. The low cost system will be easy to use and capable of rapid inspection, covering a fastener in well under one minute.",

Experimental evaluations will include chemical compatibility with the baseline coatings and substrate materials, adherence, long term stability, and moisture and salt fog resistance. Evaluation will also include mechanical testing at ambient temperature before and after thermal cycling and electrical testing at ambient and elevated temperatures in air. A full-scale component or appropriate subcomponent demonstration will be conducted to validate the specific repair coatings developed for each application. Repair coating kits will be developed for each system to aid in the transfer of the repair coating technology to the end users.",

        "abstract": "The events of 11 September 2001 and the weeks that followed have changed standard perceptions and priorities relative to threats of terrorism conducted with conventional, biological and possibly other weapons of mass destruction.  These events have highlighted the need for new technologies to meet these challenges, providing a protective shield to military personnel, first responders and the general public. The specific goals of this proposed project is to develop a portable air sterilizer capable of protecting against chemical and biological attacks. At the end of this phase II, it is envisioned that a small, lightweight air cleaner capable of dealing with chemical and biological releases will be designed using non thermal plasma as a mechanism to facilitate biological and chemical destruction.   Current force protection relies upon trapping technology which can often concentrate a problem as opposed to remediating a situation after a release. The proposed technology is an active response to chemical and biological threats. In phase I, the proof of concept was demonstrated. In phase II we will scale the unit up to a viable engineering system and test against a variety of toxic compounds and pathogens.",

Two programs selected as test beds for the code are Electromagnetic Control of High-Heat Flux Spray Impingement Boiling Under Microgravity at West Virginia University and the in-house program on Microgravity Spray Cooling at AFRL. These programs will provide critical ground-based and flight data needed to calibrate and validate the simulation code. In exchange, the tool can offer direct benefit to these programs by:    1. Helping evaluate and down-select proposed designs.   2. Aiding in the reduction and interpretation of experimental results.  3. Optimizing the operating parameters   4. Extrapolating to micro-gravity conditions  5.

The optimal solution to this problem would be a hot primary structure capable of supporting the required loads at elevated temperature while also providing the necessary thermal protection to the primary vehicle structure.   Experimental results from the NASP program indicated that titanium matrix composites (TMCs) possessed the necessary thermomechanical properties for this application. However, the processing methods at that time suffered from both prohibitive costs and reliability problems.    During the latter half of the 1990's, FMW developed a low-cost, powder-based processing method for producing high-quality TMC components. During the Phase I SBIR, FMW successfully brazed TMC face sheets to a titanium honeycomb, thereby demonstrating the potential of these materials for use as hot primary structures. In the program described herein, FMW, in conjunction with Boeing, proposes the fabrication and testing of a full-scale control surface selected from the current generation of hypersonic air vehicles.",

We propose the Phase II development of an innovative gas path sensor technology for spatially resolved measurements of the key combustion parameters: temperature, CO concentration, H2O concentration, and CO2 concentration.  Passive optical probes are arrayed to collect the emitted radiation over different views of the hot gas path.  Concentrations and temperatures are determined by spectral analysis of the emitted radiation and spatial profiles are determined by comparing the values for differing views.   This approach provides a general-purpose real-time temperature and chemical species sensing capability.  Probes can be inserted in the combustor, at the turbine inlet, in the augmenter, or at the engine exit with application as an engine development diagnostic tool, and ultimately, as a sensor for real-time active control.  The sensor feasibility has already been demonstrated in the Phase I research.  In Phase II, a prototype sensor will be developed and used for diagnosing completeness of combustion and temperature in a test combustor. Phase III products will include test stand diagnostic instrumentation and on-engine sensors.",

This project aims to develop a commercial Unified Flow Solver (UFS) that automatically switches between and couples the continuum-fluid-dynamics and kinetic solvers needed for these two regimes. The UFS will maximize computational efficiency, and ensure numerical accuracy, stability, and robustness by employing intelligent domain decomposition algorithms and solution-adaptive mesh refinement. The Direct Numerical Solver (DNS) of the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) developed and demonstrated in Phase I will be used in regions of moderate and high local Knudsen number, while a Navier-Stokes Solver will be used elsewhere. DNS offers unique advantages compared to DSMC methods for building hybrid codes. Kinetic schemes of gas dynamics will also be used to facilitate automatic domain decomposition for coupling the BTE and Navier-Stokes solvers. In the Knudsen layers, the grid size will be smaller than the characteristic mean free path while in the continuum domains it will be much larger than the mean free path. The advantages of the UFS methodology will be demonstrated for several actual aerospace, material processing, and micro-fluidics problems.",

The proposed C-SiC component design has a significantly higher operation temperature (3700 \u00b0F) with extended operational duty times. The ceramic matrix composite design proposed here will have a thrust capability of 1000 lbf (pound force), also significantly greater than the current state of the art design.  The added thrust capability will enable higher performance advanced designs, applicable to GMD / KEI missile programs employing liquid/gel DACS systems, including THAAD.

The proposed approach is an innovative Supercharged Injected 60 degree V-twin uniflow four-cycle design of 450cc cylinder capacity designated (SIV-2225). Unlike commercial off the shelf conversions, the proposed SIV-2225 overcomes small scale thermal and specific volume deficiencies by means of positive displacement built-in supercharge with high adiabatic and trapping efficiency resulting in scavenge air delivery ratios approaching 2:1.  High thermal and combustion efficiencies are achieved by doubling the trapping volume prior to the compression stroke thereby significantly reducing the effective surface/volume ratio and associated heat losses.  Internal pumping losses are kept to minimum due to the maximum port time area associated with uniflow sleeve design, which, affords up to 85% of the cylinder circumference for breathing. This equates to 4 times the breathing capacity when compared to overhead poppet valve designs. As a result this 4-cycle uniflow sleeve valve engine has a breathing capacity well beyond the 12,000 RPM range. In addition, the low profile cylinder head retains complete freedom of the combustion chamber, which is an invaluable feature when optimizing the required heavy fuel combustion system.",

The first ALCAL will be mounted in the aperture stop of the wide FOV lens for agile wavefront correction to sharpen the image in the local 20 degrees field where the target has been detected.  The second ALCAL, mounted between lens and image plane together with the aperture stop corrector, will provide zooming of the target image.

As sensor and display capabilities are improved, the number of electrical signals needed to transcieve information increases, the density of the HVI assembly grows, resulting in an increase in cable diameter, stiffness and weight. This in turn affects the pilot's head movement and fatigue.  We propose to convert most of the signal lines within the cable from conventional copper wire cables and electrical contacts to optical fiber and shuttered termini.

The lasers produced during Phase II will be evaluated in a terahertz imaging system designed and assembled during Phase I.  Phase I also demonstrated, for the first time, that it was possible to grow an MOCVD terahertz QC laser epitaxial wafer structure identical to the MBE-grown structure used by MIT to produce the first US terahertz QC laser last year.  During Phase II, several candidate terahertz laser epitaxial structures will be designed, grown, processed, evaluated, and incorporated into a terahertz imaging system.  The epitaxial layer structure designs will be carried out at the University of Illinois, and epitaxial wafer growth, wafer processing, laser fabrication and evaluation will be carried out at Spire.

Completion of this new and innovative approach will help operational forces meet the Air Force's goal of extending time on wing for turbine engine rotating components and reduce life-cycle costs while assuring the safety of air crew and enhancing mission readiness.  It will facilitate condition based maintenance made possible by prognostics type logistical tools.  Furthermore, when field conditions call for enhanced performance of turbine engines beyond rated power, life impact analysis data will be available nearly real-time to show true impact on component life and mission readiness.",

        "abstract": "Based on the hidden, unique opcode invention made and demonstrated in Phase I and its integration with CyberDog Communications Inc Object Level Firewall(OLF) authentication, key management and encryption technology, Accord Solutions Inc proposes to prototype the Reconfigurable Architecture for Software Protection (RASP) System. The RASP System provides an extremely strong level of cryptographic protection from quantum and supercomputer brute force attacks, preventing compromise of high value HPC binary executables through reverse engineering. In addition, there is low impact on HPC software development, with  minimal impact on typical HPC working sets, with slight latency increases for disk IO and interprocessor communication. The RASP system uniquely distributes a single binary executable to each processor authenticated to execute it. Authentication by the OLF provides assurance that access is made only by validated processors. Data input and output is likewise protected, but with different keys, ensuring that no user can access the binary executable for reverse engineering exploitation. Parallel processing uses a different set of RASP keys to protect interprocessor communication. The Phase II effort produces three prototypes: purely software, FPGA accelerated software and a printed circuit board. Each of these prototypes will be demonstrated (single, parallel and staged) using an instrumented test bed.",

        "abstract": "Due to environmental control requirements, the sources of separator materials for existing Ni-H2 batteries are discontinuing that business.  During Phase I of this project, AMS developed an advanced battery separator technology that addresses this issue.  Specifically, AMS developed a high-performance battery separator that can replace the current Ni-H2 separator without major cell design changes.  Using a polyethylene polymer and benign fillers, AMS employed an environmentally friendly process to develop prototype material.  These samples have been evaluated by military and commercial Ni-H2 battery manufacturers and have been judged to be an improved potential replacement for their batteries.  These manufacturers have given AMS detailed material specifications for their applications, virtually all of which have already been met.  Phase II will involve streamlining the manufacturing process; testing variations of the separator in actual military and commercial battery cells; receiving feedback from the participating battery manufacturers/testers; and further optimizing the formulation and process steps as necessary.  The result will be that the necessary engineering and scientific steps will be completed to allow for moving from prototypes to pilot runs.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this program is to develop manufacturing technologies/methods that will allow for the fabrication of advanced regenerators made from erbium-based, intermetallic compounds for application in space-based cryocoolers.  These regenerators, when used as a replacement for Pb-powder regenerators, will result in an increase in efficiency of cryocoolers by a factor of 3-4.  When used as a replacement for Er-based powder regenerators for the 4\u00b0K cryocoolers, an increase in efficiency by factors of 10-20 can be expected.   Thus, the Er-based micro-channel regenerators are expected to reduce power requirements as well as the overall size and weight of cryocoolers.  In addition, the Er-alloys are harder than lead making them easier to handle, less prone to cold welding, and removing problems of toxicity.  Mezzo initially evaluated three fabrication methods under this program:  high aspect ratio LIGA molds being used to simultaneously electro discharge machine (EDM) tens of thousands of holes (LIGA-EDM), direct molding using LIGA molds, and molding using a binder/ErPr system followed by a burnout and sintering process.  Tests carried out under this program have shown the feasibility of fabrication of high performance regenerators using various micromanufacturing methods.  With further development, this program should lead to substantial improvements in cryocooler performance.",

No single material has been identified that is likely to directly substitute for beryllium due to its unique characteristics.  Composites, both polymer and metal matrix, have unique characteristics and come the closest to providing a single material substitute for beryllium; but \"Hybrid Composites\" provide the best alternative to beryllium. The Hybrid Composites approach uses multi-constituent composite materials to replace beryllium for structures, optics, and electronics thermal management applications based on combinations of reinforcements, matrices, and integrated electrical materials. In the Phase I study, the feasibility of using the Hybrid Composites design approach for beryllium replacement was successfully demonstrated analytically and design methodologies were defined for EKV components for three different functional applications-structural, electronic thermal management, and optical. The Phase II program objective will be to develop and demonstrate low cost, producible, and high performance Hybrid Composite structures to replace beryllium for EKV structural components including the EKV optical sensor sunshade, Electronics Unit (EU) housing, Divert Attitude Control Subsystem (DACS) structures, and an integrated DACS/Structure common module primary structure components for the EKV assembly.

The cost of a single mistake or slow response can be exorbitant, resulting in a significant reduction in a satellite's lifespan or in the loss of a satellite.  In light of their growing responsibility, the grave implications of errors and performance deficiencies, and the growing complexity of their work, it is essential that space personnel be provided with training technologies that are able to facilitate the acquisition of high levels of proficiency in a complex environment.  In particular, space personnel may be benefited by training technologies that help them better understand how the data with which they work relate to the physical systems they are monitoring and managing.  To provide this type of training technology, CHI Systems proposes to develop the Satellite Technician Advanced Training System (STATS), which is a prototype training system that uses visualization technologies to facilitate satellite technicians' ability to understand the data on their workstations in terms of their relationship to the satellite system as a whole and to the complex interrelationships among its subsystems",

        "abstract": "A nearly universal trend in modern technology is integrating systems, and their associated devices, on decreasingly smaller scales. Examples range from complete telecommunication systems on a chip to implantable medical devices smaller than human cells. The majority of these devices apply hybrid designs that integrate on a commensurate scale electronics with active and passive optical components. How to design such systems accounting for all the various physical phenomena, including those present in the fabrication processes, is a very challenging problem. Moreover, as optical components are reduced to a scale that is comparable to the operational wavelength, approximate optical design tools are no longer valid. For these cases more rigorous electromagnetic analysis is required. Thus, new computer aided design (CAD) tools are needed that integrate the rigorous physical models and fabrication processes into a single desktop environment. To solve this very challenging problem we propose to apply EM Photonic's revolutionary hardware acceleration system. This system has demonstrated that application specific hardware can provide unprecedented acceleration in solving complicated electromagnetic problems using only a single desktop computer. We are confident this novel approach will break the computational bottleneck that has hindered progress towards a truly useful micro- and nano- photonics CAD system.",

The signature is the result of both thermal and nonthermal radiation.  The latter is defined by electric charge separation and acceleration.  The usual thermal radiation theory must be expanded to include electric charge separation in hot, ionized combustion gases in order to calculate accurately the electrical conductivity within the plume and, therefore the absorption/transmission of the radiation from the plume.  The output of any appropriate quasi-steady plume flow field computer code becomes the input to our post-processor 3-dimensional radiation code RFPLUME.  Previously, we applied the theoretical model of nonthermal RF radiation to that from axisymmetric quasi-steady plumes in the upper atmosphere and also to that from an unsteady plume impacting the launch pad.  This work will now be extended and generalized to 3D flows resulting from multiple rocket nozzles and/or oblique interactions with the launch pad.

This Phase II effort will develop a property database of ambient and elevated temperature mechanical and thermal properties such that nanograined tungsten throat liners can be designed and fabricated.  These throat liners will be test fired in solid rocket motors, and their performance will be evaluated.",

These environments, which include deep-sea hydrothermal vents, ocean boreholes, underwater volcanoes, and terrestrial aquifers, are of interest to the NASA Ames Astrobiology Group because they may harbor subsurface microbiological ecosystems, whose occurrences can be detected by measuring such isotope ratios. In Phase I, we have demonstrated the technical feasibility of making all three of these ratio measurements in a single, multiplexed instrument using both simulated and actual biogenically-generated gas samples. These ratios have been determined to better than 0.2%, which is sufficient to determine the presence of biological activity. The Phase II effort will consist primarily of packaging the instrument for extreme environments and subsequent field-testing in conjunction with NASA. The final Phase II prototype will be delivered to the NASA Ames Astrobiology Group. This instrument will be the first remotely operable sensor capable of measuring isotope ratios with sufficient precision to indicate the presence of biological activity in a variety of extreme environments.",

Custom methods that are expensive to deploy and maintain are required to transport, synchronize, and select the best stream. Furthermore, with the current mixture of wireless, optical fiber, and wired transport methods and protocols the problem is made even more difficult.    The recent trend in the commercial telecommunications industry is to move toward an all internet protocol (IP) based network structure. If these high-performance, cost-effective hardware and software solutions could be applied to military flight-test ranges, it would result in lower life-cycle costs and reduced operational complexity.  Therefore, the objective of this project is to develop an operationally suitable real-time IP based telemetry transport mechanism that satisfies the quality of service, stream alignment, and stream selection with minimum latency deviation at a reasonable cost.    During phase I, Nova Engineering has developed an architecture that significantly enhances the state-of-the-art in air-to-ground telemetry.

At the same time, X-band and UHF SAR and moving target radar (GMTI) is now, and will continue to be, a primary modality for battlefield reconnaissance and situation awareness.  SAR and LADAR are largely complementary technologies because SAR works well at long range and captures synoptic views for large area search, cueing, and detection.  LADAR data improves as the range decreases and is well-suited to target matching in a seeker.  In Phase I we developed a specific target transfer approach to SAR-LADAR fusion which demonstrated the feasibility of the concept.  In Phase II, we propose to extend this investigation to other fusion options including evidence fusion and cueing.  We plan a trade study to understand the performance tradeoffs of the different approaches and understand their benefits and limitations.

All of these methods have relative advantages and disadvantages; however, these methods can be compromised with moderate effort when used as the only solution to the problem.  As a result, the security community has recently become interested in the feasibility of obtaining high quality idiosyncratic electronic signatures directly from a computing platform.  These signatures would provide a means of authentication that addresses the deficiencies of the current methods.  Our Phase I research effort demonstrated the existence of idiosyncratic features, the feasibility of using these features to uniquely identify a computer, and a method for leveraging this identification to prevent unauthorized software execution.  The result of the Phase I research was an integrated algorithm, software, and hardware design.

Because these phenomena are the usual causes of failure, reduced thrust, increased fuel consumption, and reduced life cycle of aircraft engines, the potential for their occurrence must be anticipated in new designs. Unfortunately, their elimination through costly, iterative re-design and testing is likely to become more of an issue as engines are pushed to higher levels of performance. The innovative research proposed by Thaerocomp Technical Corporation (TTC) will result in the development and validation of an advanced software package for heat release prediction in single-phase and liquid-fueled spray combustors and advanced augmentors.

Our successful coupling of the proposed code with CHEMKIN-III has led to easy and robust modeling with detailed chemistry, which is required for accurate calculations of heat release and most unsteady phenomena. The benefits of the proposed product include improved engine safety, faster turn-around in the analysis cycle, and significant savings in the cost of analysis.",

        "abstract": "In order to maintain the desired high level of performance required by modern military aircraft operating under a wide range of conditions many military engines use variable inlet guide vanes (IGVs).  As a result, a significant weight penalty is paid in the form of the IGVs themselves as well as all of the associated linkages and drive hardware required to actuate them. Considering the emphasis that the military places on the thrust to weight ratio of their engines, an alternative that would reduce or eliminate this drawback would be very attractive. In Phase I, Techsburg demonstrate the ability of a fixed-geometry, flow control IGV to replace the variable IGVs. For Phase II, Techsburg is proposing to mature this technology to a TRL of 5 through demonstration in a Honeywell compressor rig at the Compressor Research Facility (CRF).",

        "abstract": "The goal of this SBIR is to develop a capability for securely transmitting cryptographic keys over wireless networking environments. The lack of perimeter defenses in wireless networks demands that all transmitters/receivers possess cryptographic devices to protect sensitive data. With the increasing use of wireless technologies, this places unrealistic management and distribution requirements on the security personnel. Additionally, as security breaches are detected, it is paramount that new cryptographic keys be rapidly transmitted to the remaining trusted wireless participants. New solutions are needed that securely distribute cryptographic keys over wireless networks to large groups of devices with minimal human intervention. These solutions must be suitable for both emerging and legacy cryptographic devices.  They must also be agile enough to allow rekeying to occur at anytime and anywhere. This SBIR is developing a new Wireless Rekeying Device and new secure group key distribution algorithm capable of rekeying thousands of devices simultaneously.  Our technology combines emerging low-cost commercial components with an innovative command-hierarchical key-graph algorithm to perform over-the-air group rekeying of legacy cryptographic devices.  Our Phase I SBIR analysis has shown that this architecture and algorithm combination is secure, highly scalable, supports command delegation, and is computationally/memory/network efficient.",

Scalability of current state-of-the-art kW-class solid-state Master Oscillator/Power Amplifier (MOPA) systems is limited by thermo-optic aberrations in the gain medium, and by heat transport/disposal.  Beam-combining by multiplexing several 1-10kW class MOPAs provides a path for further power scaling to MW levels, but present techniques using coherent phased arrays, diffractive couplers, spectral beam-combining or temporal-multiplexing are currently limited by losses, aberrations, damage to diffractive components at high average or peak powers, and system complexity.  CTI proposes an innovative proprietary technology that can be applied to retain spatial and spectral coherence both in power-scaling of a MOPA and in coherent beam-combining.  In a MOPA, the technology can maximize extraction efficiency and minimize thermo-optic aberrations.  In a coherent beam-combiner, high power beams can be co-phased and combined with low loss, negligible aberrations and without using vulnerable components.  Together the technologies provide a path to extremely compact and rugged ladar or weapons-class lasers.  In the highly successful Phase I program, CTI has: (1) demonstrated the beam combining technique in a low power prototype; (2) conducted design trades, and developed a detailed engineering design for the Phase II co-phased beam-combined diffraction-limited 4 element array; and (3) extended this to develop a conceptual design for a MW laser.  Phase II will deliver the 1 kW class co-phased laser, and a detailed design of the MW laser.  The designs will leverage CTI's experience in kW-class lasers and in flight qualified laser systems.",

One potential solution is the use of submunitions that can gut, or `disable' the inside of a target while leaving the exterior walls completely intact.  To advance this solution, SARA is developing a network/smartfuze technology that will enable attacking submunitions to share gathered target data, request additional sub-munitions as needed, and collaborate in defeating such a target with the amount/type of force needed to defeat WMD capability without disastrous collateral effects.  The basis of this network is the ability to communicate through earth, concrete and even steel with proprietary SARA induction-based technology.

Calibration of geometric and photometric environmental attributes allows robust operation and consistent reasoning over a constrained metric parameter space, while a sophisticated appearance prediction engine able to account for such phenomena as reflectance and cast shadows additionally enables highly accurate template-to-image matching.  SAVOR is designed to approach a vehicle type classification rate of 95% or greater on ordinary daytime traffic. Real-time operation allows statistically meaningful performance analyses over long durations and in temporally-varying environmental conditions.

Taking this approach will result in a high current and high temperature SSPC that totally eliminates the need for active cooling and is capable of operating at high environmental temperatures. Phase II efforts will yield detailed engineering designs, models, analysis and simulation results including performance estimates, such as weights, volumes, power dissipations, and efficiencies, hardware development and fabrication, and hardware demonstration in an engineering laboratory. Our proposed Phase II effort includes the participation on a consultant basis of a world leader in manufacturing of high precision servo systems for military and commercial markets, and a premier manufacturer of Air Force systems (aircrafts). Mechatronic Systems has achieved significant progress on the development of high temperature and high power density SiC based electric motor drives for servo applications under SBIR contracts from the U.S. Air Force [11-14]. Mechatronic Systems qualified suppliers have demonstrated the capability to manufacture and deliver high temperature SiC bare die and SiC power modules per our engineering designs and performance specifications [11-14].",

        "abstract": "This project is developing a real-time software \"health monitoring\" system for high-powered laser systems. By \"health monitoring\", we are referring to a system that can independently monitor the status of the laser over time, alerting operators to diminished performance and preventing catastrophic failure. A variety of different high power lasers are under development, including the Airborne Laser and the Tactical High Energy Laser (THEL). These lasers need to not only operate for long periods of time without system failure, but also must deliver peak amounts of power in order to achieve their mission. To achieve long-term peak performance, system operators must monitor the condition of various optics using sensors such as video cameras, scatter meters, power meters, and environmental sensors. This Phase II project will create a software package that can monitor high value optics in real time. A graphical toolkit will be created to allow operators to easily create data monitors. An autonomous diagnostics module will also be included. Ultimately, the system will be a highly interactive monitoring and diagnostic tool for laser operators that will assure optimal system performance.",

GPS/INS systems work by acquiring position and velocity information and maneuvering to given target coordinates entered before release. If seeker technology is used, target-tracking techniques are employed to guide to the final target. The need to precisely attack fixed/moveable targets has come to the forefront in the most recent conflicts. Seekers bring high accuracy for moving/moveable targets but also much higher cost and greater mission planning, power, and cooling requirements. The ability to attack this class of targets without the expense and issues associated with seekers is desirable.

Having overcome critical technical issues associated with two-way communication between these neural structures and the virtual robots they govern, IEI plans to develop a commercially viable software package wherein self-determining virtual robots may be constructed, evolved, and tested within settings having either military or commercial significance. Essential to this software package will be an export facility through which the underlying neural architectures, fine-tuned within virtual reality, can be ported to actual hardware (or complimentary simulation environments), allowing for very rapid robotic prototyping. Conversely, this software package will provide an import facility through which real-world knowledge gleaned from hardware-based systems can be exploited within virtual reality. Together, these import and export facilities will allow for iterative cycles of robot development alternating between simulation and reality. With this development environment as its centerpiece, IEI will form a consortium of companies to pioneer the use of this package in developing new robotic products and services, likewise using it as a virtual showcase for a wide range of existing products.",

This shift from diesel to electric power is part of a greater program within the DoD to phase in hydrogen-based (fuel cell) power generation over the next 15 years.  Lynntech Inc.'s patented bipolar proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell technology is ideally suited for high efficiency, power generation.  Lynntech's fuel cells have been recognized by NASA and the aerospace industry for their high power density and specific power.

This technology will be adapted to the unique requirements of DOD infrared sensor applications at lower temperatures and at significantly increased cooling capacities.  The proposed system will be capable of simultaneously providing 2 W of refrigeration at 35 K and 20 W at 85 K within a single integrated assembly.  The unique characteristics of the turbo-Brayton cycle permit distributed cooling at multiple sites with a single, multistage configuration with very high thermodynamic efficiency, resulting in low input power and reduced mass.  In Phase I, we developed a preliminary design of the cryocooler and its components, developed load curves and assessed the benefits of advanced developments.  During Phase II, we propose to develop and demonstrate an advanced recuperator that will provide milestone reductions in cryocooler mass and power consumption.

The proposed work will demonstrate a new and innovative technique for improving the spatial resolution of hyperspectral image data and develop software implementations of the algorithm and the required multi-sensor registration.  This technique, called Color Sharpening, combines a multi-spectral image with a lower spatial resolution hyperspectral image to produce a product that has the spectral properties of the hyperspectral image at a spatial resolution approaching that of the multi-spectral image.  This approach is contrasted to panchromatic sharpening that is to combine a single panchromatic band with several lower resolution color bands.   Color Sharpening is a departure from procedures that have been implemented before, and offers the benefits of high spatial and spectral resolution for subsequent hyperspectral processing such as terrain classification and target detection.  Under Phase I, the resolution enhancement algorithm and required high quality registration procedures were developed.

        "abstract": "Advanced high-speed gas turbine engines are continually subjected to extreme operating environments making bearings a life limiting component in the engine. Oil-free foil bearings will improve weapon system range, reduce weight and costs, and increase overall system reliability. Foil bearings are successfully used in aircraft environmental control systems. However, there is need for further research and development, because gas turbine engines operate at higher temperatures and are subjected to higher radial and axial loads. Several unique innovations are being proposed which will make foil air bearings suitable for high temperature gas turbine engines. Critical technology barriers have been outlined along with a reasonable work plan and timeline.     In Phase I feasibility of foil bearings for gas turbine engines was shown by analysis, modeling and limited testing. In Phase II the process for scaling to larger size bearings, i.e. 2 inch to 4 inch and 6 inch diameter journal bearings will be proven. The larger size bearings, i.e. 4 inch and 6 inch diameter journal bearings will be designed, developed and tested. The bearings will also be tested in a high temperature test rig simulating operating environments of a gas turbine engine including speeds, temperatures, and thrust loads. The technology readiness of larger size bearings required for VAATE XTL 18 and UCAV gas turbine engines will be proven. Simulator testing simulating the rotor dynamics of VAATE XTL 18 and UCAV engines will be accomplished in Phase III.",

DocTRAP:  1) protects against insider theft of sensitive electronic documents, 2) detects malicious insider activity, and 3) reacts to keep the sensitive information from leaving the protected boundary of the internal network. The Phase II SBIR builds on the success of the Phase II technology investigation and validation, and results in the application of DocTRAP technology to solve real-world problems.  The resulting Phase II software product protects against the distribution of sensitive information to unauthorized persons outside the internal network.

        "abstract": "Virtually all DoD and commercial organizations have come to rely upon Microsoft (MS) Office applications for documenting and exchanging a wide range of information in text documents, briefings, spreadsheets, and multimedia documents.   While the value of these applications is indisputable, not everyone is aware of their ability to carry far more information than meets the eye. Such information falls into two general categories: metadata and hidden objects. Metadata is placed in the file by the application itself, whereas hidden objects are placed in the file by the application's user, either inadvertently or intentionally. Phase I analysis revealed that almost exclusively, existing commercial products focused on the detection of metadata, for the most part ignoring hidden objects. Our Phase II approach will employ the spiral development methodology to incrementally build a file inspection product that addresses both sets of requirements, across the DoD and the commercial marketplace. The initial spiral will accomplish a thorough design and develop a filter set that includes a basic GUI. Through subsequent spirals, additional filters will be developed and the GUI will be enhanced. Testing and documentation will become more formal, and an API-based architecture will be developed to facilitate integration into external applications or systems.",

Because the instrument can 1) measure shear stress values up to 100 Pa, 2) account for atmospheric variations in local fluid properties, and 3) accommodate relatively large streamwise pressure gradients, it is well suited for use in flight test research and commercial aircraft applications.  During the previous Phase I program, NEAR identified some deficiencies in the current sensor housing design.  Thus, the proposed Phase II effort will focus on developing a robust housing which can withstand the vibration, temperature, pressure, and moisture levels found in flight.  Sensor housing designs will be developed and refined through a series of wind tunnel tests using tunnels capable of simulating the flight environment.  The final sensor design will be demonstrated through flight testing on NASA Dryden?s F-15B.

        "abstract": "Underwater objects of interest are often marked by placing an acoustic marker or pinger either on or very near to the object.  This device is left on site until revisited at some later time by another system able to localize it.  Current marker/pinger technology typically transmits energy in a narrow spectral band.  The implications of such a transmission are:  the signals are easily detectable by undesirable observers; two or more markers transmitting simultaneously will cause confusion in detection and bearing estimation.  Furthermore, current marker/pinger technology would be wasteful of energy in broadband signaling, resulting in unnecessarily reduced operational life.  Our Phase One efforts concentrated on the development of a robust, broadband signaling scheme based upon our acoustic communications (acomms) technology, and on the development of a new technology for efficient conversion of electrical power to broadband acoustic power.  These combined developments will permit the construction of a smart marker with the following capabilities:    1. We propose to operate the marker in a 10 kHz band, with the low end of the band suitable for the ONR-designated band C.  However, the center frequency could be higher and the band much wider to suit application.   2. Among other configurations, the markers will be configured to operate in conjunction with both the existing Benthos ATM 885 and the WHOI Micromodem operating in band C.  3. We will provide a minimum1 km range for a battery-powered marker.  4. We plan to provide as many as three operating modes for battery-powered units.  Modes will include a fully \"awake\" mode, a \"drowsy\" mode, and a hibernation mode.  Continuous \"awake\" operation will result in a battery life of about 22 days.   5. Our preferred mode of operation is to command an individual marker to respond with a coded, \"covert\" frequency hopping (FH) sequence.  Other signaling modes are possible.   6. We are planning a single device that can be used from shallow water to 500 m depth.   7. We will provide both diver-held and vehicle-mounted devices for interrogating the markers and for estimating range and bearing.",

In the Phase I SBIR program, Prime Research designed, assembled and demonstrated two dynamic pressure measurement systems based on novel self-calibrating optical sensor technology.  The Phase II effort proposed here will convert the prototype sensors into pre-production devices, and evaluation of these pre-production sensors will be performed in test turbines at Pratt & Whitney to obtain pressure data in various locations throughout the turbine, including inlets, compressors, and augmentors.  Access to test facilities and engineering support is pledged by Pratt & Whitney at no cost.

Thus, in order to address the mixture of students (i.e., their backgrounds, aptitudes, mental models, capabilities, etc.), instructor doctrines, and training goals (e.g., accelerated learning, re-training, etc.) it has become necessary to define new methodologies in order to achieve effectiveness and uniformity in training content, student evaluation, and scenario generation.  KBSI presents a new framework for generating simulation-based training scenarios. We integrate knowledge mined from historical databases (or trainee performance results) with that elicited from subject matter experts and then apply that integrated knowledge to facilitate the design or modification of training scenarios in order to generate scenarios automatically. We will also investigate the use of other data mining techniques such as Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks.

An extensive series of experiments led to a pressure regulated liquid bismuth feed system design.  Bismuth will be stored as a compact solid on the spacecraft.  Most significant feed system elements were tested.  Numerical modeling showed the bismuth discharge to be highly efficient; bismuth thrusters will outperform similar xenon thrusters.  Maximum thrust to power (T/P) and thrust to system mass (T/M) will both increase substantially.  Bimodal capabilities benefit; high T/P is possible throughout the range 1000 sec < Isp < 3000 sec.  The tenuous bismuth charge exchange plasma leads to less thruster erosion than observed in a xenon system; this means high total impulse (longer lifetime), and helps mitigate spacecraft interactions, which were scoped out by Aerospace Corporation under subcontract.  In Phase II, Busek will design, and build a complete bismuth Hall thruster system.  Performance and plume testing will lead to an optimized, deliverable prototype system.

In the Phase I program, Busek designed, built and performed initial performance characterization of a 20 kW thruster design based on our nominal magnetic arrangement.  The maximum efficiency obtained was 67% at 400 V at the discharge.  Power input up to 16 kW was demonstrated.  Also during Phase I the preliminary design of the low mass magnetic circuit was completed.  The two designs have nearly identical magnetic field distribution and use the same discharge dimensions ensuring similar performance.  In Phase II, Busek will generate mechanical drawings and build a 20 kW low mass prototype, measure its magnetic field on the bench, and measure the thrust it produces over a range of operating conditions.  In the first half of Phase II, the nominal prototype will be subjected to a more extensive series of tests to demonstrate bimodal capabilities over 1000-3000 sec Isp operating range.  Plasma simulations and erosion measurements will be developed to predict lifetime, which is > 10,000 hours.  At the end of Phase II, an optimized low  mass design will be tested and delivered.",

IAI proposes to continue development of Frameworker , a tool that helps developers rapidly and parsimoniously code metadata for learning objects.   Metadata specifications,are designed to make learning objects easier to find and reuse.  They define a set of elements and values that allow different learning objects to be found and used together.  However, it may be  difficult for a courseware author to find, understand, and implement these various metadata standards, elements and existing classification systems.  Frameworker is designed to help alleviate these problems, while yielding ultimate control to the courseware developer.   The main benefits of Frameworker include (1) decreased dependence on human expertise by semi-automated selection of metadata elements and classification systems, (2) increased authoring efficiency by minimizing the number of these that are coded for each learning object, (3) easier and more accurate coding, and (4) facilitating convergence by making overlapping classification systems available across a community of developers.

The approach is fully compatible with silicon IC processing and utilizes a novel combination of optical read out of a surface micro-machined detector to achieve nearly instantaneous response, large filed of view, large array size, and RF immune operation. Our approach uniquely converts invisible imagines into visible color imagines that are read-out by a conventional CCD camera.  The method eliminates traditional frame rate related temporal latency and is thus capable of generating multi-spectral images at update rates to 400 Hz.  The design also facilitates large field of view (FOV) detection and is simple, compact, lightweight, low power, rugged, and long operating life.  During Phase I, AGILTRON has progressed in several key aspects including large chamber monitoring system design and large FOV lens design/fabrication.

Due to the interdependencies between subsystems, it is becoming increasingly important to establish a simulation infrastructure that accurately accounts for the interactions between subsystems and promotes the collaboration between individual groups and organizations involved in the design, analysis, and/or development of complex \"systems of systems.\" Moreover, this type of simulation infrastructure would provide system integrators and program managers with a rapid and easy-to-use means of establishing proof-of-concept for new systems, evaluating competitive system configurations or architectures at a system level and, after the candidate architecture is selected and a more detailed design phase is entered, tracking and managing the progress of the detailed system design. Such an infrastructure could also be useful throughout the life cycle of a military platform for analyzing potential field problems, evaluating technology enhancements/retrofits, and/or personnel training. The proof-of-concept and viability of such a capability were established in Phase I. The Phase II research will be focused upon the next steps in the development of this system integration, analysis, and design simulation environment.",

The defense market for such devices is significant, reflected by the fact that all branches of the US military are actively pursuing high power lasers.

The 2.5 MW generator when coupled to Allison T406 (AE2307) engine results in 1600 Lb. generator set that can be used for any vehicle mounted or stationary application. Tne design of the generator is cost effective, and can be easily extended to cover 1 MW to 5 MW range. The Phase II activity will include fabrication and testing of the generator based on the Phase I design. The Phase I design was further analyzed and verified during an extensive program under a separate PRDA contract to minimize design risks.

        "abstract": "Wide-area surveillance of airborne and ground-moving targets is an emerging research topic examined by the military services, DARPA and in the open literature. A space-based bistatic radar system offers many advantages for use in surveillance including the potential for covert wide-area coverage. However, it must contend with increased clutter spread due to higher platform speeds which causes the masking of targets over a larger portion of the angle-Doppler space and makes an effective clutter mitigation strategy even more vital. In addition, clutter in a bistatic radar is inherently non-stationary (i.e., the angle-Doppler spectra vary from range bin to range bin) thus complicating the training for STAP algorithms. The proposed research program will develop a computer model for evaluating the performance of a bistatic SBR that employs STAP and apply that model in the development of robust STAP techniques to be employed in a challenging environment of non-stationary range-ambiguous clutter, training corruption, and clutter discretes. Bistatic radar system concepts involving combinations of MEO and LEO satellites as well as airborne adjunct platforms will be investigated. Performance metrics of interest will include area coverage, achievable minimum detectable velocity, and geolocation accuracy",

The target devices are one one that will emit in the UV (300 nm) and one that will emit in the violet (400 nm), each with power greater than 5 mW. Recent data indicate ZnO-based photonic devices such as light emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes (LDs) that use arsenic doped p-type material will have technical and operational advantages to those based on GaN. Principal advantages include ease of film growth at lower cost, larger exciton binding energy to give higher brightness in emission and sensitivity in detection, the availability of single crystal ZnO substrates to reduce defect densities, and existence of wet chemical etching processes for use in the fabrication process. A shallow acceptor level increases the hole carrier activation ratio. Room temperature device operation should show higher efficiency, higher powers, and longer lifetimes. In Phase II, (Zn, Be, Mg, O)-ternary alloys and ZnO/(ZnBeO and/or ZnMgO) superlattices for UV/Violet light emitting and receiving applications will be fabricated using a new growth technique that provides high quality films.

A MEO constellation for GMTI surveillance results in fewer satellites, lower platform velocity, narrower clutter spectrum and improved target MDV.  For the longer MEO slant range, the target area is visible much longer with less target handover between adjacent satellites.

The MEO SBR will be characterized by a large, deployable AESA or reflector antenna system, selected after realistic size, weight, power and complexity tradeoffs, and a high-throughput state-of-the art on-board signal processor.

Currently, a typical thermal protection system for aircraft applications involves bonding ceramic tiles onto the aircraft.  The bonded ceramic tiles are completely exposed and subject to the external environment.  Although the tiles provide the necessary thermal protection, they are relatively soft and are degraded by impact with environmental particulates.  Such deterioration results in high costs because frequent maintenance and replacement is required to keep the aircraft in operation.  Therefore, improved thermal and impact protection systems are needed to improve the reliability and durability of aircraft structures.     Aerogels are presently the best thermal insulation material available exhibiting excellent thermal, acoustic, and vibration protection.  Aerogel materials have already demonstrated their superiority as both high and low temperature insulation materials.  Flexible fiber reinforced aerogel composites were developed during the Phase I effort and were shown to be a feasible solution for protecting aircraft exhaust-washed structures.

RMD proposes and NDE instrument based on an array of magnetoresistive (MR) sensor elements used to produce real-time magnetic fields images of cracks, corrosion, and other defects in a wide range of components, some with complex shapes.  Correlating the magnetic field properties at many points, with the positions where the measurements are made, allows the generation of real-time, 3-D images of defects.  During Phase I, high quality images were made of simulated cracks 5 mils wide and 25 mils on the inside of a 1/4 inch thick steel sample.  The images were made by scanning the outside of the sample.  MR sensors have achieved sensitivity of approximately 1.0 x 10-10 T/&#8730;Hz.  MR sensors have bandwidth greater than 1 GHz, they can withstand forces of 100,000g, and temperatures over 2000C.  Phase II will result in a portable, cost effective NDE instrument for imaging defects in the filed under a variety of environmental conditions.    The PI and his collaborators have been able to develop MR sensor systems for recovering data on obsolete or damaged magnetic tapes, and for detecting cracks and corrosion in sheet metal. Phase I tests indicate that the new technology is capable of detecting second layer defects.",

        "abstract": "Very low cost (and some legacy) image generators (IG) often lack the fidelity to perform in high fidelity, mission critical simulation systems.  They can suffer from several key performance limitations including low image update rate, limited scene complexity, and non-graceful degradation during overload.  Real-time signal processing techniques can be applied to help overcome these limitations in many systems. Utilizing rendered 3D imagery as the source, a graphics processor can perform 2D image generation functions to compute intermediate frames of video between IG updates, extrapolating images to be used in cases of skipped frames due to overload.   This allows the IG to have an update rate lower than that of the overall system requirements.  With a lower update rate, the 3D imagery calculations are given more time to compute frames, and therefore can include additional scene content to further enhance the overall simulation.  Additionally, with the proper signal processing architecture, the system can perform tasks, such as non-linear image distortion (static and potentially dynamic) to map scenes onto curved surfaces or simulate complex sensor effects.",

        "abstract": "The ADDIOS solicitation addresses a fundamental limitation imposed by physics on all imaging sensor systems: performance requirements demand higher sensor resolution, but processor capabilities demand lower sensor resolution.  The pixels of a low-resolution sensor cover areas that are much larger than the target.  This dilutes the pixel's signal energy with background energy, decreasing the detection performance of the sensor.  Increasing the resolution of the sensor alleviates this problem, but has a corresponding penalty in the amount of processing power needed for real-time detection.    DRA has developed an effective two-color missile warning sensor that operates in the visible spectrum (VMWS).  During the Phase I effort of ADDIOS, DRA incorporated CMOS imaging technology into the VMWS in order to analyze the threat scene using variable resolution (VR).  Using VR in missile warning allows for efficient detection at low-resolution for the entire threat scene as well as effective high-resolution tracking and declaration of missile threats.  The concept of VR is analogous to having electronic foveal vision, except the high-resolution fovea can move as needed about the field of view.  During Phase II, DRA will formulate the algorithms to accomplish VR in missile warning.",

Although filters are currently available for particulates, there remains a  need for regenerating, signature-less filters that can trap pesticides and  biological pollutants. Under Phase II, eSpin proposes to develop and  fabricate engineered prototypes of self-regenerating polymer and carbon  nanofiber based composite air filters.    Electrospun nanofibers, which have an extremely high surface area and very  small pores, will be produced to trap and neutralize fine particles,  aerosols and pesticide vapors. The architecture will be tailored by varying  fiber diameter and fiber packing fraction. The nanofibers will be carbonized  and activated for optimum performance. The filter will be designed to  regenerate itself by electrically heating the carbon nanofibers, burning off  biological agents and pesticide aerosols, and desorbing pesticide vapors.  The desorbed vapors will be destroyed by passing them through a post-filter  in which the fibers have their surfaces modified to generate singlet oxygen,  which is known to destroy pesticides. Carbon nanofibers will absorb  pollutants, while the post-filter will oxidize pollutants.    At the end of the Phase II, eSpin will have developed light weight nanofiber  based, regenerating, low-pressure air filters for eliminating pesticides and  pollutants.",

        "abstract": "The advanced seeker of the future will be one that allows for multiple targets and various advanced countermeasures.  This advanced seeker is most likely one that includes a dual mode component to it. A Dual Mode Seeker (DMS) has at least an infrared (IR) Focal Plane Array (FPA) as well as an active means to capture target range and preferably 3-D imagery.  It is this range detection with 3-D imagery that is the subject of this proposal.  A Laser Detection And Ranging (Ladar) system can provide accurate angle, angle and range (AAR) detection allowing the DMS to create a three dimensional image(s) of the target(s).  The Ladar system being considered as part of this proposal is based on the Ladar brassboard developed and demonstrated by BAE SYSTEMS using the Lincoln Labs 32x32 APD array design.  Presently, IBSi is under contract with USA SMDC under the Long Range Atmospheric Defense (LRAD) program to integrate a mirror control and stabilization system to be used in the next generation seekers such as MKV, KEI and Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) Dual mode seeker (DMS).  This system is being delivered to BAE Systems in Nashua, NH for use in technology demonstration and DMS integration.  One area that has been identified as critical is the ability to point and queue the Ladar's output laser to a target based, in part, on the IR FPA data.  This ability requires a very tight coupling of the Ladar system with that of the IR signal processing.  It should be noted that the focus of this effort is AAR Ladar due to its inherent small size and high performance, compatibility with range resolved Doppler Ladar would be a consideration.  As shown through the MDA ARRDI study both approaches have their strengths and compliment each other.     Based on continuing development of the dual mode seeker being targeted for the next generation avionics on the THAAD program and Carrier Vehicle concepts for MKV, by our team member BAE Systems, it is now known that the combination of the passive IR FPA image data and active range (Ladar) image will require only a 32x32 array size.  This array size is sufficient as long as the feature size (pitch) of the pixels with-in the APD array and the integrated ROIC can be manufactured to support a much tighter pixel pitch than what has been previously realized. Future application will require arrays of up to 1024x1024. The approach proposed here is scalable to this size.",

Conventional technologies such as new-generation of HEPA filters provide reasonable protection for a certain amount of time.  However, HEPA filters are expensive and require the use of pre-filters to limit their rate of loading, moreover, they dissipate large amounts of power from the ventilation air stream.  We propose to develop a new technology for decontamination of air streams through simultaneous injection and generation of strong oxidative free radicals.  These free radicals, which have an average lifetime of less than a second, are effective in neutralizing chemical and biological agents upon contact and dissipate not leaving any residue.  The strong air/gas stream containing free radicals produced in a non-thermal plasma source will be able to penetrate efficiently the contaminated air stream due to vibrant turbulence caused by the injection stream.  Non-thermal plasma technologies are currently under investigation for their ability to decompose biological and chemical agents.  Plasma chemical processes have been known to be highly effective in promoting oxidation, enhancing molecular dissociation, and producing free radicals to enhance chemical reactions.  Plasma techniques such as the pulsed microwave discharge proposed here, offer advantages of energy efficiency and the capability for the simultaneous removal of co-existing CBW agents.",

However, they have experienced significantly shorter life than anticipated in performance tests conducted using current gas turbine engine oils (GTOs).  Their chemistry does not interact in the same way with the conventional aryl phosphate antiwear lubricant additives to form lubricious surface coatings.  Under the Phase I program, METSS investigated the technical feasibility of developing new lubricant additives for corrosion-resistant high-chrome steels by evaluating a number of lubricant chemistries for their antiwear properties and their thermo-oxidative stability.  Under the proposed Phase II program, METSS will optimize the performance of these new lubricant additives with regard to antiwear characteristics, corrosion resistance, thermal and oxidative stability, and deposit forming tendencies.  Since GTO fluids are also used to lubricate conventional steels used in gear and bearing applications, special emphasis will be placed on additional tribology testing required to fully qualify the new lubricants for DoD requirements.

The need for CBR threat detection has become increasingly critical to national and international security. Current detection techniques rely on systems that are intrusive, expensive, time-consuming or unreliable.  A non-intrusive Terahertz (THz) CBR detection approach demonstrated during phase I will enable reduced shipboard workload for functions (such as examining packages delivered to Navy ships) and will increase the ship's protection against asymmetrical threats.  The objective of this proposal is to develop a portable solid-state device to interrogate shipboard hazards with Terahertz (THz) energy to determine the presence of chemical and biological hazards.  While the initial focus is on screening packages, the proposed system is safe for people screening, and when afloat, the THz system can be used to alarm against airborne threats.  During Phase I, we demonstrated the efficacy of the novel combination of microstructured aerosol and gas collector with an all electronic THz spectrometer to non-invasively detect simulants of hazardous chemical vapors and biological pathogens.  The participants have substantial experience in every aspect of the novel combination of filtration and detection, including air sampling for CB agents, surface sampling, and optical spectroscopy.  During Phase II, we will focus on development of a portable prototype for demonstration with biological agents in a certified agent lab.",

The impedance measurements at particular frequencies will be modeled using fuzzy logic modeling to correlate their condition to signatures in the ac impedance measurements.

        "abstract": "The objectives of this proposed Phase II project are to develop the appropriate optics for an 8 wavelength CWDM system and demonstrate both the multiplexed data link and the integration of the link with an aircraft actuator.  Fly-by-light (FBL) systems have been the subject of research for many years; however, there are still several hurdles to overcome before FBL systems can provide the next advance in flight control technology.  One of the main difficulties with current proposed FBL systems is the large number of fibers required.  In order to reduce the number of fibers, coarse wavelength division multiplexing (CWDM) can be used to increase the signal capacity of individual fibers.  The Phase I effort resulted in an architecture design capable of decreasing the number of fibers from 1190 to 210 when using a CWDM system with 8 wavelengths.  Digital Optics Corporation will develop and demonstrate the necessary components for a CWDM based sensor network for FBL applications.  New CWDM modules will be designed and fabricated and assembled with the necessary active components and optical sensors in order to demonstrate a complete optical data link.  Partnering with HR Textron, this CWDM data link will be integrated with an aircraft actuator.",

Successful Phase I has provided the scientific and technological groundwork for further nanocomposite arsenic removal technology advancement in Phase II.     The Phase II program scales-up the MnO2/Fe2O3 nanocomposite performed in Phase I.  Emphasis is on rapid commercialization of nanocomposite water filters for military and commercial applications.  Key Phase II milestones include: (1) scale-up the chemical synthesis into pilot-scale production, (2) fabricate prototype MnO2/Fe2O3 nanocomposite filtration media and cartridge via Omnipure's Aquabond and carbon block technologies, (3) evaluate prototype filtration media and cartridges following NSF/ANSI standard 53.  A prototype water treatment unit will be built using MnO2/Fe2O3 nanocomposite cartridge.  The unit will be evaluated using source water from USEPA's arsenic technology demonstration sites, and delivered to AFFTC at the end of phase II.  The Phase II participants include Omnipure Filter Co. and the Univ. of Houston.

        "abstract": "Both the USAF's Air Mobility Command (AMC) and commercial carriers must route multiple aircraft efficiently despite multiple, possibly conflicting requirements (minimize fuel burn, rendezvous on time, etc.). Phase I demonstrated the technical feasibilty of finding optimized routes for a collection of sorties using a combination of parallel distributed processing and advanced search technology.  The Phase II effort would enhance and extend the technology demonstrated in Phase I to handle more complicated airspace limitations (e.g., time-dependent clearances) and larger sortie ensembles, while more effectively eliminating suboptimal options to reduce processing demands.  The WARP flight-planning system, developed by On Time Systems for AMC, minimizes fuel consumption for individual flights. Development of automated cross-sortie optimization capabilities would extend WARP's benefits to a much broader range of operational settings. The addition of capabilities to manage differing optimization criteria, such as coordinated arrival times or mission durations, would enhance WARP's capabilities still further in important areas.  These changes would make WARP more useful both to AMC and in commercial applications, because it would both manage various flight-planning goals and help ensure that inter-mission tradeoffs are made as rationally and efficiently as possible.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project will develop a new technology that provides 2D/3D/4D visualization of weather information within a commercial GIS (Geographic Information System) environment.  GIS systems provide rich support for mapping, geographic data handling, spatial query, and geographic analysis functionality, but do not include native support for weather.  GIS systems typically use static (atemporal) databases for visualization and analysis of geographic data (for example, NIMA CDs).  These static databases are typically built by importing existing geographic data (such as road network, urban/rural landuse, etc.).  Weather data are temporal/dynamic in nature and are often accessed as large global four-dimensional datasets providing a wide range of weather parameters.  So, current applications that use weather information tend to be stove-piped systems with limited capability for integration with other mapping and geographic analysis systems.     The proposed research and development would result in a \"weather extension\" to a commercial GIS architecture, allowing the development of \"weather-aware\" mapping applications for the US Air Force and DoD.  The toolkit extensions would also support incorporation of weather forecasts within future mission applications based on the DoD's Commercial Joint Mapping Tool Kit (C/JMTK) as well as applications based directly on the ArcGIS&#61668; desktop platform (from ESRIr).",

A specific and unique porphyrin-based chromophore (PBC) is excited at a wavelength of 355 nm and fluoresces at a visible wavelength of 610 nm. The reflected wavelength can be readily observed using standard Night Vision Goggles.   Although the PBC putty is inherently unstable, preliminary processes have been developed during a SBIR Phase I program.  The successful research allows the technology to be potentially utilized for various military and commercial security applications.   During the Phase II program, a functional primary delivery system will be developed and demonstrated.  The delivery system configuration will be specifically designed for utilization in military perimeter security applications.  A secondary delivery system will also be preliminarily developed for battlefield dissemination of the PBC-based technology.",

        "abstract": "To address the current separation between bearing analysis and rotor response calculations, a combined computational tool will be developed to couple the rotor-bearing system more directly.  This tool will enable the complete thermo-mechanical analysis of rotating machinery structures by combining an advanced representation of rotor geometry with embedded calculations of both rolling element and fluid film bearing dynamic performance that makes no apriori assumptions regarding load distribution.  The response calculations will be incorporated into a fully integrated, platform independent, graphical user interface that features a complete set of pre- and post-processing displays along with an expert system to guide model definition and result interpretation.  Phase I work established the analysis requirements, defined methodology, tested prototype software, and created a software design specification.  The prototype demonstrations convincingly showed that the integration of previously disconnected bearing mechanics into rotor dynamics is very feasible.  In Phase II, full development of the tool will be accomplished, using the design specification, with an emphasis to get an operational version available to beta testers half way through the program.",

        "abstract": "One of the critical capabilities to enhance the availability and performance of C4I systems for Homeland Defense and other major Air Force initiatives (e.g., JWID, DMFE, TAS, DICE, Broadsword, JBI, SSW and BP) is indexing and retrieval of large multi-source information. Most current indexing and retrieval techniques in these systems are based on limited sets of keywords and simple lookup tables. ARGTEC is pioneering the use of a new, innovative technology for content-based indexing, search and retrieval in large information databases. During Phase I of this program, we proved that our technology is extendable into the domain of XML content-based indexing, search and retrieval. We also developed a proof-of-concept demonstration for content-based indexing and retrieval of free-text XML documents. Our demonstration delivers very impressive results with very high selectivity and reliability in real-time retrieval of free-text messages. Previously, we have been successful in applying this technology to Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS). In tests on large fingerprint databases, it delivered > 99% identification accuracy (i.e., < 1% Type I error) and close to zero false alarm rate.    ARGTEC proposes to develop and implement a content-based XML Indexing, Search and Retrieval (XISAR) system prototype for multi-source database management. We will expand our ARG technology to real-time processing of more generalized global information containing free-text as well as other data at multiple levels of detail and resolution. We will show that our system is especially effective in handling noisy and partial information. We will insure that our technology will be infused into the JWID's Collaboration Guard (CG) system as the first operational system that will utilize our product.",

These rhenium thrusters, valve seats and valve bodies are expensive and time consuming to fabricate and are the controlling factor for producing a deliverable SDACS unit.  In order to meet MDA/Navy timelines for fielding a missile defense system, significant reductions in time and cost are desired. One approach for reducing component fabrication time and cost is to integrate components such as the thruster and valve seat. Under the Phase I SBIR program, DE Technologies, Inc.

The proposed Phase II program will build on the Phase I research to develop, analyze, manufacture and test prototype integrated thruster/valve seat designs for representative SDACS configurations. The thruster/valve seat designs developed in Phase II will be specifically designed for EL-Form,  rhenium production and hot-fired to demonstrate performance in a representative environment.

This can be a significant source of noise within the aircraft cabin. The proposed innovation is a new method for testing the acoustics of model scale turbofan engine exhaust systems at cruise conditions in a transonic wind tunnel. This would complement the aerodynamic tests now conducted in the wind tunnel. Currently, acoustic data at cruise conditions is only obtained from costly flight tests. Wind tunnel tests are desirable to simulate the proper flight conditions, but acoustic measurements are difficult in this environment. The new method involves three specific areas of innovation: a) phased-array noise measurement methods, b) evaluating potential modifications to an existing wind tunnel, and c) evaluating means for reducing model air supply noise. Phase I demonstrated that each of these problems has been solved. The proposed Phase II research will combine these processes into an efficient measurement procedure. It will lead to a successful commercial service to airframe manufacturers faced with meeting recently enacted legislation governing noise in the aircraft cabin.",

This proves that the proposed pulse shaping idea is feasible for implementation and provides a foundation for us to continue the research and development in Phase II to achieve 1 ns pulse with over 1 kW peak power, for which more serious pulse distortion has to be compensated.

        "abstract": "The development of inexpensive unmanned aircraft will soon bring the opportunity to place persistent organic hovering sensors at key locations in support of intelligence gathering, targeting, and force protection missions.  As many of the sensor packages flown on these assets will be line-of-sight dependent, careful platform placement will be crucial for sensor effectiveness.  In order to assure good sensor placement without burdening the war fighter, fast automated techniques will be required to place sensors where they will be most effective and move them automatically when conditions change.  Under this Phase II SBIR, ALPHATECH will build on its Phase I sensor location fitness algorithm to include static and dynamic placement strategies which will provide feasible dynamic routing solutions for hovering aircraft.  These algorithms will be implemented in software within a test and demonstration environment which will permit the verification and quantification of algorithm performance, as well as visualization of system solutions.  The resulting system will be appropriate for transition into a larger control package which includes tracking and management of the sensor time line.",

MSI has explored both integrated seed and epitaxial approaches to SSC.  SSC has been demonstrated to produce a highly textured material with property enhancements.  One remaining obstacle to a truly low cost SSC single crystal manufacturing process is a high-rate production for seeds.  In this Phase II SBIR program, MSI will develop two low-cost BaTiO3 seed production methods in parallel.  The processes will be evaluated based on: the yield of seed material produced per week, the cost of the process, the amount of seed material needed to convert PMN-PT, and the effectiveness of the seed material to convert PMN-PT.  The overall emphasis of this program on reducing cost of producing SSC PMN-PT material and the resultant final cost of the actuator or transducer device.",

Building on this base, in Phase II, we will experimentally demonstrate a) scalability of the ISM shells from the currently proven 1 m diameter to significantly larger diameters, b) deployment/synchronization with support structure in relevant environments (i.e. vacuum), c) passive concentration and surface accuracy, and d) usefulness of actuation strategies to further refine surface accuracy.

In particular, the AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) constitute a leading candidate for simultaneously realizing ultra-high frequency, low noise and high power amplifiers covering the range from 3-40 GHZ.     The main advantage of AlGaN/GaN over Silicon and GaAs stems form its wide band gap, hence high breakdown fields and high electron saturation velocity. The electron transport properties at the AlGaN/GaN interface along with the high electron saturation velocity and high breakdown fields in AlGaN/GaN are the basis for the superior performance of these devices.  Magnolia has designed a unique HEMT device structure that will improve the device performance and improve reliability of the HEMT devices. Magnolia proposes to use Semi-insulating SiC substrates to grow HEMT devices using RF plasma assisted MBE growth of AlGaN/GaN. As part of the proposed effort, Magnolia plans to incorporate microelectronic processes for dry-etching and electrical contact formation, for the fabrication of ultra high frequency, low noise and high power nitride HEMT devices with high reliability.

        "abstract": "The objective of this project is to build a midwave infrared four dimensional imaging spectrometer (4D-IS) capable of capturing full hyperspectral image cube (2-spatial dimensions, spectral dimension, and temporal) at video rates.  The sensor will be built to fully interface with the HALO-II system and will support, among other things, target tracking and passive ranging using the Advanced Monocular Passive Ranging (A-MPR) algorithm.  With the 4D-IS on board, the HALO-II cameras do not need to be tasked for extra and time consuming measurements, for the MPR data collection.  Also the 4D-IS provides many bands, as opposed to the HALO-II cameras providing only a few bands, to drastically improve the MPR accuracy.  The 4D-IS system is ideal for MPR since (1) it provides spectrally resolved data for superior range and atmospheric retrieval, (2) it provides spatially resolved data allowing for background subtraction and the discrimination of multiple targets, and (3) it provides temporally resolved data to capture desired plume phenomenological events such as staging, afterburning cessation, engine shutdown, and general plume evolution along the trajectory.  The 4D-IS design concept was developed under Phase-I and recently demonstrated in the VNIR under a separate program.    The MWIR sensor development, and HALO-II integration and validation tests will be completed in two years.  Under an optional 3rd year task, OKSI will provide operational support to the sensor flights and data collection, initial shake down, and full interface to the A-MPR system.",

The SIGNMOS is based on germanium \"quantum dust\" embedded in a silicon matrix, directly integrated into a CMOS amplification circuit.  The device will perform amplified photoreception with a bandwidth of >40 GHz analog and >40 Gbps digital.  Unlike current silicon-based high-speed photodetectors, the SIGNMOS will operate with signals between 1.2 and 1.6 micrometers, including the telecommunications bands near 1.31 and 1.55 micrometers.  Compared to current InGaAs photodetectors that operate in the communications bands, the SIGNMOS will be less expensive because of its easy integratability with standard silicon-based circuitry.  Another advantage over current free-space photodetectors is that the reception area of the SIGNMOS is independent of its bandwidth, so the detector can be large and hence more sensitive.  In Phase I POC demonstrated the feasibility of SIGNMOS by physics-based modeling and demonstration of a low-bandwidth prototype.  In Phase II POC plans to fabricate a fully operational 40 Gbps photoreceiver and demonstrate it with communication input from a 1.55-micrometer laser modulated at 40 Gbps.",

GaN is capable of producing very large DC power levels, and therefore very high heat fluxes and total heat load in each transmit receive (T/R) module.  In Phase I, an analytical system study confirmed that conventional thermal management approaches are not capable of maintaining the peak junction temperature less than its limiting operating value of 150 0C.  In the Phase I system study, a number of thermal management technologies were evaluated to quantify their impact on the peak junction temperature.  The two technologies identified for Phase II development are micro-heat pipes (MHP) that would be integrated into the T/R module stack-up (used for heat spreading) and vapor chamber mounting plates.  The VCP transports heat efficiently to the side rail coolant channels.  A combined analytical and experimental PII program will develop and demonstrate these technologies at the component and then system levels, ultimately transitioning these technologies to a maturity for insertion into a system in the next 3-5 years.",

The Phase II program will design, fabricate, and test a carbon-carbon primary mirror.  Figure and surface finish will be achieved through a combination of carbon-carbon substrate replication, SiOx, glass, coating applied to the substrate using a vacuum deposition process, and magneto-rheological finishing.  In addition, a chemical vapor infiltration process will be used to fill the pores and provide a seal coat in the carbon-carbon to preclude dust and moisture contamination during storage and operation.  The two characteristics that differentiate carbon-carbon from other materials are radiation hardening and dimensional insensitivity to moisture.  The primary benefits of carbon-carbon are lower cost and reduced fabrication lead time.

TRI/Austin proposes a completely different coating system that is resistant to the high-energy impact damage caused by FOD.  The coating cures rapidly, does not contain volatile organic compounds and is non-toxic when cured.  It can be easily applied or repaired in the field or maintenance depot.  The combination of this impact resistant coating and a non-toxic primer will replace the poor-performing, toxic coating system currently in use.",

        "abstract": "MicroEnergy Technologies is developing an autonomous cooling module, capable of removing waste heat fluxes of up to 1000 W/cm^2 from electronics and other devices.  The cooling module will utilize an extremely efficient microchannel heatsink geometry and two-phase (boiling) flow to maximize heat transfer rates.  The heat transfer will be further enhanced through the use of nanofluids with uniquely beneficial thermophysical properties. The module will utilize a number of technological innovations to create a self-pumped device that requires no electrical power input.  The combination of these technologies will result in a compact, robust, high-performance cooling module that can be adapted to a wide range of thermal management problems.  Phase II will build on the foundations of technological feasibility laid during Phase I, with the ultimate goal of creating a working prototype of an autonomous cooling module.  This development work will lead us to a series of design guidelines that will be used to create one or more commercializable products during Phase III of the project.",

        "abstract": "Recent military efforts have illustrated the difficulty for conventional weapons to find and defeat \"deep-targets\" that are concealed, guarded, mobile, or even buried.  Examples include underground hardened bunkers, cave/tunnel systems, and mobile SCUD launchers.  Miniature robotics could be used to find,  collect data, track, and even defeat such targets, but the robots need to be well coordinated, and possess an intelligence for creatively achieving their mission.     A distributed robotics system architecture is proposed that allows a swarm of heterogeneous robots to be dropped into an area, and perform deep-target reconnaissance missions. Included in this approach are the collections of intelligent behaviors that control the individual robots, and the mechanisms for selection and composition of compound behaviors.  The architecture takes into account the unique requirements and characteristics of the miniature robotic hardware, the communications, the power constraints, and types of locomotion and sensors that are anticipated to be present in the system.  In Phase I, the distributed robotic software architecture was designed, and prototype behaviors are being implemented for analysis.  During Phase 2, the system will be implemented and tests performed in simulation.  Post Phase 2 plans include demonstration upon a collection of miniature robots already under development by our team.",

The archetypal example system in which we are interested is the LOCAAS smart munition. The algorithms we propose to develop, however, will be broadly applicable to any number of seeker, interceptor, and semi-autonomous munition systems.     Leveraging recent research in optical flow and active contours with proven filtering technologies of direct applicability in tracking for systems such as the Air Borne Laser, we will develop a suite of algorithms to determine feature positions over time within scenes observed by imaging-sensor-bearing munitions.  The feature positions over time are then to be used for improved track and guidance accuracy.  Much more general and flexible than traditional correlation trackers, the optical flow methodology adapts well to scaling and aspect angle changes.  Coupled with efficient temporal models and filters, the optical flow and active contours can maintain the location of multiple targets in a scene with great accuracy.",

There is a need for methods that process HRR profiles on-the-fly, enhance their features, discover the salient features, and learn robust representations from a small number of views. In Phase I we demonstrated feasibility of pattern enhancement and learning methods based on neural models of human visual processing, learning, and recognition that provide a novel approach to address this need. Promising simulation results using datasets of military targets indicate that these methods can be exploited in the field to improve the association between GMTI detections and tracks.

We will analyze and enhance stability of HRR feature discovery and learning & recognition, and enable the incorporation of a priori knowledge.

This change is expected to impact 10 percent of the nation's drinking water systems; the vast majority of those impacted are small, rural water suppliers. New approaches, particularly simple, adsorption-based technologies are needed to provide cost effective treatment options for small water suppliers.     In Phase I, ADA showed that its Amended SilicateT arsenic sorbent exhibited 3-4 times greater capacity for arsenic versus commercial media in a simulated Edwards AFB water. In addition, the material is effective on arsenite and arsenate, and is insensitive to pH over the normal range of drinking water. In Phase II the team will optimize production and performance of the Amended SilicateT material and demonstrate a complete arsenic removal system based on the use of the sorbent. Small pilot units will be fabricated and tested in laboratory and field settings. These prototype units will be small in size to minimize water usage, but will be fully automated and will incorporate all components of a full-scale design.

Specially, for military applications, thermally stable fuels will: (a) allow cooling of turbine components while maintaining higher turbine cycle temperature, (b) increase thrust-to-weight ratio, (c) reduce maintenance, (d) remove the need for specialty fuels, and (e) and reduce take-off weight.     Normal fuels tend to form various deposits at relatively low temperatures due to oxidative reactions between the fuel and dissolved oxygen (from fuel exposed to air during fuel handling).  This deposition can be minimized or eliminated by either using additives that suppress thermal oxidative reactions, or by removing the dissolved oxygen in the fuel.  Fuel additives provide limited gains in thermal stability (225\u00b0F) and increase the complexity, whereas the thermal stability of de-oxygenated fuels can be increased by as much as 900\u00b0F.  Vesta Sciences has developed a proprietary and unique de-oxygenation system which is capable of reducing the dissolved oxygen levels below 1 ppm.

        "abstract": "An essential capability of an information gathering architecture is the ability to adapt to dynamic re-tasking requirements (i.e. the ability to manage real-time moding, pointing, and directing of ISR sensors) commensurate with the decision-making time scale of tactical, battlefield operations.  Reliance on reactive dynamic re-tasking alone is likely to require excessive sensing resources to meet tactical time-lines.  A more efficient and robust approach is to develop semi-automated planning tools that are capable of generating collection plans that hedge against uncertainty to provide robustness to expected contingencies (e.g., pop-up tasks, degradation of sensor performance, loss of a sensor, etc.). ALPHATECH is uniquely qualified to address the problem of robust collection planning for effective dynamic re-tasking of ISR assets. ALPHATECH has been at the forefront of developing new technology for ISR collection planning and management. A significant challenge confronting the generation of robust plans is properly balancing between the accommodation of contingencies, performing wide area surveillance, and collecting against known targets.  This proposal addresses the challenge of robust collection planning using an innovative optimization approach incorporating models for contingencies and developing plans that balance the potentially conflicting objectives of an ISR collection manager.",

        "abstract": "There is currently an urgent need for the development of novel penetrator concepts capable of defeating hardened concrete reinforced targets.  The use of a hard nose and high strength and high toughness steel can result in significant improvement in the penetrator performance.  It follows, that the creation of a conceptual penetrator with a very high hardness nose structure, followed by a high strength and high toughness steel, will be ideal.  The difficulty in fabricating this conceptual penetrator provides a tremendous challenge to the material science and engineering discipline.  The key impediments to the development of such penetrators are the difficulty in the economic fabrication of the hard nose and its integration with the trailing steel structure.     Phase I investigations have successfully demonstrated the ability of powder injection molding (PIM) technique to produce high hardness tungsten carbide nose structures, which has also been successfully integrated with a trailing steel section.  Phase II program will build on this concept, optimize the properties, and develop a process for the economic fabrication of such hard nosed penetrators in large numbers.  Success in this project will result in a new class of penetrator whose performance will be superior compared to state-of-the-art penetrators.",

A key goal of this SBIR is to meet critical information needs of the 45 SW's Knowledge Management Initiative (KMI) that will enable them to carry out their mission more effectively and at less cost.  The 45 SW envisions a single integrated range picture serving critical information needs for the entire spaceport community.  This effort will tackle three key challenges in making the vision a reality.  First, we will link today's disconnected information stovepipes to build an integrated view of information.  Next, we will make that integrated view available to solution builders by publishing a web services API.  Finally, we will serve up two new web-delivered applications to the spaceport community: a general information finder, and the Vista tool for visualizing range-wide resource allocation.",

We discover and develop high-value features and templates extracted from multi-sensor and multi-look data, and enhance their utility using model-based and learing-based feature level fusion (and hypothesis level fusion).  This optimization is performed in a statistical framework for robustness, and is cast in an integrated platform that links ATR and tracking algorithms with target physics databases, data processing and feature extraction capabilties, and noise and scenario generators.  Genetic algorithms are used to drive the optimal feature/template selection and fusion engine design process. Feature/template and fusion utility is assessed by measuring tracker and ATR MOPs such as track purity, and probability of correct assocation and id over a suitable distribution of operating conditions, scenarios and noise processes.  The data modalities considered include radar, laser and infrared.  Super resolution methods are applied to develop improved feature types from image and profile data, and to enhance the quality of their construction. The methodology can be used to improve performance MOPS across diverse scenarios, reduce computational complexity, provide natural objective functions for sensor resource management, and inform design of Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) experiments.",

The decline in the use of Ada has led to a fall in the supply of trained personnel, and a reduction in tool vendor support.  Migration to a new language is usually technically and economically infeasible, so programs such as THAAD have a huge legacy code problem.  A common problem with such systems is how to make modifications so as to adapt them to changing requirements in a way that poses little risk to the integrity of the code.  We propose a tool based on refactoring --- the disciplined transformation of code to improve its design while retaining its essential semantics.  In Phase I we implemented a proof-of-concept prototype capable of performing transformations important for safety-critical code, and demonstrated it to potential customers at Boeing and Lockheed Martin.  We have secured an agreement with Boeing for its use and evaluation during Phase II.  The prospects for commercial success are excellent, as our initial market research indicates strong demand.

However, because of inevitable trades between resources and capability, there remains a strong need for standardized architecture for implementing experiments requiring high computational and data acquisition throughput.  Further, because there is frequently a need to integrate several experiments on a single satellite, modularization allows individual teams to develop its functions with less impact and reduced risk than for a highly-integrated experiment.  In Phase I, we defined a modularized architecture for a payload computer and data acquisition/control system. In Phase II, we will develop enabling technologies, together with systems engineering capabilities, that will make possible the demonstration of satellites having transformational capabilities in a small-sat package and at a small-sat price.

As the deployed size of payloads grows without increasing stowed volume, the complexity of the mechanical deployment schemes increase correspondingly.  Traditionally, control of deployment is the responsibility, not of the payload developer, but of the small-sat spacecraft integrator who has responsibility for the electronics and software used to implement the deployment.  With increasingly complex deployable payloads this division of labor becomes increasingly problematic, and prompts the need for a general purpose deployment controller that can be programmed and used by the payload developer.     The Phase II program extends the development of our deployment controller from the feasibility study of Phase I to a prototype experiment computer and deployment control system applicable to the Deployed Structures Experiment (DSX).  The program consists of three main efforts:    Definition of system-level interfaces and requirements for the DSX satellite.

In addition to the need for flame and moisture resistance, many military applications require that the materials have impact and ballistic resistant properties.  Metals and ceramics are recognized to have good ballistic properties, but their densities are too high for applications that require mobility.  Conventional polymeric foam cores are designed to enhance the bending stiffness of structures.  Although current foamed structures normally have adequate impact properties for some applications, they do not have the required severe impact (ballistic) and flame resistant properties.  In our Phase I research, we proved that our proposed foamed sandwich composites posses all of the desirable properties mentioned above.  The processing technique of this foamed sandwich composite does not involve any toxic chemicals. They are extremely lightweight, and considering the threat level it can defeat, are excellent for applications that require mobility.  Additional features include high mechanical properties at elevated temperatures, ductility, and the ability to resist fragmentation from neighboring broken components.

The z-axis gyroscope can also be combined with a companion x-axis gyroscope, resulting in a second version of an integrated IMU.  Individual z-axis gyros selected for high performance can also be mounted on the sides of a pyramidal mount with orthogonal faces to achieve a non-integrated IMU.  This approach eliminates the need to align the gyros, since the input axis is normal to the mounting surface.",

        "abstract": "A newly developed \"coal-based\" porous graphite material has been recently produced. This development is a direct result of Touchstone Research Laboratory's Phase I funding to develop enhanced-strength carbon foam heat-exchanger materials for aerospace applications since low density carbon foams cannot endure high bleed air pressures in aerospace pre-coolers and heat exchangers.  The newly developed material indicates compressive strength of ~ 6000 psi in comparison with 200-700 psi for graphite foam.  In addition, the porous graphite has 3 times the thermal conductivity (55 W/m\u00b7K) of Inconel and significantly lower CTE indicating ~3.5 (1/\u00b0C), which should be beneficial in reducing thermal stress and improving durability.  Preliminary investigations show there will be no added costs related to the production of coal-based porous graphite since similar production methods are employed in the manufacture of other CFOAMr products lines.  This makes coal-based porous graphite extremely affordable relative to any other carbon and graphite currently on the market.  Touchstone and its partners propose to fabricate a heat exchanger core from porous graphite for pressure drop, heat flow and durability evaluations, which will ultimately lead to the construction of highly efficient, lightweight, and affordable replacements to current heat exchanger technologies in aerospace.",

This diminishes the benefits that can be achieved by UTC tracking in a jamming environment.  Under this proposed SBIR effort we will develop a high A/J direct acquisition mode for UTC signal processing.  Our proposed approach, termed UTC Assisted Acquisition, leverages aiding information that is provided to the weapon (Child) from the launch platform (Parent), to allow the weapon's GPS receiver to directly enter the UTC mode. The major innovation of the proposed approach is to use the Parent aiding data to reduce the UTC search space and leverage the UTC processing to use the combined set of satellite signals for acquisition for improved A/J protection.

The CBT/WBT approach consolidates individual incidents into a comprehensive plan that enables students to learn about root causes and types of SD and possible preventative measures.

However, current laboratory synthetic battlespace environments do not have the flexibility and fidelity to digitally simulate critical communication architectures, protocols, and effects.  Increasingly, programs such as the Aerial Common Sensor (ACS) and Joint Distributed Engineering Plant (JDEP) are using simulation environments to perform a variety of tasks from requirements analysis and concept evaluation to testing and evaluation.  As simulations become more widely used to support the full acquisition life-cycle, through simulation based acquisition, the importance of realistically modeling communications effects is becoming increasingly critical.  This Phase II proposal builds on a very successful Phase I effort in which we developed the design for an advanced HLA-based Communication server.  This HLA-based Communication Server is designed to fit seamlessly into distributed real-time simulation environments using tools developed by VTC for the JDEP infrastructure enhancement effort.  In addition, VTC had secured matching Fast Track funding from the ACS program, which has a requirement to model the effects of the network and communication infrastructure supported by the ACS systems.",

An actuator merit figure based on Phase I results of 3x reduced capacitance, 1.33x increase in stroke, greater temperature stability and cost shows that the NANO-TSC cofired actuator would be 2.67 compared to the standard Xinetics DM actuator of 0.38.  The NANO-TSC material exhibits a high fraction of single crystal properties, with high compositional uniformity, enhanced mechanical toughness.

The properties will be measured as functions of temperature, concentrations, pressure and strain rate.

Currently available countermeasure systems are costly, complex and not operationally acceptable.  Current MWS equipment cannot meet all of the requirements such as long-range detection, high angular resolution, low false alarm rate, and detection of missiles in high background clutter.  This program addresses the lack of MWSs that can detect surface-to-air missiles at long ranges in high clutter with a high probability of declaration and a low false alarm rate.    During the Phase I effort, DRA developed a promising two-color missile-warning sensor that operates in the visible spectrum (VMWS).  This silicon-based sensor exhibits many desirable capabilities for missile warning including high resolution, low cost, and high frame rate.  The two-color aspect of the sensor also serves to guard against false alarms due to sun glints.  DRA demonstrated VMWS feasibility by detecting live-fire missiles using a proof-of-concept sensor.  The Phase II effort leverages the substantial prior investment and research into VMWS and will build a new sensor with custom, wide field of view optics that allow the collection of spectrally pure color bands.",

This ability can be greatly improved if there are a variety of different technologies for target detection and discrimination, each responsible for a specific characteristic. The need to search for new target characteristics is driven in part by the continuing proliferation of countermeasures, including deployment of decoys and other deceit and concealment tactics.    Polarization signature is the unique polarization response of a target, affected only by the constitution and the shape. The proposed effort aims to develop an IR polarization imaging system based on an innovative Micro Patterned polarization filter technique, which can be integrated into the commercial camera platform.     Although the benefits of polarization imaging have been demonstrated at the conceptual level, development and deployment of military operator-oriented polarization imaging products have been thwarted by the complicated measurement scheme and by the lack of reliable polarization management devices and components. The focus of this proposal is to increase the level of maturity of the proposed polarization-imaging technology. A working prototype system will be demonstrated by integration of the Micro Patterned polarization filter into an off-the-shelf camera platform.",

Also features like average intensity may be easily masked using simple countermeasures.  PRA is proposing to expand upon the physics model and estimation procedures developed in Phase I to extract, in real-time from optical signatures, dynamics-based features such as coning angle, angular momentum vector, spin rate and precession rate.  These features reduce the dependency of discrimination on a priori information, make discrimination less susceptible to countermeasures and also simplify the training process.

        "abstract": "Combining area search and high confidence ID for moving and stationary targets on a tactical UAV-sized sensor platform presents challenges due to conflicting waveforms, limited aperture time and limited throughput.  In Phase 1, we developed an innovative solution to this problem, which is applicable to both GMTI and SAR.  In Phase 2, we propose to demonstrate a prototype sensor that realizes this solution.    Our approach is based on two ideas: concurrent data collection and multiple resolution processing.  Concurrent collection means that multiple data (e.g. GMTI and HRR, or SAR search and SAR ATR) are collected at the same time to maximize aperture usage.  Multiple resolution processing means that low resolution detections efficiently cue computationally-intensive high resolution processing.  These two factors, employed in both GMTI/HRR and SAR modes, combine to create a radar that is uniquely suited to track targets through move-stop-move scenarios and can be deployed on a tactical UAV-sized platform.    In Phase 2, we intend to modify our existing E-Series radar to demonstrate concurrent GMTI and HRR modes, to track and ID a moving target and determine when it stops, to form low and high resolution SAR images of the stopped target,  and to redetect and track the target when it moves.",

The suite will be designed for various small UAV platforms that operate as a team to perform missions; or contribute to a layered, networked environment that includes more powerful sensors on manned platforms or larger UAVs.   In Phase I, TSC defined innovative sensor combinations including MMW radar and LADAR that fit within the size, weight and power payload limitations of small UAVs.  TSC also identified promising small UAV systems and novel deployment concepts including swarms and parasitic configurations.  In Phase II, TSC will develop analysis tools; perform trade-offs; and conduct simulations to evaluate candidate small UAV sensor suites.  TSC will optimize an affordable sensor and UAV mix to meet AFRL cost goals; develop detailed CONOPS; and identify risk areas.  For Phase III, TSC plans to integrate these tools within existing AFRL M&S environments, and carry out an experimental demonstration with a UAV testbed.",

        "abstract": ": The development of cost-effective manufacturing technique for PMN-PT based piezoelectric single crystals with enhanced capabilities is critical to the achievement of the new generation of acoustic transduction devices. In Phase I, feasibility of the novel technique was demonstrated. The objective of this research project is to continue development of reducing the manufacturing costs for large-sized PMN-PT single crystals grown by a novel hybrid method, the combination of multi-crucible (8~10) Bridgman method and zone-leveling technique with a specially designed batch reservoir on crucibles. This hybrid method promises a cost-effective approach for mass production of large-sized PMN-PT single crystals with improved compositional uniformity and quality control. The distinctive features of the phase II project are that: (1) the number of crucibles/per furnace will be increased up to 10; (2) the diameter of each crucible will be enlarged up to 3 inches; (3) implementation of zone-leveling gives better control of compositional uniformity; (4) self-fabricated platinum crucible with a specially designed reservoir to enhance zone leveling effect with lower probability of crucible leaking, and (5) self-refurbishment of platinum crucibles further reduces the costs of manufacture. The proposed work is directed at evaluating PMN-PT crystal quality by relating piezoelectric properties with compositional analysis of the boules. Audit of the manufacturing costs for PMN-PT single crystals grown by this new method will be made by a detailed consideration of the costs for platinum, materials, man power, environmental control, equipment depreciation and capitalization. The proposed crystal growth method will be of immediate applicability to the fabrication of 2~3 inch-sized devices with uniform piezoelectric properties. Anticipated work in Phase II would be extended to larger sizes. The PMN-PT single crystal products, such as, poled or un-poled plates, disks, rings, cylinders and wedges, will be supplied to clients for the production of PiezoCrystal transduction devices for defense and civilian applications.",

Furthermore, process technology that facilitates the transition of a product (breadboard, brass board or prototype) from an R&D environment to any manufacturing environment (commercial, defense or both) is desirable. A key technology that shows bright promise is ultra-miniature electronics packaging to reduce launch costs and to ease radiation shielding thereby permitting use of less radiation resistant COTS parts. Irvine Sensors Corporation proposes to develop a low cost and reliable process for manufacturing densely packaged \"systems in a stack\" that dramatically reduces the weight and size of MDA systems.  This packaging approach is based on the Neo-StackT technology developed at ISC.  The goal is to produce heterogeneous miniature stacks containing diverse types of integrated circuits (ICs) in a design and fabrication environment that minimizes time to transition from the breadboard phase to a manufacturing environment adaptable to both defense and commercial applications.

Scientific Systems Company, Inc. of Woburn MA and its subcontractor, Lockheed Martin Tactical Systems (LMTS)  of Eagan MN, propose a foundational, joint control-theoretic approach to multisensor, multitarget sensor management.  It is based on three innovations: (1) a unified foundation for multisensor-multitarget data fusion based on the  multisensor-multitarget recursive Bayes filter; (2) approximations of this usually intractable filter, namely  first-order multitarget moment filters and multi-hypothesis correlator (MHC) filters; and (3) integration of these  filters with an intuitively meaningful, probabilistically rigorous, and potentially tractable objective functions:  the POSTERIOR EXPECTED NUMBER OF TARGETS (PENT), and its extension the POSTERIOR EXPECTED NUMBER OF TARGETS OF  INTEREST (PENTI).  For PENTI, sensors are optimally directed to preferentially collect observations from  targets  of current or potential significance.  Phase I showed the feasibility assessment for sensor management based on PENT & PENTI and demonstrated (1)  tractable  objective functions, (2) closed-form formulas for these objective functions, and (3) excellent sensor management  performance for simulated multi-target multi-sensor scenarios.  The primary focus of the Phase II will be to design and develop advanced approaches for sensor management capable of  encompassing a very broad range of applications and emphasize the development of a prototype integrated sensor  management algorithm to be tested using realistic multisensor data.  Specific Phase II tasks are: (1) Extend PENT  to the Multisensor Multistep Setting, (2) Extend PENTI to the Multisensor Multistep Setting, (3) Implement and Test  with Different Trackers, (4) Derive/Implement Performance Metrics with Target Preference, (5) Extend the Significance  Functions for Targets of Interests, (6) Characterize the Effectiveness, Strengths, and Limitations of the Algorithms, and  (7) Phase III, Transfer of Technology, and Commercialization.

In essence, SPEC corrosion detection IPT team will be able to access the condition of structures and recommend corrective action prior to events leading to excessive damage and eventual structural failure.  This is CBM for structures.  Corrosion is one of the major problems of commercial and military maintenance, costing billions of dollars annually in manpower and materials. With stretched operational and maintenance budgets, a system capable of detecting early onset of corrosion is essential to manage the corrosion problem.  SPEC seeks to extend its Ph1 effort to alleviate this corrosion dilemma by continuing the prototype fluorescent corrosion indicator (FCI) system for metal under paint. In addition, extend Ph1 feasibility study into a practical condition based maintenance (CBM) prototype for the application of a specialty FCI optical fiber for sensing corrosion, strain, temperature and potentially relative humidity within a reinforced concrete structure.    Part of the Phase II plan is to involve potential Phase III commercial users in field testing of CSHM system as reflected by the IPT put together by SPEC to lend both technical and commercial guidance.  3M views CSHM as a huge potential market for a new specialty fiber product line, application area that is virgin and have signed on to the IPT team for this reason.  University of Texas Center for Transportation Research (CTR) will facilitate involvement by Texas Department of Transportation (TxDoT) in Beta testing within the Texas highway system.  Successful results of field testing will lend legitimacy to the practical CBM commercial viability of CSHM deployment not only into the TxDoT transportation system but also into the federal system (USDoT).  CERL laboratories will also be used to confirm the FCI technology of the CSHM system.  Through CERL, military applications of CSHM will be pursed.    CSHM technology represents a very high payoff potential for the monitoring and maintenance of critical and high valve civilian structures, such as chemical reaction vessels and any steel and steel-reinforced concrete structures that are exposed to corrosive environments. SPEC, with IPT partners, will explore other possible industrial applications such as chemical processing, pharmaceutical, microelectronics, pulp and paper, aviation, and marine vessels.

The block processing architecture will enable improved dynamic performance, anti-jam capability, faster acquisition, less susceptibility to multi-path and robust performance. It will have novel navigational filters enabling improved A/J and robustness, easy transition to GPS/INS integration and RTK type processing. The receiver will be able to utilize all of the C/A, P and M-code as well as any one or two of such codes.  CRS has developed a novel software-based receiver development platform, which allows simulation of a variety of architectures, configurations, and situations, and when the simulation is complete, the simulated system can be implemented using FPGA's (pre-processors) as a real-time prototype.  We propose to use this development system for the design and development of novel architectures using alternate approaches to GPS receiver design. The software-based, flexible GPS receiver will allow innovative uses of GPS systems; it will allow numerous adaptations to be performed including the use of new frequencies and codes, and it will also allow quick adaptation for specialized niche applications.  During Phase I, we have developed and demonstrated the use of block processing for C/A, P and M code signals. The advantages of block processing over conventional time domain processing has been demonstrated. Feasibility of implementation of block processing using COTS technologies has been established. The Phase II efforts will provide a prototype receiver operating in real time and under realistic scenarios.

In our phase 1 effort, we developed a sensor management algorithm for collecting HRR MTI position and signature data at aspect angles that are predicted to be of use in the future.  The algorithm also tasks the collection of FTI position data on stopped targets so as to track targets as they start and stop.

Numerica has developed an advanced  STSS tracker and tested it extensively on government supplied scenarios.  Several key challenges remain when tracking closely spaced objects:  (1) some objects remain unresolved through most of midcourse;  (2) inconsistent object resolutions may persist over time or between  multiple sensor views;  and (3) an explosion in the number of observed targets can overwhelm any tracking system with  potential targets.    To advance the state-of-the-art this program develops signal processing, pixel-cluster  tracking, and group-cluster tracking  as integrated components that fuse and exploit all available information.  The new technology  allows us to decompose  pixel-clusters into subclusters and resolved objects  in support of accurate tracking and early discrimination.  Real-time tracking throughout the most challenging scenario scenes is maintained by temporarily resorting to group-cluster tracking.  The algorithms are to be fully integrated with Numerica's Multiple Frame Assignment  tracking system  to make better signal processing and data association decisions by exploiting information from  multiple frames of data. This integration  provides a rapid transfer of  the algorithm into MDA's BMD programs  and the commercial market.",

The FA-DST algorithm collects target feature measurements at the appropriate time and aspect such that the fusion and tracking system can both avoid misassociating measurements to tracks (thus avoid track switches) and correct track switches when the algorithm fails to prevent them due, perhaps, to the unavailability of features at the appropriate aspect. The domain of sensor tasks includes different radar modes and waveforms so that the feature database and the fusion and tracking module may best be serviced for different values of the expected signal-to-interference ratio, resolution, background traffic, vehicle classification and radar cross-section. The other module to be developed is the TOM. The TOM comprises several algorithms which model and propagate the uncertainty in associating vehicles to tracks, build and maintain a database of features that uniquely characterize each tracked object, and process received features to resolve potential track switches and breaks.

In this program we will design and build a single-aperture sensor mounted on an equatorial astronomical mount and a multi-aperture strap down sensor system without moving parts, as well as evaluate design changes for a deployable unit.  The first sensor will be used to measure the star limiting magnitude and probability of detecting stars. The second sensor will be used to measure the accuracy of a celestial fix. The multi-aperture unit views three areas of the sky separated by 120 degrees in azimuth using a single focal plane array, detects and identifies stars, and calculates three celestial lines-of-positions (LOPs) and a celestial fix. The sensor operates autonomously and delivers a latitude/longitude fix every 6 seconds with position error of less than 100 m. The sensor software includes a background subtraction and a SNR enhancement algorithm, star catalog, star pattern recognition software, software for mapping of the instrument axis, algorithm for computation of the LOPs and celestial fix, and low-level instrument-control code.  The field test will demonstrate that the hardware prototype of the ACNS meets all the performance goals.",

        "abstract": "Of particular consideration under VAATE I will be future requirements for long range strike aircraft. The sustained high mach usage requirements for the long range strike aircraft necessitate up to 10 times the requirement of F119. OEMs have indicated that in some cases the current fleet was flown hotter than expected and life was reduced on the order of 10 to 1. VEXTEC successfully demonstrated the potential for predicting creep-fatigue interaction based on bolt hole specimens. A significant difference was predicted for pure fatigue without creep, fatigue with global creep effects but no localized creep effects, and fatigue with both global and local creep consideration. The Phase I demonstration predicting valley dwell and peak dwell missions correlated with OEM experience. Phase I research consisted of damage nucleation and propagation (ie: transgranular verses intergranular effects), cyclic damage accumulation, cycle verses time dependence, and the availability of physics-based modeling approaches. Building on the Phase I work, the Phase II will develop a comprehensive methodology for predicting creep effects on fatigue life prediction for complex missions. This methodology will also consider environmental effects, such as embrittlement due to oxidation.",

        "abstract": "Asynchronous circuit design has the potential to offer orders of magnitude improvement in speed, power dissipation and EMI over synchronous circuit design. It is especially appealing to military electronics due to its extremely low EMI performance and its suitability as an enabling technology for heterogeneous system integration with high reliability and affordability. However, its real silicon success has been extremely limited due to lack of supporting design and test tools. In this SBIR project, we propose to develop three innovative CAD tools (CASTER, Arsyn-D and AFIST) to address the missing yet critical links for a complete clockless circuit design and test flow. CASTER (CMOS Asynchronous System Timing, Energy and Radiation) is the first CAD tool for silicon-accurate analysis and optimization of timing, power and EMI of asynchronous circuits. It provides a fast engine for clockless circuit optimization, as well as a standard tool and metrics for the final sign off of clockless design, and evaluation of different design styles. Arsyn-D is a million-transistor scale optimization tool for clockless circuits that incorporates automatic asynchronous topology selection to address military requirements. AFIST is the first realistic fault modeling based test generation and diagnosis tool for asynchronous circuits, based on innovative behavioral fault modeling technologies. We propose to team up with Boeing Solid State Electronics to demonstrate the proposed tools on military electronics design, in particular, to DARPA/CLASS program benchmarks.",

There are many military applications, including the projectile launchers on which the proposal focuses.   # By replacing the sensitive explosives in projectile launchers with Metafex, systems will be safer. Because the Metafex explosive replacement will be safer, it will be less costly to manufacture, to ship, and to use.   # In contrast to conventional ones, the proposed projectile launchers require no explosives. They are environmentally benign, can be safely shipped anywhere, and need no special handling. The projectile launchers will be inert until activated by energetic electrical pulses.   # In Phase II of the proposed project, Metafex projectile launchers will be built and tested, and system studies will be performed.",

A significant problem is targets moving in and out of hide sites, where track is lost and identification of targets emerging from hide is uncertain. In Phase I, we demonstrated feasibility of fusion of complementary sensing by airborne GMTI/HRR-radar and MSI/HSI spectral sensors to overcome these limitations and support long-duration tracking and reacquisition of targets emerging from hide. The proposed Phase II effort will create an integrated prototype system of combined GMTI tracking, HRR/HSI learning on-the-fly, and recognition of target signatures sensed from a space-based radar constellation augmented by one or more airborne HSI sensors. Tracking will be aided by HSI & HRR target features discovered while learning, and spatial context extracted using spectral data mining. Target learning will be guided by tracking, in conjunction with spectral anomaly detection to localize the target of interest in a small moving area. We will develop and transfer an integrated system based on this strategy using an existing multi-modality (EO, HSI) 3D urban site model, and embedded moving targets (possessing HSI and HRR signatures, and GMTI detections from the simulated radar constellation).",

Phase I of this effort refined and developed the concept of using Force Templates as a mechanism for integrating units and their clients into an infosphere. Phase II will implement a first-generation capability based on these concepts. The prototype will provide a mechanism for easily implementing and controlling the flow of information based on the operational requirements and organizational structure of the user community. The management components within the JBI infrastructure will use this operational context as the basis for selecting from a set of user-submitted information management policies those that are applicable to each individual client. This will provide a mechanism that not only addresses the problem of getting the right information to the right person at the right time, but also the problem of preventing the wrong information from reaching the wrong person.  The components implementing these functions will provide full flexibility in terms of operational domains. The software will be equally capable of managing infospheres supporting military, civilian, or private sector applications. A testbed will be provided in which the prototype software may be used to experiment with various operational procedures, thereby gaining insight into how a JBI might best be used in various situations.",

In Phase I we proved the feasibility of the approach and demonstrated strong adhesion to titanium, resistance to high temperature (over 1800F), insulating qualities, room temperature curing, and durability. In Phase II we refine the coating system to enhance service life, to provide a moisture and vapor barrier, to inhibit titanium embrittlement, and qualify it for B-2 flight test.

Telemetry files from the payload launch vehicle (PLV) and orbital/sub-orbital project (OSP) target launch vehicle were reduced between 15% and 50% respectively while maintaining data/time synchronization.   Phase II will continue the testing schedule and characterize the compressibility of data from all telemetry-sending devices involved in a THAAD test flight.  Since telemetry data must be synchronous to maintain the time coding, and since the effectiveness of loss-less compression varies with the details of the input, a characteristic ceiling must be established for a particular data stream.  Variable quality lossy compressed data (perhaps video feeds) will be used to fill all packets up to the characteristic ceiling.    Phase II will produce working prototypes of a compression/encryption device to be demonstrated in a relevant operational environment, but not fully flight qualified.

        "abstract": "Current methods of rubber/metal bonding lead to significant environmental\n\n  concerns. The largest single commercial rubber-bonding application is the bonding\n\n  of steel tire cords to sulfur-vulcanized natural rubber compounds. The current\n\n  processes require that cobalt be added to the rubber to provide durable bonds.\n\n  Cyanide also is used in the brass plating of steel tire cords. Tire separation\n\n  failures are too frequent, particularly on retread truck tires, causing roadway\n\n  hazards and visible environmental contamination. In nontire, automotive rubber-bonding\n\n  applications, a solvent-based adhesive process is used that suffers from environmental\n\n  shortcomings related to the collection and disposal of solvents.\n\nThe goal of this Phase II research project is to: (1) develop a system capable\n\n  of bonding tire cords to rubber for new tires and retreads that does not contain\n\n  cobalt or require cyanide-based plating, and (2) eliminate solvent pollutants\n\n  in other rubber-bonding applications. This system also will eliminate volatile\n\n  organic compounds in other rubber/metal-bonding applications. During Phase\n\n  I, Aeromet Technologies, Inc., developed excellent silane mixtures and methods,\n\n  including nanoparticle additions to improve silane coating thickness and interfacial\n\n  bonding. Hydrolyzed silanes for bonding rubber to metal surfaces have been\n\n  demonstrated successfully. Characterization techniques have identified the\n\n  chemical reactions for the mixed silanes, effects of nanoparticles, and the\n\n  bonding mechanism. A patent has been filed based on the work performed during\n\n  Phase I.\n\nThe scope of work for Phase II includes further characterization of the silane\n\n  mixtures with additives and the study of the actual bonds between the rubber\n\n  and the metal surfaces using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy\n\n  and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques. The newly identified\n\n  silane mixtures and application methods from Phase I will be optimized, and\n\n  production-run tire cords will be tested on prototype and production equipment\n\n  according to industry-accepted standards. Commercialization studies will include\n\n  market analysis, potential environmental improvements, and cost-saving opportunities\n\n  for the tire industry. The tire companies will provide rubber formulations\n\n  and identify physical tests. A tire cord manufacturer has committed to perform\n\n  demonstration tests at its facility, and two tire companies have prepared letters\n\n  of support for Phase II.\n\nBased on the success of Phase I, Aeromet Technologies, Inc., has obtained\n\n  the support of tire cord manufacturers and tire producers. There are excellent\n\n  opportunities for commercialization in nontire applications and in the tire\n\n  industry because of reduced environmental impact, lower costs, and additional\n\n  corrosion benefits over the current methods.",

CNT significantly enhances the electric conductivity\n\n  of composites at a low doping level (approximately 1 percent) with improved\n\n  mechanical strength. The application of such advanced conductive composites\n\n  will result in significant economic and environmental benefits. For example,\n\n  a clean electrostatic coating can be applied directly to the CNT- filled conductive\n\n  composites used in automobile body panels and parts, and the existing spray-over-conductive\n\n  primer process with high volatile organic compounds can be eliminated. That\n\n  application alone will save more than 250 million pounds of painted fascia\n\n  material used in automobiles each year.\n\nCurrently, there are two major hurdles that prevent successful commercialization\n\n  of the advanced CNT-filled composites. The first is the high cost and limited\n\n  availability of high-quality CNT. The second is the dispersion and bonding\n\n  problems of the CNT in plastic composites. Advanced catalysts and processes\n\n  need to be discovered to dramatically improve the yield of high-quality and\n\n  high-purity CNT, and directly make high-quality CNT with specific morphologies\n\n  that are readily dispersible in plastics.\n\nThe Intematix Corporation has proposed this project in response to these\n\n  technical and commercial challenges from the marketplace. Intematix accomplished\n\n  all of the Phase I objectives. The most active and efficient catalyst compositions\n\n  to produce high-quality CNT were discovered by synthesizing and studying more\n\n  than 10,000 different CNT catalyst compositions. The new catalysts start synthesizing\n\n  CNT at temperatures as low as 350\u00b0C, with a catalytic yield of CNT double that\n\n  of the best known catalyst under identical CNT synthesis conditions. High-quality\n\n  CNTs of various dimensions and morphologies can be synthesized selectively\n\n  with different catalyst compositions. Novel morphologies of CNT, such as DNA-like\n\n  &quot;double helix&quot; and &quot;nano-ribbon,&quot; have been demonstrated.\n\nIn Phase II, Intematix proposes to develop an innovative chemical vapor deposition\n\n  process with the capability of mass-producing high-quality CNT at the cost\n\n  target that enables its commercialization in the advanced conductive composites.\n\n  Intematix is teaming up with a leading global composite producer that has established\n\n  commercialization channels and customer bases for the low-cost and high-performance\n\n  CNT-filled conductive composites.

Immunoassays allow the highly selective detection of a\n\n  wide variety of substances of organic and biological origin using a very sensitive\n\n  approach. IOS is developing a technology to conduct these selective and sensitive\n\n  assays in a continuous or periodic manner. \n\nPhase I demonstrated the feasibility of detecting polyaromatic hydrocarbons\n\n  down to concentrations of 10 parts per billion or less using this new technique.\n\n  Improved limits of detection may be expected through refinement of spectroscopic\n\n  labeling techniques. The goal of this Phase II research project is to fabricate\n\n  and field test prototype monitors for contaminants with industrial partners.\n\n  The protection of water used for human consumption or other human exposures\n\n  is a primary application for the planned contaminant monitor because the safety\n\n  of water can be improved markedly by the more frequent monitoring of specific\n\n  common contaminants, especially if the threat of high concentrations is known\n\n  to be present. IOS monitors will be very useful at water treatment facilities,\n\n  within water distribution systems, and at food processing plants to guard against\n\n  contaminants and biohazards.\n\nWater monitoring for the presence of contaminants also has an important role\n\n  in pollution prevention. Significant threats to the environment are presented\n\n  by known sources of contamination that ultimately may migrate to water sources\n\n  used by humans, animals, and agricultural crops. The potential migration of\n\n  underground contaminants through barriers can be minimized or eliminated by\n\n  periodic or continuous monitoring. In applications where contaminated sites\n\n  are being remediated, monitoring on a periodic or continuous basis can be used\n\n  to assess the effectiveness of the process and to assure that the remediation\n\n  process does not unintentionally spread contaminants further into the environment.",

        "abstract": "Aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs) are among the most popular fire-fighting\n\n  foams used against fuel and oil fires because of their effectiveness and their\n\n  ease of application. Unfortunately, recent studies have shown that certain\n\n  fluorosurfactants used in AFFFs are toxic to aquatic life and tend to accumulate\n\n  in the blood of animals and humans. The manufacturer recently has phased out\n\n  these surfactants. Current AFFF concentrates contain fluorosurfactants that\n\n  are chemically different from those that have been phased out. However, the\n\n  toxicity and persistency in the environment of these fluorosurfactants are\n\n  unknown and are under investigation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n\n  and the Fire Fighting Foam Coalition, a group that represents AFFFs and fluorosurfactant\n\n  manufacturers. Thus, their future presence in the market is unsure. Therefore,\n\n  the fire-fighting industry needs new environmentally friendly foaming agents\n\n  and foam stabilizers that will replace fluorosurfactants in fire-fighting foams.\n\nThe goal of this research project is to develop a new, fluorine-free fire-fighting\n\n  foam based on TDA Research, Inc.'s (TDA) proprietary additives. During\n\n  Phase I, TDA began developing novel fluorine-free foam stabilizers for fire-fighting\n\n  foam concentrates. It was shown that TDA foams are up to 60 times more stable\n\n  than current AFFFs, and that the foam stability can be finely tuned over a\n\n  wide range by properly selecting the chemistry of the additives and the composition\n\n  of the solutions. TDA demonstrated that additives can be formulated into a\n\n  concentrate that can be used with commercial fire-fighting equipment, and that\n\n  TDA's foams can be used to extinguish hydrocarbon fires. TDA also identified\n\n  new surfactant types that, in combination with TDA's foam stabilizers,\n\n  offer the potential to make effective fluorine-free AFFFs. During the course\n\n  of the Phase I project, contacts were beginning to be established with representatives\n\n  of the fire-fighting industry, and many of them expressed an interest in this\n\n  research and in the promising preliminary results.\n\nDuring Phase II, TDA will continue to work toward the optimization and commercialization\n\n  of fluorine-free foam concentrates in collaboration with commercial partners.\n\n  TDA also will evaluate the toxicity and biodegradability of the resulting product\n\n  and its compliance with fire-fighting standards and environmental regulations.",

        "abstract": "During Phase I of this research project, ADA Technologies, Inc. (ADA) identified\n\n  a new class of amended silicate sorbents, based on a novel amendment chemistry\n\n  and amendment process. During Phase I, static bed testing identified sorbents\n\n  with mercury capacities as high as 12,000 g per gram of sorbent. Testing of\n\n  the new sorbents in a dynamic, in-flight test rig constructed during the Phase\n\n  I project showed 85 percent mercury control at dosage rates of less than 7\n\n  lbs/MMacf. Testing of flue gas desulfurization powdered activated carbon under\n\n  identical conditions consistently showed a significantly poorer performance.\n\nIn Phase II, ADA will optimize the chemistry and preparation of the new sorbents\n\n  to minimize costs compared to the current amended silicate sorbent formulation\n\n  and will evaluate their performance in laboratory-scale test rigs under both\n\n  static and dynamic conditions. Testing of the best formulations then will progress\n\n  to a pilot-scale demonstration on a slipstream from an operating power plant\n\n  to validate laboratory test data. The Phase II investigations will include\n\n  testing the stability of the captured mercury in spent sorbents under three\n\n  different leaching protocols. The sorbents, mixed with fly ash, also will be\n\n  evaluated as concrete additives. In the Phase II Commercialization Option,\n\n  ADA will prepare a 4,000 lb batch of sorbent to conduct a full-scale demonstration\n\n  at a commercial power plant.\n\nIt is anticipated that these amended silicates will provide a significant\n\n  cost advantage over activated carbon, the current baseline technology, on the\n\n  basis of cost, mercury capacity, and the ability to continue the use of fly\n\n  ash as a concrete additive. The inability to use fly ash containing activated\n\n  carbon as a concrete additive could double or triple the overall costs of mercury\n\n  control for the utility industry. Furthermore, the need to replace fly ash\n\n  currently used in concrete with Portland cement will add $750 million to the\n\n  Nation's cost of dealing with mercury emissions, and also will lead to\n\n  the release of an additional 12 million tons of carbon dioxide.

        "abstract": "The current flue gas purification technologies are expensive, energy intensive,\n\n  and secondary pollution generating. Most of these technologies only remove\n\n  a single pollutant from flue gases. For example, the prevailing limestone-based\n\n  scrubber not only is expensive and energy consuming, but also generates a large\n\n  amount of liquid and solid wastes.\n\nThe goal of the Phase I research project was to establish the feasibility\n\n  of using the carbon-polymer matrix (CPM) material for flue gas purification\n\n  applications. The proposed CPM material removes sulfur dioxide (SO2), mercury\n\n  vapor (both elemental mercury and mercury oxide), and fine particles simultaneously\n\n  from flue gas. Because of its unique physical-chemical properties, the material\n\n  removes SO2 by converting it into concentrated sulfuric acid without requiring\n\n  a complicated material-regeneration process. It also removes mercury vapor\n\n  by a chemical-fixation process and removes fine particles by a surface-filtration\n\n  process.\n\nPhase I clearly established the feasibility of using CPM material for flue\n\n  gas purification applications. During Phase I, the CPM materials were synthesized\n\n  and characterized, the unique acid solution-expelling capability or the self-regenerative\n\n  capability of the CPM material was demonstrated, very high flue gas SO2 and\n\n  mercury removal efficiencies (more than 97 percent) were achieved, and the\n\n  long-term performance stability of flue gas purification was observed.\n\nBased on the success of the Phase I project, the goal of Phase II is to further\n\n  develop and commercialize this innovative technology. During the Phase II project,\n\n  the CPM material synthesis will be optimized and scaled up, the CPM-based flue\n\n  gas purification system will be studied and designed, a prototype unit will\n\n  be constructed, and a small-scale field demonstration will be carried out.\n\nIf successful, an innovative coal-burning flue gas purification technology\n\n  will be developed and commercialized.

        "abstract": "The SBIR Phase I research project was very successful. Field results in commercial\n\n  applications showed an operational air/volatile organic compound (VOC) selectivity\n\n  of 27. Performance surpassed the California Air Resource Board (CARB) emissions\n\n  goal. Equally as important, Compact Membrane Systems, Inc. (CMS) demonstrated\n\n  further membrane improvements with a novel membrane product concept.\n\nMajor advantages of CMS membrane technology include: (1) it is recovery versus\n\n  abatement driven, (2) product and manufacturing has been established, and (3)\n\n  it has broad platform capabilities and a strong patent position. This combination\n\n  provides for a very powerful and broad VOC recovery program. Although the program\n\n  focus is gasoline underground storage tanks (UST), the technology developed\n\n  in this project will have broad value for many other VOC emission sources.\n\nThe high gas transport and chemical resistance of CMS' reverse separation\n\n  membrane (RSM) provides the opportunity to use them as process recovery devices\n\n  to recover high-value materials such as reactor feeds, products, and solvents,\n\n  and return them to process. Examples of a broader utility of CMS' RSM\n\n  for other VOC recovery applications include tank farms and marine terminals,\n\n  offshore oil production operations, dry cleaning, chemical and polymer manufacturing\n\n  process vents, and soil vapor extraction.\n\nData indicate that a market need exists well past 2020, and that CMS is the\n\n  first to seek CARB certification. No other technology presently is in place\n\n  to meet CARB gasoline UST requirements. Conventional VOC recovery membranes\n\n  (silicone rubber) preferentially transport organic vapors over air. This system\n\n  is less appropriate for air venting in USTs. Therefore, CMS developed perfluoro\n\n  polymer RSMs that allow for rapid air venting while retaining gasoline in USTs.\n\n  The CMS membrane system has excellent chemical and thermal stability. \n\nBased on these successes, CMS will perform extensive Phase II field demonstrations.\n\n  These extensive field demonstrations can be achieved in Phase II based on existing\n\n  strong commercial and developmental relationships that CMS has in place. These\n\n  include commercial and licensing arrangements with two large industrial membrane\n\n  companies as well as relationships with major companies servicing USTs. Phase\n\n  II activities will include:\n\n&#8226; Building and testing a prototype system for field demonstrations\n\n  on USTs.\n\n&#8226; Expanding demonstrations to include both summer (low volatility)\n\n  and winter (high volatility) fuels. Also, demonstrating the prototype on both\n\n  balanced and vacuum UST systems.\n\n&#8226; Demonstrating that both the CMS system and product have value beyond\n\n  USTs by demonstrating performance on VOC recovery from a non-UST system.\n\n&#8226; Using the above results, perform detailed engineering analyses (to\n\n  determine whether other applications) CMS system is justified on economic recovery\n\n  or environmental terms.\n\n&#8226; Demonstrate whether the CMS VOC recovery technology is a broad technology\n\n  platform.",

Most cyanobacterial\n\n  blooms, however, are not toxic. Furthermore, bloom toxicity will change over\n\n  time. Therefore, cyanobacterial identification is not enough; toxin presence\n\n  must be confirmed. There are many biological/toxicological methods available\n\n  to detect these toxins. The main drawback of these biological techniques is\n\n  that they are time consuming, laboratory-based, and require significant technical\n\n  expertise. With dynamic systems such as cyanobacterial blooms, detection and\n\n  identification of toxins should be conducted as quickly as possible, preferably\n\n  in the field. \n\nThe goal of this research project is to develop a field-portable automated\n\n  sensor based on Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) that can be used\n\n  by nonspecialists. The entire system will weigh approximately 10 pounds and\n\n  will detect the different toxins through a simple dipstick arrangement. SERS\n\n  spectroscopy, which directly measures chemical bonding, theoretically would\n\n  allow direct determination of all analytes; however, practical identification\n\n  of the desired toxins in the presence of nontoxic bacteria and other chemical\n\n  constituents in the water supply could become unwieldy. There are methods by\n\n  which SERS substrates can be made specific for certain analytes using chemical\n\n  modifications. These modifications can alter the surface chemistry to attract\n\n  chemicals with a certain electronegativity, pH, or chemical reactivity. EIC\n\n  Laboratories, Inc., (EIC) will use the latter and develop SERS substrates highly\n\n  specific for the toxins of interest. \n\nPhase I demonstrated the potential for SERS as a cyanotoxin sensor, in which\n\n  cylindrospermopsin, microcystins, anatoxin-a, saxitoxins, and domoic acid all\n\n  were detected. Rapid detection of high fg toxin quantities was demonstrated\n\n  with the SERS sensor. Phase II will expand the SERS sensor capabilities to\n\n  detect microcystin, anatoxin-as, nodularin, domoic acid, and other EPA-defined\n\n  cyanotoxins of interest. In Phase II, EIC will develop an easy-to-use, automated\n\n  cyanotoxin methodology that will be tested at an environmental laboratory;\n\n  a prototype field-portable sensing system that will weigh approximately 10\n\n  lbs. also will be designed. The sensor will be capable of being immersed in\n\n  surface water by a field engineer for rapid results, mounted at a processed\n\n  water facility for continuous monitoring, or used at an environmental laboratory\n\n  as a sample prescreener.

        "abstract": "Uncontrolled oxidation of sulfide minerals in mine wastes causes acid rock\n\n  drainage (ARD) that contaminates receiving waters with acid and heavy metals.\n\n  ARD is an enormous environmental problem, and the most significant environmental\n\n  issue faced by the mining industry. Effectively dealing with ARD has been and\n\n  continues to be a formidable challenge for which no global solutions exist.\n\n  Existing technology for controlling ARD at the source by stopping oxidation\n\n  of sulfide minerals still is rudimentary and aims to stop either chemical oxidation\n\n  or biological oxidation, but not both. Both of these chemical and biological\n\n  processes are important in the formation of ARD. Consequently, both processes\n\n  must be controlled for a comprehensive solution to the problem.\n\nThe overall goal of this Phase II research project is to develop a comprehensive\n\n  solution to the ARD problem by rendering sulfide rock nonreactive to chemical\n\n  and biological oxidation. The approach involves a combined treatment involving\n\n  chemical coating and the use of thiocyanate, which is highly and selectively\n\n  inhibitory to acidophilic microorganisms that catalyze ARD formation. Furthermore,\n\n  the control of microbial activity may prolong the longevity of chemical coatings\n\n  that are subject to failure under the severe ARD conditions caused by biooxidation.\n\nThe specific goals of this Phase II project are to: (1) determine quantitatively\n\n  the effectiveness of the combined treatment in preventing ARD from developing\n\n  when applied to fresh waste rock or tailings; (2) determine the effectiveness\n\n  of the combined treatment in controlling an existing ARD situation; (3) estimate\n\n  the cost for this ARD treatment; (4) develop an engineering plan for application\n\n  of the treatment at mine sites; (5) obtain preliminary information on the feasibility\n\n  of producing a combined controlled-release product; and (6) determine if consolidated\n\n  phosphate clay waste may be used as a source of phosphate rock. Phase II laboratory\n\n  tests will be conducted with sulfidic rock from collaborating mining companies\n\n  that are prepared to conduct field trials if the results are promising.\n\nPhase I results were encouraging, showing that the combined treatment could\n\n  be highly effective both in preventing ARD and in controlling existing ARD.\n\n  Phase I research and development involved laboratory-accelerated weathering\n\n  tests employing sulfidic rock from a gold mine in Nevada. Preliminary estimates\n\n  indicated that the combined treatment would be less costly than existing technology\n\n  for ARD prevention and control. Furthermore, even where complete control was\n\n  not obtained, the improvement in water quality with the combined treatment\n\n  would result in a substantial reduction in capital and operating costs for\n\n  conventional water treatment, and far less sludge would be produced. \n\nThe combined treatment approach has the potential to greatly reduce the costs\n\n  and environmental impacts from ARD. It has wide applicability to mining situations,\n\n  including application to tailings and waste rock to prevent or treat ARD. It\n\n  could be used by mining companies for ARD control during or following mining.\n\n  The component chemicals of the combined treatment are readily available and\n\n  inexpensive. In some cases, the components already are available at mining\n\n  sites in process waste streams. Nonetheless, there also may be the opportunity\n\n  to develop a combined controlled-release product.",

Existing treatment methods are imperfect in that they are either\n\n  slow, expensive, or unable to treat the full spectrum of groundwater contaminants.\n\n  Prior work has demonstrated that zero valent iron can detoxify groundwater\n\n  contaminated with halogenated hydrocarbons and other toxic chemicals. The beneficial\n\n  chemical reactions occur on the particle surface so an ideal, kinetically active\n\n  powder will offer a large surface area per unit mass. Traditional iron materials\n\n  are inexpensive but contain coarse particles and provide a low surface area\n\n  of only 0.1 to 0.4 m2/g of powder. Accordingly, these powders react slowly\n\n  and often are unable to treat the full spectrum of groundwater contaminants.\n\n  Recently, nanocrystalline iron powders with a surface area of greater than\n\n  10 m2/g have been marketed, but these materials either are prohibitively expensive,\n\n  not available in large quantities, or contain a significant amount of nonreactive\n\n  iron oxide.\n\nThe goal of this research project is to apply OnMaterials' expertise\n\n  in powder synthesis and processing to produce a lower-cost, high-surface area,\n\n  zero valent iron for the remediation marketplace. A series of experiments were\n\n  performed that identified materials and processing conditions to produce iron\n\n  with a surface area 10-20 times greater than existing low-cost powders. The\n\n  OnMaterials synthesis process also is capable of producing powder containing\n\n  embedded secondary metals. These multimetallic materials are beneficial because\n\n  they catalyze the production of hydrogen gas that increases the reaction rate.\n\n  When the benefits of the multimetallic system were coupled with the high surface\n\n  area, OnMaterials' powder provided very rapid reaction kinetics. When\n\n  a small amount of powder was added to an aqueous tricholorethylene solution,\n\n  OnMaterials powder accomplished the removal of all chlorinated compounds in\n\n  less than 1 day. In contrast, commercially available iron powder showed negligible\n\n  reactivity after 1 week in the same solution.\n\nThe highly reactive powder will allow for the end user to use a lesser powder\n\n  quantity to remediate a given amount of contaminant with a concurrent reduction\n\n    in application costs. The high reactivity also will allow for the treatment\n\n    of reduction-resistant groundwater contaminants. When successfully developed,\n\n    scaled, and commercialized, the product can positively impact the $5 billion\n\n    per year remediation marketplace, not only for chlorinated solvents, but\n\n  also for other toxic chemicals, including chromates, arsenic, and perchlorate.",

The primary goal of this Phase II research project is to standardize,\n\n  validate, and commercialize an amphibian lifecycle model using Xenopus as a\n\n  system for the evaluation of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) found in\n\n  the workplace or in the environment. Specifically, Fort Environmental Laboratories,\n\n  Inc., standardized and evaluated the use of X. tropicalis as a model system\n\n  to evaluate the effect of EDCs on various aspects of the amphibian lifecycle\n\n  by conducting studies with a series of known mammalian EDCs and chemicals with\n\n  unknown activity. 17&szlig;-estradiol (E2), androstene dione, and methoxychlor\n\n  were used to develop and standardize the model. Results from these studies\n\n  were used to generate a final study protocol from which a Guidance Document\n\n  ultimately will be prepared following Phase II interlaboratory validation studies.\n\nResults from Phase I strongly indicated that chronic exposure to E2 slightly\n\n  delayed development, had a marginal affect on the normalcy of early larval\n\n  development, dramatically skewed sex ratios toward the female gender, induced\n\n  gonadal malformations that included some intersexual development at low test\n\n  concentrations, and induced liver abnormalities. Furthermore, chronic E2 exposure\n\n  impaired both female and male reproductive fitness. Chronic exposure to E2\n\n  decreased breeding success in both sexes, decreased fertilization in exposed\n\n  females, and decreased embryo-larval viability in the F1 progeny.\n\nChronic exposure to androstene dione dramatically skewed sex ratios toward\n\n  the male gender, induced gonadal malformations that included some intersexual\n\n  development at low test concentrations, and caused liver abnormalities. Androstene\n\n  dione reduced reproductive fitness in female specimens, but not male specimens.\n\n  Chronic exposure to androstene dione did not markedly alter breeding success\n\n  in both sexes or decrease embryo-larval viability in F1 progeny, in contrast\n\n  to the effects of E2.\n\nFinally, chronic exposure to methoxychlor delayed development, including\n\n  slowing the rate of metamorphosis; had a slight affect on the normalcy of larval\n\n  development; caused skewed sex ratios toward the female gender; and induced\n\n  gonad, liver, and thyroid abnormalities in juvenile specimens. Furthermore,\n\n  chronic methoxychlor exposure impaired both female and male reproduction fitness.\n\n  Increasing concerns over the widespread finding of EDCs in the environment\n\n  have dramatically increased the need for standardized assays, such as the XLCA,\n\n  because no other assay of this type is available today.",

        "abstract": "Tunable diode laser spectroscopy (TDLS) is one of the most versatile and\n\n  powerful detection technologies. Essentially, any contaminant can be detected,\n\n  and with emerging cavity-enhanced techniques, sensitivities can be in the parts\n\n  per trillion. Despite this tremendous potency, however, widespread use of TDLS\n\n  has been prevented largely by the lack of economical, reliable, and wavelength-versatile\n\n  tunable diode lasers. Currently available tunable diode lasers are either:\n\n  (1) not robust and expensive (such as mechanically tuned lasers that are vibration\n\n  sensitive and can cost up to $20,000), or (2) only exist at a few specific\n\n  center wavelengths and have limited tunability (such as distributed feedback\n\n  lasers that typically can tune only 2 nm around only select wavelengths). \n\nDuring this project, Vescent Photonics, Inc., developed an all solid-state\n\n  laser that will be extremely robust, compact (comparable in size to a book\n\n  of matches), widely tunable (greater than 90 nm, likely limited by the diode\n\n  gain curve), and accommodating to wavelengths from 400 nm to 2 \u00b5m (any\n\n  semiconductor diode chip can be used as the gain medium). This remarkable new\n\n  laser design, termed WECSL (pronounced &quot;wexl&quot;), is enabled by an\n\n  innovative electrooptic technology. In Phase I, Vescent Photonics, Inc., demonstrated\n\n  an unprecedented voltage-tuned index of n\n\n  greater than 0.02, which, for  =\n\n  1 \u00b5m\n\n  light, provides 200 waves of voltage controlled optical phase delay per centimeter\n\n  of propagation. Furthermore, through detailed modeling and experiments, the\n\n  feasibility of using this technology to construct all solid-state tunable diode\n\n  lasers was demonstrated. The goal of this Phase II research project is to build\n\n  three different WECSL lasers with center wavelengths at 670 nm, 1,824 nm, and\n\n  1,954 nm, which can probe NO2, NO, and N2O, respectively. Finally, to illustrate\n\n  the utility of the WECSL for TDLS, demonstration spectra for each NOx species\n\n  will be recorded.\n\nThe potential commercial applications are many. First, environmental monitoring\n\n  is a diverse and expanding market, with applications including in situ factory\n\n  monitoring, mobile emissions monitoring, and fenceline detection, for example.\n\n  When combined with ultra-sensitive cavity-enhanced detection techniques, applications\n\n  exist for weapons detection and medical breath analyses. Outside of monitoring,\n\n  a large market for tunable diode lasers is telecommunications, where precise\n\n  control over wavelength enables increased bandwidth through optical fibers.\n\n  Finally, tunable diode lasers find utility in the growing field of fiber-sensors.",

These systems generate enormous amounts of data requiring a large storage capacity and high transmission bandwidth. Advanced compression techniques are necessary to reduce the demands on storage and transmission while maintaining high data quality for human and machine analysis.  Systran Federal Corp.

As with other types of data, compression of SAR images must strike a balance between maximum density and minimum information degradation.  Current techniques, such as those using a Discrete Fourier Transform or Discrete Cosine Transform, do not provide acceptable results due to the generation of artifacts. The research conducted in Phase I shows that wavelet-based techniques provide low loss of information at high compression ratios.  The SFC/OSU/LMCO team will develop wavelet-based algorithms for compressing magnitude-only images and complex SAR data, and implement these algorithms in field programmable gate arrays for efficient and reconfigurable processing.

        "abstract": "The objective of this effort is to develop autonomous technology in the form of a software toolkit for the spatial alignment of image, SIGINT, and GMTI data collected from the battlespace. Some work has been directed toward the spatial alignment of images, SIGINT and GMTI data collected from the battlespace; yet, the understanding of precisely how to extract and use this data for relative and absolute registration remains limited. The focus of this research is to develop novel approaches to geo-registration by first developing a generic concept of geo-reference invariant feature that can be extracted from each data source and second, developing algorithms for correlating/integrating these salient features across the multiple data sources and a fiducial database for relative and absolute registration. Examples of features that cross multiple source data domains are radio/TV transmission towers, command and control centers, road intersections, fixed search radar towers, and cellular phone towers. Trade-off studies will identify correlation/integration algorithms that will tie disparate types of sensor data together with the fiducial database while exploiting the knowledge of physics and phenomenological models (exact or approximate) of sensors and source types that might be available. The research will exploit innovative approaches including knowledge-based (AI/expert) systems, multiresolutional architectures, and evolutionary computation. Most appropriate approaches will be identified for each sensor, source type, and for correlating all the data and available knowledge. The result will be a reliable, flexible system that can coregister multiple sensor data, estimate and account for errors and uncertainties, and identify measures of effectiveness for automatic convergence to minimize human intervention. The algorithms will be implemented as a software toolkit to enable the flexible system integration for multi-source data. This effort will exploit innovative approaches for image pair prescreening and integrated intelligent computational systems. Whereas R&D and testing are currently being performed to exploit some well-known algorithms (mutual information (MI), wavelet, and feature based), this effort seeks to further extend and optimize work on existing registration algorithms for robustness as well as developing new ones and integrating them into a tool suite. The Phase II SMART toolkit concept will employ a real time expert system based approach to automatically \"broker\" or select the appropriate geo-registration and correlation algorithm(s) for multi-source data domains. The innovation research will focus on the following: (i) use of optimizing algorithms that apply a multi-source data registration/fusion tree methodology and AI decision making to achieve the goals of autonomous registration; (ii) novel techniques for image pair preprocessing using intensity and knowledge based methods that derive the \"frequency content\" of images and broker the selection of the appropriate registration algorithm; (iii) methods for handling 2-D rigid and elastic body problems using photogrammetry-based methods; and (iv) new methods to provide tractable error/uncertainty handling and registration performance/effectiveness measures. The thrust in Phase II will be on, but not be limited to the use of MI, feature (control point), and wavelet based methods for multi-modality IMINT and for non-IMINT cases. This capability will directly serve the needs of DoD product centers (ASD) and acquisitions (Joint Strike Fighter) concerned with advancing the state of the art in sensors, electronics, and battlespace technologies for achieving the goals of rapid (near real time), onboard precision target geo-location. SMART technologies will be readily useable by a sensor-to-shooter warfighter, battlespace commander, and airborne surveillance operator.",

Even with the aid of a sophisticated tracker/classifier such as the ETC, false alarms remain a problem in many operationally interesting areas. Experience from the radar world suggests that the single most important discriminant between target and clutter is resolution. However, this approach has not been possible for active sonars because the current receiver arrays are not large enough to provide sufficient resolution for effective discrimination. This situation is changing now based on advancements in the synthetic aperture sonar (SAS), which achieves high azimuthal resolution without physically extending the receiver array. The image azimuthal resolution is range and wavelength-independent if the full integration aperture can be achieved. Even if the full aperture cannot be realized due to tactical constraints, summing several pings may still offer significant detection and classification performance gains.    We propose a Phase II program to develop this advanced target classification capability for the MFTA. If successful, the low and zero-doppler targets may no longer pose a problem if their detailed features can be recognized in an image.

The Phase II effort will implement the full-scene high-fidelity thermal modeling (HFTM) design from the Phase I effort, as well as several acceptable modeling trade-offs to accelerate run-time performance.   This implementation will solve the 3D heat diffusion and surface radiative transfer problem for appropriately-coupled thermodynamic systems of dynamic targets with their surrounding background elements.   The modeling will include dynamic vehicle states such as engine state, vehicle motion, terrain interaction, etc. The resulting Phase II proto-type will enable the sensor analyst to readily construct highly detailed and complex large-scale databases, and credibly simulate any combination of sensors in the 0.20-25.0 um band for EO, IR and hyper-spectral sensor fusion research.",

Trade studies have defined a requirement for deployable wings which are far too long for the conventional solution of simply pivoting outward from the wing root. KCI proposes to develop an alternative wing design that can roughly double the span of the deployed wing compared to the conventional pivoting solution.     Three different design implementations of ELW shall be developed. Detail layout, design and structural analysis of each concept shall be performed to identify practical issues which must be addressed for functional implementation including storage, deployment, sustained cruise, maneuvering and high speed dash. Detailed cost and weight estimates shall be prepared to downselect the most promising design. Three prototype ELW systems shall be produced and tested including structural loading, deployment reliability and deployment under realistic airloads.     Weight and low unit cost at high production rates is another important characteristic for a successful ELW. All ELW designs described are made from high performance composite materials using the pultrusion process. Pultrusion is fully automated and produces the lowest cost structural composites on a per-pound or per-foot basis.",

Rocket engine and turbine engine programs such as the IHPRPT and IHPTET initiatives, respectively, are intended to double next-generation propulsion capabilities.  Reaching this aggressive goal demands the implementation of high temperature capability, environmentally resistant, lightweight material systems.  Prominent among the alternative materials under consideration for such applications are ceramic matrix composites (CMCs).  Recent Air Force and NASA programs have considerably progressed the development of CMCs for ~2500 F combustion environments, but additional work is required to extend current CMC capabilities to temperatures >=3500 F.  In this project, Ultramet will scale up processes for and fabricate components from an ultrahigh temperature capable CMC using a matrix such as zirconium carbide/silicon carbide or hafnium carbide/ silicon carbide (ZrC/SiC or HfC/SiC) or other composition analogous to Ultramet's Ultra2000TM microlayered HfC/SiC coating system that has previously been shown to be effective for ultrahigh temperature applications.

The innovation is based on pixel-level integration of bi-material cantilevers that directly convert the IR image into a visible image, providing unprecedented opportunity to produce affordable MWIR imagers by eliminating the need for costly electronic amplification and fan-out.  The optical readout scheme eliminates additional signal loss that inevitably occurs in electronic read-out methods due to thermal loss through electrical contact made to the detector elements.  This unconventional approach facilitates the use of a variety of high-sensitivity IR sensing materials without the obstacle of processing incompatibility and offers near instantaneous full-array imaging.   Moreover, the design is simple, compact, lightweight, low power consumption, and rugged.  The Phase I work has successfully demonstrated the fabrication of a PbSe/MEMS IR detector achieving high specific detectivity D* ~ 4E08 (cmHz^1/2W).  Our complex simulation analysis indicates two order of magnitude sensitivity improvement is achievable as the device fabrication process is further optimized.  As a technology demonstration, the Phase II effort undertakes the fabrication of a fully functional prototype uncooled PbSe/MEMS based MWIR imager of 160x120 pixels with 360o large FOV IR optics and imaging speed over 400 FPS.",

In addition, a unique spectral imaging sensor prototype for enhanced missile threat warning will be developed.  This Phase II approach will capitalize on the design concepts created during the Phase I effort.

All four images will be spatially identical but with different spectral filters to pass four narrow MWIR bands selected specifically to address missile threat warning.

Wideband radars generally produce range-compressed images with fine range resolution (< 1m), a relatively small number of range bins (1000 to 2000), and thus a small range extent or range gate.  However, there are applications within the missile defense mission that may require a much wider range extent while retaining fine resolution, and thus a correspondingly larger number of range bins (e.g., 10,000 to 100,000).  The requirement to generate a large number of range bins from a wideband radar pulse (~1 GHz bandwidth) places extreme demands on the return pulse processor.  Essex Corporation has previously  developed an Advanced Optical Processor (AOP) with 1 GHz bandwidth and 2000 range bins.

        "abstract": "XCom Wireless is a developer of micromachined microwave circuitry for adaptive filters and phased array antennas, high-performance sub-systems identified as critical technologies for the next generation of defense and commercial RF electronics.  The XCom process for MEMS-based millimeter-wave circuitry provides a direct alternative to solid-state and waveguide components, so communications and radar system manufacturers can easily upgrade to this technology, saving weight, space, power, and money.  The proposed program is to design a micromachined space-capable millimeter-wave phased array antenna platform suitable for SATCOM transmit and receive operations.  The design will integrate passive circuit elements into the antenna array developed during the Phase I effort, and will use MEMS phase shifters to provide high-performance electronic beam-steering capabilities in a compact, low-cost form factor.  Separate arrays for downlink (71-76 GHz) and uplink (81-86 GHz) will be developed.  As with the Phase I effort, Phase II continues to leverage XCom hybrid MEMS and micromachined interconnect technologies developed in association with DARPA, ARO, U.S. Army CECOM, and NASA JPL.  This suite of novel devices and processes provides critical technological advantages for this Phase II effort, including the ability to prototype Phase I designs ahead of schedule.  Hybrid assembly of millimeter-wave antenna and circuit elements using RF MEMS promises low-cost, rapid manufacturing of compact communications and radar phased arrays, and the use of robust hermetic XCom packaging provides shock survivability and temperature tolerance for space-based operation.",

Reticulated foams promise to: (1) increase injector performance by improving mixing efficiencies and combustion stability; (2) increase injector reliability by reducing vulnerability to particulate fouling of orifices; (3) decrease manufacturing cost by eliminating the need for precision machining numerous small diameter orifices, thus greatly simplifying fabrication; and (4) significantly decrease weight.     The objective of this Phase II program is to demonstrate producing and testing a fully functional reticulated SiC foam injector/thruster assembly which meets the performance requirements for MDA divert propulsion applications. This proposed effort will address detailed propellant injector design and optimization with continued evaluation of the reticulated ceramic foam injector/diffuser concept. Additional foam samples of various porosities and densities will be produced and evaluated to determine their respective liquid and gaseous hydraulic characteristics, specific surface area, and compressive strength properties to access their potential for use in advanced propellant injector designs. Efforts will focus on developing foam diffuser/injector concepts for both bipropellants (including hypergolic) and advanced monopropellants (catalytic).

        "abstract": "In Phase I, we demonstrated that Mg-AZ31 alloy reinforced with graphite fibers has over 27% higher specific stiffness than beryllium.  Since EKV sunshade is a stiffness critical application, sunshades manufactured from graphite/Mg could weigh 27% less than the current Be design.  Further, testing at MMCC and preliminary results from Raytheon show the material to be gas impermeable.  Using MMCC's net-shape Advanced Pressure Infiltration Casting (APICT) process, the sunshade would cost half as much, resulting in a $7- $10 million savings in procurement cost.  In addition, lower mass will lead to increased performance that could result in further cost savings and increased mission capability.  This project, in collaboration with the prime contractor, will demonstrate the materials and environmental performance and cost effectiveness of  Gr/Mg EKV sunshades.  Phase II can be considered to be a pre-production manufacturing technology readiness project and will enable direct procurement for EKV system deployment.  Beyond the structural and cost enhancements, Mg/graphite is non toxic and has none of the environmental and occupational health liabilities associated with melting, machining and handling of beryllium.  The establishment of this technology will enable a business line in strong, high specific stiffness structural tubing for missiles, spacecraft, satellite, airborne and sports applications.",

No degradation in the sensor response after 90 days of storage was measured.

        "abstract": "There is a strong interest in pulse tube cryocoolers for strategic and tactical applications. The pulse tube cryocooler derives its thermodynamic performance from a controlled movement of a gas volume within a tube resulting in extraction of heat from a definable cold interface. Performance of pulse tube cryocoolers is strongly dependent upon accurate control of the gas flow to achieve a matching of the moving gas volume with the tube volume and effective phasing of the gas volume motion relative to driving pressure waveforms. TAI will incorporate a MEMS-based valve array to accurately and remotely control the gas flow. A major benefit of this controllable micro-miniature flow manifold is dynamic flow management with minimal addition of parasitic void volume to provide enhanced cryocooler performance. The proposed approach to package multiple electrostatic flow control valves in a configuration that satisfies the cryocooler application requirements was developed in Phase I and study results revealed that significant gains in pulse tube cryocooler performance can be realized. In Phase II, a prototype flow control device will be fabricated and integrated with a dedicated pulse tube cryocooler test bed to demonstrate the proposed embodiment.",

The TODS Phase I study program addressed the above MDA/TC program objectives and developed innovative spectrally efficient solutions to increase the broadcast telemetry range and the data rates within a limited available frequency spectrum. The proposed TODS system offers two benefits by alleviating the two primary limitations of the current telemetry systems, namely (1) it extends the telemetry broadcast range without increasing the RF transmit power at the mobile or the size of the ground-based telemetry tracking antenna system, and (2) it increases the telemetry capacity (data rate) using a spectrally efficient signal modulation scheme. The proposed TODS system solution also improves the telemetry data reliability requirement by employing a highly efficient coding algorithm. In this Phase II Program,Mayflower proposes to address the issue of wireless channel characterization in very high dynamics (up to 20 Mach) and to develop and demonstrate a working TODS prototype hardware system at L/S band.

        "abstract": "The proposed Bistatic Altimeter concept is intended to provide a low cost solution to improve the accuracy of existing munitions such as the Joint Advanced Standoff Strike Missile (JASSM), Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), and the Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM).  For GPS guided munitions, the GPS navigation error can be related to the weapon CEP. Examining the unclassified ORD threshold for the current GPS capability, the horizontal accuracy is 6.3m but the vertical accuracy is 13.6m.  It is clear that vertical dilution of precision (VDOP) dominates the GDOP and can result in higher CEP than predicted. The concept exploits radiation from existing national or commercial assets as the transmitter and utilizes a new antenna, algorithms, processor, and receiver to provide precise altitude measurements of the munition.  Central to the research and critical to the ultimate success of the program and ultimate implementation, is a system configured for ease of integration into the weapon system.  The antenna performance in the installed configuration will be central to success and is an important aspect of the research. The technique also has application to manned aircraft; military, commercial, and private air transportation.",

        "abstract": "Harmonia proposes a novel approach to automatically generating tactical human/computer interface (HCI) code and object design data from the user interface design developed through usability prototyping.  This approach uses the User Interface Markup Language (UIML), an open specification language being standardized by OASIS, as a user interface design language that can be rendered to usability prototypes, tactical HCI code, and object model representations.  The proposed approach centers on defining an enhanced, UIML-based user interface design process, and then defining tool support needs for this process.  The intent is to span the gap between usability and object-oriented software engineering by supporting rapid prototyping of user interfaces for usability engineering, while providing the ability to generate object design data for the overall system's object model and tactical HCI code for deployment.  UIML and its associated tools form a bridge between the user interface designer and the application modeler, allowing early and frequent integration of the user interface design process and the application development life cycle.  Bridging the gap between usability and software engineering is expected to save considerable effort by eliminating the manual work currently required to move from usability prototype to tactical HCI software.",

As specifically identified in the recent \"Department of Defense Laser Master Plan\", the key technology issue on the path to high-power FEL deployment is the demonstration of reliable, high-brightness, photocathode injector operation.  A DC gun/superconducting accelerator combination provides the most promising and most mature path to efficient, weapon-level electron beam power.  One of the primary issues identified with this type of gun is beam quality degradation for operation at weapon system charge levels that approach 1 nC per bunch or higher.  Longitudinal phase space aberrations set in that can significantly reduce the lasing efficiency of the FEL.  We are proposing to design and build an accelerating system that will correct the development of this aberration and provide very high quality electron beams at current levels sufficient for weapon level performance.",

The primary emphasis of this effort was to investigate practical interference suppression techniques for use in existing radars against current and projected interference sources, analyze and quantify detection and target angular accuracy, and demonstrate projected performance. Three associated architectures were examined: (1) a conventional two-step approach (2) a Sum-Difference architecture and (3) a multi-channel (subarray) architecture. The results demonstrated that a multi-channel architecture was superior in many ways. In this Phase II effort, we shall extend our efforts in many areas, including: (1) auxiliary channels for sidelobe cancellation, (2) sub-banded input handling, (3) advanced beam-steering / tracking approach, and (4) a potentially more accurate numerical optimization technique. Our demonstration plan will utilize an experimental phased array system with the assistance of Lockheed-Martin Corporation. These will eventually lead to implementation of jamming suppression processors for advanced software-only upgrades to existing Navy radars",

Project Objectives: To demonstrate the feasibility of the new WaveBand beamforming technology at frequencies corresponding to those of Navy radar (X-band and S-band) and to deliver an operating prototype of the new antenna to the Navy.     Effort: WaveBand will design, fabricate, test, and deliver to the Navy a 2D antenna prototype comprised of 8 subarrays.

Research completed to date at PRLLC on the Positronium Storage Ring (PSR) shows that long-term positron storage of ~ 10^15-18 may be possible in the future.     A positron (anti-electron) is the antimatter equivalent of an electron. Antimatter has the highest specific energy of any material in existence. It is 180 MJ/mg, which places it ten orders of magnitude larger than chemical propellants  (0.013 J/mg) and three orders of magnitude larger than nuclear fission or fusion. Positrons annihilate into gamma rays when they collide with electrons, with a total released energy of 1.02 MeV.  These low energy gamma rays cannot remove a neutron or proton from a bound nucleus in surrounding media.  Hence, positron annihilation cannot create radioactive by-products, yet their energy can be harnessed for many practical applications.     One of the main reasons positrons have not been exploited to date is the lack of cost effective and practical size confinement methods to store large amounts of positrons.  PRLLC is on its way to accomplishing this goal thus allowing for a whole new realm of high-density energy applications including novel ordnance, materials science and propulsion concepts.",

These systems pose unique challenges in that the cooling system must dissipate high heat fluxes over large surface areas with limited heat rejection, while functioning in harsh operational environments.  Effective two-phase cooling techniques with high-heat transfer rates and low coolant flow rates must be combined with energy storage and dissipation techniques which enable high-energy lasers on compact tactical platforms.    In the Phase I feasibility study, an evaluation was performed comparing closed cycle water micro-channel technology, closed cycle two-phase evaporative spray cooling (ESC) technology, and open cycle ESC technology.  The study revealed that micro-channel systems are not practical for military tactical platforms, and is one of the limiting factors for the deployment of high-energy lasers (HELs) on these platforms. The Phase I feasibility study has established that ESC, thermal energy storage (TES) and refrigeration are the key technologies that enable a closed cycle cooling system for a 100 kW diode pumped solid-state laser (DPSSL) on a compact tactical platform.  The Phase I study also showed that open cycle ESC systems offer a compact solution for lasers with short operation times (< 90 seconds), but are not practical for longer duration    The primary focus for the Phase II effort is the development of prototype system that validates these key technology areas.  The prototype unit will show scalability of ESC cycle design to support 100 kW DPSSL system while addressing operational \"real-environment\" characteristics typical of tactical platforms.

        "abstract": "To achieve design objectives of affordability and stealth, simultaneously with higher speed, there is a need to reduce energy requirements traditionally associated with high-speed performance of underwater vehicles.  The specific objective of the overall effort is to develop and demonstrate a class of viscoelastic materials that will reduce friction drag without the requirement of additional energy or consumable additives.  The approach is to complete development of theory and to validate it with experiments.  Under previous efforts, Cortana outlined a theoretical approach suitable for choosing appropriate physical parameters and structure of such materials, and for estimating turbulent friction drag reduction under given flow conditions.  In the Phase I period, Cortana updated theory and numerical calculations for use with axisymmetric bodies, and for prediction of results for actual experimental configurations.  In the Phase II base period, we will conduct proof-of-concept experiments for coated flat plates in a 12-inch water tunnel test facility, with significant effort devoted to molding quality control and coating structural design for minimization of edge effects.  The Phase II option will focus on out-year experimental design and molding techniques for axisymmetric bodies, with the potential for limited experiments in the 12-inch tunnel.",

Current state-of-art laser transmitters, consisting of diode-pumped solid-state lasers and optical parametric oscillators, have demonstrated the required optical power and wavelength in the mid-infrared spectral region.  However, these laser systems are complex and expensive customized devices.  To provide reliable and affordable mid-wave lasers for ship-based infrared countermeasures (IRCM), Aculight Corporation proposes a novel laser source based on commercial fiber-optic technology coupled with an innovative wavelength shifter to provide high power, broad bandwidth radiation in the mid-infrared.  The Phase I experiments demonstrated the feasibility of combining multiple commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) telecom fiber amplifiers into a high-power mid-wave laser for IRCM.  In the Phase II, a moderate power brassboard IRCM laser will be built using COTS telecom fiber-optics components and a novel wavelength shifter.  The brassboard laser will be delivered to the Navy for testing at the completion of the Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Many MDA missions ask for compact image sensors capable of low power, high frame rate, mega-pixel resolution and efficient light detection over the entire 300nm to 1570nm wavelength range. e-Phocus  has demonstrated a compact, low power, mega-pixel resolution and 30 Hz sensors over the visible spectrum (400nm - 700nm), using its patented Hi-SightTM technology with an amorphous silicon (a-Si) photodiode structure.  The Hi-SightTM technology involves the coating of a multi-layer amorphous or microcrystalline photodiode structure on a CMOS readout integrated circuit, in order to provide a high performance image sensor with an imaging bandwidth potentially spanning the ultraviolet to near infrared spectrum.  Under the Phase I e-Phocus showed a path to extend the ability of the Hi-SightTM technology to perform to 290nm in the UV using a surface anti-reflection layer structure, and to 900 nm in the Near IR using microcrystalline silicon (\u0192Yc-Si). e-Phocus also determined that with microcrytalline germanium (\u0192Yc-Ge) based photo-sensing heterostructure, the spectral response can be further extended to 1570nm.  In this SBIR Phase-II program, e-Phocus intends to develop a \u0192Yc-Ge based photo-sensing hetero-structure, to be used on top of Hi-SightTM readout circuitry, which can extend sensor's spectral response towards 1570nm.    The Phase II program will investigate the spectral response of \u0192Yc-Gebased photo-sensing heterostructure devices and its capability in supporting high frame rate sensors.  e-Phocus intends to demonstrate that Hi-SightTM sensor architecture in conjunction of \u0192Yc-Ge photo-sensing structure will be a viable and cost-effective solution leading to image sensors with broadband sensing capability to support MDA's missions.

This Phase II program will design, develop a DPG and demonstrate its capability to measure the displacement amplitude of a diaphragm that is loaded by PRS debris.  The gauge is designed such that the displacement is directly proportional to load over the load range of interest.  The displacement is measured using a fiber optic system that is radiation hard and immune to the electric-magnetic noise environments of PRS simulators.  The failure threshold of existing survivable shields is estimated to be 400 taps.  The phase I DPG was demonstrated to accurately measure loads from 25 to more than 1000 taps and to be immune to the simulator environments.

In the private sector, the theme is the same, more energy in a smaller package to power sophisticated electronics and electric vehicles.  The advent of Li-ion battery technology has meant that batteries have finally become high-energy devices.  While this is a move in the right direction, the specific energy of Li-ion (~130-150Wh/kg) still falls short of what is demanded, >400Wh/kg, from a rechargeable device.  New materials need to be developed to close this energy gap.  Carbon nanotubes offer a new opportunity to meet these energy demands.  The proposed Phase II research effort seeks to expand upon our recent successful Phase I program in which we demonstrated a lab scale all carbon nanotube battery with a specific energy exceeding 600Wh/kg.  The proposed effort will focus on scaling up the methods required to produce prototype pouch batteries with a specific energy >400Wh/kg.

Our approach differs from other attempts to use images for automatic landing in that we utilize mainly detection and estimation of meaningful lines instead of reference points. The major advantage of our solution approach to the UAV automatic landing task is generality: no airport surveying data is necessary. We rely on only one natural parameter, the maximum false alarm rate, unlike all previous methods that depend on a multitude of unstable thresholds. We propose to make all computational tasks the real-time, in particular the detection of meaningful straight lines, and to assess the precision of the measurements with respect to the resolution of the camera.

It operates by releasing probes from a sonobuoy whenever an SVP is required.  As a probe descends through the water, it gathers SVP data and transmits it back to the sonobuoy.  The result is a better understanding of environmental conditions throughout the process of searching for submarines.  By using this environmental information, it is possible to know where submarines may be hiding.  The result is a much more thorough understanding of the battlespace.    This novel approach to the problem has advantages over currently employed methods of gathering SVP information.  The probes are small enough to enable several SVPs per sonobuoy.  This minimizes the number of required sonobuoys, which in turn decreases the time and cost associated with sonobuoy deployment.  It will also decrease danger to soldiers by minimizing the time they are required to be in the battlespace.    The wireless nature of UVOSPS provides flexibility for deployment scenarios because it operates in both shallow and deep water; it will not tangle on bottom structures.  UVOSPS can also provide bottom depth information, which is useful in analyzing the battlespace environment.",

Dismounts moving though the system would be detected, their location determined, their motion tracked, and alarms generated.  Because of its LPI/LPD qualities, a UWB system would also be covert.  Such a system is important because it allows unattended surveillance of areas or perimeters in rural, urban or MOUT environments.  For military users, this system provides increased situational awareness and an increased ability to deny areas to opponents.  For commercial users this would mean a new way to safeguard reservoirs, aircraft, airports, nuclear plants and other targets.  The feasibility of this project has been demonstrated through several programs including this SBIR and DARPA's MicroThunder project.  Our technical approach is to perform rigorous requirements definition, system analysis and system design leading to the objective system.   Programmatically, this project is tightly coupled with the MicroThunder project.  This coupling is synergistic and well coordinated.    At a Critical Design Review (CDR), Time Domain and BBN (MicroThunder prime contractor) will present a clear technical path towards implementation of a lightweight (",

        "abstract": "This Phase II project will provide prototype perimeter surveillance systems to protect stationary assets such as aircraft and large areas such as naval installations, supply depots, reservoirs, or power plants.  The proposed security system will provide the Government an additional tool for Homeland Defense efforts to thwart terrorist activities.  This security system will employ a hybrid Ultra-Wideband (UWB) bi-static radar/radio to detect motion and relay alarms.  Physical fences are not practical for protecting transient assets, are easy to breach, require monitoring, and can be surreptitiously damaged or destroyed.  In contrast, portable bi-static radar sensors are readily deployed, minimize reliance on guards and cameras, and automatically report breaches and broken links.  Advantages of UWB over other RF systems include low probability of detection, minimal interference, reduced power consumption, and tracking capability.  NAVAIR, Hanscom AFB, the Manassas police department, EPA and Federal Express have identified the need for such capabilities.  The radar security solution feasibility was proven in Phase I and demonstrated in other efforts.  To demonstrate a robust, fieldable prototype perimeter security system for this Phase II effort, TDC will leverage the Phase I results, maximize our UWB radar and communications expertise and hardware, and integrate two related DARPA efforts.",

        "abstract": "SPEC proposes to develop and deliver a flight capable Target Hologram Generator (THG)--a programmable flight module that forms radar hologram target countermeasure signatures of hard objects in flight--to MDA's Target and Countermeasures (T&C) program. For example, a single unit is capable of creating multiple ECM/ECCM scenarios, different emitters - separated by frequency, phase, time, and other parameters--simulating 16 false targets with arbitrary polarization generated simultaneously distributed across range and Doppler.  THG ability to simulate any radar/communications system in its frequency range, allows cost effective simulation of passive or active countermeasure threat trains, from simple to complex, by using either flight test data or modeled passive missile countermeasures.  This allows rapid development and verification of ECM/ECCM techniques for both hardware-in-the-loop and flight-tests settings.  Directed by the SPEC Countermeasures Integration Laboratory (CIL), THG will deliver dramatic cost savings in production and integration of \"realistic signatures\" for T&C flight hardware, while supporting low cost, quick reaction, spiral development of increasingly capable countermeasures tactics over lifetime of T&C programs.  CIL also includes full range of countermeasures (e.g., chaff, erectables and inflatables) production equipment that was used to produce the vast majority of currently deployed missile and space countermeasures systems.",

        "abstract": "Proposed is an underwater surveillance system for operation in denied littoral areas using autonomous underwater gliders.     The approach is particularly suitable for extended surveillance prior to actual conflict and is capable of remote or off-shore deployment of multiple gliders.    Gliders, which operate by changing buoyancy and gliding in a vertical saw-tooth profile, bring some unique advantages to this challenging problem:  silent operation (no propeller), ability to surface or equilibrate at equilibrium depth, hover as required, long range and extended endurance.    An important potential advance is creating a vehicle able to rest on the bottom.  Most AUVs must remain in motion, or possibly equilibrium in neutral buoyancy mode at controlled depth with little or no propulsion.  The ability to be both mobile and rest on the bottom creates many opportunities.  In particular, advantages include: much longer missions; operating during certain hours with quiescent periods; avoidance of bioluminescent trail; remaining quiescent until triggered by events; accurate observation of local tides and currents; etc.  A mobile to stationary conversion will allow a traditional bottom mounted sensor platform to be deployed from over the horizon, covertly move into position, and then become a bottom fixture.  A design optimized for both mobility and bottom resting is proposed.",

Power and Energy (P&E) brings to this task a 10 year record of  production and sale of more than 1000 commercial hydrogen purifiers in which  hydrogen is diffused through palladium membranes to produce long-lived  streams of ultra-pure hydrogen. The innovative feature of the proposed  device is the reduction of palladium membrane thickness to about a micron,  i.e, too thin to be self-supporting in the absence of a substrate which  combines high permeability and dimensional stability under stress. Equally  important are the properties of the membrane/substrate interface and the  orientation of the assembly relative to the direction of reformate flow.  Familiarity with the molecular mechanism of hydrogen flow in membranes  serves as a guide to assessment of these effects. Various flat-disc  substrates composed of sintered nano-sized particulates are currently under  investigation during Phase I.

        "abstract": "A malicious reverse engineering attack is an attempt by an adversary to learn information about the behavior and implementation of software from analysis of the binary executable code.  One technique to counter the threat of reverse engineering attacks is to obfuscate the software.  Obfuscation is translation of a computer program so that it remains a computer program with the same functionality as the original, but is more difficult to reverse engineer.    We propose Tornado, a software tool for automatic obfuscation of program source code.  Tornado is able to reason about the susceptibility of software to reverse engineering.  Tornado can intelligently transform software for the purposes of increasing the costs and difficulty of reverse engineering the software.  Tornado is not limited to a fixed set of transformations, since it is designed to be extensible in order to cope with new types of threats.  Tornado is able to account for the unique software requirements of software found in the real-time and embedded domains.",

        "abstract": "Color night vision offers major advantages to the warfighter, aircrew, law enforcement, and special operations forces, by improving scene understanding and orientation.  While false color imagery has been generated by the fusion of monochrome visible imagery with various bands in the thermal IR, this technique suffers from the fact that the color in the fused image has nothing to do with colors perceived by the human eye and used by the human brain for scene understanding and object recognition.  True color imagery, on the other hand, utilizes information in the visible band to replicate the colors as would be seen in natural daylight.  DoD studies have shown that reaction time and target detection ability are improved when comparing true color to monochrome imagery.    This proposal addresses the development of a prototype true color night vision (TCNV) image intensified camera that uses novel filter technology and image processing algorithms..  Previous attempts to develop TCNV using similar approaches suffered from inadequate sensitivity and signal levels.  In the current approach, the inclusion of nearly 100% of the available NIR signal in conjunction with appropriate image processing schemes can dramatically improve the overall signal to noise level and also allows an operator to view laser aiming devices.  In the Phase-I project, OKSI demonstrated the feasibility of the approach through analysis of computer simulations, along with laboratory and outdoor experiments.  In Phase-II, OKSI will construct a full working prototype system that will be available for testing by DoD personal.  Under an optional task a real-time video rate performance will be demonstrated, with further miniaturization under a subsequent option.",

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses the need for deep UV semiconductor lasers for use in UV resonance enhanced Raman spectroscopic identification of biological agents. The proposed approach avoids the problems of p-doping and ohmic contacts by using subminiature direct electron injection excitation of an InAlGaN heterostructure. We have demonstrated strong stimulated emission at 274nm using this approach with measured linewidth reduction from 16nm to 4nm and five orders of magnitude non-linear increase in intensity. High levels of chemical specificity can be obtained using Raman spectroscopy without sample preparation, contact, or destruction. When Raman excitation occurs within the electronic resonance band of a material the scatter cross-sections can improve as much as eight orders of magnitude. For biochemical molecules such as nucleic and amino acids these absorption bands are very strong in the deep UV between about 220nm and 280nm. When Raman excitation is below about 250nm, there is a fluorescence-free region extending over 4000 wave numbers above the excitation wavelength providing very high detection sensitivities and low background noise.   It is the goal of this proposed program to demonstrate deep UV emission from a semiconductor laser and the ability to obtain deep UV resonance Raman spectra of analogs of hazardous biological agents.",

The ubiquitously used solar cells have almost reached their power density and specific power limits and will never be able to support very large power demands such as needed for electric propulsion and high energy weapons.

The goal of this program is the development of new thermionic energy conversion systems based on nanostructured carbon and diamond materials.  The joint PTS and NC State research on the Phase I has demonstrated results that indicate that these materials have unusual characteristics for operation as efficient thermionic emitters at low temperatures not previously considered possible for thermionic systems.  We are proposing a novel approach to thermionic energy conversion based on doped diamond with a negative electron affinity (NEA) or nanostructured carbon as emitters and collectors based on wide bandgap semiconductors.

A single malfunction or degradation can prevent the communication from occurring, leading to missed opportunities for contact.  With low earth orbit satellites such at SBIRS-Low--managing the interaction of support systems is even more difficult.  Such a constellation has the potential to receive requests for service at any time and must respond within tight timelines by utilizing worldwide resources to establish communication between any terrestrial station and any target satellite in the constellation.  Maintaining the entire space-ground big picture for this dynamic environment is challenging.  To address this problem, SYTRONICS and our subcontractor, Ball, propose to develop a proof-of-concept intelligent agent support system that will aid SBIRS-Low crews to manage pre-pass contact operations.  In addition to operational support, our system will address the requirements inherent with training to use such an agent-assisted system by developing an Instructor Operator Station (IOS) that allows a single operator to train the contact support team.  The IOS will serve a dual purpose as a training device and also be transferable as a supervisor system that manages pre-pass operations on the operations floor.",

Plug-and-Sense Connectivity - a software architecture that detects attached modules, communicates module use instructions, and identifies the physical properties, and geometric orientation of the module within the vehicle's stack. Smart Systems - utilize the vehicle's systems to aid in assembly, checkout, launch, and transition to operational status. Autonomous Operations - broad spectrum of autonomy from; self-detect, isolation, and repair of anomalies to; self-guided, goal-following on-orbit activities. Minimally Structured Spacecraft - a spacecraft structural design that is driven by on-orbit activities, not launch load requirements.  This SBIR Phase II program will develop the key enabling technologies required by a rapid response spacecraft architecture. The immediate benefits to the US military space community are two-fold. First, the technologies developed in this program can be quickly realized in flight hardware, as part of a Phase III program, and a near-term rapid response spacecraft demonstration conducted.

As the tape moves across the laser focus, a high-temperature jet is created on the opposite side from the laser without burning through the tape.

        "abstract": "Leaks in aircraft fluid lines, depending on their severity, can reduce aircraft performance, compromise mission availability, or result in catastrophic loss or damage to the aircraft. Conventional monitoring technologies may not be sufficiently sensitive to allow accurate prediction of performance degradation or failure for timely preventative maintenance. Detection of small line leaks, connection point or seal leaks and communication through the PHM system can result in early warning and mitigation of potentially catastrophic aircraft fluid system failures.    Miniature, low power, lightweight, low cost, smart detectors such as those made by Cyrano Sciences, Inc. installed at critical fluidic system connections, lines, or interstitial spaces in the airframe can provide a timely warning to the pilot or PHM system to service the system or take other appropriate actions.    In Phase II of this SBIR, we will extend our Phase I work on aircraft fluid detection and identification using our polymer composite sensors and software and apply it to the problems of detecting hydraulic and coolant leaks in the Joint Strike Fighter. The Phase II activities will result in design and fabrication of a \"looks-like, works-like\" engineering prototype for functional evaluation in the laboratory and initial flight-testing.",

A Phase I project showed the feasibility of using technology for automated abductive inference (best explanation reasoning), supported by modeling and simulation, to detect, and infer the locations of, sonically illuminated objects, using data from ambient sounds that have been degraded by multipathing. It appears that 3D scene reconstruction from passive (and active) sonar can be done using layered abductive inference, physics models, computational geometry, and miscellaneous domain knowledge. The objectives of the Phase II project are to develop a more advanced abduction engine and to demonstrate its effectiveness for 3D scene reconstruction from passive sonar. Model-based abduction has many potential applications to other problems of information fusion and interpretation for military and civilian applications.",

Even with the recent terrorist activities, the defense procurement budget has dramatically fallen from its peak, and DoD and the Military Services are demanding more performance for less cost. Gone are the days when new systems could be acquired simply for reasons of greater performance. Now the benefits of performance improvements must be balanced against cost to arrive at a \"best value\" solution or best investment. Effective decision-making to support \"best-value\" investments can be enhanced with a distributed collaborative decision support (DCDS) environment.

It therefore offers to missile defense two wholly new options for detection and tracking of closely-spaced objects (CSOs):    (1) Pixon processing can increase resolution by a factor of four beyond the diffraction limit. It thus can resolve targets at ranges four times greater than otherwise possible, increasing the time available for critical decision making.    (2) Conversely, telescope apertures can be reduced by a factor of four while holding performance constant, resulting in significantly reduced system cost.    We propose to build a modular Pixon processor that will not only demonstrate such resolution enhancement but also significantly decrease noise and achieve theoretically optimum radiometry. The prototype-implemented in field-programmable gate arrays on a single circuit board-will process images of CSO clusters in 0.03 second.  Multiple processors can work in parallel to process larger or multiple images; future implementations in application-specific integrated circuits will further increase speed. In an Enhancement option, we propose to interface this core processor with Aeromet, Inc.'s AIRS sensors and field test the full system.

One of the rotary disk modules was recently tested by the Air Force researchers, and they were able to build the world's highest average power rotary disk lasers in Nd-YAG and Nd-glass.  Their tests have a great potential to serve Air Force's Directed Energy applications in the tens of kilowatt power regime.

This projectile delivers relatively the same quantity and quality of force to targets that range from just in front of the launcher to a target as far away as two kilometers.  This is achieved by a carefully engineered projectile that flies at a nearly constant velocity and then changes its configuration just prior to impacting the target.  This project is also designed to deliver secondary payloads as it performs its primary kinetic impact function.  Secondary payloads will include electro-incapacitation systems.  The proposed technology is a new application of existing civilian technology and hence can be manufactured at low cost.

For instance, it could be configured to implement the CDMA cellular phone waveform while in the USA and then be reconfigured to implement the GSM cellular phone waveform when in Europe.     Multipath immunity is among the advantages of Flexceiver technology.  Multipath is the name given to the phenomenon that causes cell phone and radio station fades.  For instance, while sitting at a traffic light you may loose the radio station you were listening to (due to a fade) and then recover reception by drifting six inches forward.  The Flexceiver supports waveforms that eradicate this phenomenon, dramatically improving one-way and two-way RF communications systems.  The Flexceiver features the capacity for the opportunistic use of radio frequency spectrum is an attribute that will become increasingly important as our frequency bands become more crowded.  The ranging capability of the Flexceiver can be leveraged for positioning applications such as location of children and parents within an amusement park, tracking of busses and taxi cabs, and warehouse inventory management.  The high accuracy consensus clock feature facilitates low power networking by enabling all network devices to go into and come out of a low power sleep mode synchronously.  Low Probability of Jamming (LPJ) waveforms are particularly attractive to military markets.  Low Probability of Detection (LPD) waveforms are desirable to the intelligence community.",

Current systems suffer from high false alarm rates when operating in shallow water. The operator is the limiting factor in system performance for current systems which have to increase the detection and classification confidence threshold of echoes presented, sacrificing detection performance.  Fusing together multiple echoes originating from the same target has the potential to reduce false alarm rates for the sonar system. By exploiting the full scattering field of the target's response to multistatic sources, additional echo reception opportunities can be used to confirm near-specular echo detections thereby improving sonar performance.

We will use meteorological instruments as input to atmospheric predictive codes to bias the ratio of the atmospheric transmission of the two spectral bands.    The benefits of ratio radiometery is that the absolute transmission values are not required and errors are associated only in deviations of the ratio of the bands. During Phase I, we validated the operational capabilities of our ADS Radiometer system by testing the device against various US Navy atmospheric databases.    During Phase I, we also established detailed error budgets that form the basis of our component specifications and for our calibration strategy. Our Phase II design embraces the fact that non-lethal weapons maintenance requirements must be reasonably compatible with those for other items of equipment and support procedures should not require extraordinary arrangements or the introduction of a large quantity of system-specific test and repair equipment.

For every military scenario, there is a comparable problem in civilian law enforcement, at Department of Energy facilities and within the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's charter.  SARA proposes to expand on the Phase I concept of a single device, randomly delivering an intrusive, distracting, and annoying non-lethal effect, for many seconds. The proposed non-lethal device will accommodate several existing non-lethal distraction devices and fit existing delivery systems thereby eliminating the need for another new system, shortening the development cycle and speeding up the time between research and end use. The Phase II effort will involve design, test, structural analysis, environmental testing and culminate in a user evaluation.",

Key technological prerequisites for this new approach are the ability to monitor the condition of critical components, and the ability to accurately forecast their remaining useful life. Phase I of this project clearly demonstrated the feasibility of accurately predicting the remaining life of rolling element bearings. During Phase II, Sentient Corporation will complement in-house test capabilities by teaming with The Timken Company to assemble a comprehensive, high quality database of bearing spall initiation and propagation for tapered roller, angular contact, and radial bearings, while Purdue University will research material and component level phenomena. New understanding of bearing failure processes resulting from this data will be used to further develop the physics-based model created during Phase I. The goal is for the model to represent the physics of failure accurately enough that it will work in virtually any bearing application without modification. This will be demonstrated by evaluating model performance across the entire experimental database. In addition, the model will be enhanced to utilize diagnostic data for refining model predictions and estimating uncertainty.",

InSb and GaSb substrates have advantages that make them attractive and in use for high frequency stealth (such as the joint strike fighter) and commercial applications. A significant aspect inhibiting ready-to-use implementation of these wafers is the inconsistency of the substrate surface. In particular, producing epi-ready surfaces with a desorbable oxide is difficult when using standard chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) finishing technique. The Phase I program demonstrated a 33% to 65% reduction in average roughness (Ra) and peak-to-valley (Z) roughness of InSb and GaSb surfaces through use of gas cluster ion beam (GCIB) smoothing processes prior to homoepitaxy growth. A controlled oxide and the elimination of surface pitting in substrate/epitaxy interfaces with molecular beam homoepitaxy application were observed. In the Phase II program, highly precise InSb and GaSb substrate alignment (\u00b10.01\u00b0), a consistent surface RHEED oscillation pattern, and explicit electrical integrity of InSb based focal plane arrays made from the improved substrates will be implemented to provide verification of \"epi-readiness\" and determine substrate specifications.

The design of NASEIM allows fast-time noise computation ? consistent with the needs of the simulation it is supporting.  In addition to noise modeling, NASEIM integrates air quality impact assessment in the form of emissions inventories, providing a more complete environmental impact picture.  Using NASEIM, researchers can, early in the development cycle, identify concept elements that are significant contributors to specific impacts.  Further, NASEIM allows comparison across multiple concepts.  Phase II concludes with an integrated demonstration of NASEIM with ACES.",

        "abstract": "The Phase-I investigation resulted in a major breakthough in terms of algorithmic capabilities to retrieve thrusting target range using passive measurements of target spectral radiation.  Range, range uncertainty, and range sensitivity are computed with high accuracy.  The algorithm takes full advantage of the atmospheric propagation models (e.g., Modtran), while the inputs to the model are also retrieved from the radiation measurements.  The algorithm was demonstrated with numerous synthetic data cases as well as with actual sensor measurements (Black Brant launch from White Sands Missile Range).  The technique, based on an inverse problem solution, was demonstrated to work with different types of sensors including multispectral (such as the HALO-II system equipped with appropriate bandpass filters) or hyperspectral sensors with a large number of bands.  It was also shown that multiple bands improve algorithm accuracy and make the approach less sensitive to sensor noise.  For a hyperspectral sensor, it was shown that noise had negligible impact on range retrieval accuracy.    Under Phase-II, efforts will focus on porting the algorithm to a flight capable system and integrating the system on board the HALO-II aircraft.  This work will be accomplished with the full support of Aeromet, the developer and operator of the HALO-II system.  In parallel to the hardware implementation, the algorithm will be further tested with plume radiation measurements of several target vehicles types (solids, amines, and cryogenic) through a wide range of trajectory parameters.  Additional enhancements will be implemented to reduce overall uncertainty, and to account for correlated parameters.",

We will iterate system design alternatives, compare them with our baseline system, and discuss the best of the alternative with the Navy. We will also develop test methods, fabricate test hardware and perform experimental studies to determine the effectiveness of our proposed vehicle arresting system. At the completion of the Option Phase II a full landing/handling system will be supplied to the Navy for sea trials or other development testing during Phase III.",

        "abstract": "The continuous increase in integrated circuit (IC) scaling and complexity means that there are less output pins per transistor on the chip, resulting in reduced observability, controllability and insufficient test coverage.  External testing of the IC has therefore become complex, time intensive and expensive. The answer is to use Built In Self Test (BIST).  The use of BIST can, however, affect the way in which a circuit responds to a radiation event because it is intimately electrically connected to the circuit it is to test.  The technical objective of the Phase I project was to develop an innovative feasibility concept that provides a radiation hard by design capability for BIST circuitry in a chosen manufacturing technology, and incorporate this concept into a selected commercial electronic design automation (EDA) tool.  The test circuit selected for the radiation effects study and subsequent hardening is a flash Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) with non-linearity BIST and prognostic BIST.  During Phase I the design of this circuit was completed and radiation effects vulnerability studies were performed.  Some hardening strategies have been incorporated.  Concepts for tools that would allow design automation of some of the tasks necessary to achieve a radiation-hardened design have also been developed in parallel.  The ADC and the BIST circuits were entered into an EDA design system having circuit simulation capabilities (using the Cadence EDA framework).  With the successful simulation results from Phase I, the technical objective of Phase II is to move forward and conduct a prototype demonstration.  Final deliverables will include a qualified library of BIST for mixed signal designs, a high-speed hardened flash ADC core and a new and unique design kit for radiation effects modeling of analog and mixed signal circuits.",

Existing water-based thermal management systems are undesirable due to the high freezing point of water and need for military systems to operate in low temperature environments.  Mainstream has recently completed a Phase I SBIR program that experimentally verified the potential for spray cooling high power laser diode arrays with non-water-based fluids.  The patented system is capable of removing high heat flux at the laser diode array, maintaining spatially uniform temperature over large laser slab surface areas, and accurately controlling laser temperature.  In Phase II a complete spray cooling thermal management system will be designed, fabricated, and integrated into a high-power, solid-state laser.  The integrated laser system will be performance tested.  In the Phase II Option, gravity-independence will be demonstrated for adverse-gravity and space-based applications.  The result of this program is not just an incremental improvement over an existing thermal solution.  It is the enabling technology that will make weapons-class, solid-state lasers a reality.",

Xtreme Alternative Defense Systems (XADS) proposes to develop a family of prototype systems in Phase 2, stemming from our research during SBIR Phase 1. The systems we propose are called \"StunStrike\".     StunStrike is based on a highly modified \"Tesla coil\" with the capability of accurately and directionally emitting a spark tuned to a frequency which will tetanize and stun human voluntary muscle tissue. The technology allows us to build smaller, shorter ranged systems which are man-portable, as well as larger, fixed position systems with longer range. This technology is somewhat proven, and can be brought to market very soon.    The spark length (range) of each variant is as follows:   - the Close Quarters Shock Rifle (CQSR) is man-portable and has a 5-6 foot range  - the Short Range StunStrike (SRSS) is vehicle or trailer mounted and has a 20 foot range  - the Medium Range StunStrike (MRSS) is trailer or fixed-position mounted and will have a range around 45 feet.",

The system will recover water initially contained within wastes and stabilize the residue with respect to microbial growth. Dry waste may then be safely stored or passed to the next waste treatment process. Using microwave power, water present in the solid waste is selectively and rapidly heated. Liquid phase water flashes to steam and superheats. Hot water and steam formed in the interior of waste particles create an environment that is lethal to bacteria, yeasts, molds, and viruses.  Superheated steam contacts all exposed surfaces and provides an effective thermal kill of microbes, in a manner similar to that of an autoclave.  Both water and heat are recovered in a condensing heat exchanger, with further water reclaimed from saturated air by adsorption, using microwave regenerable sorbents. Benefits of microwave power include rapid heat-up and cool-down, and selective heating of water by the direct absorption of electromagnetic radiation, thus minimizing conductive and convective losses. This translates directly into reduced size and power requirements, and lower Equivalent System Mass (ESM).",

Great advances have been made over the past 20 years in photovoltaic technology, and thin-film devices are no exception.

Tests can be run on test articles as large as 4 square feet quickly and cost effectively because the SURE facility does not require a wind tunnel nor does it move the test article to simulate supersonic rain.  A large range of rain environments can be simulated in the facility.",

        "abstract": "Strategic missile defense will benefit directly by increasing the operational IR bandwidth from the mid-wavelength to a multi-bandwidth capability.  Increasing bandwidth performance will allow on-board processing (target acquisition and discrimination) to improve range performance, tracking, and hit-to-kill.  Increasing bandwidth to include the near IR to the long wavelength IR also allows for incorporation of active sensing (LADAR) in addition to passive sensing.  Sub-wavelength diffractive structures etched onto gallium arsenide (GaAs) present tremendous performance enhancement potential for missile applications.  Employing gray scale lithography to etch the sub-wavelength diffractive structures onto both surfaces of the GaAs eliminates the need for anti-reflective coatings and allows for discreet sub-bandwidths of operation over a broadband operational window with very high performance, improved field-of-regard, and increased fracture toughness.  Employing GaAs as the bulk IR window opens the bandwidth from the mid-wavelength region (sapphire) to include the near IR to the far long wavelength IR.  It also provides a cutoff temperature of nearly 460\u00b0C.  GaAs and the sub-wavelength diffractive structures present a significant opportunity to improve spectral performance of the THAAD system or any kill vehicle utilizing the IR part of the spectrum.  Relatively large area diffractively structured GaAs windows (T>85%) will be demonstrated.",

The concept presented is for a multi-task sensor produced using MEMS technology that fits in the cylinder head adjacent to the gasket with its sensing element exposed in the cylinder to the combustion process. The fabrication process and design are proprietary information. The device is to be fabricated using technology derived to build planar strain gauges that have thickness of between 20um and 100um. The same packaging solution that was used for the strain gauges is to be used for the pressure /temperature sensor. This allows the ''finished'' devices to be in the 45um to 125um thickness range. As such, they can be fitted to an engine without the need to machine or redesign the engine. Subsequently, the device can be fitted to existing engines. Devices will be able to measure both temperature and pressure throughout a four-stroke cycle. As such failure in valves, piston rings or the cylinder head gasket can be identified. The fabrication method (MEMS) in conjunction with the unique packaging solution ensures that the unit cost of the device is in the $5.00 range.",

However, the development cycle of a new material or component can be very time consuming and costly. We propose to implement a modular architecture for a Virtual Systems Integration Lab (VSIL) that allows designers to quickly create simulations for their systems. The VSIL can increase the speed and reduce the cost at which new materials and components are developed. In particular, the design and production of vehicles frequently require that physical prototypes be made of certain subcomponents. These prototypes can be very costly and time consuming. Furthermore, multiple revisions of the prototype often need to be made during the design process. The VSIL will decrease the cost of system design and decrease the time to market.  Cybernet will leverage their extensive experience in software architecture, systems modeling, sensor development, vehicle modeling, and hardware testing.  This Phase II effort will result in the development of a sophisticated virtual prototyping architecture and a sophisticated simulation of a Vetronics system chosen in coordination with the sponsor.

Advantages and disadvantages of each type of air moving device will be examined.A clear understanding of how any air movement device fits into the system will be developed.  If the air movement device does not operate at its peak efficiency, the system as a whole does not operate as efficiently as it could.  It is paramount that each component within a system be understood from the system's perspective.    Work will include the design and development of multiple air movement devices by a mathematical development process integrated with CFD analysis.  Solid models of the finalized designs will be used to create working rapid prototype fans and blowers.  Each prototype then will be performance tested.  This will provide the measurable real world benefit of each design improvement.   One or more of the prototype air moving devices will then be incorporated into other ongoing programs.

A new higher-voltage approach has emerged as a future standard for commercial automotive electrical systems.

Additionally, the implementation of 42V power management systems will facilitate the growth of many emerging technologies that benefit from higher supply voltages, such as integrated starter/generators, drive-by-wire systems, electromagnetic valvetrains, and intelligent electro-mechanical loads.

The resultant panels match the shape of internal cavities within the vehicle, thus allowing ease of integration.  The use of large curved tiles allows the cost of the system to be low (no building of mosaics with smaller tiles), and allows the armor system to function as part of the structure of the vehicle.

        "abstract": "The Virtual System Integration Laboratory (VSIL) represents a significant advance in integrated vehicle testing, particularly important for future vehicle programs such as FCS. It provides a means of simulating, testing and evaluating vehicle system components and their interfaces and integration into a functioning system. Previous approaches relied upon development of prototypes to resolve integration and interoperability issues between subsystems, an approach that is both costly and time-consuming. The HLA-based VSIL will use simulation objects and scenarios developed under this contract, together with contractor-developed simulations of vehicle subsystems and SAFOR drivers, to assess subsystem integration, interoperability and performance issues as a virtual system. The VSIL will additionally provide capabilities for Hardware/Software-In-The-Loop (H/SITL) testing and evaluation, where appropriate and useful. GDLS, one of the FCS vehicle contractors, has indicated that they will be providing matching funds (Fast Track) and creating a VSIL in-house with the results of this effort in support of its FCS efforts. The VSIL will include an Internet-accessible Repository of models, simulations and interface specifications to facilitate development of subsystem-specific simulations by second tier contractors, thereby increasing the assurance of interoperability in emerging systems.",

All vehicle and top-tier component manufacturers recognize the numerous benefits of 42-Volt  electrical systems for improved performance, fuel efficiency, packaging, and emissions.  However, it was quickly determined that the commercial automotive industry has significantly reduced the pace of 42-Volt adaptation and therefore the near-term feasibility for military adoption of commercial 42-Volt technology is greatly reduced.  However, the analysis completed during Phase I uncovered a number of significant challenges electrical system reliability, longevity, and safety.  Therefore, ASTI has determined to develop a comprehensive \"Intelligent Multiple Battery Sustainment and Readiness System\" (IMBSRS) for ground vehicles which will monitor the needs of the battery system and employ multiple technologies to manage and protect critical components.  The objectives of the IMBSRS are to prevent dead batteries, maximize the longevity of batteries, detect battery system problems and predict component failures, extend battery system performance, and demonstrate wide-scale applicability to legacy commercial and military vehicles and to the Army's Future Combat Systems.  The configurable system will include advanced wireless communications and embedded diagnostics and prognostics capabilities.",

Additional instrumentation is needed to improve manned docking operations? safety, as well as to enable telerobotic operation of spacecraft or completely autonomous rendezvous and docking. To address this need, we propose a suite of active sensors that will provide range and bearing information to a docking craft at distances of kilometers, and will provide 6-degree-of-freedom information at distances of hundreds of meters. The suite of sensors will include NASA?s Advanced Video Guidance Sensor (AVGS) for short-range operations, and will build on that sensor?s flight heritage by adding a laser range and bearing finder (RBF). There is a need for a laser RBF that can operate to distances of 5 km; currently, no such space-qualified RBF exists. For this reason we propose building a wide-angle laser RBF. The wide angle removes the need for scanning systems such as gimbals, eliminating moving parts and making the sensor simpler and space qualification easier. The RBF will work from 5 km in to distances on the order of tens of meters, an operating range that will allow it to mesh with AVGS, and with a range accuracy of 1 m.",

The radiator is one of the key parts in heat rejection systems, in both power conversion technologies for solar and space nuclear electric propulsion. An advanced radiator must provide high thermal performance with minimum mass while satisfying launch and deployment considerations. Traditional metal based radiators and single phase pumped heat transport loops are inadequate for the emerging demands; metal based high temperature radiators usually are over 8 ~ 10kg/m2.  C-C composite materials are ideal candidates to solve this challenge because of their series of advantages, such as very low density, high thermal conductivity, good mechanical properties, high flexibility and variability in thermal and structural properties by tailoring their composite constituents.  In combination with heat pipes, two-phase Capillary Pumped Loops (CPL) and Loop Heat Pipes (LHP) or other two-phase heat transport loops, overall thermal performance and reliability of the space radiators can be significantly improved and realized by reducing radiator mass, which is a big portion of overall spacecraft mass.",

Equally important, the Equivalent Source Reduction (ESR) experiments completed show a dramatic simplification of the problem of acoustically modeling surfaces, with little to no perceivable difference in the auralization.  \n\nWhile AuSIM3D? real-time binaural rendering capacity has grown from a few point sound sources four years ago to a few dozen point sources presently, largely due to gains in commodity processor speed, the performance improvement capacity shown by SVD and the simplification of the acoustic surface modeling problem demonstrated possible with ESR has been much more dramatic.  Our results show hundreds of point sources can now be realistically rendered in real-time, and that these sources can represent a relatively large surface with negligible loss of accuracy.  When these techniques are integrated in the AuSIM3D client and server applications as proposed in Phase II, it will be possible for the first time to binaurally render the sound of an acoustic disturbance applied to a surface model of considerable area.   \n\nAuSIM is also eager to optimize the ESR and SVD implementations into commercial-quality software applications to create the next generation of AuSIM3D technology.  With the newly added horsepower, AuSIM3D applications will be soon able to render directly the acoustic data generated by industry standard Finite Element Analysis (FEA) acoustics vendors such as MSC/Nastran, COMET Acoustics, and ABAQUS.

As there are no analytical tools or experimental facilities in the world today that can quantify a cavitating inducer?s dynamic transfer function, developing this capability is crucial for the safety, reliability and competitiveness of the American Space Industry.  An innovative experimental technique that uses mappings of inlet and exit flow and pressure fluctuations to quantify a cavitating inducer?s dynamic transfer function is proposed.  A cavitating inducer can be a source of instability in a rocket vehicle.  Due to cavitation dynamics, inlet flow perturbations maybe amplified by the inducer resulting in very large flow and pressure fluctuations in the fuel system.    The resulting dynamic couplings can lead to vehicle instability (POGO) as well as generate intense dynamic loadings on the turbopump.

The improved wear (relative to commercial diamond tools) is achieved by orienting diamond crystals on the tips of specially designed cutter inserts, so as to exploit the anisotropy in diamond hardness. The reduction in tip wear enhances the precision of machining in uninterrupted cuts. The advantage is most clearly seen when hard ceramics, such as SiC, are machined, but the new cutter technology also provides benefits in machining certain metallic systems. Another innovation is the fabrication of a set of spherically-shaped Diamonite? smoothers, which improve the quality of the finishing operation; thus, for the first time, giving an ultra-smooth surface finish. The combined innovations should enable the optics industry to enhance the performance of large telescopes and interferometers. In Phase I, we designed a special diamond cutting tool for SiC, manufactured samples of cutters and smoothers, conducted research on machining and smoothing of mirror materials, and proved the validity of the concept. In Phase II, we propose to develop ultra-smooth diamond tooling and diamond tool fabrication techniques. The deliverables are diamond-TiC-Ti cutters to achieve higher precision of turning and Diamonite? smoothers to realize better surface finish.   In addition, procedures for the reproducible fabrication of mirror optics will be defined.

        "abstract": "Microbial growth in storage water has been a problem for NASA since the onset of space flight.  During the Phase I program, Luna developed a novel affinity microcantilever-based biosensor that was capable of directly monitoring water supplies for bacterial contamination during space flights. The biosensor is based upon the principle that as organisms bind to an affinity coated microcantilever beam, the chemomechanical forces induce a deflection in proportion to concentration of bound target.  Using gold-based coupling methods, anti-E coli antibodies were attached to the microcantilever beams and tested with varying concentrations of E. coli. Luna?s patented EFPI technology was then used to monitor the cantilever deflection with subnanometer sensitivity.  Binding of E. coli was successfully demonstrated at concentrations of 105 CFU/ml which induced significant signal responses.  During the Phase II, sensitivity will be increased using the new USB FiberPro II system and through optimization of affinity coatings and signal enhancement reagents.  The affinity microcantilever will be adapted for multiplexing using micromachined arrays and integrated with microfluidics for stable reagent handling.  The affinity microcantilevers will not only be useful for space-based applications, but will be adaptable for use in water quality and environmental monitoring, food safety, process monitoring, and medical diagnostics.",

Liquid monopropellants are often used in propulsion systems where simplicity of design, restartable/control on demand, and repeatability is desired.  Unfortunately, many monopropellants are toxic and dangerous, ruling them out for EMU thruster application. Thus, EMU thrusters have relied upon cold gaseous nitrogen, which offers very low specific impulse and propellant mass fraction. A NOPS, however, uses nitrous oxide, a readily available safe and storable propellant which is not toxic, has performance comparable to hydrazine, and does not decompose spontaneously like hydrogen peroxide.  Furthermore, Pioneer Astronautics has demonstrated a system that decomposes N2O into a breathable mix of oxygen and nitrogen.  Thus, for example, an EMU propelled by a NOPS system would provide an astronaut with a large emergency backup supply of oxygen.  Such a dual use system could also have great utility as the propulsion system for manned spacecraft, such as the International Space Station or the Space Shuttle, where safety is paramount and breathing gas reserves are desired.

        "abstract": "Tinsley Laboratories, a subsidiary of SSG Inc., proposes a Phase 2 SBIR program to increase the efficiency of manufacturing bare Beryllium mirrors using  its proprietary deterministic Computer Controlled Optical Surfacing (CCOS) process.  Over the last 25 years, this process has demonstrated the capability to produce state-of-the-art aspheric optics, including extensive work with bare Beryllium aspheric reflectors.  In the Phase 1 SBIR study, a process involving tool dressing assisted CCOS grinding generated material removal rates that were more linear than the standard CCOS grinding process.  The Phase 2 effort proposes to investigate additional parameters of the tool assisted CCOS process with a goal of achieving >2x reduction in total processing time.  Increased efficiency, and reduced costs, are key drivers as next generation astronomical and earth observing applications are being driven to larger and larger telescope apertures.  Beryllium optics are a key technology for these large aperture system designs, due to the material?s high specific stiffness and aggressively lightweighting capabilities.  The process optimization that we propose will make Beryllium optics more cost effective for these applications, in this way allowing system designs to benefit from the superior bulk material properties associated with the material.",

Space Micro has developed innovations for mitigating SEU/SEFI, enabling the use of high-speed microprocessors (>1,500 MIPS) with improved SEU tolerances (>1E-5 errors/day).  Time-Triple Modular Redundancy (TTMR) applies traditional triple modular redundancy on a single microprocessor.  TTMR improves SEU rates substantially.  SEFI is solved through the use of a SEFI ?Hardened Core? circuit, external to the microprocessor, along with SEFI recovery software embedded into application code.  It monitors the ?health? of the processor, and if SEFI occurs, forces the processor to return through a series of escalating events (interrupts, reset).  Space Micro successfully demonstrated monitoring and recovery of Pentiums from SEFI, 100% of the time, using a prototype of the H-Core in a proton environment. This is significant in being the industry?s first (only) demonstrated solution for SEFI in microprocessors.  \n\nIn Phase II, the H-Core will be advanced into a radiation hardened IC that operates with any advanced microprocessor, allowing automatic return to operational status after a SEFI event.

        "abstract": "Application of fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMC) can enhance the efficiency and performance, reduce the weight, improve the durability, and lower the cost of rocket engine combustion devices and turbomachinery components used in high temperature, high-stress environments. Meeting these objectives requires improvements in fiber-reinforced CMC materials and fabrication processes, particularly improved fiber/matrix interfaces, interface deposition processes, and oxidation protection. In previous work, Ultramet developed an ultraviolet-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (UVCVD) process that allows deposition of dense, strain-tolerant ceramics at room temperature, thus avoiding heat-induced material degradation and providing excellent material performance, including enhanced oxidation protection. Although these coatings have improved performance, identifying a single phase that best performs the two key functions of the interface coating, oxidation protection and interface slip, has proven elusive. Phase I focused on development of both conventional CVD and UVCVD deposition techniques that resulted in several novel multilayer interface coating systems utilizing oxide and carbide phases. Fiber tows coated with multilayer systems exhibited dramatic improvement in tensile strength compared to both uncoated tows and fiber coated with a single oxide layer. One multilayer system was employed in the fabrication of a carbon fiber-reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) CMC that demonstrated the highest mechanical strength yet achieved for C/SiC using Ultramet's melt infiltration densification process, verifying the beneficial effect of the multilayer system via a 33% strength increase. The Phase II project will build on this encouraging preliminary room temperature data via further optimization of multilayer interface deposition at Ultramet and extensive evaluation of both coated tows and CMCs utilizing the coatings at the elevated temperatures expected in actual use.",

Mesoporous materials consist of highly ordered three-dimensional structures with precisely controlled pore size distributions, relatively high surface areas, and surface affinities which promote the adsorption of aqueous organic contaminants.

These innovative catalysts will facilitate the development of more effective methods for the destruction of organic contaminants in wastewaters generated aboard spacecraft, Lunar and planetary habitations. When fully developed, ambient temperature catalysts can be employed in the volatile removal assembly (VRA) or other similar aqueous phase catalytic oxidation reactors to both increase the degree of mineralization of organic contaminants and to drastically reduce the required operating temperature and pressure.  These improved performance characteristics directly translate into reduced size, weight, and power consumption, and therefore will result in substantially lower Equivalent System Mass (ESM) for catalytic reactors which employ these innovative highly active ambient temperature catalysts.

ARDL proposes to further study, optimize and develop airless wheel-tire concepts to ultimately achieve a spring reinforcement for inserting to the current radial tires.  \u00b7 The proposed Phase II study is to continue the current development of a run flat tire is based on a spiral spring reinforcement elements.  The development will be based on the following two ideas/concepts:    (1)  MASYS patented idea of molding the tire around the spiral spring.  This idea will be tested using 13-inch prototype tires from MASYS (Israel)  (2)  ARDL concept of inserting the spring element into the current commercial and army (radial) tires.  This idea will be tested using 15-inch prototype tires developed by ARDL.  The Phase II effort will include the selection of one concept/idea for the prototype manufacturing 20-inch Army tire.  This design will be evaluated and optimized based on performance, durability, manufacturability, reliability, weight and cost factors for 20-inch tires.  The Phase II effort will include the submission of ten prototype 20-inch tires for TACOM durability testing based on the selected manufacturing concept.",

It represents decades of development and is the standard tool for experimental particle physics simulations.  In another SBIR Phase I project AES had already established its level of suitability for the simulation of space radiation shielding to protect astronauts. Geant4, however, represents geometry in its own format which is not immediately\ncompatible with standard CAD programs which generally lack critical information for radiation simulation such as composition of materials.\n\nBased on experience in Phase I, we plan to continue developing an XML framework plus associated tools supporting both CAD (STEP) format and Geant4, plus a rich variety of extensions which offer significant flexibility in terms of the ability to track accounting, assembly, quality, and countless other parameters with no interference with the main physics/engineering tasks. This could prove invaluable in attempts to better understand equipment and mission failures, optimize maintenance and repair schedules, and generally improve reliability.",

        "abstract": "Future NASA programs will utilize solid-state devices (e.g., detectors, processors) that require cooling. Thermal management is of critical importance for a variety of solid-state devices. As the size of solid-state devices continues to shrink, device performance and reliability is limited by the ability to remove the increasing density of heat generated within these components. Furthermore, other devices such as solid-state lasers and infrared cameras require cooling and active temperature control. We propose two complimentary approaches to address these issues. The first approach is to develop thermoelectric (TE) coolers using nanotechnology. Thermoelectric materials require high electrical conductivity, but low thermal conductivity. Using nanotchnology it should be possible to significantly suppress the thermal conductivity without a corresponding reduction in electron transport. The second approach we propose is to enhance the thermal contact conductance at interfaces by taking advantage of nanotechnology.",

The improved performance allows a low mass, low power requirement, chemical analysis tool suitable for planetary missions. This tool is suitable for understanding the chemistry of geophysical materials and can detect signs of life or pre-biotic processes.  The ability to determine chemical state in addition to elemental composition of materials with no a priori knowledge of the materials provides a robust experimental capability for extracting information in situations where the environment is not totally known. A second innovation involves using a new sample access technology that eliminates valves or pumping from the Mars atmosphere. The XPS tool input only needs to be placed 1 mm from the sample area of interest. This greatly simplifies ease of use, makes sample introduction simple and improves reliability.

As NASA pursues long-duration crewed missions, it will be necessary to adapt packed-bed chemical processing methods to reduced gravity to minimize the mass and volume of consumables hauled from earth. To develop design tools, accurate measurement of void fraction is critical to (1) identify the flow regimes, and (2) quantify the liquid holdup. Opaque reactor beds and conductive working liquids render various traditional void fraction measurements impractical. Advantages of impedance-based measurements include:  excellent sensitivity to void fraction, non-intrusive installation, and high rates of data sampling. In Phase I we demonstrated that our approach can meet the need with a prototypical packed-bed geometry and a conductive liquid. Our results prove a sensor configuration, demonstrate a signal-conditioning approach, and show that electrical impedance measurements in a packed-bed configuration can be correlated readily to void fraction for both steady-state and transient two-phase flows.  During Phase II we will develop purpose-built electronics, adapt the sensor mechanical design to the configuration of packed-bed facilities, and demonstrate a prototype with packed-bed facilities like those used in NASA research projects.",

Using our proprietary high performance adhesive to insulated metal substrate process for LED illuminators, Relume has been able to demonstrate a three to four fold increase in luminous output over conventional approaches with a dramatic improvement in life, lower production costs and increased reliability. When combined with our pulse modulation technology, we are able to produce high power, secure signaling lamps for either visible or infrared applications. Conventional large arrays of high output LEDs are particularly vulnerable to degradation, as it becomes increasingly difficult to shed heat from such dense arrays.  Without aggressive cooling means, large LED arrays have degraded rapidly in hot climates.  Using advanced adhesives, proprietary metal circuit construction and economical screen printing methods, Relume is able to achieve very robust, highly efficient LED arrays.  With this highly aggressive thermal management, Relume's LED arrays can be pulsed at very high intensities permitting very long distance secure communication links.  In Phase I a high output modular array was fabricated using this process. This array was digitally modulated for optical communication with a Relume handheld receiver.  Relume's advanced LED arrays demonstrated a factor of four increase in luminous output over conventional approaches proving the feasibility this technology.

Significant time compression and a compact footprint will be needed for mobile repair to serve in the field. The Direct Metal Deposition (DMD) offers promise due to its closed loop control of the dimension, however, the build rate or deposition rate has to be enhanced. Deposition rate enhancement for a machine with this limited foot print is a challenge since it limits the type, size and power of the laser energy source. Diode laser technology offers a solution due to its high power efficiency and small foot print, in comparison to CO2 and Nd:YAG systems.    The Phase I program has demonstrated that laser aided DMD is possible with a 300 Watt diode laser having a wavelength of 810nm, with deposition rate comparable or slightly higher than that for CO2 laser of equivalent power. The goal for the Phase II is to develop a fiber-coupled diode laser based, DMD system platform, scalable to reach the high deposition rate goal of 8-10 inch3 per hour using a high power fiber-coupled diode laser. In order to achieve the stated goal, the Phase II program will construct a 5-axis DMD system with a 1 kW fiber coupled diode laser (the highest power available today), complemented by a research program for high deposition rate using a multi- kilowatt CO2 laser to provide a road map for future higher power systems.     As a result of the Phase II, a diode laser based DMD system will be ready for commercialization that will accept higher powered diode lasers as they become commercially available, and its performance will be fully understood at those higher laser power levels. High power diode laser DMD technology will enable the introduction of DMD to the high volume manufacturing environment.

A secondary innovation is the specific selection of other critical system components that make the overall system suitable for airborne and space-based instrumentation.

        "abstract": "To achieve the required levels of efficiency, performance, reliability, and survivability in the Army's next generation of weapon systems and tactical vehicles, designers need to comprehensively model the integrated performance of vehicle components early in the design process. ThermoAnalytics proposes to create an integrated vehicle design tool geared towards efficient thermal management, versatile propulsion capability, and cost-effective signature control. This tool, based on the proven MuSES and RadTherm analysis codes, will consist of detailed, system-ready models of components such as heat exchangers, cooling loops, heat pipes, fluid pumps, and temperature-dependent drivetrain component models. Since airflow is an important factor in thermal management, ThermoAnalytics will incorporate application-specific convection models based on CFD solutions into the component models. This combination of fluid and thermal is essential to optimize the cooling system under the wide variety of operating and environmental conditions that military assets are subjected to. To validate the design tool  ThermoAnalytics is collaborating with Engineered Machined Products, Michigan Technological University, and Clemson University. The virtual prototyping thermal management design tool will be tied closely with CAD and Product Data Management systems to facilitate the integration of the tool with other analysis and design codes.",

The effort proposed herein sets forth a multi-phase approach for the efficient application of existing data processing, visualization and analysis techniques for the identification and characterization of safety-relevant flight conditions, and for the identification of their precursors. The approach starts by reducing the voluminous flight data into a feature-based encoding, where features used for each flight parameter type are selected to match its specific variation. The second processing phase allows domain experts to efficiently inspect the flight data starting from detected exceedances, and to formulate constraint-based hypotheses regarding co-occurring events, and possible precursors. The third phase uses the hypotheses developed during the second phase to apply constraint-based data mining techniques for the identification of patterns associated with exceedances, and to identify the precursor sets for safety-relevant flight conditions. The description of the proposed effort also includes preliminary implementation results for selected prototype components, and establishes the feasibility of the investigated approach.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale, 3D simulations of complex configurations using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) have become increasingly critical in the design of aircraft, aerospace vehicles and propulsion systems. The CFD analysis process consists of three phases: pre-processing, solver and post-processing. Multi-disciplinary techniques, which analyze phenomena such as fluid-structure interaction, introduce additional computational complexity and require non-trivial coupling between CFD and structures codes. In designing software for each of the three analytical phases, software developers tend to look at what is optimal and necessary for their particular operation. Considerations such as data sharing, archiving and interoperability are given less attention than efficiency and accuracy of physical models. As the pace of simulation increases, the sheer volume of numerical data requires that a stable and easy to operate methodology be made available to developers and users of pre-processing, post-processing and solver tools. The offeror proposes to create a software toolkit that provides an intelligent storage and retrieval mechanism for large-scale CFD simulation data, combining software libraries, database/compression methodologies and web browser-style control and query tools. This toolkit will assist those developing and maintaining solver codes as well as the analyst/designer community and greatly accelerate aerospace vehicle synthesis by enabling data sharing, storage efficiency and interoperability.",

There is an immediate need to reduce the workload and manpower requirements, and expedite the distribution of ammunition shipments through the in-theater storage areas to the combat end users.  To support this initiative, this program will develop and implement the enabling component technologies required for highly autonomous, configured load building.  By extending the autonomy of robotic field material handling equipment through the integration of sensor driven, intelligent controls, the efficiency and expedition of forward supply operations will be significantly increased.     RRC established that through the application of sensor technologies and advanced robotic control, an existing manual material handling system could be modified to perform many tasks autonomously.  RRC incorporated new hardware and software controls to the Smart Crane Ammunition Transfer System to demonstrate this capability.  The Smart Crane employs an integrated set of core component technologies, which are reusable and adaptable for deployment throughout the military's material handling domain.  The Smart Crane uses a shared control approach, whereby an operator can perform material handling tasks via manual teleoperation or by executing several autonomous strategies for crane control operation.  The greatest impact to increasing operational efficiency and throughput in material handling operations will be achieved by advancing the autonomy of the system, thereby promoting the operator to a supervisory role.  This program will develop the hardware and software components that advance the automation of three requisite material handling activities that are the most time consuming and require the highest level of operator involvement; munitions payload acquisition, payload placement, and payload release.  With these enabling component technologies in hand, the program will develop and implement the infrastructure to coordinate these capabilities to demonstrate highly autonomous, configured load building.    This program builds on technology previously developed for the Army by RRC and others and will provide the Army with a suite of reusable and adaptable hardware and software components that can be applied to a broad range of existing field material handling systems.",

Panels are not independent structures but are part of more complex systems, e.g. panel + support + TPS, and an accurate estimate of the response/life of the panels must include the interaction with these other components.

Conventional filtering methods are invective due to broadly tunable lasers and increasing laser pulse energies/average powers. SARA proposes a novel, protective measure using plasma/optical interactions and nonlinear effects to create an optical shield against laser attack. The SARA approach is independent of laser wavelength, operates real time to defeat multiple line or frequency swept lasers and scales to high average power (weapon class lasers). Further, related and plasma effect can be harnessed in the same SARA concept to simultaneously provide a means for reduction of tank optical signatures against lower power targeting lasers.

        "abstract": "In response to Army SBIR Topic No. A02-232, we propose to develop a novel approach to package high power density SiC devices for high temperature operations. The proposed approach is aimed at achieving (i) substantially higher heat rejection, (ii) drastically simplified packaging technology, (iii) greatly improved reliability for high temperature operations, and (iv) low cost so that it cab find numerous dual-use applications. In Phase I, we clearly demonstrated the feasibility of the approach. In Phase II, we propose to substantially improve the technology, including further increased heat rejection, higher ambient operating temperatures, and increased voltage and power ratings. These substantial improvements to the technology will be achieved through the design, fabrication and demonstration of a series of packaged SiC power rectifiers and switches suitable for high temperature operations.  Computer modeling will be carried out to assist the design of the key components. The fabricated key component will be characterized and tested under different temperatures. The packages developed under Phase II will be capable of handling power dissipations up to a factor of 10X better than state-of-the-art and suitable for operations at ambient temperatures up to 200C or higher. Because of the simplicity and low cost of the proposed packaging technology, if demonstrated successfully, it should also find widespread applications for Si power devices.",

        "abstract": "It is well known that terrestrial microorganisms can thrive in a microgravity environment.  There is a significant risk of transporting opportunistic pathogenic microorganisms from Earth to extraterrestrial environments, as well as the possibility of unfamiliar biocontaminants entering Earth?s atmosphere via flight hardware.  Because these scenarios could pose significant health threats, reliable sampling and detection methods must be developed.  Currently, there are no automated techniques for sampling spacecraft surfaces for microorganisms and providing real-time analysis for contamination, despite the desperate need for such a device.  To overcome obstacles associated with conventional sampling and time-consuming detection methods, Lynntech has developed a unique vacuum surface sampling device which can be used in conjunction with a state of the art electrochemical based gene expression micro-detection unit.  In the Phase I research, Lynntech successfully designed and fabricated the sampling unit, demonstrating its sampling capability on several surfaces.  In addition, the microbiological electronic detection unit, including a cell lysing system and miniature thermal cycler, were successfully designed, built, and tested as individual benchtop components.  The Phase II research will focus on the development and delivery of breadboard hardware to NASA for engineering and microbial evaluation.",

Building on our Phase I work, we propose to automate key aspects of emerging sustainment tactics, techniques, and procedures.  Our approach employs a three-level, hierarchical, component-based software architecture.  This architecture exploits recent advances in constraint-based planning and hierarchical control to decouple the interdependent problems of planning, scheduling, routing, and robotic control. The top level uses constraint-based planning techniques to develop rough-cut resupply plans that respect task priorities and meet deadlines.  The middle level refines these plans into a global schedule for a group of coordinated assets such as a Forward Support Battalion. The bottom level manages the movement of individual vehicles. We will evaluate the system's generality and efficiency through Army-sponsored integration experiments using real hardware, including ARDEC's Smart Crane test bed.  These experiments will apply our system to multi-vehicle resupply scenarios involving combinations of manually operated, semi-autonomous, and fully autonomous MHE, harmonized with FCS's evolving sustainment CONOPS.",

        "abstract": "The primary method of particle mass measurement for industrial processes uses sampling via extraction and filtration, and this method will probably remain as the standard.  While this approach is reliable if carefully performed, it generally requires manual operation and long sample times for a single data point.  Long sample times are specifically a problem for measurements of industrial gas turbine engines, and as stated in the solicitation, are virtually impractical for short term operation of military gas turbine engines.  The Navy would like to find a fast and accurate substitute measurement technique for the conventional mass sampling EPA Method 5.   There is no current cost-effective technology for a real-time particle monitor that is reliable as a continuous and robust sensor for the gas turbine/expander industry.  The ideal requirement is that an advanced sensor obtain both particle size distributions and concentrations in a relatively short period of time, and that the instrument provide a direct or correlated mass measurement.  The device should also be simple to operate, portable, and robust for operation under high temperature field conditions.  The overall objectives of this project will be the design, fabrication, testing, and validation of a quantitative LAPS prototype instrument that can obtain size and concentration measurements of gas turbine soot in the size range of 20 - 500 nm.  The LAPS technique will be combined with the PPC single particle counting technique to provide an instrument that can measure dilute (100 \u00ecg/m3 to 5 g/m3) particle concentrations in the range of 30 nm to 100 microns.  Primary objectives of the phase II project will be design, fabrication, testing and validation of the combined instrument on full-scale gas turbines.

The realizable gains in performance depend upon the capabilities of the antennas and the algorithms employed to control the use of their transmission resources. In our Phase I the San Diego Research Center, Inc. (SDRC) designed distributed algorithms for selecting links for packet transmissions and for scheduling and reserving transmission resources. Specifically, we developed a directional Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) MAC algorithm (the Link Scheduling MAC, LiSL) that improves quality of service (in terms of end-to-end delay, goodput, and reliability) accorded to individual sessions, as well as the network''''''''''''''''s capacity and its ability to thwart jamming and detection by hostile entities, by equipping nodes with directional antennas.     In addition, the SDRC has developed scanning techniques for blind neighbor discovery that result in low probability of detection (LPD). These techniques enable two distant nodes, with no prior knowledge of each other''''''''''''''''s relative location or direction, to find each other using narrow-beam scanning. Results of our Phase I work show that our LiSL MAC and topology management algorithms provide improvement in the capacity and latency of antenna-aware MANET.     For Phase II, we propose to implement LiSL and our Topology Management algorithms, which includes our scanning neighbor discovery module. Further, we will improve the performance of our algorithms using a QualNet model of an end-to-end antenna-aware MANET.

During the proposed, Phase II project we will fabricate and test an innovative cooling system that directly interfaces a recuperative, reverse-Brayton low temperature stage with a regenerative, pulse-tube upper stage. This hybrid, multi-stage cryocooler has the potential to be an efficient and compact device capable of meeting the cryogenic cooling needs of the Air Force. The system offers additional benefits related to easy thermal, electrical, and mechanical integration, high reliability, and low vibration.   During the Phase I project, we developed a detailed thermodynamic model of the proposed cryocooler and validated some aspects of that model against experimental data. Another result of the Phase I project was the development and demonstration of an efficient and practical rectifying interface, required to convert the oscillatory pulse-tube flow into a continuous flow appropriate for the recuperative stage. The key component in the interface, the check-valves, demonstrated flow and dynamic characteristics appropriate for the hybrid cooler. The implementation of the interface system did not have a substantially negative effect on the performance of the pulse-tube stage. This interface represented a key technical challenge for the hybrid cryocooler.",

Thermal oxidation resulting in lubricant work in rigid condition breakdown and formation of deposits are typical causes of engine failure at high temperature operating conditions.  Work in the Phase II program seeks to review all sliding wear tribological aspects of an FCS type military diesel engine.  A systematic approach to generating a tribology solution for high temperature operation is outlined and proposed for solving this issue.  Initially, mathematical modeling equations will be generated to model and predict what adverse tribological phenomenon can be expected at a particular sliding wear interface.  Lubricant modeling equations exist and will be used to determine what specific lubricant properties are essential in solving critical tribology issues, such as short and long term thermal stability (especially the goals of 410\u00ba TRR and 175\u00baC sump temperatures), long term viscosity, viscosity at given temperature, lubricant chemical modification temperature, to mention just a few of the complex lubricant chemistry.  These equations can be used to select specific basestock oil formulations and additive components.  We will use a laboratory Tribology complex test apparatus that will generate eight lubricant performance parameters in real time to assess synthesized lubricants and select the best lubricant components and synthesize a lubricant for small bore single cylinder LHR diesel engine lubricant screening tests.

These systems must detect targets with very small cross-sections, have large operational ranges, and near zero false alarms, thus making threat detection very complicated problem. The fundamental advantage of TM-UWB radar for hit avoidance application is that single pulses are generated and detected rather than long series of cycles, thus extremely low probability-of-detection and high sensitivity are achievable. TM-UWB has many other advantages including size, cost and power, resistance to jamming, ability to perform electronic beam forming and beam steering.

The Kroll technology is mature, yet expensive, limiting titanium?s usages.  The Kroll titanium sponge is vacuum remelted and alloyed, and cast into billets, or the sponge in ground to powder and powder metallurgy processing used to produce components where alloying can occur in-situ during sintering.  Electrolysis/electrowinning processes to produce titanium particulate/sponge have significant potential but have not been perfected to produce acceptable purity and low cost product.  This is due in part to titanium?s +4 valence state and lack of solubility of the oxide or covalent chloride in fused salts, the multivalency of titanium and re-oxidation of reduced titanium ions at the anode.  Initial results of Phase I suggest a breakthrough in electrowinning titanium that overcomes these problems have been demonstrated.  The process consists of a combined thermal/electrolytic treatment utilizing a composite titanium oxide-carbon anode that dissolves Ti3+ directly into solution for electrolytic reduction to titanium particulate that can be directly utilized in powder metallurgy.  Both anode and cathode efficiencies are near 100% resulting in low cost titanium.  Pulse electrolysis benefits demonstrate reducing cell voltage, controlling Ti particle morphology, and allowing the electrolysis to be performed at very low temperatures.  The concept of producing titanium at both composite anodes and cathodes was demonstrated utilizing pulse electrolysis.  Pulse electrolysis will be optimized to the most economical process to produce titanium and titanium alloy powder for armor and other defense applications.

        "abstract": "Creare proposes to complete the development of a system that will simultaneously enable two-way voice communication while monitoring sound exposure to the ear for soldiers working in high noise environments.  Current Army artillery crews are forced to work in close proximity to cannons that produce in excess of 180 dB of impulsive noise, which can result in noise-induced hearing loss after brief exposures without sufficient hearing protection.  These ground crews also have a need to communicate with other personnel.  However, no existing hearing protection system offers sufficient noise reduction for these crews to work safely in extreme noise environments while simultaneously enhancing the communication signal and monitoring sound exposure to the ear.    Creare's Electronic Communication and Dosimetry System for High Noise Environments is based on advanced audio signal processing and state-of-the-art acoustic hardware.  During the Phase I project, we fabricated and tested a bench-top prototype system.  Our test results clearly demonstrated the feasibility of our innovation.  During the Phase II project, we will fabricate and test optimized prototype systems for enhanced communications and dosimetry in high noise environments.",

In keeping with the impetus toward resource recovery and reuse (R3), the Army is seeking means of extracting components from their propellant wastes for reprocessing. In Phase I, the feasibility of an innovative process for recovering the main ingredients of triple-base formulations was demonstrated in the laboratory.  This information was used to develop a detailed flow sheet and mass balance for the process. The process is inherently safe, environmentally friendly, and economic in that it uses an inexpensive industrial solvent and will generate income from the sale of recovered products. Costs associated with conventional disposal of explosive wastes and the long-term maintenance and liability associated with hazardous waste sites will be eliminated.  The main objective of the proposed Phase-II program is to demonstrate the process at the pilot-scale and to evaluate the recovered products for specification compliance.

The objective of this research is to identify the technical requirements to enable the transport of legacy and IP based telemetry streams over IP networks.  In a Phase I effort, Terawave demonstrated that TM/IP is a technically feasible and potentially beneficial solution for meeting the data transmission needs of range networks.  Phase II will pursue the development of a product implementation that will enable successful transmission and reconstruction of source TM streams in a variety of network configurations, implementing mechanisms to support the required Quality of Service across the IP network.  Terawave will also pursue the integration of additional features that will enhance range operations.  The first operational enhancement will be to add the ability to reduce the effects of differential delays between TM streams.

The general technical approach of the proposed IFAS2 (Integrated Force And Sustainment Flow Analysis System)  is to exploit a   distributed workflow framework augmented with a Bayes Net probability network to represent the processes and the interprocess dependencies. Within this framework, sustainment flows would be dynamically adjusted to support force flow.   The Bayes Net would provide the means to determine second and  third order impacts from changes in force flow structures, coordinate their implications, and predict probabilities for adequate sustainment support.  Within this framework, CSS soldiers can identify  risk threshold and use the Bayes Nets to isolate the impacts within the distribution framework. .   We shall leverage heavily from Chi System's CDAS (Commander's Decision Aide System) to provide Map, mobility, and terrain servicing analyses.

However, supply of hydrogen gas to the PEM fuel cell at the point of use remains a problem. The use of a portable fuel reformer offers an attractive technology to provide hydrogen to the fuel cell while using a hydrocarbon liquid fuel as the primary fuel source.  Steam reforming of natural gas is an established process on an industrial scale but it has proven to be difficult to scale down into a compact, efficient system that can process liquid fuels because of sulfur poisoning and system integration and thermal management issues.  To address these challenges InnovaTek proposes to develop a microchannel fuel processor to produce pure hydrogen in the range of 20 to 400 cc/second for a multi-kW PEM fuel cell. The proposed fuel reformer will be built on microchannel architecture to achieve size, weight and thermal efficiency requirements.  The system will produce hydrogen from catalytic steam reforming of readily available fuels, such as gasoline and diesel fuel, through the use of InnovaTek's proprietary sulfur-tolerant catalyst.",

        "abstract": "To mitigate the significant vertical accelerations caused by land mines, an innovative approach is proposed for mine-blast resistant seats for use in the Army's Future Combat Systems (FCS) and Interim Armored Vehicle (IAV) platforms.  Unique energy absorbing metal foam canisters are being designed for installation as legs on Army vehicle seats.  Designs for new diver's and crew seats are suggested that mitigate injuries following a land mine blast load of 1840 g applied over 0.32 ms at the vehicle floor.  The vertical dynamic loads experienced by vehicle seat occupants are attenuated such that no acceleration peak above 20 g persists for more than 7 ms, and corresponding vertical displacements of the seated passenger are minimal.  Advanced finite element modeling of the seat/occupant system under the blast load has led to the optimization of preliminary designs.  These preliminary seats will be instrumented and mine blast tested to validate their designs.  Test data will be correlated with simulation predictions, and improvements will be implemented in the seat designs as necessary.  When the designs are finalized, follow-up manufacturing preparation (including production cost estimation), marketing, and commercialization activities will occur for the new blast resistant Army vehicle seats.

It is bright, scalable to large volume, low weight and low cost, by the end of Phase II.  A true 3-D volumetric image can be created at ambient light for every viewing angle with the prototype. A full color volumetric video monitor for motion pictures can be further developed based on Phase II research.",

        "abstract": "In this Phase II effort, the Foster-Miller team will expand upon the outstanding results achieved during Phase I, exploiting the benefits of nanotechnology to develop single wall carbon nanotube (SWNT)-based electrolytic ultracapacitors having greatly improved power delivery capability over current ultracapacitors.  During the Phase I effort, Foster-Miller demonstrated that the use of SWNTs in an ultracapacitor structure can increase the power delivery capabilities by three orders of magnitude over conventional ultracapacitors.  This performance level will establish SWNT ultracapacitor technology as the ideal power source for Directed Energy Weapon (DEW) systems requiring high (Megawatt) power pulses delivered in the hundreds of microsecond to millisecond time range. These DEW systems, being developed for the Army under the Future Combat Systems (FCS) program, require extremely compact, high capacity, and quick discharging/recharging energy storage systems to be successful.  The ultracapacitor under development here has the most desirable combination of properties for these applications.  The Phase II program will refine the ultacapacitor system initially investigated in Phase I, and then proceed to design and test small scale devices, leading up to design, construction and testing of a prototype 1 kJ SWNT-based ultracapacitor delivering 200 kW/kg for technology transition into selected FCS DEW systems.

The two IR channels are critically chosen to minimize the impact of varying humidity levels; the Phase II will also utilize a normalized difference signal which minimizes the attenuating effects of rain, fog, and snow.  This system will employ a modified commercial 16\" Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope and two uncooled microbolometer focal plane arrays to provide the two thermal IR images form which the target temperature is extracted.  The Phase II will also produce a GUI which is used to view the scene, select the region of interest, and control other operating parameters.  Performance projections are a target temperature accuracy of \u00b11.5\u00baC at a 15Hz measurement bandwidth with a 12cm spatial resolution at a 1km standoff.

As a result, advanced dielectrics that allow for increased capacitor energy density are necessary to ensure successful technology insertion.  Recent Phase I results support potential for significantly reducing capacitor size and weight.  Unique methods for assembling nano-size, high dielectric constant particles in a polymer matrix were developed.  Measured properties of the structured composite support capability for amplifying the nano-particle's contribution to dielectric constant by over a factor of three while maintaining dielectric strength.

The world's first preceramic polymer-derived HfC-based structural ceramic fibers were demonstrated. Additionally, preceramic polymers for polymer-infiltration-pyrolysis have also been developed. With both of these advances, it is now possible to produce HfCNf/HfCNm Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC), as well as woven carbon fiber/HfCN matrix composites. Such an advance in CMC technology should have a significant impact on elevating the operational temperature and duration of rocket thrusters and nozzle throats with minimal erosion for such demanding applications as THAAD. At the completion of the Phase II program, prototype HfCf/HfCm and Cf/HfCm ceramic matrix composite (CMC) thrusters will have been fabricated and tested at operational temperatures of 4000oF (~2200oC) and above.

This determination is performed with adaptive feature selection using Data Modeling (a method for extracting [O(3n)] multi-variable polynomial solutions to the Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomials describing the relationships between data sets). Data Modeling also provides a method for enabling physics based target discrimination algorithms to be embedded into existing system firmware for real-time in-theater use. To date, these algorithms cannot be embedded into the limited computational resources of the currently fielded and proposed systems because they use features that are signal and data processing intensive. Data Modeling extracts an equivalent transfer function that captures the functionality within the discrimination algorithm that can be embedded in firmware using resources available in current fielded systems and future proposed systems.

        "abstract": "Soldier performance in a modern battlefield environment is becoming increasingly demanding on the human sensory facilities and more lethal due to threat of biological, chemical, and other agents.  The logical defense mechanism is to encapsulate and try to isolate the soldier from the hostile environment.  However, when the human head is enveloped in a protective sealed helmet or the soldier is confined to a sealed vehicle; he becomes disoriented because of the denial or mismatch of ordinary sensor cues.  The resultant effect of this disorientation causes the soldier to lose the vital situational awareness and the feeling of well-being needed to react to changing threats and to carryout his mission.  The Point and Click/Speech (PAC/S) research opportunity is a solution to this and other human computer interface problems while maintaining local surrounding audio cue orientation and situational awareness.  Unique TERI Natural Language Speech, integrated with enhanced speech recognition and language understanding, is to be seamlessly incorporated with tactical operation aids, 3-D audio cueing and eye-tracking, providing a cooperative modality that is user friendly and intuitive.  Universal interface standards will be integrated among the PAC/S components, with application to Objective Force Warrior, Homeland Security Architecture, and Combat Decision Aid System, to offer an Army Technical Architecture and commercial compliant solution.  The integrated PAC/S performance will be demonstrated using a \"plug-in\" architecture by a soldier to test OFW portable Multi-Modal Interface (MMI) suitability and to quantify benefits.  Incremental deliveries of the enhanced MMI components are scheduled for delivery every six months.  Tactical speech recognition research at TERI has made great strides in the past few years in terms of noise robustness and language processing, and is gaining acceptance as a keyboard replacement.  A hands-free mouse (trackball) replacement that can be operated accurately in a moving vehicle or by a soldier in the field, will enable the warrior to navigate through menus, select items, and control C3 information technology components.  A MMI low power lightweight PAC/S device will be delivered, providing unique tactical operation aids for an intuitive and natural feel.

        "abstract": "Active Signal Technologies and Alfred University have brought together a broad-based industrial consortium to rapidly advance the development and commercialization of bismuth sodium titanate (BNT), a novel high performance capacitor material for use in both high-temperature and high-field applications.  While the dielectric properties of our Phase I BNT show great promise, this is a new-comer to the capacitor field and will have to prove itself on more than just superior electrical performance.  Reliability and uniformity are particularly critical -- specifically, ceramic capacitors exhibit adverse failure modes (notably cracking) in demanding applications, and wider variation in electrical properties than desired when operated at high field.  Accordingly, the principal driving force behind the materials development is a reliability effort incorporating both model-based fundamental understanding of the failure mechanisms and experimental quantification and characterization of the failures.  All of the compositional and processing optimization is guided by the results from this reliability study.  Optimized materials from the lab development are scaled-up on actual production equipment using industrially accepted powder manufacturing techniques and then supplied to Lockheed Martin to make the large tube shaped blocking capacitor needed for the high-temperature commercial process, and to Novacap to produce high-field multilayer capacitors.",

Different realizations of this all-optical modular technology to be delivered in the Phase 2 will include: surveillance and security camera systems with sensor protection and laser mitigation capability; planar micro-optical systems allowing dynamically controlled interfacing between waveguides or fibers; all-optical spatial light modulator assemblies; and test and development systems for sensing, visualizing and the control of evanescent light propagation in complex micro-optical structures.  Such a large family of devices and technologies originates from the novel light modulating capabilities of an extended class of photosensitive LC, which were synthesized in the Phase 1 work. Photoinduced transformations between phases of these materials and the impact of such transformations on their optical properties will be characterized. Material properties (temperature range, birefringence, photosensitivity, response times) will be optimized and subsequently tailored to specific applications.",

The simulation-based program, demonstrated during Phase I with full development proposed herein, will integrate multiple sources of legacy flight mission and usage data with various air vehicle support cost models to evaluate aircraft maintenance, operations and support costs in terms of leading cost drivers and component failure modes. A unique aspect of this proposed Phase II program is related to the capability of performing simulation-based usage analysis for a fleet of aircraft and correlating it with critical aircraft component failures, resulting maintenance required and the associated life cycle costs. An open systems software architecture using a CORBA-based (common object request broker architecture) infrastructure, XML data formats and web-enabled, agent-based database management is proposed for most effectively integrating the various sources of air vehicle data and models.  At the completion of Phase II, the web-enabled software application program with easy-to-navigate graphical user interface (GUI) will be demonstrated and delivered to the USAF with complete mission-based simulation analysis capability and support cost models/databases.

        "abstract": "Existing techniques for overland height finding against slow, low-flying air targets may not be compatible with the antenna configurations of emerging and future airborne surveillance radar systems.  For example, both monopulse and space-time adaptive processing (STAP) have traditionally been based on monolithic, planar arrays, rather than on the conformal arrays of Sensor Craft or the sparse, volume arrays formed by a cluster of microsatellites or small UAVs.  Additionally, existing techniques have failed to exploit the interaction of the target with its electromagnetic environment by incorporating auxiliary sources of knowledge such as DTED and LU/LC.  Terrain exploitation, Prony's method of array processing, and stereoscopic radar processing are three new and innovative concepts that overcome many of the limitations of more traditional overland height-finding methods.  These techniques were shown to be feasible during the Phase I effort.  To facilitate the transition of these techniques into operational and future air surveillance systems, the Phase II effort will demonstrate and minimize the sensitivity of the three height-finding techniques to real-world effects, including errors in the environmental knowledge that is being exploited.  The final sensitivities will be used to prepare hardware and software specifications for the algorithms.  Specific air surveillance systems with which the techniques are compatible will be identified.  The techniques will be optimized for these systems and performance will be validated by processing sets of high fidelity synthetic data, which will be used in lieu of recorded radar data.",

The CADLS system architecture, adapts the next generation commercial wireless technology, streamlines it, and integrates it with a space-based satellite radio access network to provide a seamless economic solution for meeting the range telemetry and flight safety requirements over broad coverage area . The CADLS system will support the test and evaluation needs of MDA guided ballistic missiles and DoD advanced air platforms including unmanned vehicles.

        "abstract": "We propose a new active broadband electromagnetic (EM) sensor to detect and classify naval mines buried in the littoral. The sensor will work like an underwater metal detector, but it will operate at multiple programmable frequencies suitable to a given littoral environment. Once it detects a potential target, the sensor will interrogate the target and measure its spectral responses (inphase and quadrature) over the entire operating bandwidth. The sensor will then compare the measured spectrum with a library of spectra stored for mines that are known or presumed to occur in the survey area. The process will generate a rank-ordered list of spectral matches. As the sensor finds new mines at a site, it can expand its spectral library - a \"learn as you go\" approach. The proposed active EM sensor can be used as a \"confirmation sensor\" when it is integrated with other sensors such as passive magnetometers and sonars.  A mathematical framework will be developed to interface this data with fusion algorithms being pursued for buried minehunting.  In addition, the sensor will serve in a dual role to simultaneously measure the conductivities of the seawater and bottom sediment, which can be used to derive sediment density and porosity, providing important environmental data for mine warfare.    Target classification based on the spectral fingerprints is called Electromagnetic Induction Spectroscopy or EMIS. It is known that an EMIS spectrum depends on the object's shape and metal compositions in terms of electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability. Apart from a possibility of direct detection of explosives, EMIS is the only rigorous, physics-based phenomenology for identifying buried mines. The EMIS algorithms, validated for land mines, will be modified for the classification of buried sea mines to provide computer-automated target recognition.  This proposal addresses developments of both sensor hardware and EMIS-based software to solve the buried naval mine detection and classification problem.",

The proposal will attempt to bring together two exciting approaches aimed at producing compact, highly functional optical amplifiers with the potential for rapid reduction in the cost per amplifier port. First, we will investigate a novel side-pumping geometry using inexpensive, high power multimode pump laser sources to simultaneously energize an array of erbium-doped active cores. The pumping geometry allows for massive sharing of the pump power over several amplifier ports. It also eliminates the need for the complicated and costly pump-signal wavelength-division multiplexers used in conventional erbium-doped amplifiers. Second, we will explore low cost fiber drawing methods to produce compact, monolithic amplifier array structures. In contrast to other fabrication approaches, fiber drawing technologies support the formation of active core elements with very high erbium and ytterbium doping concentrations, circular cross sections, and dramatically lower per unit cost. The demonstration of side-pumped monolithic amplifier arrays will pave the way for widespread deployment of low-cost, compact amplification throughout a variety of optical communication networks.",

        "abstract": "Space-based radar (SBR) requires multiple RF power amplifiers (PAs) to drive phased-arrays antennas.  Control of the beam direction requires an amplitude range of 22 dB, and coupling between elements results in load impedances with significant mismatch.  Both factors make conventional linear RF PAs very inefficient.    The proposed approach employs a high-efficiency RF PA, class-S modulator, and electronically tuned matching network.  The class-EF RF PA provides the best combination of efficiency and power output.  Wide-bandgap transistors (e.g., SiC or GaN) provide significant output power with reasonable load impedances. The class-S modulator controls signal amplitude, allowing the RF PA to remain saturated for maximum efficiency.  A digital signal processor removes amplitude variations due to heating of the transistors.  The electronically tuned matching network adapts to impedance changes associated with changes in beam direction.  The average efficiency is nearly triple that of a conventional PA.  The corresponding reduction in dc-input power in turn produces significant savings in the cost of the satellite power system.  The proposed Phase-II program is an experimental evaluation of technologies, culminating in a prototype system.",

The code incorporates a physics-driven architecture with custom modular components to optimize time/fidelity performance and trades in signature computation.  The proposed project combines legacy information with new advanced technologies to create a fast accurate comprehensive unified signature simulation tool.",

        "abstract": "Active imaging in the short- and mid-wave infrared has well-known benefits versus shorter wavelengths: eye safety, better visibility through battlefield obscurants, high atmospheric transmission, and reduced background emission. However, there are no suitable imaging detectors at eye-safe wavelengths. In Phase I, CTI proposed a nonlinear sum-frequency generator (SFG) to convert an image at 1.55 mm to a shorter wavelength where better detectors exist.  The SFG will provide spectral filtering and optical range-gating capability. In Phase I, CTI successfully performed risk reduction experiments that up-converted a multi-pixel image form the 1.5 mm region to 0.63 mm.  This experiment provided proof of principle evidence for the multipixel imager that will be built in Phase II.  In addition, detailed ladar and transceiver models were produced to ensure the feasibility of the NLO converter.  In Phase II, CTI will expand on Phase I success to build a NLO imaging transceiver capable of range resolution that will convert eye-safe 1.5 mm returns to 0.63 mm where intensified cameras are available.  CTI will leverage its extensive repertoire of nonlinear optics, remote sensing experience, and expertise in flight hardware to reduce risk and increase the probability of success.",

Solid-State lasers have been a canidate technology from the earliest time, but for various reasons, this technology has not been developed to a point where they are scalable to high average power lasers. The development of diode laser pump arrays has improved efficiency, but at a considerable increase in systems cost. The diode pumped solid state lasers developed to date have several deficiencies in meeting the needs of the DOD. The efficiency of neodymium lasers is too low, 10% to, arguably 15%, to allow a weapons-level device to be proberly packaged on a single platform. The cost is also high, and is primarily driven by the cost of the diode arrays and diode array coolers. If one adds additional requirements for wavelength considerations, these issues become even more debilitating by factors of two or more. In order for this technology to find acceptance, a dramatic improvement in efficiency needs to be found. This Project is exploring the potential of cryogenically cooled solid state lasers to favorably resolve these problems and result in efficieny, effective lasers that can function within existing logistic capabilities in the field.",

The key innovations to obtain a low noise, high efficiency cooling system include: 1) a localized EHD micropump integrated into the sensor substrate, chip, or detector to be cooled reduces the pressure gradients and flow fluctuations in the system and 2) high heat transfer coefficients are achieved through combined thin film evaporation and EHD-enhanced pumping without transmission of any hydrodynamic or structural noise.

The approach will use both three-dimensional, prestack shot-profile wave-equation migration and a novel three-dimensional migration velocity analysis to enable better imaging of geologic structure as well as improved reservoir characterization in structurally complex land areas.  Phase I developed prototype software that increases imaging resolution in complex geologic areas and deep (over 15,000 feet) land basins and Gulf of Mexico shelf basins.  The primary goal of generating angle gathers using shot-profile wave-equation migration, and using them for migration velocity analysis update, was accomplished.

In parallel work, a method for performing automatic velocity analysis, via a high-resolution parametrization of the residual moveout in angle gathers followed by tomographic update, will be developed.  This research will determine the ability of the new generalized-wave-equation imaging software to process large three-dimensional seismic surveys.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The technology should allow three-dimensional seismic data to be used much more effectively to characterize and delineate oil reservoirs and to monitor enhanced oil recovery processes in extremely complicated geological areas, such as the deep Rocky Mountain basins.

To deploy these devices on ground, air, and space platforms, the new laser sources are required to increase the range and improve image resolution.  This project will develop a short pulse, high power, high-repetition-rate laser source based on innovative fiber amplifier technology to meet these requirements.  The approach uses recently developed components from the telecommunications industry to realize an all-fiber-based laser source that is efficient, compact, and very reliable.  In Phase I, a very compact, robust, and small-size fiber laser system was built and delivered to the DOE.  The feasibility of the concept was demonstrated by generating pulses with a peak power of 100 kW and a pulse duration of 700 ps.

        "abstract": "NIST is using a sensitive optical technique called cavity ring-down detection to permit detection of impurities in semiconductor process gases, which cause substantial losses in manufacturing yield. In order to increase the sensitivity and range of application of this technique, improved single frequency laser sources are required. In particular, lasers providing more power, narrower line-width, better beam quality and access to a wider range of wavelengths would allow detection of a wider range of species with greater sensitivity. Aculight has developed a novel laser technology which meets all of these requirements. As a final result of this program, we will deliver a packaged, fiber-based laser system which provides 1 Watt of tunable, single frequency output between 1.6 and 1.8 um. This is two orders of magnitude more power than diode lasers currently used for the application. In order to verify the utility of the laser for the application we will show that greatly increased efficiency of coupling into a ring-down cavity can be demonstrated when compared with that observed with diode laser.\n\nCOMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Single frequency sources in the near to mid-infrared have a wide range of applications in trace gas detection for environmental and industrial process monitoring, gas leak detection, combustion diagnostics, telecom test and measurement, and laboratory spectroscopy. We propose to initially develop these sources as laboratory scientific lasers comparable to tunable diode lasers, but with much greater power and wavelength access. Further development of such sources for low cost and compact packaging will allow their use in sensor applications.",

Current methods for removing these radiological contaminants are expensive, use hazardous chemicals or dangerous rotating machinery, release removed materials into the airspace surrounding the jobsite, and generate considerable secondary waste.  This project will develop an electrodecontamination  process that overcomes these deficiencies with the removal of radioactive contamination.  The process combines the best attributes of electropolishing and strippable coatings into a safe, cost-effective technology that can rapidly remove both fixed and smearable radioactive contaminants from stainless steel and other conductive substrates.  The system maintains full control of materials as they are stripped, can be deployed within minutes, and results in a waste form already familiar to DOE\u00bfs existing infrastructure \u00bf radioactive \u00bfhot\u00bf plastic.  Phase I developed a safe and cost effective system that uses proprietary gel chemistry and a special power waveform to remove radioactive contamination from stainless steel through surface stripping electrochemical reactions.  Independent laboratory tests demonstrated the system\u00bfs ability to remove up to 96% of fixed and 99% of smearable radioactive contaminates from stainless steel without generating airborne hazard.  In Phase II, independent certifications of electrical safety, nuclear safeguards compliance, and non-combustability of the cured gel will be obtained.  Extensive field validations will be carried out at three or more nuclear facilities within the DOE and the power industry.  A configuration-controlled engineering package will be created in anticipation of manufacturing a commercial product in Phase III.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The electro-decontamination technology should have application in the steel fabrication and construction sectors, as well as the autobody repair industry.  In addition, the gel has anti-microbial properties, suggesting possible medical applications, such as the control of tuberculosis or other highly infectious diseases within surgical suites and medical facilities, or spray-on surgical masking and wound dressings for burn treatment.",

In particular, major urban centers are potential targets of nuclear attacks, \u00bfdirty bomb\u00bf attacks, and chemical/biological agent attacks.  This project will develop, demonstrate and make commercially available a cost-effective, easy-to-use Situational Awareness Monitoring System (SAMS) comprised of a series of individually configurable Micro-environmental Sensor Pods (MSP) containing both meteorological sensors and radiation detectors with good spectral resolution.  These units would be permanently deployed to establish baseline conditions and monitor for pre-event warning signs.  Additional units could be quickly deployed after an event to augment the network for the emergency response and clean-up teams.  The network feeds data to a central station where advanced computer models of plume dispersion could predict the spread of material from a radiological terrorist incident.  In Phase I, a high resolution gamma ray spectrometer was incorporated into a plug-and-play sensor module for use with an MSP and was shown to detect and identify radioactive material in a passing vehicle.  The data was relayed from the MSP to a personal computer via a radio link, demonstrating the feasibility this system for detecting unauthorized nuclear material.  In Phase II, the advanced gamma ray spectrum analyzer will be incorporated into a sensor module for use with the open architecture plug-and-play port on an existing Situational Awareness Monitor (SAM). Additional wireless dosimeter sensors will be included to further enhance the capability of the SAM system, and to provide information to characterize suspicious sources.  By incorporating baseline data from the sensor network in atmospheric/plume models, the spread of toxic material through an urban center could be projected, allowing policy makers to create emergency response plans.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  This system should see immediate market demand from agencies responsible for homeland security in metropolitan areas and military bases.  Since the sensor interface is generic, detectors for chemical agents, pollutants, or other contaminants can also be incorporated into the Situational Awareness Monitor for data collection and transmission.",

Rigidization of inflatable wings provides several potential advantages, including reducing the vulnerability to punctures, increasing stiffness and load-carrying capability, allowing a higher aspect ratio for high altitude efficiency and longer missions, and reducing weight by eliminating the make up pressurization supply. In the Phase I program, rapid cure resin systems (10 sec at 0?aC) with long shelf lives (>10 yrs) were formulated and used to fabricate, deploy, and rigidize a half span wing. Mechanical tests of the rigidized wing showed that it had attained the desired stiffness. The Phase II program will demonstrate internal cure, tailoring the resin formulation and lighting system for more efficient rapid cure at low temperatures, determine a more optimized design for a selected application, and demonstrate improved manufacturing techniques with skinning for better aerodynamic performance.

This project will develop a strain of Clostridium thermocellum, a rapid cellulose-fermenting microorganism that produces ethanol as well as organic acids, for producing industrial ethanol from pretreated biomass in a consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) configuration.  Phase I established the technical capability to metabolically engineer C. thermocellum.  A high efficiency gene transfer system for this organism, using custom apparatus and an optimized protocol, was developed.  Site-specific gene integration into genes associated with acetic acid formation was demonstrated.  Fermentation studies showed a dramatic decrease in acetic acid production compared to the wild-type C thermocellum.

The critical commercialization research and development issues in this project are:  (1) mode-equalization image processing and pre-conditioning of the P-wave and S-wave data sets to make them suitable for simultaneous quantitative inversion and analysis; ( 2) computation of optimal seismic attributes and robust pressure-saturation inversion of these attributes; (3) testing and bulletproofing these techniques on a real field data set to overcome the inevitable practical data issues; and (4) developing the tools in an interactive GUI-based software package to provide a workflow that facilitates integrated numerical computation and human interpretation.\n\nCommercial applications of proposed research will include accurate mapping of bypassed oil, monitoring of costly injected fluids in hydrocarbon reservoirs and global-warming CO2 sequestration projects. It will have applications in the monitoring of ground water reserves, contaminant plumes and environmental clean-up activities. Medical imaging is another potential market target use of elastic waves as they could yield superior results over acoustic waves alone. Commercial and societal benefits include extending the life of existing oil and gas fields, thus reducing the need for exploration in environmentally sensitive areas and improving the nation's energy security.",

General-purpose processors do not provide enough performance density to effectively address these applications.  The introduction of super-computing boards based on (multi-purpose, reconfigurable) Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) could provide these extremely high performance densities.  However, the effective implementation of applications in FPGA hardware is difficult.  In addition to the core computational processing, interface and support cores will be required for effective data movement to memories, busses, and networks, as well as to the system monitoring/management agent.  This project will manufacture an advanced Reconfigurable Computing board, the Configurable Software Radio Board (CSRB), based on state-of-the-art Xilinx Virtex II Pro FPGA technology.  Phase I developed the architecture and design for the CSRB.  The CSRB is capable of 1.5 - 2.5 TeraOps of computing power, 100 Gbps front panel I/O, 4 Gbps backplane I/O, and hosts more than 4 GBytes of on-board memory.  System issues such as signal integrity, thermal management, high-current power supplies, current in-rush control, testability, and maintainability were addressed.  In Phase II, four copies of the CSRB will be manufactured, tested, and delivered.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  Sensor signal processing applications, such as found in security surveillance, medical, and target recognition systems, should greatly benefit from the proposed high-density compute board.

Available data acquisition systems use currently available analog-to-digital converter (ADC) technologies, which cannot be packed densely enough to extract all of the available information from these experiments.  Current ADC data transfer speeds, power consumption, pin count, and mutual electromagnetic interference levels have compromised the ability to measure and understand many small-scale phenomena.  This project will develop a new architecture that combines a proprietary high-speed (500 Ms/s), high-resolution, flash/folding ADC core with a proprietary high speed (up to 30 GB/s), multi-level (ternary) serializer/deserializer (SERDES) interface.  Phase I developed the ADC architecture, performed computer simulations of the basic ADC blocks, and proved the feasibility of the proposed concept. The computer simulation indicated a maximum data rate of 30 Gb/s at the high-speed digital ADC output.  A bench prototype of the ternary interconnect, based on off-the-shelf components and operating at 12 Gb/s, was demonstrated.  In Phase II, the ADC and SERDES will be integrated into a set of mixed-signal ICs, which will be manufactured using an advanced commercial high density SiGe fabrication process.  Phase II, will design and fabricate ADC and SERDES Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and integrate the developed product into a functional data acquisition system.

The fabrication process, established during the Phase I effort, utilizes low-voltage pulses combined with a novel electrode configuration to periodically pole channel waveguides embedded in a KTP chip. The use of standard off-the-shelf KTP channel waveguides will significantly increase yields, allow greater design flexibility, and decrease manufacturing expenses while providing a large QPM conversion efficiency that will enable a range of commercially significant applications.

However, the measurement of the composition of these compounds suffers from the lack of real-time, size-resolved, quantitative instruments.  An innovative aerosol mass spectrometer has been recently developed for size-resolved, quantitative chemical composition data on aerosol particles.  This project will improve the instrument by interfacing it with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer that will allow chemical analysis of individual aerosol particles.  Phase I developed the detection electronics and software for the time-of-flight mass spectrometer, designed the physical interface between the time-of-flight mass spectrometer and the aerosol mass spectrometer system, and conducted preliminary tests of a prototype system in the laboratory and in the field.  In Phase II, a complete aerosol mass spectrometer with an integrated time-of-flight mass spectrometer will be built.

The prevalent means of detection, a chemiluminescence-based monitor (the so-called NOx box), often provides inaccurate readings for nitrogen dioxide in the presence of other nitrogen-containing trace atmospheric species.  This project will build an uncomplicated, inexpensive, and accurate spectroscopic sensor for the detection of nitrogen dioxide at the sub-part-per-billion level using Cavity Attenuation Phase Shift spectroscopy (CAPS), a technique related to cavity ringdown laser absorption spectroscopy.  It relies on the measurement of small shifts in the phase of modulated light that is transmitted through a resonant optical cavity induced by the absorption of the target species.  In Phase I, a proof-of-principle demonstration of a CAPS-based nitrogen dioxide sensor was performed.  Results indicated that the CAPS-based sensor had sensitivity less than 1 part per billion of nitrogen dioxide.  A calibrated CAPS sensor accurately monitored ambient NO2 concentrations at the 0-40 ppb level over the course of a two day observation period, without the need for human intervention.

        "abstract": "Agriculture is in need of safer products to replace methyl bromide and other synthetic pesticides. Soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium, Rhizoctonia, Verticillium and Phytophthora are a major problem in horticulture, field crop production and greenhouses causing root rots, wilts and loss of vigor and yield. Methyl bromide, a potent ozone-depleting agent being phased out by 2005, is frequently used as a soil fumigant before planting strawberries, tomatoes, peppers and other crops to control soil-borne diseases and pests. Harvested fresh fruit commodities are highly susceptible to fungal decay and often require pre- or postharvest fungicide treatment to reduce losses. Many fungicides for postharvest use are being phased out due to toxicological concerns, and fungicide resistance has become widespread. The purpose of this project is to develop a naturally occurring fungus into a non-toxic, effective alternative to synthetic pesticides for outdoor soil, greenhouse soil and postharvest treatments. The fungus Muscodor albus produces a mixture of low molecular weight volatile compounds that are specifically toxic to other microorganisms. This research will demonstrate the commercial potential of the biofumigant in greenhouse soil, pre-plant soil applications and postharvest disease control in citrus, pome fruit, berries and grapes. Commercial development of this biofumigant will provide an effective new tool compatible with sustainable integrated pest management and organic food production.",

        "abstract": "Fish ecology and environmental research scientists have an urgent need for an automated fish identification system for biological research. Many fish species travel great distances during their life cycle. As they travel past a narrow passage on the rivers or dams that are equipped with a fish ladder, their species, size, total number, and the time can be recorded for migration pattern and population studies. These are very important data for biologists, especially for the research of endangered species and effects of environmental change. Manual monitoring and recognition of fish 24 hours a day or reviewing hours of video tapes recorded at fish passageways during the entire migration season is a very tedious task and, frequently results in unreliable data. At places where monitoring facilities are not available, fish must be captured, measured, and counted manually. This invasive method, although not preferable, may be the only option available. Tests conducted in Phase I show very promising results and prove that such an automated system is feasible. This Phase II project proposes to improve the fish tracking and recognition algorithms, conduct extensive field testing in varying conditions, construct an underwater camera system, and develop and prepare to market a commercial product.",

        "abstract": "The Energetic X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST) is a proposed mission that aims to detect faint high energy X-ray sources in the energy range 10 - 600 keV. The concept for EXIST relies on an X-ray telescope imaging the entire sky each 95 min orbit. The core of the X-ray imaging telescope comprises approximately 8 square meters of pixilated Cd-Zn-Te (CZT) detectors, a technical feat never before attempted. This enormous array requires development of a new packaging technology for CZT detector arrays, one that allows detectors to be abutted together into large arrays of CZT tiles, with minimal dead space in between detectors. Also required is a technology that can produce these detectors with a high interconnection yield, not currently achieved with indium bump technologies. We propose an innovative technique to assemble CZT X-ray sensors avoiding conventional direct indium bump hybridization used today. The novel scheme incorporates commercial off-the-shelf flip-chip and multichip module technologies, combined with new flip-chip bonding materials and proprietary processes developed at Aguila under previous NASA sponsorship. This will result in novel detector modules containing fully-integrated readout electronics that can be implemented into a large-array motherboard.",

In some buildings, high indoor humidity creates health problems and leads to the growth of mold and mildew; in other buildings, energy is wasted as the building owner overcools the indoor space to try to create comfortable conditions.  A high efficiency air conditioner that also provided superior dehumidification would restore healthy indoor conditions while significantly reducing energy use.  This project will incorporate advanced liquid-desiccant technology into an electric vapor-compression air conditioner that:  (1) provides more than twice the dehumidification of a conventional system, (2) reduces compressor power by 24% or more, and (3) is easy to install on a residence.  A 6,000 Btu/h breadboard model of the liquid-desiccant vapor-compression air conditioner was built and tested in Phase I.  It was shown that this air conditioner could deliver about two-thirds of its cooling as dehumidification.  The test results also validated a computer model, which was used to design an advanced air conditioner for a home that had an SEER of 14.9 and a Sensible Heat Ratio of 0.34.  In Phase II, an early-entry market for the liquid-desiccant vapor-compression air conditioner will be identified, in conjunction with a manufacturer of HVAC equipment.  A prototype of this air conditioner will be built and tested in a home to: (1) quantify annual energy savings, (2) demonstrate independent control of temperature and humidity, and (3) identify possible control, operating, and maintenance issues that would be addressed in a second prototype.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  A highly efficient electric air conditioner that provides independent control of temperature and humidity within homes, even under the most humid summer conditions, would address problems of poor indoor air quality, mold and mildew growth, and the waste of energy from over-cooling.

On the other hand, todays power electronics technologies lend themselves well to modularity, which will result in systems with decreased production costs and greater reliability.  This project will develop standardized 100kW and 1MW power electronic modules for converter/inverter applications.  Modular converters/inverters will be demonstrated in various configurations to prove the viability of standarized power converter components for multiple and diverse applications.  Phase I developed scaling rules for the implementation of power conversion technologies over 50 kW.  Partitioning rules concerning device technology, optical technologies, and scaleabiliy techniques with respect to power level and reliability were considered.  A plan for cost-effectively developing reliable, modular 100 kW/phase and 1MW/phase power converters was produced.  In Phase II, power converter/inverter building blocks will be produced.  Six 100 kW/phase modules and six 1 MW/phase modules will be manafactured, configured, and tested to prove the standardization approach.  System costs will be detailed and compared to known pricing structures.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  A modular three-phase voltage source inverter should offer significant benefits over current application-specific designs,  including flexibility for different power levels, high reliability of optimized individual modules, and cost reduction through high volume manufacturing.

        "abstract": "72984-Currently available methods impose limits on the processing of multi-filamentary, superconducting wires used in high energy physics experiments.  These limits can be severe when one of the wire components has a mechanical strength substantially smaller than the other component(s), and can eliminate many desirable wire designs from consideration.   Niobium-Tin and Niobium-Aluminum are examples of systems that exhibit this problem.  Recent experimental work has shown that hydrostatic reduction, using low-angle dies and relatively large-area reductions (greater than 4:1), can produce good results with a much wider range of material mechanical strengths; in particular, jelly roll structures including niobium, copper, and tin have been processed successfully.  Yet, when these same systems were processed using cold drawing, the results were unacceptable.  This project will develop a hydrostatic processing facility that uses only high area reductions and could have an important impact on superconducting wire production, along with additional improvements in performance.  Phase I demonstrated that it is possible to build a relatively large diameter (D = 6\u00bf) pressure vessel that can withstand 150,000 psi.  The design uses proven elements taken from the design of conventional extrusion presses.  The pressure vessel will enable the production of wire samples in the 300' to 2,000' range, depending on wire diameter, which can be cabled and tested for magnet performance.  In Phase II, the high pressure vessel will be built and joined with two other existing vessels to form a Hydrostatic Wire Processing Facility (HWPF).  The HWPF will be able to process billets from up to 3\" in diameter and 5' long to down to wire size, with all processing done hydrostatically with high area reductions and low angle dies.  Several wire geometries will be tested in the HWPF.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The Hydrostatic Wire Processing Facility (HWPF) should extend the \u00bfparameter space\u00bf for the production of superconducting wire, allowing wire architectures that cannot be processed with cold-drawing.  In addition, larger numbers of elements can be succesfully process in order to reduce effective filament diameter.  If the overall program is successful, the HWPF will define the \u00bfnext generation\u00bf Niobium Tin superconducting wire material.",

        "abstract": "72486-With the ever increasing number of smaller animals, such as mice and rats, being used as human disease models, the demand for small animal imaging also has increased.  In particular, the pharmaceutical industry requires the in vivo quantification of biological processes, to measure the mechanism of action of a pharmacological agent and its concentration at the site of action.  High-resolution nuclear imaging technologies such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has the potential to contribute unique information at these finely-graded levels.  However, the main barriers to using SPECT in studies of laboratory animals have traditionally been poor spatial resolution, low sensitivity, and high cost.  To address these deficiencies, this project will develop a novel detector based on a new, position-sensitive readout coupled to a microcolumnar scintillator, leading to a SPECT detector that can achieve extremely fine spatial resolution and high sensitivity in a cost-effective manner.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of developing a high resolution, high efficiency SPECT detector module based on a new charge coupled device (CCD).  Accomplishments included the development of a 3 mm thick microcolumnar scintillator film, construction of a digital imaging detector based on a special CCD, and radionuclide imaging using this detector/scintillator in a realistic SPECT environment.  Phase II will develop a prototype digital detector based on the aforementioned technologies for SPECT imaging.  The detector will consist of a thick microcolumnar scintillator optically coupled to the novel CCD via a fiberoptic taper, and a specially designed tungsten collimator.  When completed, the detector will provide a 5 cm x 5 cm imaging area, an intrinsic spatial resolution of 100 microns or lower, and a high detection efficiency for gamma ray energies typically used in SPECT at a relatively low cost.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The new detector design should have widespread use in new small animal/human SPECT systems in particular and nuclear medicine systems in general.

        "abstract": "CCDs (Charge-Coupled Devices), and more recently, CMOS (complementary-symmetry metal-oxide-semiconductor) APS (Active Pixel Sensor) cameras have revolutionized imaging instrumentation and the many fields that utilize these instruments. Both these technologies rely on integrating, the analog photo-current generated in each pixel, which limits their sensitivity and bandwidth. Counting individual optical photons with an avalanche photodiode operated above its breakdown voltage provides the greatest sensitivity, and represents true digital imaging that facilitates pixel-level signal processing. In essence, the Geiger APD pixel directly converts an incident photon flux into a digital count rate, which eliminates the readout noise associated with analog detection, providing a unique CMOS architecture for analog-to-digital conversion. This program develops a fully integrated, digital camera chip, which is an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that counts individual optical photons using avalanche photodiodes operated above breakdown, in Geiger mode. This all-digital, CMOS imaging technology fulfills the demanding requirements for providing high-resolution images at GHz speeds characteristic of CMOS devices. In Phase I, we successfully completed all the Phase I goals by designing, fabricating, and characterizing the Geiger APD pixel elements of the APS camera ASIC. In Phase II, we will design, fabricate and characterize prototypes of the complete APS camera ASIC.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Program Phase II project will develop advanced forms of transparent network proxies for both satellite and terrestrial broadband wireless communications to the Internet. Shared wireless access links to the Internet often exhibit what has been called a traffic / cost anomaly. While almost 90% of the traffic in the network can flow from the Internet to the user, almost 90% of the cost of the access links can be attributed to the channel transmitting packets from the user to the Internet. Wireless Internet access from the user to the Internet is often implemented by means of some variation of a random access ALOHA channel. The interaction of ALOHA channels with TCP and other high level protocols used in the Internet can limit the effectiveness of both TCP and ALOHA for such access. The goal of this NSF SBIR research program is to understand this awkward interaction of standards in the high cost random access channel and to develop a strategy of migration to a more sensible access architecture based upon transparent proxies.\n\nThe societal and commercial impact of this project will be to increase the capacity of broadband wireless Internet multiple access channels thereby decreasing the cost per user of the channel. This decrease in the cost per user when shared with customers can increase the market for broadband wireless access to the Internet while increasing the profitability for wireless Internet Service Providers. These fast proxies will make wireless Internet access affordable for under-served and un-served end users in rural areas in the United States and in much of the rest of the world. Additionally the technical innovations of this research will serve to advance the current level of understanding of how TCP/IP protocols interact with other protocols in wireless data networks.",

In Phase I, a large number of coal samples were collected from coalbed methane wells for microbial evaluation.  The feasibility of using microorganisms to convert coal into methane was demonstrated.  Specific areas for coal and microorganism collection during Phase II were identified.  In Phase II, microbial enrichments will be prepared from coal (both whole core and cutting samples) and evaluated for methane formation.  The microbes will be isolated and characterized, and an optimum culture mix will be developed.  Factors affecting bioconversion economics will be evaluated, and industry stakeholders will be identified and contacted for Phase III Field Tests.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The in situ bioconversion of sequestered greenhouse gases, along with part of the coal, into methane would provide clean, environmentally friendly energy and significantly increase U.S. natural gas supplies, thereby reducing foreign energy dependency.

Therefore, on a ton-by-ton basis, technology that targets methane emissions would mitigate global warming at a faster rate than the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions.  Because methane recovery from coal mines and landfills is economically driven, and recovery projects are either ceased or not initiated if natural gas prices are low, this greenhouse gas is commonly released to the atmosphere even when it is not present in commercial quantities.  This project will identify and cultivate unique microbes that will be used to reduce methane emissions in coal mines, in gob gas systems in front of mining operations, and in biofilters located in mine ventilation systems.  Phase I identified methane seep locations that may have persisted for many decades or more, and a unique anaerobic sampling technique was developed that maximized the probability of collecting anaerobic microbes.  The microbial research clearly demonstrated that microbes collected at the methane seep locations consumed methane under anaerobic conditions in the presence of sulfate.  As a consequence, the feasibility of isolating anaerobic methane oxidizers, so that they can be applied to reducing non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions in coal mines and coal outcrops, has been demonstrated.  Phase II research will lead to the isolation of anaerobic methane oxidizers. Also, multiple samples will be obtained from a few selected sites throughout the year to evaluate the seasonal fluctuations in microbial activity.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  These unique microorganisms, methanotrophs, would be applied directly to coal in the mine, injected into coal seams in front of mining operations, and utilized in biofilters for mine ventilation systems to reduce methane emissions and prevent explosions.

Discharges into streams are essentially forbidden, while indiscriminant surface discharge causes soil salination.  Prior Phase I work has shown that halophytic plants may be successful in sequestering significant amounts of sodium when irrigated with CBM discharge waters.  This Phase II project will confirm Phase I greenhouse data with field trials of plants irrigated with CBM water and fish effluent when compared with controls under otherwise normal farming practices.  Soil impacts and tilth will also be examined in great detail. \n\nThe commercial application of this project will be to alleviate the negative impact of CBM discharges on the environment in Wyoming, and to open up huge areas of land for responsible CBM exploration and recovery.",

Proposed Phase II research builds on very promising Phase I laboratory studies showing that beneficial (probiotic) bacteria improved the survival rate of oyster larvae from commercial hatcheries by a highly statistically significant average of 32% and protected oyster larvae and juveniles from challenge by virulent bacterial pathogens. In Phase II, we will test these favorable results in three commercial shellfish hatcheries/nurseries. Probiotics will be tested by adding to (1) brood stock (2) concentrated larval and juvenile shellfish (3) larval and juvenile shellfish tank systems and (4) static and continuous cultures of algal feeds. We will measure comparative survival, growth rate, and time to metamorphosis in treated and untreated groups. Our probiotic species will significantly increase survival and profitability of shellfish hatcheries and nurseries, with similar beneficial application to shrimp and warm water fish hatcheries, operating in the same temperature range. Our probiotics provide a needed method for controlling bacterial colonization of hatcheries. A favorable cost-benefit ratio is anticipated making this a viable product in a largely untapped market. We have systematized a method of probiotic sourcing, characterization and testing that enables us to obtain additional effective probiotic species from any marine environment.",

Opportunities exist for developing improvements in the methods and materials used in the ground-based ignition of prescribed fires. Improved ignition techniques could enable managers to conduct burns at times where weather, fuels and resource limitations would otherwise preclude burn activities, widening the presently limited window of opportunity for burning. It is the intent of the present research proposal to develop a Ground-Based, Line-Source Ignition System that provides an improved method for conducting prescribed burning. In particular, this project involves developing a Linear Incendiary Strand manufactured from pine resin. Use of this novel device will enhance burning opportunities by providing a means to generate high fire intensity through rapid burn strip ignition by ground personnel. The proposed ignition system provides a method for using improved convection engineering techniques to reduce the negative impacts of smoke on the nation's air quality. In addition, the proposed device offers a substitute for presently used petroleum products, and will allow ground crews a higher degree of safety while igniting prescribed fires.",

Further efforts along conventional lines invite problems with higher-order modes, thermal cooling, and thermo-mechanical stresses.  The basic problem with the conventional approach is that the microwave power is forced through a single disk window.  This project will develop a distributed microwave window concept in which the power is transmitted through a series of ceramic-filled apertures.  In Phase I, mode-matching field theory and software were developed for both scattering parameter and trapped-mode characterization in the new window geometry.  Mockup prototype windows were designed, fabricated, and tested at low-power, successfully demonstrating the suitability of the approach to high-power window design.  Measured scattering parameters and mode resonance frequencies correlated well with calculated values, which demonstrated the technical feasibility of this microwave window.  Phase II will develop additional theory and software for advanced compact configurations of the distributed window.  Additional cold-test prototypes (non-brazed) will be designed, built, and tested at low-power.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The high-power microwave windows should find use in radar, fusion, and particle accelerator applications.  Also, the dual injection feature of the distributed window lends would be useful for studying the nonlinear properties of the dielectric material used in the window\u00bfs ceramic-filled coupling apertures.",

Though enabling software can help, captioning has remained a labor\u00adintensive and time-consuming process. Commercial applications of automated speech recognition have typically focused on dictation and speech-interactive services, but little effort has been directed towards applying speech technology to the automation of captioning to address high costs and lengthy turnaround times. Commercial recognition software still requires either a restricted speaker set or a restricted linguistic domain; these represent significant barriers to automated captioning efforts.We propose to apply automatic speech processing techniques to the automation of captioning, thereby significantly lowering costs and turnaround times. Our approach utilizes a known text transcript of the program audio to avoid performing recognition. Instead, we focus on determining the optimal alignment between the transcript and the program audio. This tightly constrains the problem domain, and avoids high error rates.Our Phase I prototype showed the feasibility of automating captioning using this approach.

A rover-mounted, remotely-controlled robot arm with a demolition tool fixtured to its tool plate can free workers from this high risk environment.  Unfortunately, no one demolition tool has the versatility to adapt to the wide range of D&D materials, conditions, and operating tasks.  Under the best circumstances the design, fabrication, integration, and debugging of tool-holding fixtures is a notoriously time-consuming cost driver.

Advanced embedded intelligence will enable the dexterous hand to adapt to the infinite variety of tool geometries, while rugged and fault-tolerant design will allow it to survive harsh conditions such as impacts and radiation.  Phase I developed an initial hand prototype, along with grasping strategies, which proved secure under extreme conditions of vibration and reaction forces.

Phase II will:  (1) implement a passive-active strategy for increased mechanical ruggedness to survive unexpected impacts and chemical exposure; (2) develop fault-tolerant, self-healing firmware/software to overcome the harsh environmental extremes of radiation and electromagnetic interference; (3) expand functionality and operational control through the addition and synthesis of key vision, force, position, aural, and acceleration sensors; and (4) evaluate the robotic hand in realistic tasks.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The automatically reconfigurable fixture should be a key enabler for industrial robotic installations around the globe, sharply reducing fixturing and tooling costs while supporting a new level of robot versatility.  When not securing tools, the hand also would be available for performing a wide variety of other tasks, such as manipulating and clearing debris.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovative Research Phase II project will develop a process that integrates wafer bonding technology with a novel straining process to create a new ultra fast silicon substrate: Strained-Silicon-On-Insulator (SSOI). This substrate can undergo normal IC fabrication and resulting circuits will be 30% faster at half the power required for comparative non-strained- SSOI architectures. The process is a direct approach and entirely surpasses the nearest competition as there is no germanium in any part of the processing. As a result the strained silicon is free from the high concentration of treading dislocations (>105 cm-2) always present when strained-silicon is grown on \"strain-relaxed\" silicon germanium virtual substrates. The silicon strained by the proposed method is maintained within its mechanically elastic region and thus is free from structural imperfections. The proposed method engages wafer bonding procedures already in place within the industry and modifies those processes to give a combined result of wafer bonding and SOI straining within a single step. The direct approach and single process makes the technique very inexpensive. The discipline evoked is fundamental surface science which involves investigation of both physical properties such as surface energies along with chemical aspects such as maintaining surface hydration and active surface species required for wafer bonding.\n\nCommercially, the substrates available via this effort will make possible ultra fast silicon electronics. The proposed process also allows for non-intrusive radiation-hardening, giving initial commercial outlet in the military sector. Further markets include\nmainstream silicon-based electronics; effectively new host materials with speeds more\ncharacteristic of materials such as gallium arsenide and most salient, very low power electronics.",

        "abstract": "Water is the essence of life. Few will disagree that it is a resource that must be protected for the well-being of all: plant and animal. Millions of holes have been and are being drilled in the earth to search for water, uranium, oil and gas, and coal-bed methane. Many thousands of these holes are mid-depth (500-4500 feet) and fill with water if the drills penetrate one or more aquifers. When these water-containing drill holes are abandoned, soil stability and the purity of that exposed groundwater are threatened. A product is needed that is superior to Portland cement, which historically has been the recommended sealing material. But because of cement's heat of hydration and rigidity it can cause stability problems in certain soils, applications and where ground motion is a concern. Additionally, bentonite seals do not alter pH as does cement and can 'heal' if damaged. 'Healing' refers to bentonite's ability to fill in fissures caused by earth or drill casing movement. Currently a technology does not exist to satisfactorily plug mid-depth drill holes without cement. We intend to develop the most ecologically-beneficial, user-friendly, and cost-effective product to seal mid-depth drill holes. The product must be economical to ship and must be easy for a non-technical person to handle at the well site. This product will prevent loss of water (or other natural resources), groundwater contamination from surface chemicals, inter-aquifer mixing, and subsidence which can occur with conventional cement plugging techniques.",

This adaptive proximity-based personalization algorithm recommends nearby venues based on predicted user interest and distance. It will further develop a highly distributed algorithm that allows handsets to perform part of the calculation, dramatically reducing computation costs that central servers would otherwise bear. This context-based user-interface allows users to chain operations, concentrating activities by proximity, and avoiding retyping. This project will expand the user- interface advancements to include personalizing categories, and a user-interface approach that mixes categories with individual venues. In addition it will explore algorithms that mix different types of venues on the same screen. Identity federation will help retailers and portals more readily deal with intermediary services. Self-service retail interfaces can allow traditional \"brick-and-mortar\" retailers to cost-effectively provide \"click-and-mortar\" services to consumers. A SOAP-based web-service will allow portals to filter data and configure look-and-feel more precisely. However, the proposed    tag mechanism will likely be good enough for most portals, as the output format can be configured easily through CSS, and filtering can be performed through the company's self-service portal interface\n\nThe end result of this project is a product that can be incorporated in enterprise logistics applications that help field personnel find, reserve, use and store resources while being able to improve the speed that consumers navigate user-interfaces, even when location is irrelevant. The in-handset personalization may ensure better privacy and security, even in non-location based applications.

Current methods for the assessment of biomass and size require excessive handling of the fish. This induces mortality, slows growth and causes illness. Results produced by these methods are inaccurate, labor intensive and increase production costs. In Phase I we demonstrated the feasibility of an innovative acoustic system for the estimation of fish size, mapping of fish density and estimation of biomass in an aquaculture net-pen. Phase II of the project will focus on the development of a prototype of the instrument to be deployed on a self-propelled platform, as well as on controlled experiments and testing at a fish farm.

The commercialization of the Acoustic Biomass Monitor will modernize and enhance fish farming technology, increasing both the efficiency and profitability of fish farms.

A major problem in the revegetation industry is the inability of container growers to consistently produce plant colonized by VAM. Despite the commercialization of VAM inoculum by the biotechnical industry, actual colonization of plants using standard nursery practices has resulted in consistently low colonization rates. The goal of Phase II research is to create a marketable growth media product termed \"VAM-Gro\" for the landscape and restoration/reclamation nursery industries based upon our Phase I research. In Phase II, we intend to demonstrate increased root biomass production under nursery conditions, increased field survival, and increased field growth rates for plants grown in VAM-Gro above industry standard growth media.

        "abstract": "72067-Gasification is one of the most efficient methods of producing electricity from coal and other solid fuels.  However, high temperature, slagging gasifiers have refractory liners that deteriorate rapidly and have a relatively short life, requiring considerable, costly maintenance.  Depending on operating temperature, unit size, and feedstock, refractory liners typically last 6-18 months and replacement costs exceed $1 million, including materials, manpower, and lost revenue due to downtime.  Additionally, these refractories contain chrome oxide, which causes health and environmental concerns due to the potential of carcinogenic hexavalent chrome formation during use.  This project will develop an advanced, improved refractory material for use in a coal-fed gasifier.  This material will be free of chrome oxide, cost less than 50% of currently used chrome oxide-bearing refractories, and provide an estimated life expectancy of at least three years in a coal-fed gasifier application. In Phase I, an economical, advanced refractory ceramic material for coal-fed slagging gasifiers was demonstrated.  Over 25 ceramic material compositions were formulated, formed into specimens, and tested for strength, density, porosity, and static cup brick slag corrosion.  Three compositions met all technical/ economical objectives:  absence of chrome/chrome oxide, good ceramic formability (at lab-scale), average flexural strength over 2,000 psi, static cup brick slag corrosion/penetration not greater than 2 mm, and a preliminary estimated cost that would be 50% less than of current gasifier refractory materials.  In Phase II, test results from Phase I will be used for further ceramic material development/optimization and a scaling-up of process techniques.  Full size ceramic shapes will be produced and tested in a full size gasifier. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  Economical refractory materials that contain no chrome oxide and provide excellent high temperature corrosion resistance should find use as refractory linings in solid feed gasifiers, molten metal (e.g., stainless steel) furnaces that yield slags, and chemical reactors that produce corrosive chemicals.  The benefits of such a refractory material would include excellent corrosion resistance, lower cost (i.e., more than $500,000 potential average refractory savings per gasifier), longer life, and environmental safety.",

A significant increase in renewable, cleaner-burning biofuels, such as biodiesel, offers the potential to address all of these issues.  However, biodiesel market penetration is severely limited by high feedstock (vegetable oil) costs associated with soybean production on valuable farm ground.  This project will diversify, extend, and lower the cost of America\u00bfs biodiesel production capacity by developing industrial oilseed crops specifically suited for marginal, non-irrigated, fallow cropland.  These oilseed crops could provide a regional biodiesel feedstock for regional refinement, enabling biodiesel to be price-competitive with petroleum-based diesel.  Phase I collected, grew, and carried out preliminary testing on candidate strains of three high-potential oilseed varieties in the Central High Plains of Colorado, Kansas, and Nebraska.  These oilseeds were grown in field trials alongside the best-performing current oilseed crops as performance checks to identify strains that could adapt to this marginal agricultural region.  Phase II will develop adapted industrial oilseed cultivars in the mustard family, which exhibit sufficiently high oil production and meal quality while limiting production costs, so that a biodiesel price that is competitive with petroleum diesel can be achieved.

Over the past few years, energy consumption by computers has emerged as a major area of intellectual and commercial activity. A key principle behind this approach is to use speculative information available at compile time to reduce power and energy consumption. The key qualifier is speculative: the information does not have to be provably correct. Speculative information that turns out to be correct will enhance energy reduction; if it is incorrect, the worst that will happen is that a penalty (in terms of energy) will have to be paid. The use of such speculative compile-time information opens up a largely unexplored dimension in compilers and computer architectures, to target energy efficiency.\n\nThe outcome of the proposed effort will not merely be a set of products, but also a vastly increased understanding of the means by which compile-time information can be exploited for energy savings. It is expected that this development effort will have a considerable impact on the theoretical underpinnings of compilers and compiler-architecture interaction, as well as a significant commercial impact. With the increasing prevalence of battery-powered computing devices such as PDAs, mobile telephones, and notebooks, power-aware computing is becoming increasingly important commercially.",

During Phase I period, the feasibility of ultra-fast tunable filters based on electro-optical effect have been demonstrated through prototyping. State-of-the-art filter characteristics have been achieved, including ultra-fast response (< 500 ns), wide tuning range (> 80nm at 1550nm), narrow line width (< 0.1nm) and broad working spectral band (from visible to middle infrared continuously). Based on the successful Phase I execution, the major effort of Phase II will be developing an advanced tunable filter platform. At which several commercial products are expected to emerge. Such as ultra-fast hyperspectral imaging systems suitable for geosciences and medical diagnostics, high frequency wavelength modulators for high sensitivity spectroscopic detection of trace-gas and wide-range fast-tuning optical filters for spectroscopy and wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) optical communication\n\nHyperspectral imagery has many existing and potential applications in agriculture,\nforestry, emergency response/disaster management, insurance, national security, oil and gas\nexploration, medical imaging, and military surveillance.

The tunable add/drop is promise to reduce network complexity and cost by eliminating expensive optical-electrical-optical conversion and reducing inventory of fixed-wavelength devices. A fast wavelength modulation, combined with synchronized detection, can form a very sensitive spectroscopic analytic instrument for trace-gas sensing. These gases usually have characteristic absorption lines in infrared  (IR) band, where no other fast tunable filter existed.

A variety of challenging test sample solutions, potentiometric measurements made with NFLJ references varied < 0.5 mV with response times of less than 60 seconds while measurements made with conventional reference electrodes varied up to 20 mV with response times of over one hour have already been completed. The NFLJ reference electrode's exceedingly small electrolyte consumption makes possible handheld NFLJ pH sensors with significantly higher precision and longer operational life. The high impedance of NFLJ reference electrodes, when using modern commercial pH electrodes, has no measurable effect on the precision, response time, or span of the pH measurement.\n\nThe nanochannel glass nanofluidic-flowing liquid junction (NFLJ) adds a new dimension to the design and construction of reference electrodes. The unique ability of the NFLJ design to separate flow volume and flow velocity will provide scientists with a tool for investigating reference electrode behavior as a function of flow, velocity, and resistance.

A new approach that maintains accuracy while reducing computational cost is needed.  This project will develop a finite element, particle-in-cell code with adaptive meshing, which could reduce the number of elements by two to three orders of magnitude while maintaining or improving the simulation accuracy.  In Phase I, quasi-static field solvers for both electrostatics and magnetostatics were implemented using the finite element methods with adaptive meshing.  The quasi-static solvers permitted time varying boundary conditions, but the electric and magnetic fields remained uncoupled.

The design will be developed, constructed and tested in Phase II, significantly advancing the field of optical switching from where it is today.\n\nThis integrated wavelength switch should have numerous applications in commercial and government networks. The capacity is huge: 4 fibers with 40 wavelengths each carrying 40 Gbit/s of data results in 6 Terabit/s switching capacity. This allows continued growth in the Internet, and enables a much lower cost solution to higher capacity wavelength services. Continued expansion of access to information requires continued expansion of worldwide core optical networks.",

The overall objective of this project is to identify and localize, using MCG, cardiac ischemia, the leading cause of death in the US.

Upon successful completion of this project MCG has the potential to become the new gold standard for the detection of cardiac ischemia in patients presenting with suspicion of acute coronary syndrome. \n\nWorldwide, the lack of inexpensive and non-invasive cardiac diagnostic techniques causes unnecessary delays in the recognition of acute coronary heart disease and its treatment. The feasibility of MCG to diagnose heart disease has been demonstrated. Machine learning tools provide quantitative methods for the automated diagnosis of heart disease.    After successful completion of this project, physicians and nurses in leading U.S. hospitals can be trained in automated MCG diagnosis.

        "abstract": "This  Small  Business  Innovative  Research  Phase  II  project  will focus on developing  tunable  microwave  devices  that  utilize  ferroelectric  thin  films  for  their  electronic  properties.    Specifically, barium  strontium titanate (BST) thin films are being used to develop new classes of tunable microwave devices, including phase  shifters,  delay  lines  and  frequency-agile  filters.    Currently, these ferroelectric  devices  suffer  from  two drawbacks:  easily  formed  planar  devices  demand very  large  tuning  voltages  on  the  order  of 100 Volts , while easily  tuned  parallel  plate  devices  require  sophisticated  processing  techniques.    These  problems  have inhibited  the  development  of  commercially  viable  components.    The current project proposes combining silicon based circuitry with ferroelectric devices on the same substrate.  For example, a silicon  charge  pump  circuit  can  be  integrated  on-chip  to  provide  high  tuning  voltages  for  a  ferroelectric phase shifter.  The voltage will be isolated to the chip and less than 3 Volts would be needed to externally drive the device.  Combining silicon semiconductor technology with ferroelectrics will enable development of devices which take advantage of ferroelectric's  dielectric  properties  and  overcome  the  current  roadblocks  in  the  way  of commercializing these devices. \n \nCommercially, a  great  deal  of  interest  has emerged in  the use of  ferroelectric thin  films in the wireless industry because of the material's ability to dramatically improve the functionality of existing devices.  For example, a ferroelectric duplexer is possible which has one third the size of existing duplexers, while using 40% less power.  Today's multiband handsets use up to four filters, so the potential for ferroelectrics is tremendous.  A key wireless handset manufacturer identified at least six applications for tunable devices inside their telephones. Overall, the  wireless  telecommunications  market  has  spawned  the  need  for  small,  low  power,  high  bandwidth microwave  components.    Over $50 billion of wireless handsets were sold  in  2002, with  $6  billion  being spent on RF semiconductor components.  With the trend towards highly functional wireless appliances like PDA's, the demand for wireless components will continue  skyrocketing.",

These composites passively (a great advantage in simplicity and effectiveness over other recently developed active material dampers) provide damping through domain wall switching, a non-conservative action which provides a high loss factor (~ 0.40). These dampers can be easily fabricated into complex shapes, provide stiffness and strength while also incorporating novel damping capabilities which exceed in performance and temperature range viscoelastic materials, the current state of the art for damping.    Currently, the magnetostrictive material used in these dampers is Terfenol-D, a rare-earth/iron alloy, which was originally developed for sonar applications. The hysteresis of the material is minimal by design. However, by altering the composition of the alloy, i.e. the ratio of rare-earth to iron, the size and activation stress of hysteresis in the material can be changed, increasing loss factors and effective stress ranges. Fortis Technologies proposes to use this new technology in thin-layers on turbomachinery components and measure the vibration mitigation effectiveness on a variety of turbomachinery components susceptible to high-cycle fatigue. We believe this economical process can easily be scaled up and commercially implemental for a variety of applications throughout a turbine engine",

This project will develop low-cost, dip-coated ceramic oxide coatings to prevent the high temperature corrosion of super alloys used in turbine engines that operate in syngas environments.  The dense ceramic oxide coating will function as environmental barrier coatings (EBC) on super alloys, providing protection in the aggressive and corrosive conditions found in high temperature turbine applications.  In Phase I, the feasibility of applying well bonded graded coatings of oxide compositions was demonstrated.  The coatings were in the 2 to 60 micron thickness range, and were crack free and dense.  It was demonstrated that the graded oxide coating have excellent corrosion stability in atmospheres composed of syngas, coal and fly ash impurities, and sulfur gas.  In tests lasting one thousand hours, the coating showed good thermo-mechanical stability while protecting the alloy from corrosion.  In Phase II, longer term exposure tests (10,000 hours) of the oxide coating on super alloy will be demonstrated in corrosive and abrasive environments.  A fabrication process for oxide coatings on complex alloy components for use in IGCC systems will be developed.  A partnership with a commercial synthetic gas company, to test the coating in real IGCC gas streams, will maximize the chances of developing a commercial viable oxide coating technology.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The new coatings would protect the turbine components and process equipments exposed to high temperature syngas environments in IGCC systems, and also would be applicable to other chemical, aerospace, and military processes.

        "abstract": "73138-As solid oxide fuel cell technology matures, it is becoming increasingly important to lower the cost of insulation.  Currently available low-cost insulation cannot be used in these applications because it contains silica, which volatilizes and degrades the anode.  Therefore, new low-cost, net-shape options for solid oxide fuel cell insulation are needed.  This project will develop a novel castable ceramic material with properties that make it ideal for solid oxide fuel cell insulation.  These properties include net-shape fabrication capability, very low thermal conductivity, thermochemical stability up to 1000oC, and very good thermal shock resistance.  In Phase I, the feasibility of using the castable ceramic materials as fuel cell insulation was proven through specific experiments.  These experiments showed that the candidate insulation materials provide thermochemical stability under fuel rich environments; very low thermal conductivity (0.3-0.4 W/mK), as required for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) insulation; and reliable performance of the solid oxide fuel cells when  the insulation was exposed to the air/fuel mixture at high temperature.  In Phase II, two net-shape insulation concepts from Phase I will be optimized and tested to demonstrate commercial product viability.  Activities will include materials and process optimization, component fabrication, and long term testing in SOFC systems. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  Commercial sales of insulation materials for solid oxide fuel cells should exceed $3 million by the year 2010.  It is anticipated that these new materials can capture a 40% market share, leading to annual sales of over $1.25 million to solid oxide fuel cell manufacturers and system integrators.  By partnering with a commercial SOFC manufacturer in Phase II, the chances of developing a commercially viable SOFC insulation technology will be maximized.",

        "abstract": "73123  In an effort to increase U.S. energy security, there has been considerable investment during the past two decades in research and development efforts directed toward the economic production of liquid fuels and chemicals from domestic coal and natural gas supplies.  Although the worldwide inventory of uncommitted gas reserves likely exceeds 2,000 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), equivalent to ca. 360 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe), none of these gas reserves are located in North America.  The conversion of coal-derived synthesis gas to clean transportation fuels via Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) using iron-based catalysts offers an economically attractive pathway in the near-term to achieving increased energy independence and security; however, the general consensus for FTS operations using an iron catalyst has been that separation of catalyst fines from the FTS heavy product is very difficult and may be a fatal flaw with currently available technology, such that catalyst/wax separation is one of the most important technical risks and a critical issue that must be resolved.  CeraMem Corporation has demonstrated (in Phase I) and plans to develop (in Phase II) and ultimately commercialize (in Phase III) an advanced process for catalyst-wax separation that has potential to enable the production of clean transportation fuels from synthesis gas derived from hydrogen-deficient feedstocks (such as coal).  In the Phase I program, CeraMem designed, assembled, and successfully operated a bench-scale, advanced monolith membrane filtration loop (AMML), and demonstrated the efficacy of a ceramic ultrafiltration membrane installed in the AMML for the production of near-catalyst-free product wax.  In the Phase II program, CeraMem plans to work intimately with its Phase II/III commercialization partner to further develop the subject technology demonstrated in the Phase I program.  Specifically, CeraMem plans to (1) design, construct, and operate a pilot-scale, advanced membrane process system; (2) determine the influences of key process and membrane element variables on system performance; (3) optimize CeraMem's advanced process for both primary and secondary catalyst/wax separation processes;  (4) develop engineering designs for potential commercial installations; (5) perform economic analyses for each design; and (6) initiate execution of CeraMem's commercialization strategy.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The primary commercial application for the advanced membrane process under development in this program is separation of iron-catalyst fines from wax produced from synthesis gas derived from hydrogen-deficient resources, such as coal.  If successful, CeraMem's technology will enable the commercial production of clean transportation fuels from the domestic coal supply at a cost as low as $0.50 per barrel, thereby providing a mechanism to significantly reduce dependence on oil imports, leading to increased energy security for the United States.  Other potential applications are foreseen in the petrochemical industry, including the removal of particulate contaminants from amine strippers, the regeneration of used lubricating oils, and the removal of catalyst fines from fluid catalytic cracking oil.",

        "abstract": "72215-Demand for ethanol as a transportation fuel has been growing substantially and this growth is anticipated to continue.  Most ethanol is produced via fermentation of sugars derived from corn and is comparatively expensive, in large part due to the high capital and energy costs for fermentation and for separating the product from the fermentation broths.  Technologies to improve the efficiency of ethanol separation and to better integrate the fermentation and downstream separation processes are needed to lower the cost of fuel ethanol.  This project will develop novel low-cost inorganic pervaporation membrane modules that have superior separation properties for extracting ethanol from fermentation broths, particularly for biomass-derived ethanol, significantly improving the energy efficiency and related costs for each of these operations.  In Phase I, the feasibility of fabricating high-performance inorganic ethanol-separation membranes on prototype supports was demonstrated.  The ethanol fluxes obtained with the innovative membrane devices were outstanding as compared to existing technology.  In Phase II, fabrication methods for the novel inorganic membranes will be improved and the membranes will be scaled-up to larger areas.  The ethanol separation properties of the scaled-up membranes will be demonstrated in extended tests, primarily through use of live fermentation broths as feed streams.  The data acquired will be used to evaluate the projected economics of several coupled pervaporation-fermentation process schemes for ethanol production.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The technology should provide an important reduction in initial capital costs, capital recovery costs, and operating costs for fuel ethanol plants.  This would be an important step in reducing the costs of starch-derived and biomass-derived ethanol, making it more cost-competitive with petroleum-derived fuels.

These industries have used membrane technology for some applications but membrane durability limits their widespread utilization. At present, there are no commercial cost-effective membranes that have the requisite process performance and lifetime for many applications within these industries. Inorganic membranes are either too expensive or are damaged by the abrasive-laden feed streams typical in sugar and grain processing applications. High temperatures, high viscosities, and membrane fouling have limited the use of polymeric membranes. CeraMem is proposing to develop low-cost, abrasion resistant, inorganic membranes for use in a number of sugar and grain processing applications. If successfully developed, these membranes could be priced less than half that of competing ceramic membranes and have higher flux and better flux stability than competing polymeric membranes. The use of low-cost, durable, inorganic membranes in the sugar and grain processing industries would increase flexibility in production and reduce cost. The membranes could be used to sterilize sugar juice and process liquors for subsequent processing increasing production flexibility or used to replace precoat filters thereby eliminating the costs of filter-aid sludge dewatering and disposal. In addition, this membrane technology could be used for other applications such as grain processing for corn sweeteners and production of ethanol as an alternative fuel.",

The system consists of a disposable biosensor chip and an optical reader device. The detection is based on a proprietary optical transduction technology known as grating-coupled surface plasmon resonance imaging (GCSPRI). Prior Phase I work has demonstrated the feasibility of the GCSPR microarray technology for multiplexed detection with high sensitivity. The goal of the Phase II project is to develop a laboratory prototype of a detection/identification sensor and a prototype chip for multiplexed detection of a model set of three analytes including a bacterium, a virus and a toxin. Non-pathogenic organisms will be used as model systems. Multi-epitope detection methods will be explored for reducing the probability of false alarms. The end result of the Phase II effort will be a demonstration with the laboratory prototype using manual sample introduction. This will provide the logical and critical milestone to transition into commercial development of a portable detection system interfaced to an aerosol collector for field testing and evaluation.\n\n\nThe commercial application of this project is in the detection of  biological agents for Homeland Defense. The capability for near real-time, multiplexed measurements with a low false alarm rate will be valuable whenever rapid assessment of a contaminated environment is needed. The potential applications would include hospitals, where nosocomial infections may arise; large buildings, where accidental contamination with mold spores, Legionella and other pathogens may create health hazards; recreational water and drinking water supplies, where waterborne pathogens are a great concern;  and the food industry, where there is a need for sensitive methods for on-line and real-time detection of pathogens.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will focus on scale-up and validation of the company's relational model discovery technology, with specific application focus on web-visitor behavior modeling. In Phase I research the company developed a modeling paradigm based a synthetic variable language for relational Bayesian modeling. Its synthetic variable language is the first comprehensive effort to develop a principled way to represent, discover, and perform probabilistic inference with mixed intra-table, cross-table, and multi-table relational features. This capability provides the basis for construction of comprehensive, integrated models of relational data. Models constructed capture the rich detail of web visitor behavior and can be used to make inferences about web visitor intent (e.g., whether or not a purchase in planned) in real- time. These results are not obtainable by any other modeling technology. The technical objectives for the Phase II project are to: (1) develop a complete language to establish solutions to outstanding issues in our synthetic variable capability, (2) engineer the infrastructure needed for commercial deployment, (3) construct deployable models of web visitor behavior to identify opportunities for intervention, and (4) conduct field-trials of model-based interventions to establish the business value of our approach. A paradox of modern society is that we possess so little knowledge relative to the amount of data we collect and store. E-commerce provides a paradigmatic example of this paradox. E-Commerce platforms collect unprecedented amounts of information about customer interactions, yet today's E-commerce applications do not provide the service expected by customers or the performance demanded by online retailers. Online retailers are demanding increasingly sophisticated marketing and merchandising technologies. The proposed product will empower online merchants and service providers by enabling efficient and integrated understanding of online consumer behavior.\n\nThe proposed product will bring in a new class of customer centric (instead of page-centric) web-based interactions that will contribute to the evolution of the World Wide Web as a communication medium. The company's technology also applies to offline scientific analysis as a method for hypothesis generation in complex relational data as in the E-commerce domain. This technology enables scientists to make better use of the data at their disposal.",

Laser based remote sensing applications require a variety of output formats, including amplitude modulated (AM) and frequency modulated (FM) continuous wave (CW) lasers; and pulsed lasers. There are currently no eye safe technologies available with the adaptive waveform capabilities to satisfy these requirements. At eye safe 1.5-micron wavelengths, bulk solid-state lasers are not capable of high average power operation; and conventional fiber laser systems are not capable of handling high peak powers due to optical damage and nonlinear effects. A patent-pending diffraction limited self-imaging waveguide laser technology has been developed that use an adaptive waveform that has the potential to satisfy the average and peak power requirements simultaneously.  There are two objectives for the Phase II research- 1) to design a self-imaging laser system with adaptive waveform capability, and 2) to demonstrate an adaptive waveform 1.5-micron laser transmitter. It is anticipated that >20 W of diffraction limited, eye safe average laser power will be achieved with adaptive waveform capability demonstrated. \n\n\nThis eye safe self-imaging waveguide laser module is targeted as an  enabling technology with broad reaching impact. The specific markets include remote sensing markets of wind and aerosol detection and 3- D imaging.  This technology should have a significant impact because current sensors are complex and costly. Other applications include hazard alerting for windshear, gust front, and turbulence detection; wake vortex detection, tracking, and measurement; and detection and tracking of hazardous bioaerosols.",

        "abstract": "72089-Most conventional dryers for biomass are designed to use fossil fuels such as natural gas and propane.  Unfortunately, natural gas and propane are costly, non-renewable, subject to price volatility, and increasingly being imported.  The use of agricultural and forest residues could displace virtually all fossil fuels used for drying, provide another revenue source for the nation\u00bfs farmers and foresters, reduce the potential for catastophic wildfires, reduce fertilizer consumption, and reduce drying costs.  However, small modular, commercial biopower systems, in which agricultural and forest residues could be used with existing commercial burners and dryers, are not available in the U.S.  This project will demonstrate that proven, small, modular biomass gas generators can be integrated with commercially-available, off-the-shelf gas burners that can be fueled with locally available residue fuels to provide economic alternatives to conventional fossil-fired drying.  Phase I demonstrated the integration of a downdraft small modular biopower system with commercial gas burners from two different manufacturers using forest residues as the fuel source.  The feasibility of converting two abundant residue fuels, corn stover and sawdust, to useful thermal energy in a fluid-bed biopower system was also demonstrated.  Two demonstrations will be conducted in Phase II: (1) in inner-city Washington DC, urban wood waste that would otherwise be landfilled will be used to dry high-value timber; and (2) at a rural, Indian-owned, sawmill in New Mexico, forest thinnings will be used to dry locally available timber.  In addition, a commercial burner will be integrated with a fluid-bed gasifier using three abundant low-bulk-density fuels: corn stover, switchgrass, and sawdust.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The energy from forest thinnings and harvested corn stover is more than sufficient to dry all of the lumber and corn respectively in the U.S. each year.  The market for new, and retrofitted, biopower-based drying systems should exceed $300 million, and save farmers and foresters over $1 billion/year in fossil fuel costs of grain and lumber drying.  In addition, jobs would be created in both rural and urban areas that currently have high unemployment.  The same technology also could be used in other distributed generation thermal markets such as greenhouse heating; building cooling, heating, and power; absorption chillers; desiccant dehumidifiers; and ice making.",

Currently available insulation systems either:  (1) do not meet these requirements; or (2) compromise the magnet system design or economics to such an extent as to make them unfeasible.  This project will develop new ceramic insulation systems, capable of being processed during the superconductor heat treatment, that meet the needs of NSO fusion devices.  The new inorganic insulation systems will provide high radiation resistance and enhanced cryogenic and elevated temperature performance, with processing properties similar to traditional composite insulation systems.  In Phase I, a prepreg form of a ceramic hybrid insulation, capable of being co-processed at Niobium-Tin reaction temperatures, was successfully developed.  The ceramic insulation systems were tested mechanically and electrically, in combination with epoxy and cyanate ester organic matrix materials, and were also irradiated to assess their radiation resistance.  Phase II will formulate new, low-cost ceramic insulation materials using low-cost fiber reinforcements that are compatible with high radiation and cryogenic environments.  The best candidate materials will be characterized for their mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties at cryogenic and elevated temperatures.  Then, they will be subjected to high doses of neutron and gamma radiation and tested mechanically following irradiation.  Finally, subscale magnet prototype coil mockups will be fabricated and tested.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The development of a prepreg ceramic insulation should have commercial applications for fusion magnets, high field accelerator magnets, and medical instruments.  All of these applications would become more viable with improved magnet processing, higher strength, and improved reliability.

Present generation of neutron sample environment equipment (cryostats, furnaces, etc.) lacks the automation features needed to handle the high demand by non-expert users for rapid experiments, and frequent sample changes.   This project will develop and deliver an advanced automated, programmable sample handling system for use in cryogenic sample environments for neutron research. The approach is to integrate state-of-the-art cryogenic and computer-controlled automation technologies to create the \u00bfFast Exchange Refrigerator for Neutron Sciences\u00bf specifically designed to increase experimental throughput in the next-generation neutron user facilities.   The new facility is targeted to high flux beamlines that will enable investigation of a large number of samples to provide high accuracy data on a wide range of sample types. In Phase I, instrument requirements were determined in discussion with users, a breadboard instrument, control software and sample holders were constructed.  The system was tested using a cryostat, test samples were exchanged in less than 1 minute.  Cool-down tests indicate that pre-cooling of samples is not required to achieve fast turnaround.  Results were analyzed and the Phase II design was drafted based on evaluation of requirements and findings.  Design parameters will be fixed, a prototype instrument will be constructed and fully documented, software will be prepared for use with ethernet-based control, simple, inexpensive sample encapsulation will be developed, the instrument will be delivered, tested and installed at the POWGEN beamline at SNS mid-second year.  Instrument specifications and commercial product design will be prepared for sale of instrument in Phase III.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee: The proposed instrument directly addresses a need for emerging neutron scattering facilities where there is a market for integrated partially automated facilities.  In addition to the target market in neutron instrumentation, a modified version of the instrument will serve markets in X-ray diffraction at facilities such as APS.",

Existing solid methane moderators have a high efficiency, but they can\u00bft be scaled to work on planned high power sources.  However, a cold moderator using solid methane pellets should be capable of high power operation, and the technology for producing methane pellets has recently been demonstrated.  This project will extend the technology to allow circulation of the pellets into and out of a remote moderator cell.  In Phase I, methods were developed to improve the flow characteristics of the pellets, which tend to stick together.  A cryogenic rotary drum hopper was developed, which allowed the pellets to be stored without sticking.  In Phase II, a full scale cryogenic pellet storage and transport system will be developed.  The system will include a larger rotary drum with an indirect pellet cooling system.  A pellet discharge chute will be designed to rapidly transfer the pellets to a remote prototype moderator.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a novel technology for laser-enabled analysis and processing (LEAP) of living cells. The ability to load cells with compounds is critical in many areas of research and medicine such as drug discovery and gene therapy. Current methods have limitations with respect to specificity, efficiency, toxicity, and/or throughput. Optoinjection is a novel and versatile procedure for cell loading that has been demonstrated in a few laboratories. Unfortunately, this is a slow, laborious procedure carried out on specialized microscopes. Oncosis has developed the LEAP platform for high-speed cell imaging and purification via lethal laser effects on unwanted cells. Phase I results demonstrated feasibility for using the LEAP platform to implement optoinjection in a high-throughput, cell-specific manner that would enable the commercialization of this novel form of cell loading. Phase II studies are proposed to optimize and implement optoinjection in biologically relevant experimental systems, resulting in data supporting this powerful new tool for the analysis and manipulation of living cells within a physiological environment. The instrument design will then be configured for successful commercial manufacturing, and further improvements in capabilities will be pursued in order to maintain market leadership and to expand into other markets.\n\nThe commercial application of this project is in the areas of cell-based life science research and drug discovery. Over $ 2.6 billion was spent during 2001 on research instrumentation in academic life science research and commercial drug discovery, and growth to $ 5.3 billion by 2005 has been forecasted. For the specific application of optoinjection, LEAP provides many advantages over current techniques including simplicity, robustness, efficiency, speed, high viability, and specificity. The commercial opportunity for this platform is therefore significant, as is the scientific enablement of experimentation that is not currently possible.",

        "abstract": "72200-Inadequate fresh air ventilation and poor indoor humidity control are two of the biggest problems in residential buildings.  Both leaky older homes and more energy efficient newer homes often have problems maintaining adequate indoor comfort and air quality.  Conventional air conditioning systems are not capable of providing the proper balance of cooling and dehumidification under varying outdoor conditions, and stand-alone dehumidifiers reduce overall system efficiency.  This project will develop a cost-effective package of refrigeration components and controls that will provide the capability to meet changing latent and sensible loads, and provide fresh air ventilation, while using less energy than air conditioners with stand-alone dehumidifiers.  The package will operate with conventional high efficiency furnaces, will be familiar to building trades, and will be easy to install.  Phase I selected and designed key components (evaporator and subcooling coils), assembled and laboratory tested a prototype system to verify capabilities, and developed a system control strategy.  Results indicate that moisture removal rates of about 51 to 55 liters per day during humid weather spells could be achieved, approximately two to four times more than a conventional single-speed central air conditioner.  Phase II will further optimize the system for both cost and performance, package the components for ease of installation, develop integrated system controls, field test the system, and initiate technology transfer activities.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The integrated system should be well suited for controlling indoor temperature and relative humidity, along with providing fresh air ventilation, in single-family and small commercial applications located in humid regions.  Since over three-quarters of the U.S. population is located in climates with high humidity, the market is substantial.  Preliminary energy savings estimates suggest that the proposed system can provide improved comfort while saving 20% (650 kWh/year) of typical cooling and dehumidification energy usage, resulting in potential cumulative national energy savings of 162.5 GWH per year.  In addition, the system should reduce the potential for mold growth, thereby reducing insurance claims.",

This innovation exploits two recent developments in liquid crystal science: a new liquid crystal phase made from novel bent-core \"banana\" molecules, and electrostatically controlled analog modulation of high polarization FLCs. The new modulators will offer the fixed-optic-axis phase modulation capability of a nematic liquid crystal in combination with the much faster speed and lower drive voltage of a ferroelectric. Present day FLCs modulate light through electrically driven optic axis rotation. Phase modulation range is limited to less than 180 degrees  unless complex multi-element device designs are used. What's so novel about the new FLC is that it modulates light through changes in its index of refraction; the direction of the optic axis remains fixed. Furthermore that modulation can be analog, unlike conventional FLCs, which are binary. This enables simpler device structures and phase ranges greater than 360 degrees.\n\n\nThe new FLC should be compatible with liquid-crystal-on-silicon technology (LCOS), allowing the ability to construct inexpensive wavelength-tunable devices and wavefront modulators for diverse application including telecommunications, holographic and conventional optical data storage, and microdisplays.  This production on an electro-optic technology could be useful in an existing market (microdisplays), and could enable large new markets in the near future (active optics, optical data storage, telecommunications).  Advantages over alternative technologies due to the nature of a lower cost manufacturing processes, and the ability to easily implement complex functionality because of the integration of this electro-optic technology with standard CMOS VLSI technology. Society could benefit through job creation, enhanced telecommunications, and improved data storage technologies.",

The longer term goal of the project is to develop transgenic crops (soybeans, corn and cotton),  that are resistant to parasitic nematodes. In Phase I research, essential proteins exposed in the nematode intestinal lumen were identified as outstanding targets for anti-nematode agents produced by plants. These proteins are accessible to the environment since the lumenal membrane of the intestine is the surface through which nutrients are absorbed by the nematode. This Phase II project is expected to show that transgenic expression of nematode intestine-toxic peptides at the site of infection would create inhospital host plants for plant parasitic nematodes and would result in resistant crops which do not require application of toxic chemicals for nematode control. \n\nThe commercial impact of this project will be on nematode control in major crops.

        "abstract": "73028-The Next Generation Linear Collider (NLC) will require high voltage pulse modulators to drive thousands of NLC klystrons at 500 kV, 265 A each.  The cost of building and operating these systems represents a substantial segment of the overall NLC cost.  In order to reduce the capital, operating, and power costs of these systems, the DOE is investigating a range of modulator technologies and architectures to identify and validate the optimal combination of performance, cost, and efficiency.  In previous work, a solid-state Marx Bank modulator, a design with the potential to provide significant cost and efficiency improvements over other modulator architectures, was investigated.  The design eliminates the pulse transformer associated with other modulator designs, which avoids large power losses and translates to savings of nearly $100M in electricity costs over a 10 year operating period.  This project will design and build a full scale, solid-state NLC Marx bank modulator.  Phase I designed and prototyped two variants of a solid-state Marx Bank modulator \u00bf one based on discrete IGBT devices, and one based on series connected IGBTs.  For both designs, performance was extrapolated to full NLC capability through circuit modeling.  In both cases, the solid-state Marx Bank designs proved to be significantly more efficient than alternative NLC modulator designs.  The series-connected design also offered the potential to eliminate two levels of losses in the power supply itself, increasing the overall system efficiency by another 5%.  Phase II will build and test a 500 kV, 530 A, solid-state Marx Bank modulator and its associated power supply.  The system will have low construction cost, high efficiency, a small footprint, and a capability of driving two NLC klystrons.  The system will be delivered to SLAC for assessment and operation.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The solid state Marx Bank modulator should have numerous applications in commercial and military high voltage systems, including commercial accelerators for medical treatment and inspection systems, military and commercial radar transmitters, and a range of materials modification processes.  The small size, efficiency, and low cost of this approach will significantly speed the adoption of solid-state pulsed power systems in these markets.",

The cost and efficiency of these modulators represents a substantial portion of the cost of building and operating the NLC.  As part of the ongoing effort to reduce these costs, a prototype Hybrid Modulator was developed and delivered, which is currently operating at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC).  However, its performance is less than expected, due to impedance added to the system to handle arc faults in the klystron without damaging the modulator itself.  This project will develop methods to simultaneously improve the modulator performance and reliably handle klystron fault currents.  In particular, very fast and efficient pulse waveforms will be provided, while safely and reliably handling klystron fault (arc) currents.  Phase I investigated two different approaches to removing the inserted impedance in the Hybrid Modulator.  In the first, improved gate drivers were designed and tested to speed the response of the modulator to klystron faults, reducing the peak currents seen within the modulator and allowing much faster pulse risetimes (and efficiency) during normal operation.  In the second, intrinsic current-limiting techniques were designed and demonstrated within the solid state switch of the modulator itself, to prevent fault currents from reaching levels that could damage the modulator or klystron.  Phase II will build, test, and install these upgraded gate drives within the Hybrid Modulator, and assess the performance improvement of the Hybrid Modulator itself.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  In addition to the NLC application, the development of active current-limiting technology should have commercial benefits by reducing the overal number (and cost) of the switches required in a solid state modulator.  This cost reduction should significantly speed the adoption of solid state modulators in a variety of applications, including cancer treatment, container inspection, and semiconductor manufacturing.",

For more than thirty years it had been assumed that the only way to efficiently compile and execute parallel programs was through MPI. Even though it had been recognized that parallel programs would run faster if executed asynchronously on the basis of data availability, technology needed to do that efficiently was not available, until Technology for Integrated Computation and Communication (TICC) came along. This tuning technology eliminates the need for dynamic checking of temporal coordination, and makes it possible to execute control signal exchange protocols in parallel with computations. More than 40 million messages may be exchanged per second. This eliminates communication bottleneck and allows asynchronous execution of parallel programs based on data availability without using MPI. TICC defines the semantics of causal statements and provides a very efficient implementation for them.\n\nTICC brings the following additional facilities: (1) Component based parallel program development environment, (2) Dynamic debugging of parallel programs (3) Dynamic monitoring and changing of messages and message traffic, (4) Dynamic repair and failure recovery, (5) Dynamic reconfiguration, and (5) Dynamic evolution parallel software systems. These have the consequent benefit of reducing parallel program development and maintenance costs, making them more easily and widely available. This, together with decreasing costs of multiprocessors, has the potential to usher in a new era of desktop supercomputing by 2007, with profound impact on science, technology, industry, education, theories of computation and communication, and society in general.",

These techniques can provide up to a factor of 24 increase in data throughput with 5 to 10 dB less of power as compared to JTRS-WNW. This provides a significant increase in network flexibility as compared to the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) WNW Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Anti-Jam (AJ) techniques. In this Phase II SBIR, Efficient Channel Coding (ECC), Xenotran, and 0dB Coding will demonstrate the flexible, near-Shannon limit Forward Error Correction (FEC) techniques developed by each company in separate Phase I efforts. This will be achieved through a demonstration implementation in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology.  Additionally, the top-level design for the overall FAST-WNW system will be developed.    A Phase II Option is proposed that would further the demonstration by integrating the FEC into an adaptive modem system, allowing the demonstration of the FAST-WNW concept in a system environment.",

        "abstract": "Pressure ulcers are a serious medical problem with annual treatment costs over $1 billion dollars. While the exact etiology involves a complex combination of factors, it is generally accepted that prolonged pressure to soft tissues results in discrete areas of acute ischemia. If the pressure is not relieved and the blood supply restored in a critical length of time, endothelial cell damage will result and eventually necrosis will occur.  While it is a common and serious condition for individuals who are confined to beds or wheelchairs the occurrence of pressure sores can be drastically reduced by frequent changes in one's body position. As a result, a number of companies have developed pressure-mapping systems to provide caregivers, patients and researchers important feedback regarding physical position history. In this Phase H effort, we intend to build upon our successful Phase I work to develop a novel optically based pressure mapping system and compare its performance to existing systems in clinical settings. Our design, based on mature optical technology, will have the physical characteristics of a thin sheet of flexible plastic. Given its sensitivity to pressure we are confident that this technology can be adapted for medical device applications. If successful, these disposable sensor sheets can be inexpensively produced in large areas, unobtrusively conform to any surface with minimal alteration of the tissue interface, and provide high resolution pressure maps.",

A critical need arises because NASA is developing higher impulse, higher power thrusters for deep space science missions. Such thrusters will erode chamber walls ten-times more aggressively than before and create unacceptably high levels of contamination in the life test facilities. Without new materials that are ten-times more resistant than graphite, the only alternative may be installation of larger vacuum test chambers at huge facility cost. The proposed sputter-resistant materials are based on carbon fibers in a highly textured configuration that allows deep penetration of incident ions and trapping of sputtered secondary atoms. Phase 1 testing has demonstrated a 5x reduction in sputter backflow toward the ion source, consistent with modeling predictions. It appears feasible to extend the use of existing test facilities at least into planned near term testing of next generation ion engines. Phase 2 will develop thicker low-contamination chamber liners intended for long duration exposure, and modeling tools will be developed to aid in the design of baffled chamber liners. Lightweight rigid plume shields for spacecraft using EP will be demonstrated and offered for testing. Removable, cleanable, liner configurations will be demonstrated for use with condensable liquid metal propellants. Sputter testing will be performed by CSU using hemispherical witness plates to rapidly acquire directional yield data. Low-contamination chamber liner materials designed for use in testing high current, high voltage ion sources will be delivered under the contract for evaluation by NASA.",

Pulverized activated carbon could be used to improve reaction kinetics, reduce energy consumption, and minimize the waste generated per unit of gold produced; however, this carbon cannot be separated from the ore.  This project will develop technology for rendering the powdered carbon magnetic so that it can be separated from the host ore after adsorption of the dissolved gold.  The approach will improve gold recovery from difficult ore deposits resulting in increased mine life and extraction efficiency, as well as reducing the energy consumed and environmental impact per ton of ore mined.  In Phase I, samples of magnetic activated carbon were prepared using various procedures and raw materials.  The carbon samples were evaluated for gold adsorption and magnetic characteristics.  Results indicate that current standards for gold recovery can be met or exceeded with improvements in both processing rate and gold recovery.  Phase II will demonstrate the magnetic carbon process on a continuous basis in an operating mining environment; on-site testing is critical to determine whether the plant operating environment and/or process variances will influence the results.  All critical design parameters will be measured, in order to in engineer a Phase III demonstration facility.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The primary application for this technology is in gold mining.  Other uses include improved purification of drinking water, treatment of contaminated ground water, and mercury removal from power plant and waste incineration flue gas.

        "abstract": "72325-Phosphate beneficiation plants currently pump hundreds of thousands of gallons of fine refuse into waste impoundments every minute.  This refuse contains not only fine phosphate, considered unrecoverable by current industrial practice, but also coarse phosphate that has been misplaced due to sizing inefficiencies.  Unfortunately, this lost phosphate is a large portion of the total valuable mineral extracted during the mining process.  Its rejection represents poor separation and energy efficiency, and its recovery would reduce production costs and lessen the amount of waste sent to impoundments.  This project will develop a mineral processing circuit for the economical recovery of phosphates that are currently being discarded.  This process includes column froth flotation preceded by a combination of advanced hydroclassification techniques.  In Phase I, historical records from four primary U.S. phosphate producers were analyzed along with sample characterization data collected directly from a typical fine waste stream.  These data indicate that there is a significant amount of valuable phosphate present in a recoverable size range.  Preliminary laboratory and on-site testing verified that this material can be concentrated and upgraded.  In Phase II, a pilot-scale test circuit will be fabricated and installed at a phosphate beneficiation plant.  In conjunction with a major phosphate producer, the mineral processing circuit will be evaluated and optimized in an effort to produce a viable product from current industrial waste.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  Because no phosphate beneficiation plant incorporates a recovery circuit for the treatment of fine refuse, commercial applications should include the fabrication and installation of the required equipment for every available plant.

        "abstract": "72314-Methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) is a commodity chemical in high demand with an annual production of over 675 million pounds in the U.S. alone.  Currently, 87% of the MEK is produced via the three-step sec-butyl alcohol route, which starts with the expensive 1-butene, consumes large amounts of energy, and generates much corrosive and toxic waste.  To address the cost, energy, and environmental issues together, this project will explore and develop a one-step process that uses a complex metal oxide catalyst to manufacture MEK from n-butane, a cheap component of natural gas.  The process uses gas-phase selective oxidation with air as the oxidant.  Through rational design and systematic study/optimization of metal oxide compositions, preparation methods, and process conditions, the resulting industrial process will achieve 50% n-butane conversion and 50% MEK selectivity (~ 25% MEK yield).  In Phase I,  several lead metal oxide catalysts of various compositions were discovered to be fairly active for n-butane conversion and selective for MEK formation.  The feasibility of catalytic production of MEK directly from n-butane in one-step, using air as the oxidant, was demonstrated.  An MEK yield of approximately 5% (22.4 % n-butane conversion and 21.3 % MEK selectivity) was achieved.  Phase II will develop a catalyst preparation process for highly active and selective metal oxide catalysts, conduct characterization studies to reveal the structure requirement of an effective catalyst, and perform a kinetic study to determine the preferred catalytic condition.  Phase II goals include 50 % n-butane conversion and 50 % MEK selectivity ( ~ 25% MEK yield).  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The catalytic process for the production of MEK should replace the current three-step sec-butyl alcohol process and provide U.S. MEK producers with the ability to compete and capture the global MEK markets.  A 60% reduction in feedstock costs could be realized by using the much cheaper n-butane as the starting material (versus the currently used 1-butene).  More than 3.8 trillion Btu of energy savings could be realized if the proposed technology were fully implemented.  Lastly, the environmental friendly catalytic process should significantly reduce waste production from the current commercial sec-butyl alcohol process.",

Initial gas-to-liquids (GTL) technologies, implemented in the 1980s and early 1990s, were not commercially successful \u00bf the main reason being that they were far too expensive.  This project will develop a practical Fischer-Tropsch (FT) technology, using a multifunctional catalyst, that has the potential to reduce costs of the FT portion of a GTL facility by 35% or more.  The cost reduction potential of this approach should provide a very strong springboard for overall GTL economic viability.  In Phase I, the hydrodynamic aspects of the multifunctional catalyst were studied, preliminary kinetics of the FT reaction were established to enable the multifunctional FT catalyst to be compared to a conventional catalyst, and the viability of the multi-functional catalyst was proven in a three-phase reactor.  In Phase II, the catalyst system will be optimized using a reactor model and tested under a range of process conditions.  Stability tests will confirm the deactivation characteristics of the catalyst, and an economic evalutaion will establish the viability of this new FT process.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The technology has the potential to reduce both fixed and variable costs by allowing simpler reactor designs and reducing raw-material consumption through better product selectivity.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project will produce a commercial version of PathfinderPlus, an online system that integrates assessment of complex, standards-based instructional objectives within interactive simulations and makes the resultant data available in a timely and efficient manner to students, teachers and administrators.  In order to effectively implement curriculum standards-based educational reforms (e.g., as mandated by the No Child Left Behind Act), teachers need guidance in linking students' day-to-day learning to these standards and in adapting subsequent instruction based on students' progress against the standards.  Existing educational technology products, however, are explicitly correlated only to the macro-level terminal objectives in each state's curriculum standards.  As a result, these products do not provide diagnostic information regarding component knowledge and skills, and they thereby fail to support teachers in understanding more precisely where students are having difficulties within a given terminal objective.  PathfinderPlus provides a comprehensive online library of highly interactive learning objects that track student' actions as they use them.  The system analyzes the generated data to create assessment probes which yield results that are indexed against a hierarchy of component knowledge and skills related to each state's terminal objectives.  This analysis provides students, teachers and other educational stakeholders with a roadmap to success in meeting their state's curriculum standards.  In terms of broader impacts, the successful production of a fully functional, commercial PathfinderPlus product will break significant technical ground in the field of large online repositories of interactive learning objects.  The deployment of ExploreLearning's XML specification HILO ML (Highly-Interactive Learning Object Markup Language) separates the pedagogical logic of a learning object's adaptive behavior from its technical instantiation.  This separation enables the efficient development of the volume of scripts required by a system that covers entire courses (e.g., Algebra).  The use of a four-tiered architecture to link fine-grained pedagogical events (i.e., pedagogically-meaningful interactions between students and the online simulations) to macro-level terminal objectives provides a flexible, modular foundation for the system.\n     In terms of impacts on K-12 education, PathfinderPlus will foster alignment with standards-based curricula, support teachers in integrating technology effectively and efficiently into their classrooms, and provide a new approach for measuring the impact of educational technology on student learning.  In addition, the system's use of interactive simulations as the medium for assessment enables a broader range of more complex, higher-order instructional objectives to be assessed (e.g., problem solving strategies and skills), as compared to traditional probes used in computer-based applications such as multiple-choice questions.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of preventable serious injury and death among on-duty firefighters is much higher than in most other occupations. Over 100 firefighters a year are killed in the line of duty, many more in some years. Gener\nally, over 50% of these deaths are from heart attacks due to the high-stress associated with extreme exertion in life-and-death situations. The goal of the proposed work is to develop a novel monitoring system for the fire industry which will transmit vita\nl sign and environmental parameter data from firefighters in a burning building to the safety officer or incident commander on the outside. This will allow the safety officer to detect when a firefighter is becoming dangerously fatigued and to make medical\nly sound decisions about when to rotate personnel, thereby avoiding preventable injury and death. The work will focus on selecting sensors to measure the desired vital signs and environmental parameters, incorporating these sensors into firefighter timeout\n gear, designing appropriate electronics and processing for these sensors, developing     robust telemetry system for reliably transferring data from within a variety of structures, and designing a    user-interface which can be easily used by a fire safet\ny officer.

No system meeting these specifications existed previous to this Phase I project. Under Phase II funding, we propose to broadly extend and enhance the capabilities of the system developed in Phase I.

Therefore, there is a great need to identify new, higher efficiency, lower cost catalysts for fuel cells.  This project will develop a novel, high-throughput combinatorial approach to the discovery and development of high activity catalysts for fuel cells.  In Phase I, a prototype combinatorial screening process and equipment was designed, built, and successfully demonstrated.  Sample preparation techniques were developed, and an initial screening was conducted for several classes of promising nobel and non-nobel metal based, low-cost, oxygen reduction catalysts.  In Phase II, the combinatorial screening process will be scaled up, allowing the pursuit of several complex catalyst development strategies that otherwise would take many years.  The goal will be an order of magnitude increase in the performance/cost ratio, with the most promising catalyst being scaled up for customer evaluation.

A high precision emittance measurement requires precise beam position at the measurement location.  At present there is no existing technique, commercial or otherwise, for non-destructive, pulse-to-pulse, simultaneous beam position and emittance measurement.  This project will develop a high precision, cavity-based system for simultaneous, pulse-to-pulse beam position and emittance measurements, without beam interception or moving parts.  A multi-cavity standing wave structure will be designed, fabricated, and tested, in which the quadrupole and the dipole standing wave modes resonate at harmonics of the beam operating frequency.  Phase I designed an optimized 9-cavity standing wave system for simultaneous high precision beam position and emittance measurements.  An integrated system was designed so that the quadrupole of the system operates with the pi-mode resonating at the 16th harmonic of the bunch frequency at the Next Linear Collider (NLC), and with the 3pi/4 dipole mode resonating at 12th harmonic.  The output field amplitude of the system was close to 9 times that of a single cavity system, resulting in better resolution.  In Phase II, the 9-cavity standing wave structure will be fabricated.

Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The high precision, integrated, position-emittance measurement technique should be applicable to all particle accelerators where maintaining beam quality is crucial, from high energy physics accelerators to medical application accelerators.  The system should offer superior functionality (pulse-to pulse resolution) at a much lower cost (a factor of ten or more) compared to presently available wire scanner systems.",

        "abstract": "72753-The Resistive Wall Mode (RWM) is a major instability that limits performance in current and projected future advanced tokamaks.  Active control of the RWM using external coils to cancel RWM magnetic flux has been shown effective in stabilizing the mode.  The control scheme requires both accurate isolation of the mode flux from the total flux and accurate modeling of system responses to the mode flux.  This project will develop a flexible desktop tool to facilitate the calculation of the mutual couplings of the plasma-wall-coil-sensor system in a three-dimensional toroidal geometry that can be easily modified to test different systems.  The tool also will facilitate the construction of system-response models for effective RWM detection.  In Phase I, a vacuum field code was modified to model the resistive wall and RWM structure as current eigenmodes.  The extended code was then designed to calculate the mutual plasma-wall-coil-sensor couplings in a flexible manner, so that alternative geometries can be easily implemented.  Phase II will: (1) optimize the RWM identification and control toolset, including the expansion of its functionality for more general use; (2) validate the toolset, including real-time vacuum and plasma tests; and (3) automate the toolset in an experimental facility, and develop packaging materials, including a user\u00bfs guide.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The modeling toolset should provide a flexible desktop tool for system-response modeling of active feedback. The nature of the tool should allow it to be easily used by researchers for a variety of systems, enabling its quick application to any current or future tokamak.",

This project will design a low-cost test rig that can be used to understand how trace contaminants in a coal-derived synthesis gas (syngas) fueled combustion environment interact with advanced turbine blade materials and coatings.  The degradation processes that may be studied with this rig include deposition, erosion, and corrosion from heavy metals or particulates and gaseous species such as SOx, alkali compounds, or HCl.  The rig also will allow for the study of thermal and mechanical loads on the test specimens, emissions measurements, and will simulate actual engine conditions.  In Phase I, a conceptual design and analysis were conducted of the rig test section to demonstrate that desired test conditions (thermal gradient and heat flux) could be achieved, and that the proposed rig is viable.  The test chamber was designed to test multiple specimens concurrently with the specimens loaded statically.  An instrumentation plan was developed to address the need to monitor specimen temperature and identify whether coating spallation occurs.  In Phase II, an analytical verification of the test section design will be performed.  In addition, the combustion system that supports the test rig will be designed and built.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  Higher performance and lower emission requirements are driving the need for advanced turbine thermal barrier coatings for industrial gas turbines, land-based aeroderivative power turbines, and military aero engines.

        "abstract": "Human activities have allowed uncharacteristically dense forests of small diameter trees to develop. Fires, which are now suppressed, historically thinned these forests, reducing stand densities by removing weak and suppressed trees. Also, because the species harvested (ponderosa pine western larch, and western white pine) were more resistant to native diseases and insects than the remaining firs and hemlocks, the present forests occupying the inland West are prone to epidemic insect and disease outbreaks as well as catastrophic stand replacing fires. Mechanical means of reducing the forest density before fire is applied appears to have the greatest likelihood of success and may be the safest and cheapest way to improve these \"unhealthy\" forest conditions. Unfortunately, the large equipment presently used for timber harvesting is expensive and usually not cost effective when used with small diameter trees. The large equipment also causes environmental degradation. Low impact, efficient, safe equipment that could be used to remove and/or redistribute these materials before applying fire would not only benefit the resource but would also help support local economies. The development of specialized timber harvesting equipment that could reduce fuel loads at the lowest possible cost is urgently needed. The purpose of this project is to develop a small, semi-autonomous vehicle for reducing fuels in forests.",

Hybrid poplar plantations have been developed extensively in the region for the pulp and paper, veneer, furniture, and environmental-remediation industries, and can be expanded further to provide renewable raw materials for the biofuels and bioproducts industries.  In this project, current elite hybrid varieties will be tested for high rates of energy conversion, and a study of energy-quality characteristics within the region\u00bfs most important hybrid (Populus generosa) will be undertaken to elucidate the most productive method of hybrid breeding for the development of future varieties.  In Phase I, 92 elite poplar varieties were collected and propagated.   Studies were conducted to determine market demand for new Populus varieties and the potential for forming an industrial genetic improvement cooperative.  Eight sites and cooperators were located for the establishment of test plantings using currently available elite materials.  Phase II will conduct an inheritance study of calorific value in the P. x generosa hybrid to determine the degree to which energy conversion potential can be manipulated and exploited through selective breeding.  The technology of near infrared scanning will be developed and refined so that large plant populations can be phenotyped in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner.  Replicated varietal site trials, using elite germplasm to identify superior selections with which energy plantations can be initiated in the near term, will be conducted.  Finally, the economic viability of poplar feedstock production using a multiple-product management strategy will be demonstrated.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  Superior poplar varieties capable of sustained production of 22.4 bone dry biomass tons per hectare per year, with improved biomass quality, should become available to the commercial nursery industry.

A fabrication process will also be developed that ensures economical manufacturability of the filter in high volumes.  The greatest challenge in the design of reliable particulate filter and trap systems has been achieving adequate regeneration, or the oxidation (burning) of particulates that accumulate in the filter substrate diesel engine operation.  The objectives of Phase II will include designing an actively regenerating filter structure, optimization of EC material for use in the DPF  substrate, development of manufacturing processes suitable for scale up to volume  production, construction of prototype DPF substrates, testing, and ultimately  integration of the  EC-integrated DPF into a functioning DPF system ready for field  testing.  The anticipated result of the Phase II project is an actively regenerating  EC-integrated DPF prototype substrate suitable for field  testing in the US EPA.s Voluntary Retrofit Program. \n\nThe EC-integrated DPF will fulfill new emissions controls scheduled to take effect in  2007.  There is presently a compelling need for a compact, simple-to-maintain,  durable, and effective diesel particulate filter for both new and existing diesel- powered vehicles.  The EC-integrated DPF could potentially reduce diesel particulate emissions by 9.5 million tons annually, preventing thousands of premature deaths due to respiratory illnesses, cancer and heart disease.  .",

The opportunity is the interest shown by village members in the activities of the HVC, particularly the farming of vanilla and the products it makes from its vanilla beans. From every indication, the future of HVC appears bright but will require growers to supply it with green vanilla beans. Further, there appears to be significant potential for HVC to produce value-added products and spearhead agri-tourism in the area, thus providing additional jobs for local residents who do not want to farm. The importance of a successful, vertically integrated business such as HVC to the economy of such a small and isolated town can be significant to the town's self-image and well being.

Moreover, the design is superbly robust, allowing the instrument to be mounted on long-term moorings, AUV\u00bfs and ROV\u00bfs, drifters or deep profiling packages.  The second instrument is a spectrometer-based, folded-path beam transmissometer.  The third is a relatively compact instrument for measuring the volume scattering function at 11 equally spaced angles from 15 to 165 degrees.  While currently there are commercial instruments for measuring absorption, beam attenuation and scattering, they all suffer from their own particular shortcomings and well-known limitations, in some cases severe limitations.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovative Research Phase II project addresses the development of\nInnovative Ultra-Broadband Ferrite Circulators/Isolators. A conventional 3-port ferrite\nstripline junction circulator involves a low-Q ferrite stripline resonator so that at the\ncirculation frequencies standing-wave resonant modes are excited dumping microwave \nenergy from the input port to the output port but not the isolation port. Operation of a \nconventional ferrite circulator is nonreciprocal, and the transmission bandwidth is \nroughly proportional to the inverse of the Q-factor of the resonator, due to the\nstanding-wave nature of the excited resonant modes. A new picture of ferrite-circulator\noperation utilizing traveling-wave coupling of microwave signals at the circulation frequencies haa been discovered. This is in contrast to the operation of the conventional circulators employing standing waves for coupling. As such, ultra-broadband operation of the circulators results, whose bandwidth has been measured in Phase I to cover from 1.6 to 16 GHz for a prototype device. It is not possible to acheive this bandwidth with a conventional circulator. This leads to a new generation of ferrite circulators or isolators.\n\nUsing the LTCC technology facilitates mass production in large quantities. As such, generic microwave circulators and isolators can be fabricated at low costs suitable for universal applications covering across many frequency bands. Ferrite-circulator operation does not \nrequire a ferrite resonator anymore. This requirement has been constantly enforced by the operation of a conventional circulator for more than 50 years. There is always a tremendous need for circulators or isolators which are able to provide signal-path separation or protection \nover many frequency bands, as demanded by the measurement of a broadband signal and by a narrow electromagnetic pulse.",

This project will develop technology for lowering the cost of the Nb/Cu filaments that go into the internal-Sn subelments and for increasing the Nb/Cu ratio of these filaments.  Increasing the Nb/Cu ratio of the filaments will increase the potential current density of the subelements.  A continous Cu wrapping approach will be used to increase the current density of the strand.  The wrapping approach also will be used to construct the Cu clad filaments that go into the subelement billet, thereby lowering the fabrication costs of the internal Sn subelements.  Phase I demonstrated the contruction of subelement billets with Cu wrapped Nb (and Nb7.5wt%Ta) filaments with both 80/20 and 90/10 Nb/Cu ratios.  These subelements were extruded, annealed, and restacked and drawn down to final strands, which were then tested.  In addition, an approach for adding Ti to the subelement billet was demonstrated.  In Phase II, the billet sizes will be scaled up to full size production billets and restacks.  Also, an additional way of introduce Ti into the subelement billet, and incorporating split barriers to lower the AC losses of the strands, will be investigated.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The largest market for the technology should be for accelerator and fusion magnets.  However, high field magnets (above 5 tesla) can be used for MRI, NMR, high gradient magnetic separators, and superconducting magnetic energy storage applications.",

In particular, the MHD limitations on design, as function of flow speed, will be determined.  Several numerical and physical issues related to solid wall treatment in MHD flows were resolved in Phase I.  The code was shown to be able to be run on parallel computers using the electric potential formulation with 3-D magnetic fields.  The code was convergent at very high Hartmann number cases (e.g., 10,000).  Free surface flow capability was enhanced by enforcing strict mass conservation and demonstrating the code capability for canonical problems.  Two fusion related test cases, pertaining to the DiMES and NSTX experiments, were used to show code applicability.  In Phase II, the code will be used to  treat liquid metal flows in closed channels with solid walls of general magnetic properties.  An induced magnetic field model will be added, and ferromagnetic features will be provided for solid wall treatment.  Fast Poisson solvers for pressure and potential will be added for solution speedup.  Fusion-relevant test cases (e.g., test modules in the ITER environment) will be used for demonstration.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The code has already shown potential for use in studying free surface and closed channel concepts in nuclear fusion.  Beyond its importance for fusion reactor design, other potential applications include MHD enhanced steel and aluminum processing in the metallurgical community, and conjugate heat transfer in the aerospace industry.",

However, current materials have limited life at the high temperature (500\u00bfF) and the corrosive environment of turbine engine operation.  This project will develop a new class of nano-materials to meet such needs.  The materials not only will have ceramic-like properties (high hardness, wear and corrosion resistance) but also will display the ductility and fracture toughness of metals.  This unique combination of properties will be accomplished by the homogenous nano-ceramic dispersion into a metal matrix, followed by compaction, and low temperature sintering.  Phase I developed techniques for processing this new class of material, nano- ceramic strengthened metal matrix, via a powder processing route.  In particular, a new material, nickel matrix strengthened by nano Ni3Si particles, was synthesized.  The material exhibited high hardness, low friction, and good corrosion resistance.  Phase II will:  (1) develop and optimize the nano-ceramic/metal matrix systems for a bearing application; (2) design and fabricate prototype bearings with the new material; and (3) test the bearing.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The new material systems should find a variety of applications: (1) in turbine engines for the power generation and transport industry; (2) in the chemical industry where robust mechanical components with wear and corrosion resistance are required; and (3) in electronic and other industries that require materials with advanced properties.",

The Global Learning Systems (GLS) product fills a gap in elementary school wheel safety education by providing a relatively low cost, rigorously field-tested, comprehensive and \nsimulated program--a safe and fun place-- for learning and practice to occur, thereby increasing chances of learning new skills and information about the activities enjoyed by 8-10 years olds while decreasing the potential health risks, time and money spen\nt in hospital emergency rooms. Owing to the success of Phase I, GLS will expand upon the interactive, scenario-based, simulative, multimedia-rich prototype CD-ROM prevention strategy it designed, developed and evaluated in Phase I and expand it to a blende\nd solution to include, CD-RQM, the Web and print materials for in-class learning and family involvement. The field test design will be a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design with two post-tests---the second post-test will be administered three months\n after the first. The testing will include two sets of schools, matched by cultural and socio-economic characteristics. Half of the students, or two schools, will be randomly assigned to either the GLS blended solution or to a more conventional (print-base\nd materials) recreational wheel safety program. The program's feasibility will be based on relevant measures of participant knowledge of the content, changes in behavior and attitudes, and self-efficacy. Based upon the outcomes of the Phase II evaluation t\nhe product will be revised for marketing to elementary schools, other educational and/or safety organizations targeting eight to 10 year olds and home computer consumers.",

        "abstract": "72354-Geologic sequestration of CO2 is a promising control technology for greenhouse gases.  However, applied on a wide scale, it will generate thousands of large CO2 deposits in the U.S., which could provoke environmental concern about CO2 \u00bfwaste disposal\u00bf and jeopardize ambitious geologic sequestration R&D efforts.  This concern could possibly be resolved by using methanogenic bacteria, which are known to naturally convert CO2 into CH4.  As an additional benefit, new, readily exploitable natural gas deposits would be create in the process.  This project will identify the most promising methanogen consortia and experimentally determine their growth capabilities and requirements under typical reservoir conditions.  Phase I identified the six most promising methanogen consortia, the mechanisms by which they convert CO2 into CH4, and the general physico-chemical conditions needed to sustain this conversion.  Oil and gas reservoirs in the U.S. were screend to define reservoir properties relevant to methanogen growth and identify potential sites for Phase II laboratory and field experiments.  In Phase II, laboratory experiments will be conducted to incubate and optimize the growth of the selected methanogen species under varying physico-chemical conditions that reflect actual reservoir conditions at the St. Johns test site (a CO2 field  in Arizona/New Mexico operated by an industry partner), as well as other potential CO2 test sites.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The successful application of naturally occurring methanogens to remediate CO2 sequestration sites would head off environmental objections to sequestration as waste disposal and open up this greenhouse-gas-reduction technology to widespread application by the power generation, chemical, petroleum, and other industries.  The technology also could generate new natural gas resources and even could allow the conversion of sub-economic (high-CO2) natural gas deposits into pure and economical methane deposits.",

        "abstract": "72393-Defense against terrorist attacks by radiation dispersion devices or thermonuclear weapons requires widely distributed radiation sensors throughout vulnerable population centers.  The sensors must rapidly and reliably communicate detections to relevant authorities for an effective threat response.  Real-time response networks must provide not only early pre-event threat detection, but also, in worst case scenarios, post-event detection to facilitate emergency management.  This project will develop a novel wireless sensor network based on Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology.  The self-forming and self-healing ad-hoc network will relay data between neighboring sensors to provide links to local communications infrastructure.  Wireless transceivers in the network will provide low probability of detection, strong multi-path fading resistance, low power consumption, and accurate location awareness by using UWB waveforms.  In Phase I, a National Sensor Network (NSN) was analyzed to determine the requirements of the wireless sensor network.  Based on these network requirements, the feasibility of an extended range UWB transceiver, which achieves the required data rate and range, was demonstrated via modeling and laboratory measurements.  In Phase II, prototypes of the UWB transceiver will be built and commercial transceiver development will be initiated.  A prototype NSN system will also be developed that includes the UWB transceivers, radiation sensors, ad-hoc wireless networking, and multiple communication links to threat response monitoring applications.  Performance of the prototype NSN system will be verified in realistic deployment environments.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  This distributed sensor approach would be a paradigm shift from previous approaches which utilize small quantities of expensive, fixed sensors.  A widely distributed solution enables defense across cities and high-profile locations such as airports, train stations, malls, and stadiums.  In addition, the approach would not be limited to radiation detection alone.  The network provides a data link for nearly any sensor type (i.e., temperature, chemical, biological), and applications in agriculture, industrial, and environmental monitoring would be feasible.  These applications also would benefit from the improvements in security, performance in harsh radio environments, location awareness, and battery life attained by using Ultra-Wideband wireless technology.",

This project will develop a new class of neutron detectors that employ the gaseous electron multiplier (GEM).  These detectors not only will have significantly better position and time resolution than current instruments, they also will be easier to build.  In Phase I, a 10 cm x 10 cm, three-element prototype GEM neutron detector was fabricated and tested at a pulsed neutron source, in order to evaluate its efficiency, gamma sensitivity, and position and time resolution.  Computational tools were developed to evaluate the secondary electron production of candidate neutron converter geometries.  These accomplishments have led to changes in the fundamental geometry of the device.  Phase II  will develop single-module, double-sided GEM detectors with neutron converters fabricated as CsI-Gd-Kapton-Gd-CsI sandwiches. The design will improve detector efficiency while retaining the time-of-flight and position resolution advantages of the GEM.  The device will be optimized by iterative fabrication and testing cycles using reactor- and spallation-source neutrons and offered as a stand-alone detector product.  In addition, multiple double-sided GEM detector modules will be combined as a means of substantially improving the neutron detection efficiency.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The GEM neutron detector should find a market at neutron bean research installations worldwide.  The device appears to be particularly well suited to the most demanding of detector applications at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  In addition, the device could be re-configured for other sources, say x-rays, by changing the central neutron-electron conversion element to a radiation-electron converter optimized for x-rays.  Because these devices could be made economically in large sizes, it also is likely that they would find use in Homeland Security applications as efficient, large area radiation detectors.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop the Liquid Phase Epitaxy (LPE) of potassium  tantalum niobate (KTN) on a cubic perovskite substrate. In this manner both components of the  film/substrate composite may be optimized for device performance. KTN has almost two orders  of magnitude higher electrooptic coefficients than current generation lithium niobate waveguides,  which would permit shorter path lengths, lower bias voltages or some combination of the two. The new, low dielectric constant substrate material developed in Phase I will enable better  matching of the effective microwave dielectric constant to the optical dielectric constant of the  film material and achieve lower bias fields. In Phase II, the researchers will develop the new  substrate material to commercial quality and size. LPE of KTN will be developed from a new  innovative flux system that allows excellent control of growth and superior film properties. Both  film and substrate will be fully characterized and optimized as a composite. The process and  product will be scaled up to full commercial size. IPI will interact with strategic partner device  manufacturers to optimize the material and realize device applications. \n\nElectrooptic devices are used in any photonics application where an electrical signal can be used  to change the state of a beam of light. While the best-known applications for electrooptic devices  are in telecommunications, customers can be found wherever light is used to move information  including optical computing, analog and digital signal processing, information processing and  sensing. Devices include phase and amplitude modulators, Q-switches, multiplexers, switch  arrays, couplers, polarization controllers, deflectors, correlators, sensors, potential transformers  and optical parametric oscillators. Potential customers are noticeably found in both the electric  power industry and the military. Initial applications in sensors will have an immediate potential  for impact in reliability of electric power distribution through failure anticipation and prevention  and conservation of electric power through monitoring and control. The proposed work will  enable electrooptic modulators, switches and innovative new photonic device applications with  lower costs, smaller footprints and lower power budgets. All this contributes to improvements of  the infrastructure of the Internet and more rapid, lower cost deployment, especially in the local  loop.",

We propose to apply the latest development in classification theory known as Support Vector Machines (SVM) to improve the accuracy of classifiers. SVM has many attractive advantages. Recent applications include automatic target recognition, breast cancer prognosis, particle identification in high energy physics, etc. Another is to use a robust fusion algorithm called Dempster-Shafer theory to fuse the decisions from different classifiers so that the overall classification performance can be further improved. During Phase II we will further refine our techniques and take on more challenging problems in chemical vapor concentration estimation and mixture component estimation. We will build a real-time version of our classifier for the e-nose application. We will also work with Boeing engineers to prototype a solenoid valve health monitoring system.

There is a need to develop highly stable cathode materials that have low work function, can be nondestructively coated over large areas as flexible thin films on the organic emitting materials, and possess hermetic sealing properties to promote long device life.  This project will develop a new class of cathode materials that have low work function and are highly stable.

The battery design projects power at 2-4kW/kg and power density at 7.5kW/liter similar to an ultracapacitor, with 20 times greater specific energy at 100- 120Wh/kg .\n\nThe rolled-ribbon design is a technology that enables US producers to compete by lowering the materials requirement, packaging and  safeguard costs of a large high-power battery. It fulfills the need for high power at low cost. In addition, this disc-shaped design exhibits excellent passive thermal management with inherent safety.

The helium-based Ion Mobility Spectrometer previously developed for NASA by the key personnel making this proposal provides the universal response and ppb sensitivity required. However, the minimal resources available onboard for missions to planets and small bodies such as comets, asteroids, and moons, mandate that the instruments provide maximum analytical capabilities with minimal requirements of volume, weight, and consumables. Therefore, further miniaturization and development of the IMS is required. For Phase II it is proposed that a miniaturized IMS prototype be designed, built, and evaluated as the platform for a space-capable instrument. This instrument will incorporate a number of novel features that advance the current technology. The modifications and improvements to the former design will provide the required analytical and space-flight capabilities to serve as the basis for a miniature space-capable instrument. Phase II will also entail the evaluation of the Mini-Cell IMS in conjunction with MEMS GC and the further miniaturization and production engineering of delivered instrumentation.

The innovation uses scaleable (square meters), self-organizing, and inexpensive electrochemical processing with low cost materials to engineer antenna/diode systems to convert light from heat sources.  IR-AAID can convert heat to electricity at over 40 percent efficiency and be adapted to different emitters simply by changing the antenna geometry.  The best IR thermo-photovoltaic modules typically operate at less than 5 percent efficiency, cost more than $300 per Watt, require up to 2000 degree Kelvin emitter temperatures to match available bandgaps, and require expensive materials with chemically tailored compositions, that are temperature sensitive, to match specific energy applications. In Phase I, the team demonstrated the feasibility of forming nanometer scale IR collecting antenna/diode structures over large areas, developed unique measurements to independently evaluate antenna and diode performance, demonstrated materials and diode structures that will provide the required IRAAID performance, generated DC power from light with IR-AAID devices, and demonstrated 6 percent conversion efficiency with non-optimized diodes. For Phase II, the team will develop robust processing to form inexpensive (less than $2 per Watt), IR-AAID prototypes to efficiently convert light to DC power.\n\nCommercially, since IR-AAID does not require prohibitively expensive advanced lithography or direct serial nano-patterning, this effort will produce low-cost nanowire arrays with high density over relatively large areas, for heat collection. These applications will vary from portable power packs that use low temperature heat, to the generation of electricity from high temperature nuclear and conventional heat sources where noise or other environmental concerns are an issue. The enabling IR-AAID features are ideally suited for heat recovery applications, a $100B resource that is virtually untapped at present due to the limitations and costs of existing technology.",

Currently available UV excimer sources have limitations such as poor spatial coherence, making them unsuitable for metrology. Therefore, the most promising route to generate fully-spatially-coherent VUV sources is to up convert light from the visible-infrared region of the spectrum, where coherent laser sources already exist.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase II Project proposes to develop a new approach for controlling disease in the aquaculture industry. This approach is based on the use of a recently discovered natural antibiotic compound in hybrid striped bass (HSB) called bass-hepcidin.  Hepcidin is an antimicrobial peptide (i.e. bactericidal molecules) that is part of the fish's innate immune system. Prior  Phase I work has demonstrated that HSB (and probably many finfish) respond to disease challenges by increasing their hepcidin levels.  This finding is useful because elevated hepcidin levels indicate that fish are being challenged by disease, and artificially increasing hepcidin levels (by feed additives or other means) may stimulate the fish's immune response to assist in combating disease.  This Phase II project will develop an ELISA diagnostic test for hepcidin and conduct follow-on clinical studies with several important aquaculture species.  If successful, this research may result in the development of two types of hepcidin-based products that will be of immense value to aquaculturists: 1) hepcidin test strips that provide an instant positive-negative indication of the presence of disease processes, analogous to pregnancy test kits, and 2) feed additives that stimulate the production of hepcidin in finfish, to be used to control disease outbreaks. \n \nThe commercial impact of this project will be significant as there is clearly a market need for products to control infectious diseases in fish that cause tremendous economic loss, of the order of $ 3 billion, each year.",

Currently used methods typically involve melting and solidification, which can cause high residual stresses, undesirable phases, and other problems. To solve the problems described a new method for spray forming is being used. This method is based on using the cold spray process avoiding undesired material, chemistry, and phase properties associated with thermal spray-forming methods.

The anticipated result of this activity is to deliver a technology yielding superior material properties of sprayed material and reduce cost of manufacturing.\n\nThe broader impacts of cold spraying near net-shapes technology could be very important technology for aerospace, including aircraft, military aircraft and spacecraft.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project involves the development of a robust, field-portable gas analyzer capable of determining the carbon isotope ratio of carbon dioxide emitting from deep-sea hydrothermal vents.  These vents provide access to water that has been trapped under the ocean in a unique, anaerobic environment that is devoid of photosynthesis and emulates the conditions believed to exist under the ice crusts of Europa and Callisto, beneath the surface of Mars, and on primordial Earth. Preliminary carbon isotope studies suggest that biological activity takes place in such an environment and novel instrumentation is sought to provide further evidence.  The Phase II analyzer, based upon our proprietary Off-Axis ICOS technology, will determine the isotope ratio in-situ to within 1 angstrom, which is sufficient to discriminate between biogenic and geological carbon sources, and may provide evidence for a Subsurface Lithotrophic Microbiological Ecosystem (SLiME).  The proposed instrument, which will interface with the Medusa seafloor sampling system developed by NASA Ames, will operate autonomously and be able to withstand the harsh underwater conditions found near deep-sea vents. The Phase II work will involve scientific development to enhance the prototype's specificity, deep-sea packaging to permit underwater deployment, and testing to demonstrate the analyzer's capabilities. \n     One of the most promising markets for our novel Off-Axis ICOS technology is in industrial process control (IPC). The Phase II instrument can be directly converted to an IPC analyzer due to its ability to autonomously operate in harsh environments, integration of compact control system, and use of sophisticated chemometric algorithms.  Within the $1.67B IPC market, the targeted markets will be those in which current technology is either too expensive or insufficient, such as the niche in the fast analysis of acetylene contamination in ethylene.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project will develop technology for prevention of nozzle wear in abrasive water jets, which limits the lifetime and accuracy of jet cutting, and currently requires entrainment of abrasives downstream of the nozzle in a larger mixing tube. The method consists of a porous nozzle surrounded by a reservoir containing high viscosity lubricant pressurized by the same pump that drives the slurry in the nozzle. The lubricant is forced through the porous walls by the pressure difference generated due to the high-speed slurry flow, and creates a thin film, which protects the nozzles' interior walls. Pilot tests have successfully reduced the nozzle wear by more than an order of magnitude. Two systems are being developed: A Porous Lubricated Mixing Tube (PLMT) that can be retrofitted into existing commercial systems, and a Porous Lubricated Abrasive Suspension Jet (PLAS-Jet) with premixed particles prior to injection. The latter enables operation at lower pressures, and cutting of harder materials with smaller jets (micro-machining). Extensive cutting and nozzle wear tests during Phase II will optimize the nozzle material, geometry and manufacturing procedures, and will determine the lubricant properties and Injection rate. Other components will also be improved including the particle and lubricant feed systems. The broader impact (commercial potential) of the Proposed technology will be abrasive water jets that can be utilized for cutting and machining of sheet metal, ceramics and composites by diverse users, ranging from small machine shops to the automotive and aircraft industries. Wear of the mixing tube in present systems adversely affects all the applications of jet cutting by limiting the lifetime of the nozzle and accuracy of the cut, by causing machine-down time, and by preventing commercial applications of micro-jets. A PLMT retrofitted with minimal investment into the thousands of abrasive jet systems already in the market will greatly reduce these adverse effects. The PLAS-Jet with premixed particles has several additional advantages that reduce the cost and extend the applications of jet cutting technology. Cost reduction results from the lower pressure required for achieving the same cutting effect (e.g. 10000 vs. 50000 PSI), the more efficient use of the abrasives, and the less frequent replacement of nozzles. The lower pressures also simplify the development of compact portable systems for remote applications in hazardous environments, such as during decommissioning of nuclear plants, and for military applications, e.g. removal of mines and other obstacles. Furthermore, unlike mixing tubes, the PLAS-Jet diameter can be reduced to levels enabling expansion of jet cutting to precision micromachining.",

Ignition and other inertial confinement fusion experiments require thin, shaped membranes for target components.  In most target concepts, the spherical fuel capsule is suspended in the middle of a cylindrical shell or hohlraum.  The capsule must be accurately located within a few microns by the capsule support:  two ultra-thin membranes that must possess high strength, high radiation resistance, and good cryogenic properties.  While polyimide can meet all of the performance requirements, no methods are currently available for producing the complex shapes needed for these applications.  This project will develop technology for forming polyimide films, 0.03-5.0 microns thick, into shapes needed for ignition targets and for a variety of inertial confinement fusion and inertial fusion energy applications.  During Phase I, high-strength polyimide films were successfully formed into the hemispherical and conical shapes required for capsule supports for ignition and heavy ion fusion targets.  Two processes, ultrathin pressure-forming and pressure-forming with reflow above the glass transition temperature, emerged as viable processes for achieving e a variety of forms in polyimide membranes.  Complementary measurement techniques were developed to provide a predictive capability for determining the formed film thickness and strength.  Phase II will extend the forming process in two ways: (1) to thinner films to optimize the capsule supports needed for ignition; and (2) to accommodate more shapes needed for other fusion science and energy applications.  Formed membranes will be optimized for enhanced performance, and the precision assembly of ignition targets that incorporate the new capsule supports will be demonstrated.

By far, the most important method of making ammonia is the Haber-Bosch system, which accounts for over 90% of the world\u00bfs ammonia production.  However, this process suffers from low product yield and requires synthesis at high temperatures and pressures.  An efficient, low-cost method for ammonia production could significantly reduce energy consumption while reducing the cost of ammonia-based products, including fertilizers and polymers.  This project will use ambient temperature molten salts to reduce the operating temperature of a previously developed electrochemical method for the synthesis of ammonia.  Phase I tested and evaluated numerous low-temperature molten salts for use in an ambient temperature and pressure system for electrochemical ammonia synthesis.  Molten salts that possessed favorable characteristics including stability and conductvity were further tested in an electrochemical ammonia production system.  Feasibility of the proposed research was successfully demonstated by synthesis of ammonia in this system.

This technology is based on the integration of highly-specific immunodiagnostics with ultra-sensitive electrochemical sensors in a multiplexed microfluidic format that allows the measurement of up to three proteins, two viruses and two bacteria simultaneously . The biosensor is expected to have low detection limits (that is, of less than 0.5 ng/ml for proteins, 1000 PFU/ml for viruses and 700 CFU/ml for bacteria), with an overall assay time of less than 30 minutes. This system will be tested for detection of potential biological threat agents such as Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (protein/toxin), Influenza (virus) and Bacillus anthracis (bacteria). The commercial application of this project will be in the areas of homeland security, clinical diagnostics, food quality control and general environmental monitoring.",

        "abstract": "73207-There is a need to predict the behavior of fluid systems in the extremely demanding conditions of very high heat and neutron fluxes, magnetohydrodynamic forces, and complex geometries found in fusion facilities.  Reliable simulations of this nature would reduce development time and costs, and allow rapid, cost-effective assessment of design concepts.  This project will develop a highly parallel code based on lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods to simulate the behaviour of fluid systems in fusion applications, with emphasis on high heat fluxes, free-surface flows, magnetohydrodynamic effects, complex geometries, and impurity chemistry.  In Phase I, a fully three-dimensional lattice Boltzmann code was written and used to test the performance of the LB methodology and investigate critical modelling issues for fusion applications.  These issues included multicomponent flows and free surfaces, flow over complex boundaries, heat and impurity transport, and turbulence.  In Phase II, the lattice Boltzmann code will be enhanced to include magnetohydrodynamic effects, surface and volumetric chemical reactions, and pre- and post-processing packages.  Emphasis will be put on parallelisation, so the code can be used on distributed computing systems for large-scale fluid dynamic simulations of fusion problems.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  In addition to the fusion application, the LB code should have applicability in numerous sectors where the flow of complex fluids plays an important role.  These sectors include the oil industry, chemical process plants, and thermal management systems (e.g., for electronics cooling).  Advantages of the lattice Boltzmann method over more conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches are that it is very easy to parallelise, execution speed scales almost linearly with the number of processors used, and complex geometries can be handled easily.  This makes lattice Boltzmann methods key contendors for next generation codes for the rapidly growing (8-10% per year) CFD market, currently estimated to be $2 billion/year.",

The development would provide a meso-scale resolution geomagnetic storm data.

Such filters are applicable in high-resolution spectroscopy, tunable lasers, and multi-spectral and hyperspectral imaging. During Phase I, we performed a feasibility study of an innovative ultra-narrow bandpass filter based on unique features of a photonic crystal interferometer (PCI), and did a meticulous and extensive analysis and modeling of its characteristics. We then assembled and tested a PCI breadboard and demonstrated its tunability over a 1 nm spectral range with a bandpass close to 0.02 nm and an acceptance angle close to 1o. The acquired data demonstrated conclusively that an approach based on the PCI concept provides an optimal solution for designing and constructing an ultra-narrow tunable optical bandpass filter. During Phase II we will design, build, deliver to NASA, and perform field testing of a compact and robust prototype module of a 1? diameter PCI filter with a tunability range of 1 nm and a bandpass range of 0.01 nm at 50% transmittance range. The Phase II design should allow for retrofitting the PCI to existing instruments and provide a stable performance in harsh operating environments.",

        "abstract": "Investigation into fatigue damage precursors over the last decade has demonstrated that surface-evident defects such as cracks and slipbands evolve in a regular manner, which corresponds to the development of fatigue damage. Through examination of the evolution of such damage precursors in a component, this regularity can facilitate prediction of the component?s remaining fatigue life. The proposed Phase 2 work is to develop and characterize a sensor for in-situ examination and historical tracking of the precursor defects and to construct the analytical framework for using that data to predict the onset of catastrophic failure. Since a major application of this technology is for monitoring fatigue damage in aircraft components, the proposed system will be compact, durable, and relatively inexpensive. The Phase I results have confirmed models of precursor evolution on surfaces; and testing of several prototype surface inspection devices has shown that the technology is compatible with the restrictions on light sources, beam scanners, detection systems, and communication interfaces which this application demands. Design analysis and preliminary designs have also been completed for the in-situ sensor modules as well as their supporting communications and control systems, so that this technology is now ready to enter Phase II development.",

        "abstract": "The Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) concept envisions a dramatic change in demand on National Airspace System (NAS) resources: a significantly increased number of flights operating as needed on Point-to-Point (PTP) routes with smaller aircraft. In addition to the increased demand on the NAS, the dynamic, ?on-demand?, nature of the SATS concept will present even greater challenges to the country?s Traffic Flow Management (TFM) system. The NAS regulates the flow of aircraft through TFM initiatives. However, the current TFM system does not perform well under uncertain demand patterns. The innovation proposed herein creates a website marketplace for providers and consumers of SATS services. More importantly, our innovation links the information from this SATS website to the Nation?s TFM system. Critical information regarding projected demand can be provided to the TFM system to allow the necessary management of the NAS. Advanced portions of this concept include interactivity between the SATS website and the TFM system to notify consumers of small aircraft transportation services regarding projected delays due to congestion along their requested route of flight at their requested flight time. In phase II of this effort, a human-in-the-loop simulation will be conducted using a prototype system to evaluate the concept.",

Current methods are laborious, inefficient and depend on the skill of the technician. Micro channel embryo culture enables automated high throughput processing because the embryo is not moved, but rather held in a \"parking place.\" This allows the fluid to be exchanged via automated systems rather than attempting to automate embryo manipulation. We propose to develop an automated micro channel embryo culture system to allow rapid optimization of micro channel culture conditions. The system utilizes commercially available automated liquid handling equipment combined with a custom incubation chamber and a digital visualization system. Specific advantages of the proposed automated micro channel culture system (AMCS) include the use of micro channel culture devices (Vitae Cell TM) which facilitates automated processing and allows one to achieve gentle medium changes, a closed system that eliminates perturbations in gas concentrations and temperature, robotically controlled medium changes and visualization eliminating operator variability. The system will initially be used to optimize bovine embryo culture. We propose to investigate parameters such as medium (single vs. sequential), medium replenishment (by flow), gas atmosphere, embryo-to-volume ratio, and medium supplementation in the micro channel system compared to the standard micro-drop.",

The work will involve the design and construction of a pilot-scale on-line metalloid recovery (OMR) system that will be tested at bench scale on simulated synthesis gas, and on slipstreams from small-scale gasifiers. Phase II work will determine the effects of particulate matter and pressurized systems on the ability to concentrate and remove the valuable element from the gas stream. The on-line recovery of deposits rich in a valuable element will have two distinct commercial benefits. The first benefit is the cost savings associated with eliminating down time required for cleaning. By eliminating one cleaning outage, a gasification plant could save $4.9 million. The second benefit is the creation of an additional revenue stream from the recovery of these deposits, which can be sold to a recycler.",

In this project, we have demonstrated the feasibility of developing a state-of-the-art autonomous cooling module that could be used in a network for thermal management of discrete and distributed electronics. The cooling module takes advantage of liquid cooling, pumped with a highly efficient built-in micropump integrated within the cooling module, to deliver more than 100 W/cm^2 of cooling. The two critical components, the heat sink and the liquid transport pump, were tested, integrated in a single package and independently for phase I feasibility demonstrations. For Phase II, MicroET is teaming with the University of Washington and Technology Assessment and Transfer (TA&T) to develop and demonstrate a breadboard prototype during the first year followed by a brassboard prototype made of a ceramic monolith structure during year 2 of the project.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II program focuses on developing carbon nanotube-based electromechanical pressure sensors. To translate the change in pressure into an electrical signal, current solutions (MEMS devices) use membranes with sensors made out of doped silicon. Silicon, however, is prone to effects of temperature changes and as a result, such devices require additional electronics for temperature compensation and more stringent packaging. They also have sensitivity limitations. The device in this work will use carbon nanotubes as strain gauges. Because nanotubes have higher sensitivity (higher gauge factor) and better temperature stability, this will result in development of devices that are easier to manufacture (fewer manufacturing steps), have superior precision, and require less stringent packaging, leading to less expensive end-product. This work will combine chemistry for synthesis of materials and microfabrication to explore important properties of a novel nano-material carbon nanotubes. Key technical innovations will include precise placement of nanotubes on thin membranes, novel approaches to avoiding membrane damage during nanotube integration, forming nanotube circuits on membranes for electromechanical pressure sensors and other integration issues. If successful, the project will lead to the first application of carbon nanotubes in high-end electronic devices, enabling the development of nano-electromechanical systems\n(NEMS), which convert mechanical effects into electrical signal. Such devices, which would include pressure sensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes and acoustic sensors, could address the unmet needs in a wide range of applications, such as in automobiles, safety, medical, military and process control. Specifically, in the automobile market, a nanotube-based pressure sensor could serve as a tire pressure measuring device and could result in over $180million in annual savings for such end users as the automotive industry.",

This project will develop novel moldable ceramic insulators for use in accelerator and fusion magnets as end pieces, pole pieces, winding mandrels, spacers, and other components.  Their electrical and mechanical strengths will be high, and their thermal properties will be tailored to meet the magnet specifications for niobium tin, niobium titanium, or even high temperature superconductor magnets.  These ceramic insulators will withstand the high temperature heat treatments and will be radiation resistant.  In Phase I, cast ceramic insulators were fabricated.  It was shown that the shape and machining of the parts could be controlled to produce high quality components, and that the cryogenic thermal expansion could be tailored over a wide range.  In Phase II, improved molding techniques will be developed using traditional molds and low-cost rapid prototyping techniques.  Mechanical, thermal, and electrical performance will be measured at both room and cryogenic temperatures.  Manufacturing and quality control methods will be developed.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The ceramic insulators should be more robust and reliable than current materials used in high field accelerator and fusion magnet systems.

        "abstract": "72180-Future energy-frontier accelerators depend on the development of robust and affordable techniques to quickly reduce the size of a muon beam.  Although schemes exist to reduce horizontal and vertical muon beam dimensions, no satisfactory solution exists to quickly shrink the beam bunch length or momentum spread, as required for a Muon Collider or as would be cost-effective for a Neutrino Factory.  Recent observations have shown that, in a continuous gaseous absorber, the increased path length from increased momentum could be used to create the needed energy loss to reduce energy spread and achieve six-dimensional cooling.  This project will exploit this concept by developing a linear channel of gas-filled, high-gradient radio frequency (RF) cavities in superimposed solenoidal and helical multipole magnetic fields, for cooling in all six dimensions.  Phase I extended and developed the analytical treatment for two independent Monte Carlo programs to simulate the proposed helical cooling channels.  Comparisons of the two simulation programs with each other and with analytical predictions demonstrated six-dimensional cooling with pressurized RF cavities in a helical channel for the first time.  Phase II will develop integrated, six-dimensional helical beam-cooling channel designs using the analytical and simulation programs developed in Phase I.  Conceptual designs of muon beam lines, incorporating helical cooling channels with realistic RF cavities and superconducting magnetic coils, will be developed for use in neutrino factories and muon colliders. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The use of a continuous gaseous absorber to cool muons in a helical channel with pressurized high-gradient RF cavities would advance accelerator science.  The high RF gradient allows the the six-dimensional cooling channel to be compact and efficient, with no space unoccupied by RF.

A very large fleet of patrol vehicles operated by the law enforcement community that record events involving contact with civilians collects MVR data daily. Due to staggering costs associated with operating current analog, non-indexing system, there is an overwhelming needs for a computerized digital MVR technology. However, its deployment is hindered by legal acceptance, because digital medium can be easily altered. Authentication plays a critical enabling role by providing an effective means to safeguard the integrity of MVR content. To capitalize upon this emerging trend of digital MVR, the company proposes as a commercialization strategy to market the innovative technology in a package in an authenticated acquisition system, consisting of a digital video camera and a software suite for on-the-fly video watermarking, off-line MPEG compression and watermark verification. This compact and low-cost acquisition system leverages on existing in-car laptop for processing and storage, and is specifically designed to meet stringent operational requirements set forth by next generation MVR system. It integrates seamlessly with existing IT infrastructure and computerized MVR management systems. \n\nMVR has provided an effective way of protecting law enforcement agencies, their officers and the public they serve. The MVR authentication provides an enabling technology for the acceptance and deployment of cost-saving computerized MVR technology for the law enforcement community nationwide. It allows for safe elimination of the labor-intensive process associated with safeguarding the integrity of MVR content, because watermarking is done on the fly and there is no time window at which MVR data are ever unprotected. With the deployment of digital MVR system equipped with watermark authentication technology, the costs associated with operating the system will be greatly reduced allowing for the savings to be redeployed to other law enforcement endeavors. Within the next three years a comprehensive national digital facial database will be created to support Homeland Security. As an integral component of the in-car laptop, this technology will serve as the front line in capturing the data for submission to the national database.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project develops a temperature-adaptive nanoparticles-based solid lubricant coating (ZnO  and MoS2 and their metastable forms) on textured cBN/TiN for hard turning and dry machining applications. The uniquely coated tool inserts are able to constantly release the lubricants out of reservoirs on the textured cBN/TiN surface.  Currently  available solid  lubricant  coatings  do  not  offer  temperature-adaptive  properties  and  are  NOT suitable  for hard turning applications.  Hard turning can offer manufacturers large cost savings compared to grinding.    However, the  achievable  surface  finish  is  critical.  The  preliminary  results indicate that the proposed solid lubricant coating will enhance hard turning surface finish and provide  greater consistency.   In addition, both  environmental and competitive cost issues are causing  manufacturers  to  migrate  toward  dry  machining.    Solid  lubricant  coatings  can  both improve  surface  finish  and  extend  the  tool  life  in  dry machining  applications  by  lowering  the friction  at  the  interface  between  the  tool  and  the  workpiece.    Commercially  available  solid lubricants  are  primarily  configured  in  layered  structures.    As  wear  progresses,  the  lubrication layer wears away and leaves the hard layer behind.  Thus, the proposed novel configuration that provides temperature  adaptability while also offering continuous long lasting lubrication has great potential. \n \nThe proposed research is an excellent example of adding value to industrial products  from the investment in nano science and engineering. The project will provide improved understanding of how the tribo-chemistry  of nanoparticle coatings  can offer temperature adaptive properties and affect machining performance.  Also, it will provide insights regarding the micro tribology along \nthe boundary of the particles and binder(s). The  primary application of the coating will be for cutting  tools  in  hard  turning  and  dry  machining.    These  are  very  important  and  growing commercial markets.  Additional markets could be for rotating machinery, dies and molds, and other wear parts. The  successful development of the proposed coating  will help reduce environmental waste and contaminants from the usage of coolants.  The disposal of both the used cutting fluid and the contaminated metal chips that were removed during the cutting process is becoming  harder  and  more  costly.    The  cost  of  the  coolant  has  been  widely  estimated  as contributing  over 15%  of  a  typical  part.s machining  costs.

Polymer electrolyte/proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell systems represent an environmentally friendly power source for a wide range of applications \u00bf transportation, stationary power generation, and consumer electronics.  This project will develop and commercialize ion-conducting thermally stable polymers for use as high-temperature, proton-exchange-membrane/membrane-electrode-assembly (PEM/MEA) materials with low methanol permeability as components of DMFC.  In Phase I, sulfonated ion-conducting sites were introduced via direct polymerization, allowing control of both their location and concentration.  The research showed not only that the materials could be synthesized, but also that they exceed the conductivity and methanol permeability performance of perfluorinated sulfonic acid Nafion materials at or above room temperature.  Phase II will optimize the design and fabrication of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) using an inkjet deposition technique to control the location, thickness, and porosity of the electrode nanocomposites on to the proton exchange membrane.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  New low cost and high performance membrane materials would allow the PEM fuel cell concept to be extended to other applications where output stability may be a major concern:  e.g., portable remote power or regenerative fuel cells.  In addition, the technology could find use as part of a computing power system, where system downtime is unacceptable.",

The spaceport of the future may resemble, from an operational perspective, our current airports and seaports of today and will need to resolve many similar issues to these transportation hubs. These issues include (1) safe and secure spaceport operations, (2) efficient movement of machinery and people through the spaceport, and (3) cost-efficient, affordable, and timely spaceport operations. Discrete event simulation has been used to assess detailed processes at modern day seaports. Like seaports, spaceport operations are labor intensive and require extensive use of personnel and machinery. The ability to conduct seaport operations efficiently has been improved significantly through proper utilization of seaport assets. This foundation provides a solid footing from which research for efficient spaceport operations can be based. An object-oriented discrete event simulation system is proposed that will address spaceport operations in the context of aerospace safety, mobility, and efficiency. The simulation system will be built upon the Java programming language to provide for maximum portability and will utilize XML for standards-based data interchange. Development of the simulation model will provide the underlying basis for follow-on activities such as 2D and 3D animation and visualization capabilities. Technology transfer of lessons learned in the development of seaport simulation models will be utilized. The overall goal of the spaceport simulation model is to maximize throughput, operational safety, and resource utilization and minimize overall cost of operations.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and prototype a single-chip \nmagnetometer based on an innovative approach to digital magnetic sensors. The traditional approach combines a physical sensor having an analog output with an electronic analog-to-digital converter.  In this sensor, the analog-to-digital conversion occurs in the physical mechanism of the sensor itself.  With this approach only inexpensive digital electronic circuits are needed to complete the sensor system, resulting in a robust design that can easily be manufactured. The unique properties of sub-micron sized magneto-resistive sensor elements are used.  The small size of these elements allows only two magnetic states, i.e. the magnetic state represents a binary digit that is a function of the external magnetic fields.  Using concepts borrowed from over-sampling delta-sigma analog-to-digital converters, it is possible to measure the analog magnitude of a magnetic field by repeatedly interrogating the magnetic state of the bit.  Using the principles of delta-sigma converters, including noise shaping feedback and high over-sampling ratios, high resolution and an inherently linear response can be achieved. \n     This single-chip digital magnetometer would be a revolutionary advance in sensor technology since it is based on standard wafer-level integrated circuit processing techniques. It will thus be much smaller and cheaper to fabricate than existing equivalent magnetic sensor systems.  The highly integrated nature of this product, low power consumption and the digital output will make it extremely attractive for remote and/or bussed sensor applications. Applications include digital compasses, geomagnetic surveying equipment, vehicle sensors for traffic control, intrusion detection, currency/document validation and portable biomedical assay devices.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to fabricate a novel nanotechnology spin-dependent tunneling (SDT) magnetic field sensor device with increased signal-to-noise performance at low frequencies. The increased resolution at low frequencies is greatly desired in a large number of application markets. The proposed device is based on innovative methods of modulating the permeability of, and/or the flux through, integrated flux concentrators. These methods of \"flux gating\" (chopping or sweeping the magnetic field which is sensed by the SDT transducers) are employed using on-chip, microfabricated coil structures. The project explores the nature of frequency-dependent (or 1/f) noise that is intrinsic to SDT devices, and offers an integrated low-power method of noise reduction. SDT technology is at the leading edge of magnetoresistive transducer development due, in part, to the fact that its magnetoresistance can be more than 3 times that of the best giant magnetoresistive devices, and more than 15 times that of the anisotropic magnetoresistive sensors on the market today.\n\nThe devices for this Phase II is based on novel and proprietary concepts for the advancement of small, solid-state, low-cost, low-power magnetic field sensors.  The primary need is for high-resolution magnetic field sensors that are more fieldable and cost effective. SDT technology offers this high-resolution potential as well as the low-cost advantages of silicon fabrication methods used for SDT micro-sensors. Applications for these sensors include non-destructive testing, security and surveillance, and magnetic media validation. Each of these very diverse applications share a common need for the small, highly sensitive, low power magnetic field sensing devices being proposed. The new devices will enable each of these areas to expand into small portable applications and into areas where cost effective low-field sensing has not been possible.",

        "abstract": "72683-The commercialization of polymer electrolyte fuel cells is hindered not only by the high cost of platinum (Pt) electrocatalysts, but also because these catalysts have insufficient activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).  In a PEM fuel cell that uses state-of-the art cathode Pt catalysts, about 80 % of the overall cell losses is caused by the sluggish kinetics of the ORR, even at Pt loading as high as 4 mg/cm2.  Therefore, it is urgently important to develop novel electrocatalysts that are more active than Pt.  This project will develop high throughput combinatorial strategies and a mechanistic model to identify new catalyst compositions that will improve the ORR kinetics.  In Phase I, highly efficient and multi-function high throughput screening systems, coupled with advanced process robotics, were established.  Compared to the commercial pure Pt catalyst, a significant enhancement of electrocatalytic activity was achievd by alloying Pt and Co.  Phase II will concentrate on the combinatorial discovery of ternary alloy electrocatalysts of Pt and transition metals and the high throughput screening of synthesized catalysts. An order-of-magnitude improvement of catalytic activity will be demonstrated.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  A highly efficient oxygen reduction catalyst would be a huge boost to the commercialization of PEM fuel cells for a wide range of applications in transportation, portable power, communications and military markets.",

A much simpler alternative, known as active DLDS, would use a fast active switch to divert the one-quarter-width slices from the high-power pulse, without need for the klystron phase shifts.  This project willl develop a fast phase shifter that could be used as the active element in such a fast switch for active DLDS.  Using advanced ferroelectric material and structures already developed, Phase I simulations showed that low loss and reasonable electrical tunability can be achieved in a phase shifter capable of causing the switching of 500 MW peak power X-band pulses.  Advanced ferroelectric samples were prepared that showed an acceptable range of electrical permittivity, loss tangent, and electrical tunability.  Ring-shaped samples, similar in size to what is required for the phase shifter, were fabricated.  A preliminary design for the high-power device to be fabricated and tested in Phase II was devised, based on use of existing ferroelectric materials.  In Phase II, an engineering design for the phase shifter will be completed.  Ferroelectric rings with required dimensions and electrical properties will be fabricated for integration into the phase shifter structure.  High-power tests, to a peak power level of at least 50 MW, will be carried out in X-band test facilities at the Naval Research Laboratory.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  A fast switch for high-power microwaves should have many uses beyond that identified for powering accelerator sections for a future electron-positron collider.

As at centimeter wavelengths, radio frequency pulse compression is needed to produce the required high peak power pulses.  Therefore, this project will develop quasi-optical passive and active pulse compression structures.  A 34-GHz 40-MW magnicon will be made available to test components and determine breakdown and surface fatigue limits in millimeter-wave accelerator-relevant structures.  In Phase I, designs of three- and four-mirror quasi-optical resonators, along with passive and active diffraction gratings, were refined and successfully cold tested with low-power 34-GHz radiation.  A preliminary design of a high-power, high-vacuum version of a four-mirror millimeter-wave pulse compressor was carried out.  Phase II will refine the design of the four-mirror quasi-optical resonator, and high-vacuum tests will be carried out at input power levels up to 10 MW at 34 GHz, with both passive and active diffraction gratings, and using chirp frequency modulation during the input pulse.  Successful results would allow tests up to 40 MW, using combined outputs from all four arms of the 34-GHz magnicon.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The 34-GHz, high-power accelerator-relevant technology should allow for the implementation of an alternative upgrade for the Next Linear Collider to a center-of-mass energy of 1.5 TeV or higher.  This upgrade would create a market for several thousand quasi-optical millimeter-wave pulse compressors, with a potential sales volume of several million dollars.

A single whispering gallery mode, such as the rotating TM20,1,1 mode of a cylindrical barrel resonator, can function as a passive rf pulse compressor in much the same manner as SLED (SLAC energy doubler), with the two orthogonal modes that comprise the rotating mode serving as the two modes of SLED.  In Phase I, a single-resonator pulse X-band compressor was designed and cold tested at low RF power, showing peak power gain of up to 7.5:1 at an efficiency of about 80%.  Designs of single- and double-resonator compressors were developed to operate with either sudden 180 degree phase shift during the input RF pulse, or with a narrow frequency-modulated input pulse.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop high quality, inexpensive polymer-based (plastic) optical fiber imaging guides and other new and unique endoscopic devices through the use of innovative polymer processing techniques. Polymer imaging guides have several distinct advantages over their glass counterparts, including reduced cost, smaller bend radius, and increased ruggedness. Additional benefits include the ability to dope the polymer matrix with molecules that can be used as environmental probes, scintillating material, or indicators ; the ability to tailor the guide for highly specific applications, and the ability to impart diverse functionality into a single imaging guide. The Phase II project is expected to result in a truly disposable endoscope. \n\nThe commercial application of this project is in the area of biomedical devices and instrumentation. It is expected that the polymer imaging guide developed in this project will be used as a direct replacement for glass guides in all types of fiber optic endoscopes currently manufactured. The resulting benefits would be lower costs, less patient discomfort, higher reliability, earlier detection of abnormal conditions, and an increase in the number of procedures that could be performed with endoscopes in an outpatient setting.",

Of the sequestration approaches that have been proposed, the secure sequestration of CO2  in the natural ecosystem appears to be a very efficient way to offset CO2  emissions into the atmosphere in the coming decades.  Three stages of carbon dioxide management and sequestration have been proposed:  (1) CO2  capture from the flue gas of power plants \u00c2\u00bf by using ammonium solutions in a wet scrubber to react with CO2  to form ammonium bicarbonate fertilizer, (2) short term carbon storage through enhanced growth of biomass using the ammonium bicarbonate fertilizer, and (3) long term carbon storage by securely sequestering CO2  as carbonates in underground water systems.  This project will develop a test protocol for measuring the utilization of ammonium bicarbonate as a fertilizer, using an ecosystem containing soil, groundwater, biomass, and atmosphere with temperature, moisture, pH and composites control.  In Phase I, procedures for sample selection, sampling plan development, laboratory-scale experiment unit design, analytical method development, and test matrix selection were developed.  In Phase II, a greenhouse will be constructed and a series of experiments to study the carbon balance in a simulated ecosystem will be conducted.   Three typical crops, three typical soils, and three groundwaters will be used in the simulated ecosystem.  A model for carbon transformation from ammonium bicarbonate to the terrestrial ecosystem will be developed.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  Ultimately, the technology should encourage the electric power industry to inject aqueous ammonia into their flue gas to sequester CO2  as ammonium bicarbonate for a fertilizer use.  This should reduce CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants, which produce more than half of the nation's electricity.",

Segmented germanium detectors can provide better position and energy resolution than any other practical detector system.  Although no fundamental technical roadblocks should prevent the ultimate production of commercially viable instruments based on segmented germanium detectors, this project will address several detailed technical issues that still must be solved.  Phase I designed and fabricated a first generation, variable temperature detector system, which had 42 x 42 strips laid out on a 2-mm pitch.  All the hardware needed to key, fixture, and fabricate the detector were built.  A 13-mm thick 101-mm diameter high purity germanium wafer was obtained for the system.

A second generation detector system, using 120-mm diameter wafer, will be designed, fabricated, and evaluated.  The detector will be loaned to nuclear physicists for more extensive evaluation.

In response to this need, this project will develop a petroleum indicator that uses an electric relaxation sensor to monitor the drilling process in real time, allowing the operator to avoid blowouts and increasing safety, drilling efficiency, and environmental protection.  The oil drilling monitoring device, based on dielectric spectroscopy, will be capable of detecting drilling fluid composition and flow with 1 percent accuracy of the oil component in the drilling mud volume.  All the active elements will be robust, capable of withstanding the harsh environment encountered in the drilling process.  Phase I developed a proof-of-concept sensor and demonstrated the detection of five percent oil in drilling fluid volume.  Sensitivity measurements were limited by the available equipment; however, analysis indicated that sensitivities of 1 percent or better could easily be achieved.  In Phase II, a working prototype will be constructed that will be capable of detecting oil concentrations between 1 percent and 100 percent.  Tests will be conducted to demonstrate that the system can withstand the harsh drilling downhole environment, and that it can detect and discriminate oil, mud, gases, and various levels of salinity and other relevant minerals.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The proposed technology and its spin-off products should enhance \u00c2\u00bfsmart drilling\u00c2\u00bf capabilities in petroleum drilling process control and monitoring.  Other potential applications include chemical/biological process monitoring, waste management, biological engineering, explosive gas warning systems, environmental monitoring, homeland security, military (monitoring of underground facilities), and space (aeronautic) and ground (automotive) vehicle fluid sensors.",

POC proved the feasibility of the DEOS concept, and demonstrated sensitivity to an induced charge of 15 mV/nC, which not only meets but exceeds the NASA requirement. This sensitivity to charge enables DEOS, to remotely measure voltage with a sensitivity of 40 V per mV of output signal at a distance of 4 in., exceeding the sensitivity of commercially available sensors by a factor of 2.5. In Phase II, we will optimize the DEOS design and complete the development of DEOS, greatly advancing the accuracy and reliability of electrostatic charge and field measurements for many NASA applications. In the process, we will develop two key components: the photo-acoustic modulator (PAM), which will transform induced charge to alternating electric current; and the electro-optical converter (EOC) which will transform that electric current into an alternating optical signal. Phase II will culminate in testing, demonstration and delivery of a prototype.",

        "abstract": "New methods are needed to help marine scientists conduct studies of the processes limiting or promoting coral recruitment and survivorship.  The small size and low visual contrast of coral recruits in natural settings make them difficult to impossible to locate efficiently.  Many coral recruits contain strongly fluorescent pigments, and viewed in the proper way this fluorescence dramatically increases their contrast with their surroundings.  Our Phase I efforts, complemented by work being carried out by other researchers, have demonstrated that fluorescence can be an enabling technology for locating coral recruits both in-situ and in the laboratory, and on both natural substrates and artificial settlement tiles.  We propose to develop a suite of fluorescence-based tools and instruments that significantly expand on currently available technologies for locating, identifying, and documenting coral recruits.  This suite will include specialized light sources and observation and photography techniques that increase the contrast of the recruits with their surroundings, and magnification tools that aid in the identification of the very small targets that are found.

The RTP combines a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) with a processing unit on a single chip. This combination allows for compact electronics for space applications. A 32-bit processing unit, compliant with the SPARC Version 8 architecture, was chosen for implementation due to its high processing capability, compact area utilization, and the many readily available Real-Time Operating Systems and development software. The processor design is licensed to PicoDyne under the GNU LGPL license. The European Space Agency developed the LEON2 SPARC core, and made it available for space electronics developers. It was developed with System-on-Chip implementations in mind, with an expandable AMBA standard on-chip interface for use with on-chip peripherals. We have architected the RTP with an array of reconfigurable logic as the primary peripheral. It is connected to the processor bus, and may be directly configured by software for many applications. The reconfigurable logic may be used simply as decode logic for off-chip peripherals, saving board space, or as a co-processor for data filtering, data compression, or communications protocol encoding and decoding. In Phase II, the RTP will be completely configured and simulated, following an ASIC design flow, then implemented in a CMOS silicon chip. Using PicoDyne's proven Radiation Tolerant and Ultra-Low-Power design techniques and processes, this capable device will enable NASA programs to accomplish more with electronics with less power and reduced board area requirements, and may be enabling technology for missions such as NanoSats.",

There are more than 90 bee-pollinated crops in the U.S. alone, and by improving crop quality and yield, it is estimated that bees add $14.6 billion to crop value. Currently, there is a crisis that is challenging the success and sustainability of communities and economies that depend on bees to pollinate commercial crops: the worldwide infestation of honey bee colonies with the parasitic mite, Varroa destructor. Infestation can destroy a commercial operation in a matter of a few months, with devastating results for those who depend on bees to pollinate their crops. While pesticides are available, resistance to treatment is spreading rapidly. Pima Research Company has developed a novel formulation of soluble sulfur that was shown in Phase I research to effectively control Varroa in the laboratory. Sulfur has FDA GRAS status, and certain formulations are approved organic pesticides. Resistance is not known to develop.

The LGC produces balloon lift gas by catalytic reforming of methanol to generate hydrogen plus some carbon monoxide and/or carbon dioxide. Pioneer Astronautics prototyped and characterized an LGC system during Phase I. The LGC was demonstrated as a portable lift gas generator for launching meteorological and scientific balloons from remote locations where high-pressure helium is not available. Based on favorable mission analyses conducted during Phase I, the LGC as a method for extending the duration of high-altitude scientific balloon flights will be developed under Phase II. The LGC would operate with an auxiliary buoyancy-control balloon. The LGC produces lift gas by catalytic reforming of methanol at night. During the day, some of the lift gas (predominantly hydrogen) is burned with atmospheric air to produce water. The water ballast can be dropped or can be recycled to the LGC for steam reforming to generate lift gas the following night. These techniques can triple the duration of high-altitude flights compared to conventional methods of dropping ballast at night and venting gas during the day.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop a new type of optical dispersion element that combines a relief grating with appropriately optimized dielectric films to achieve both high dispersion and high efficiency into one diffraction order, independent of polarization. Grating efficiency is critical for wavelength management in modern fiber-optic telecommunication systems that employ dense wave-division-multiplexing (DWDM) transmission. Dynamic gain equalizers, reconfigurable channel blockers, programmable optical add-drop modules, and wavelength-selective switches all require spatial separation of the wavelengths from an input fiber, typically with a diffraction grating, which is also typically the largest source of insertion loss. Further, because the polarization of the optical signal of any particular wavelength within a fiber may change over time, the net power loss through the device must be independent of polarization. It is very difficult to achieve high grating efficiency in both polarizations. The proposed technology achieves this goal with a proprietary combination of diffractive and thin-film interference effects, and can be fabricated to be robust\nOver the wide temperature range required of DWDM components\n\n\nThe proposed use of this optical dispersion element will be to improve the insertion loss in\nFree-space optical wavelength-management products, such as dynamic gain equalizers and\nReconfigurable channel blockers, now being deployed in modern fiber-optic telecommunication\nSystems.

        "abstract": "The total global anthropogenic ammonia air emissions are estimated to be 43 million tons per year, with animal agriculture responsible for more than any other source and comprising approximately 50% of the total. The majority of ammonia emissions come from livestock operations, especially Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) like large dairies, poultry and swine operations, and cattle feedlots. A recent NRC Report identified ammonia emissions from CAFOs are a serious economic and social problem because they are a human and animal health hazard, as well as an ecological and environmental pollutant. And yet, scientists, regulatory agencies, and other stakeholders lack appropriate diagnostic tools for measurement of ammonia. The key challenge in measuring ammonia emission is the appropriate sensors that must measure ammonia concentration in real time at multiple locations, combine sensitivity, selectivity, accuracy, affordability, ruggedness, autonomous operation without sample preparation, low-power consumption, an ability to work for long periods of time without calibration or maintenance, and to withstand environmental impact while installed outdoors. The purpose of the project is to remove the shortcomings in the currently available tools for monitoring atmospheric ammonia emissions and develop a reference standard for ammonia measurement technology. The use of such technology would significantly improve domestic ammonia air emission inventories, which would lead to sensible regulation and efficient emission mitigation strategies.",

        "abstract": "72818-Methane hydrates comprise a large potential energy source for the U.S.  The thermal dissociation of methane hydrates by the injection of a hot fluid offers the potential to economically, effectively, and controllably produce natural gas from methane hydrate deposits, along with the potential for CO2 sequestration.  However, heat losses from the injection at the surface may exceed the heating value of the recovered gas.  This project will develop a downhole catalytic combustion system for efficiently producing methane from its hydrate.  Specifically, a practical and controllable compact wellbore combustor, which is capable of high BTU downhole heat generation and minimizes the heat losses in transporting hot fluid downhole, will be developed.  In addition, the system offers the potential for sequestering CO2 into its hydrate form, releasing more heat for use in dissociating methane.  In Phase I, deposits with as little as five percent hydrate by volume were shown to be economically recoverable.  Energy costs as a fraction of produced natural gas was very low, with very high payoffs.  Phase II will complete the development of the downhole catalytic combustion system.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The technology should provide an enabling tool for natural gas production from hydrates and potentially for CO2 sequestration.  In the near term, the technology should have application for steam generation for heavy oil production, with the potential to improve production and substantially reduce energy and other costs of recovery costs from existing reservoirs.",

        "abstract": "The paradigm shift of using a multiple-satellite cluster rather than a large, monolithic spacecraft has been fueled by the objectives of increased robustness, greater flexibility, and reduced cost. It should be understood, however, that these objectives are not automatically met. The operational costs of monitoring and commanding a large fleet of close-orbiting satellites is likely to be unreasonable unless the onboard software is sufficiently autonomous, robust, and reconfigurable. A decentralized, agent-based guidance and control system has been designed in Phase I to help meet these challenging software requirements. The proposed concept is a decentralized guidance and control system, organized in a multiple-team framework, and implemented within the Princeton Satellite Systems? (PSS) ObjectAgent? architecture. In the ObjectAgent architecture, Agents may be remotely added, removed or replaced post-launch to increase mission flexibility and robustness. This level of reconfigurability exceeds the state-of-the-art in traditional flight software. The reconfigurable, decentralized system will enable the number of spacecraft in the cluster to change post-launch, will be capable of supporting clusters with large numbers of satellites, and will allow significant software modifications to be made on-orbit in a robust manner.",

The resultant reduction in the number of diodes and the size of the beam-handling optics leads to a lower-cost, lighter weight system, advantages for both the satellite- and aircraft-based systems. Our approach will enable a new generation of lower-risk, lower-cost science missions, requiring lower power and weight resources.

In the initial Phase I effort, a record cw power level (> 2W) from diode-pumped Lasers were demonstrated through the use of an innovative, side-pumped design. In Phase II, this design will be further improved and utilized as the basis for a regenerative amplifier to generate high peak powers. The output of a passively mode-locked, diode-pumped laser should provide the seed pulses for the regenerative amplifier.  The overall ultrafast source should be simpler, smaller and ultimately less expensive than present, power-equivalent, sapphire-based ultrafast laser systems. As a demonstration of the utility of the proposed technology, a time-domain terahertz (THz) spectrometer will be constructed, based on an optical-rectification THz source and an electro-optical detector, both driven by the laser system. The directly diode-pumped ultrafast laser represents an enabling technology, allowing ultrafast and THz systems to emerge from the laboratory and into the widespread scientific and industrial applications \n\nThe proposed ultrafast laser and THz spectrometer both could have the potential for significant scientific and commercial impact.  With the lower cost  (on the order of 50%) made possible by the simplicity of design, a wider range of research groups in academia and industry will be able to obtain ultrafast sources and THz instrumentation.

In particular, the scaled-down combination of the amine+Claus+SCOT processes has very high capital costs.  This project will develop a new lower-cost process, DirectTreat, for removing sulfur from natural gas streams.  DirectTreat is projected to have lower capital and operating costs than either amine+Claus+SCOT or liquid redox process for small-to-mid sized sulfur recovery plants.  In association with several companies in the natural gas and sulfur recovery industries, Phase I optimized a catalyst for the DirectTreat process, conducted an economic analysis, and demonstrated the feasibility of the technology.  In Phase II, a series of high pressure natural gas desulfurization tests will be conducted.  The best catalyst will then be subjected to lifetime testing at high pressure.  In a field test, the catalyst will be used to treat a slip stream of high pressure natural gas at a gas plant.  Finally, an economic analysis will be done to compare DirectTreat with current sulfur recovery technologies.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The DirectTreat process should offer the gas producer and petroleum refiner a much-lower-cost alternative to amine+Claus+SCOT for intermediate-sized sulfur recovery plants.  For gas producers, the much lower capital and operating costs should allow the marketing of gas that would otherwise be left in the ground.",

        "abstract": "72882-Chemical odorants made with sulfur-containing compounds are added to propane and natural gas supplies to facilitate leak detection.  However, in the fuel processing systems of fuel cells, these compounds can contaminate the anode catalysts of the fuel cell itself, thereby degrading power generation performance.  This project will develop a low-cost, high-capacity, sorbent that can reduce the concentration of organic sulfur species to less than parts per billion levels in natural gas and LPG.  Phase I developed a low cost, high capacity sorbent that can remove sulfur-bearing odorants from natural gas and LPG.  The technical and economic feasibility of using this sorbent, which dramatically reduces the cost of odorant removal, was demonstrated.  A preliminary engineering analysis showed that the size of the desulfurization system, designed to last the entire 10-year life of a 5 kW fuel cell, could be reduced to 19 L.  In Phase II, the sorbent will be scaled-up for production using commercial manufacturing techniques.  The desulfurization sorbent will be integrated with a fuel cell system (with fuel cell stacks, fuel processor and all auxiliary items) in a full-scale field test.  A detailed engineering analysis will be conducted to assess the impact of the sorbent on the efficiency, size, and cost of the overall fuel cell system. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  Fuel cells have great potential as decentralized energy power systems.  A cost-effective sorbent that removes sulfur impurities should find immediate use in the fuel cell market; the residential U.S. market alone could be as much as 1,093,000 MW.  The highly selective, low-cost sorbents with a high sulfur removal capacity also should benefit catalytic chemical manufacturing processes (e.g., hydrogen production, methanol and ammonia synthesis) that use natural gas as a feedstock.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to create a robust software system for performing uncertainty analysis of process simulations for manufacturing. For simulations that are large or that contain many parameters, even the best Monte Carlo, or importance-based sampling methods for uncertainty analysis can be prohibitively expensive.  Consequently, systematic uncertainty analyses are rarely implemented for complex systems. This proposal presents a plan to produce a commercially viable package of a new method for quantifying simulation uncertainty, based on polynomial chaos expansions.  The method can determine the probability density functions of black-box model responses and can identify quantitatively which of the parameters contribute most to uncertainties in responses for multivariate inputs and outputs.  The unique sampling approach enabled by the use of polynomial chaos expansions allows more accurate resolution of probability distribution functions at a very small fraction of the cost to achieve similar results with more traditional uncertainty-analysis methods.  \n\nWhile illustrative examples from the chemical manufacturing industries will be used to demonstrate the \nsoftware functionality, the methodology has broad application to such fields as circuit design, risk \nmanagement, allocation of experimental resources, chemical plant design and operation of production \nsystems.   Due to the ability to handle arbitrary or black-box simulations, the methods can be applied as \neasily to economic market analysis, or global climate modeling, as to chemical process design.",

The process uses reactive multi-layer foils as local heat sources for melting solder layers, and consequently bonding the components. The foils are a new class of nano-engineered materials, in which self-propagating exothermic reactions can be ignited at room temperature with a spark. The work will focus on reactive mounting of heat sinks onto server chips, an application that is in critical need of performance improvements. Two alternatives will be considered - the reactive mounting of a copper heat sink onto a metallized heat spreader that surrounds the chip, and reactive mounting of the heat sink directly onto a metallized chip. Significant improvements in heat conduction in microelectronic devices are needed as existing approaches such as adhesives, greases and epoxies suffer a number of limitations such as poor thermal conductivity, low mechanical strength and/or susceptibility to degradation.\n     With the decrease in the size and the increase in speed of microelectronic devices, poor heat dissipation has started to limit device performance and applications and thus has become a critical issue.

Concrete highway rehabilitation will become at least 33% more cost-effective due to a reduced need for capital, labor, and time - making it cost-competitve with asphalt removal and replacement.  Urban highway rehabilitation, in particular, will be more cost-effective because the pavement sub-base, utilities, and nearby buildings won't be disturbed.

        "abstract": "The proposed innovation is the use of advanced GUI and underlying functionality to reduce the time and effort required for real-time air traffic simulation scenario development. Our product directly addresses efficient generation of scenarios for real-time HITL simulations which analyze NAS operational performance and economic impact. Thus, we are responsive to: next generation simulation and modeling capability; NAS operational performance, economic impact; and real-time simulations: components with different levels of fidelity, human in-the-loop - in the A3.02 subtopic. The project objectives are to field a working prototype during Phase-II that demonstrates efficient scenario generation and incorporate feedback into a range of profitable commercial scenario generation products. The Phase-II effort includes; (1) refine application requirements; (2) refine application architecture;, (3) implement and evaluate the Phase-II prototype; and (4) prepare Phase-III business plans. We anticipate the Phase-II prototype to demonstrate significant efficiency gains regarding scenario generation - initially for the ATM domain and subsequently for other domains. Our application supports NASA human factors research regarding; current and future airspace systems, human performance, human-computer interfaces, distributed human decision-making, and design/evaluation of decision support tools. Benefits include: (1) increased scenario generation efficiency by reducing both time and resource requirements; (2) usable scenario output across multiple simulation facilities; (3) compatibility with distributed simulations; and (4) reduced need of expensive target simulation facilities for scenario development and evaluation. The period of benefit will begin during Phase-II and continue as long as there is a need for efficient scenario generation ? we expect tangible benefits for the next 10 years.",

Commercial InGaAs/InP avalanche photodiodes developed for linear operation in optical fiber communication systems have limited quantum detection efficiency and relatively high dark count rates when operated in Geiger mode, and are unable to detect radiation from important laser sources such as Tm/Ho near 2 microns. Using our experience as manufacturers of commercial linear-mode avalanche photodiodes and our epitaxial growth facility, we will design and fabricate avalanche photodiodes optimized specifically for Geiger-mode operation. The goal will be to obtain enhanced quantum detection efficiency, reduced dark count rate, and extended wavelength response to 2.1 microns. \nThe two primary impacts of this work will be to enhance the understanding of the physics of Geiger-mode avalanche photodiodes, and to provide the broader research community with improved detectors that will significantly enhance the usefulness of photon-counting techniques in the near-infrared spectral region. Although the basic theory of Geiger-mode operation of avalanche photodiodes is several decades old, there continues to be a significant quantitative discrepancy between the quantum detection efficiency predicted by the theory and the quantum detection efficiency observed experimentally. Part of this study will pursue this discrepancy, not only to design improved devices but also to better understand the fundamental performance limits. By developing improved near infrared photon-counting detectors this study will take a major toward making such detectors commercially available to the larger research community, which will enable photon-counting techniques to be more widely applied in the near-infrared spectral region.",

The truck uses a rigid frame and an independent, compliant, primary suspension for its basic architecture.  Constant contact side-bearings and yaw dampers were also added to improve dynamic performance.  Vehicle dynamics simulations performed as part of Phase I indicate that the concept truck can travel at 150mph prior to the onset of lateral instability (hunting).  The concept trucks also performed well in the other Chapter XI test regimes indicating track worthiness at lower speeds.  The primary objective of Phase II of the project is to develop the truck concept into a detailed, practical and track-worthy design that can be prototyped and built for successful over-the-road or Chapter XI testing.  A secondary objective is to produce prototypes of its key componenets for additional testing/evaluation.  As part of this process, we will conduct additional vehicle dynamics analysis to ensure that the truck performs well under a wide range of scenarios including worn conditions.  The most practical methods to achieve the desired suspension characteristics will be determined and the necessary details specified.

Aluminum nitride would be an excellent window material due to its high thermal conductivity, high dielectric strength, low secondary electron emission, and high mechanical strength, if its dielectric loss (loss tangent) could be controlled and/or reduced.  This project will develop technology for optimizing aluminum nitride for the RF window application.  In particular, the effects of starting powder type and purity, porosity, grain size, and yttria additive concentration on the thermal conductivity and microwave dielectric properties (dielectric constant and loss tangent) of aluminum nitride will be investigated.  Phase I identified the variables that control dielectric loss and thermal conductivity of aluminum nitride.  The presence of certain impurities in the starting powders, and the type and concentration of the second phase (added as a sintering aid), were found to be responsible for controlling the dielectric loss and thermal conductivity.  Phase II will determine the sintering aid concentration and associated processing variables that minimize dielectric loss without significantly reducing thermal conductivity.  The material's thermal and dielectric properties will be fully characterized to help the RF window design.  Thermetically sealed prototype windows will be prepared by newly developed metallization techniques.  Cold and hot tests will be performed to demonstrate the windows\u00c2\u00bf power handling capabilities.

The integration of low k dielectrics (dielectric constant 2.2 < k < 3.3)  with copper metal lines is expected to considerably reduce RC (resistance x capacitance)  delay for  > 10 GHz CMOS expected devices in the next 3-5 years.  One of the key issues plaguing the semiconductor industry is the  chemical  mechanical planarization (CMP) of copper/tantalum/low k  dielectric materials. The low k dielectrics  are fragile  and  are susceptible to both delamination and scratching (increased defectivity). Standard slurries employing hard abrasives may not meet the requirements for sub-80 nm CMOS devices which are expected to employ low k dielectric materials. The program proposes to develop & commercialize gentle CMP slurries based on nanoporous silica particles which exhibit reduced  hardness  and  better  stability.  Combined  with  unique  chemical  formulations, these slurries are expected to achieve lower defectivity  (surface scratching) and lower stress polishing than standard slurries.  In this Phase II project extensive experiments will be conducted both in-house and with our partners (semiconductor chip manufacturers) to optimize performance and integration issues. \n \nCommercially this research activity has significant impact not only in the semiconductor manufacturing areas, but also in may other areas such as biotechnology and nanotechnology, which are the key areas identified by the government for the future viability of US business. First and foremost it will ensure US can maintain its lead in CMP, even though semiconductor manufacturing jobs have been migrating overseas.  As CMP slurries is the largest value added application of the nanoparticle technology (> 50%)  excellence in this area will provide employment to  nanotechnology graduates in the  near future and could be a direct application of the skills they  have  acquired. This research will lead to the creation of faster electronic devices, which will in turn benefit the society to become more economically productive.

        "abstract": "Goldenseal is one of the most popular medicinal herbs in the country. Since the overwhelming majority of the raw goldenseal on the market today is wild harvested, this popularity has led to over collection from its native habitat to the point of being declared threatened or endangered in many areas by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This situation has created an opportunity for quality minded small farmers to increase farm profitability and efficiency through the utilization of idle forest land to produce a high value crop. This project goes a step beyond cultivation and will develop optimal on-farm processing and storage techniques for the individual farmer plus an extremely well characterized liquid goldenseal product which will be eventually produced and marketed on a cooperative basis through a range of outlets including health care professionals, the internet, and dietary supplement and health food stores among others. Economic and social benefits of this project include increased income and financial stability for a group of small farmers, a more reliable product for industry and consumers, plus a reduction in the need for the wild collection of goldenseal.",

The ability to advance the culture of spiny lobsters will reduce the stress on the natural stock while providing a highly desired product.  The culture cycle is dependent on the collection of lobster pueruli from the wild, due to the difficulty in rearing the larvae through the yearlong cycle.  Snapperfarm, Inc. moored its first two offshore fish submerged sea cages in the Puerto Rico in 2002.  These cages quickly became large settlement collectors for spiny lobster pueruli, which were drifting to nearshore for settlement.  The collection of pueruli from offshore sea cages represents a novel technique, which differs from the traditional methods \u00c2\u00bf small floating collectors and plankton nets.  Building on the results in Phase I, Snapperfarm will address in Phase II the bottlenecks to commercial culture of spiny lobster.  The objectives and approaches include refining pueruli collection techniques, developing feed for juveniles, using growout cages to raise lobsters to market, and finding value-added markets for cultured lobsters.  As these refinements are realized, Snapperfarm, Inc. can expand their research lobster culture program to a successful and profitable business (Phase III).",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the development of an ultrasound technology that measures internal bond strength (IBS) in paper and paperboard materials.  IBS is a very important quality control parameter because it provides an assessment of bond strength between wood pulp fibers and between plies in multi-ply grades.  Two standardized test methods are widely used throughout the paper industry to evaluate IBS: Z-direction tensile (ZDT) and Scott Plybond.  However, these methods are problematic in many ways: they require destructive testing, are technically deficient, are labor and time intensive, and cannot be integrated into automated paper testing equipment in quality control laboratories.  Since the propagation of ultrasonic waves in paper is sensitive to bonding between fibers, an ultrasonic IBS method has the potential to address all shortcomings of existing methods.  Preliminary results gathered during Phase I confirmed correlations between ultrasonic IBS, ZDT and Scott Plybond.  Phase II involves additional work on the ultrasound technology to improve its accuracy, reliability, and universality.  Also, it includes the development of an engineering prototype instrument for paper mill quality control testing, a comprehensive statistical study comparing ultrasonic IBS, ZDT, and Scott Plybond, and the drafting of a standardized test method. \n\nThe worldwide market of ZDT and Scotty Plybond Instruments is estimated at 400 units, largely in QC labs.  Expected sales are $11M. Commercialization of a few hundred units would be considered as a tremendous success in the paper industry. The successful deployment of ultrasonic IBS in the QC lab could support the future development of real-time IBS monitoring during production.",

        "abstract": "The U.S. produces 6 million MT soy hulls for low returns because hulls are used for animal feed. Pectin from soy is an attractive alternative to more expensive, imported pectins. Soy Pectin TM acts as a thickening agent rather than forming a traditional gel that permits increased dietary fiber intakes. Pollution is minimal because soy hulls require no drying and minimal water leaching. Removing acids and concentrating before precipitation minimizes the evaporation and capital costs. Citrus pectin was manufactured in 4 plants, all of which have closed. Now 5,000 MT / year of pectin is imported, addding $50 million to the trade deficit and forcing dependance on foreign suppliers. A majority of the U.S. population is chronically deficient in dietary fiber consuming only 14 grams instead of the suggested 30 grams per day. Consuming less fiber presents a significant health concern. The purpose of Phase II of this project is to establish the feasibility of actual production of Soy Pectin TM for use as a food ingredient to benefit the health of the American consumer. During Phase I, Soy Pectin, Inc. demonstrated the feasibility of extracting pectin from soybean hulls. Producing pectin from soy should be less expensive than traditional citrus pectins due to lower capital and operational costs.

Building upon existing expertise in dealing with rich media, the proposed research will apply and refine the techniques discovered in phase I to organize relevant material using both the context of the documents and the topics of the selected material. The prototype will also apply the phase I results to identify and fill in the critical gaps between segments of material extracted from the source documents with bridging text that will provide necessary context and structure, allowing the system to present the relevant material as a single coherent broadcast.\n\nThis research will result in new techniques that allow separately obtained passages of audio/video (or even text) to be joined together coherently. It will also provide techniques for organizing information based on both contextual and topical cues. These techniques will be applicable in any context in which information in natural language form is being extracted from a source collection. Furthermore, the research results will provide cost efficiencies for a number of specific important vertical markets (e.g. finance, broadcast news monitoring, etc.). The resulting software products will dramatically reduce the costs of the currently manually intensive information extraction process employed by firms in these markets. More generally, the software products that are derived from the company's current technology platform will also increase individuals' ability to find and absorb relevant information from diverse information sources, many of which are entirely intractable today. This ability is important in a wide range of communities such as academic institutions, intelligence agencies, homeland security agencies, financial institutions, and news broadcasters.",

Previous work has shown that the introduction of additional elements into internal-tin Nb3Sn superconductors can provide a material that meets the targets for critical current density and loss properties.   This project will develop improved methods for introducing the additional elements, particularly titanium and tantalum, into internal-tin Nb3Sn, in order to improve the compositional uniformity and reliability, and reduce manufacturing costs, while maintaining the improved properties.  In Phase I, a method of introducing titanium into Nb3Sn, by wrapping Nb7.5wt.%Ta rods with Nb47wt.%Ti foils, was demonstrated.  An outer wrap of niobium was put around the Nb47wt.%Ti foil, to permit maximum flexibility in the fabrication procedures.  Nineteen subelement restacks were successfully made and drawn down to 0.29 mm diameter without breakage.  In Phase II, the billet designs made in Phase I will be modified and other methods of introducing additional elements will be tried, on a small scale at first.  Then, the most promising designs will be selected, optimized, and scaled up to full sized billets.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  In addition to being used in HEP accelerator applications, the product should have application to open area MRI, where the patient is more accessible to the surgeon (MRI is the largest commercial application of low temperature superconductors), small magnets for high field laboratory applications and NMR, and levitated transportation projects.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a method for conducting high-throughput, automated analysis of the protein content of cell lines using a novel mass analyzed two-dimensional liquid-phase separation method. The conventional method of two-dimensional poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D PAGE) has several limitations ; it is labor intensive, time consuming, difficult to automate and often not readily reproducible. In addition, quantitation, especially in differential expression  experiments, is often difficult and limited in dynamic range. The proposed technology provides automated, faster, and more accurate 2D protein maps, and can be used to purify specific proteins and enact protein/peptide digest and sequencing information. These capabilities will prove valuable for studying drug-protein interactions for detecting early signs of cancer. Studies of cancer cell lines can reveal signatures of cancerous cells that can serve as markers for actual diagnosis. The proposed system is based on 2D liquid-phase protein separation using chromatofocusing (CF) in one dimension and non-porous silica, reverse-phase, high-performance liquid chromatography (NPS-RP HPLC) in the second dimension. The HPLC eluent is monitored in real-time by on-line electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS) to provide molecular weight and intensity information.\n\n\nThe commercial application of this project is in the area of proteomics. The proteomics market is forecasted to grow from $ 0.7 billion to $ 5.8 billion over the next 5 years.

Taxonomize Resource Aid (TRA) uses syntactic, semiotic, semantic and statistical techniques to generate and update resource taxonomies, which are multi-level indices into the information corpus (documents, web sites, etc.) specific to users' activities.  These active taxonomies are practice-relevant and personalized, and they provide applications of enhanced search, auto-produced portals, personalized content management, and knowledge discovery.  For example, TRA's coordinated knowledge directories produce discovery of trends in time-based documents (such as discussion groups); extraction of information from unstructured data (such as distributed themes); and notifications from monitoring multiple information sources for patterns of confluences (e.g., news relevant to collaborating partners) or discrepancies (e.g., knowledge missing in one area that can be filled from another).  Phase II development will take the successful prototype that was tested in educational settings, and create a commercial product (initially as a SOAP/WSDL web service) that will be licensed to firms selling software solutions in the areas of e-learning, search, and knowledge management.\n\nTaxonomize Resource Aid (TRA) will provide knowledge tailored for individuals, groups, and activities, and thus will provide people who have been limited by accessibility, resources, or background ready access to resources of knowledge, instruction, and collaboration.  The TRA prototype has already been shown to provide significant benefits to some university students who were learning how to do primary research.  Those who have difficulty with the culture, language, or technology gain the greatest benefits from TRA, because it gives them accelerated access to knowledge that is automatically selected for relevance to their activities, based on Taxonomize's powerful auto-categorization capabilities.  TRA can help in any field where people need to organize, manage, access and use large amounts of information and resources.  TRA can help improve education, healthcare, defense, and government organizations process information quickly, especially when dealing with immediate and critical situations.  It can also help disadvantaged people find necessary resources, and keep updated with changes that would otherwise be infeasible to monitor.

Widespread use of white LEDs would reduce the overall electrical demand for lighting by 50%.  At this time, the major hurdle for solid-state lighting is the high cost of GaN-based LED production technology.  This project will develop a novel epitaxial technology with substantially reduced process cost for the fabrication of group-III nitride epitaxial structures for white LEDs.  This novel technology is based on hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE), a low-cost method for fabricating thick quasi-bulk GaN materials, GaN-on-sapphire, and AlN-on-sapphire templates used as substrates for device fabrication.  Phase I demonstrated that the technology could be used to cost-effectively fabricate AlGaN-based structures and package violet, ultraviolet, and white LED lamps for lighting application.  White LED lamps were assembled by packaging the violet LEDs with a white light conversion phosphor blend.  Phase II will focus develop cost effective HVPE manufacturing technology for multi-wafer, Al(In)GaN-based structures production.  The  efficiencies of violet, UV and white LED lamps will be improved, with brightnesses up to 100 Lm/W anticipated.

This project will take advantage of recently developed super computer clustering technologies to develop new scalable data processing techniques to improve the quality, efficiency and turnaround time of video based data products. New and innovative scalable video processing software will be developed that can be applied to multiple video streams simultaneously while utilizing any number of available processors. This new software will also allow a facility to create multiple and complex data products, with an order of magnitude less operator setup and intervention because the video streams can be selected individually or as a group and assigned to processes prior to, during or after data acquisition. The processors assigned to the tasks may be dedicated or borrowed from other users on the network on an as available basis. With enough processors applied to the work, the time required for completing the data processing tasks could be reduced by several orders of magnitude.",

        "abstract": "Technology Applications, Inc. is proposing to demonstrate a high thermal performance microsphere-based insulation to enable reliable energy-efficient, cost-effective cryogenic distribution over long distances for earth, space, and extraterrestrial environments. The new technology, which employs a lightweight microsphere-based insulating medium, provides for robust, low-maintenance storage and distribution systems. Well suited for the on/off operation that is typical for space launch operations, microsphere insulation minimizes losses in stored propellants at spaceports and for commercial liquefied gases. Microsphere insulation?s inherent properties of high crush strength and ability to flow combine to form a tough, resilient insulation system that withstands exposure to harsh launch/landing environments and ambient /vacuum pressure cycles. Based on extensive thermal testing, including recent measurements made at the Cryogenics Test Laboratory, microspheres perform 1.5 to 3.3 times better than perlite and limit heat leak to less than most insulation materials, particularly multilayer insulation (MLI), in a soft or lost vacuum condition. At 10-1 torr vacuum, microspheres outperform MLI by a factor of two. This means significantly reduced lifecycle costs from maintenance, lost cryogen, and reinsulation. Microsphere-insulated transfer line and storage tank prototypes will be extensively tested to optimize performance, address microsphere handling and containment methods, and validate long-term performance benefits.",

A time consuming and labor intensive stage of any experimental effort is the event selection (or skimming) that must be performed at a remote site in order to deliver reasonably sized data sets to the end user.  This project will develop a Web tool for remote data skimming.  A rich client application will be developed for download and execution from any browser.  It will have graphical widgets for forming pipelines of data selection criteria, as well as job submission and monitoring controls.  The tool will be secure and collaborative, support multiple clients, and provide a repository for generated skims and skimmed data.  Phase I developed a prototype Data Skimming Grid Portal (DSGP) with a capability for selecting from a set of skims located on the server, reconfiguring the skims, and generating new skims using graphical components.  The prototype grid service invokes the skim application, provides notification of status and delivers the skimmed data to the client.  Phase II will develop a well-documented release version of the DSGP, along with a full-featured reference implementation using the latest Globus middleware.  The system will include a rich graphical client application and a command-line interface for submitting skim jobs with custom C++ code to be run in parallel on a test grid.  A catalog grid service will be developed to store references to skims and datasets, enhance monitoring capabilities, add chat features for collaboration, and activate security.

A main source of these electrons is collisions at grazing incidence between ions and beam pipe walls.  Computer modeling could be used to examine this problem, but the codes in the heavy-ion fusion community presently do not have the capability to accurately model grazing-incidence collisions.  We will develop a complete package of accurate numerical models of grazing-incidence collisions between ions and walls.  This package will include tables of data from a well-known ion-material interaction code, and it will include development of a new ion-material interaction code.  The final package will give heavy-ion fusion simulation codes the ability to determine ways to mitigate the effects of unwanted electrons.  A model of surface roughness was implemented in an ion-material interaction code, a model of electron yield was derived from that rough surface model, the electron yield model was validated against experimental results, the electron yield model was combined with a well-known particle tracking code, models of ion scattering were developed based on ion-material interaction simulations, models of electron yield were developed including ion scattering, and a new code was prototyped to calculate electron yield from ion-material interaction.  Tables of data will be created for ions, materials, energies and angles important to heavy-ion fusion and the routines to access that data, ion scattering will be added to a new ion-material interaction code to better model grazing collisions, rough surface models will be added to that same code, and finally autotools, steering with a popular scripting language, graphical user interface and computer-aided design features will be added to make building and using the code easy.

There exists already a parallel 3-D code that includes the effects of space-charge and magnet nonlinearities.  We will add needed functionality to this code to make it a suitable tool for doing high-fidelity simulations and analysis of high-current magnetized electron transport lines, including misalignments and nonlinear rf accelerating fields.  We developed and implemented methods to extract from electric field data the information required to construct high-order maps for rf cavities.  We have defined an approach for adding general misalignments to a high-order beam dynamics code.  And we have applied this code to tracking simulations of an electron transport line that is currently under research and development. We will complete the implementation of accurate, high-order maps for RF cavities, and implement general misalignments.  In collaboration with scientists at government labs, we will use the improved code to make detailed studies of a novel electron transport line currently under design.  We will also develop a suite of tools---input file converters, post-processing utilities, and the like---that will make it easier for scientists to compare with simulations done by different codes.

        "abstract": "72170  One of the factors limiting rapid development of electric and hybrid-electric vehicles is the cost and performance of battery technologies.  Lithium-ion battery technology represents the state-of-the-art for portable electronics, but in order to meet the demands of hybrid electric vehicle, further development is required, especially in the area of cathode materials.  LiMn2O4 and LiFePO4 are candidate cathode materials for application in lithium-ion batteries designed for hybrid electric vehicle, having suitably low cost.  However, demonstrations to date show LiMn2O4 suffers from Mn dissolution into the electrolyte and possesses low capacity, both of which presently limit its use for application into hybrid electric vehicle.  LiFePO4 has sufficiently high energy density but low conductivity, which limits high power capabilities.  Solving these issues are a key requirement for hybrid electric vehicle applications.  Contractor has identified a path towards development of a LiFePO4 material that allows lithium-ion technology to meet the demands of hybrid electric vehicle application.  The contractor approach combines molecular modeling, materials synthesis and electrode fabrication.  Molecular modeling will identify chemical dopants which, when synthesized under appropriate conditions, lead to improved material conductivity.  Careful control of synthetic parameters will be used to allow optimization of particle size and morphology.  Synthesized materials will then be formulated into electrodes optimized for the specific material and these electrodes will be tested in lithium-ion battery systems.  The desired final product will be a LiFePO4 cathode material that can be incorporated into large-scale lithium-ion batteries for application into hybrid electric vehicle.  Contractor's goal for Phase I was to demonstrate a LiFePO4-based material having power capability which is similar to the current industry standard, LiCoO2, thereby allowing LiFePO4 material commercialization into lithium-ion batteries.  This was accomplished in the contractor laboratories using proprietary doping and surface treatments identified through molecular modeling and synthetic efforts.  Particular attention was given to optimizing performance for supporting the requirements of lithium-ion batteries used for hybrid electric vehicle application.  In phase II contractor is planning to optimize and demonstrate high conductivity (and hence high power ability) for LiFePO4 samples produced using a low cost synthetic strategy. Demonstration of this chemical manufacturing method will bring the prodcut closer to commercialization. An electrode formulation study will allow incorporation of  the new material in 1Ah Li-ion cells with high specific power.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The hybrid electric vehicle business represents a sizable market for battery technology and contractor's goal is to develop a cathode material that allows lithium-ion battery technology to meet the requirements for the hybrid electric vehicle market.  The contractor LiFePO4 technology has the potential to advance hybrid electric vehicle development efforts hastening widespread use of hybrid electric vehicle\u00c2\u00bfs, decreasing the US dependency on petroleum imports and improving the environment through reduction of automobile emissions.  LiFePO4 can also serve as an environmentally friendly replacement of the LiCoO2 material, which is too costly for hybrid electric vehicle applications, used in today\u00c2\u00bfs lithium-ion batteries.",

The imaging system will be a compact avalanche-gain, charge-coupled device digital camera. The technology generated from this research effort will profoundly benefit many detection and discrimination applications. The innovation will offer high-photoresponse from the deep ultraviolet to the near infrared in very Low-Light-Level, as well as photopic light conditions. In addition, the camera system will have solid-state reliability without typical intensifier imaging tube limitations, such as, image burn-in and blooming. In short, the innovation will have significant cost savings over current conventional multi-spectrum imaging systems and will offer enhanced imaging performance.\n     A possible research, military, law enforcement, or homeland security application for the camera will be black-on-black detection--that is, when faint objects are difficult to discriminate from the background. This far-reaching technology will also be beneficial for many non-military applications: such as, Low-Light-Level physical, deep space and forensic sciences, as well as, photopic (daylight) medical and life sciences.

The rapid production of data-driven, information-rich animations has previously proved very difficult. With the notable exception of weather forecast animations, requiring highly expensive complex multi-computer systems, quality animations are routinely produced weeks ahead of time for television documentaries. Traffic/traveler data represents particular challenges such as the fact that data changes very frequently and becomes stale in minutes. Much of this data is in textual form, as reported on-scene by police or emergency crews. Reliability and utility to the traveler are concerns. Consequently, the four major weather broadcast companies have scarcely addressed the traffic market. This project will develop traveler data processing algorithms for predicting travel time, mining large databases of traffic information, and intelligent text- processing. It will also develop traffic micro-simulations, automating data-driven animation, and exploiting programmable graphics hardware for broadcast-quality real-time informative animations. The expected results of this project are: 1) algorithms providing useful information to travelers/commuters from raw real-time police reports and sensor data; and 2) a product animating real-time traffic/traveler information for TV broadcast and the Internet, exploiting gradual improvements of raw data, as departments of transportation equip highways with speed/density sensors, and enforcement agencies open their servers. \n\nThe Federal Highway Administration reports that the cost of traffic congestion in 1999 came to $78 billion nationwide, including 4.5 billion hours of lost time and 6.8 billion gallons of fuel wasted. Most transportation experts estimate that the ability to quickly provide accurate traffic information as proposed in this project has many benefits: 1) for drivers to plan alternative routes, keep on their schedules, and to reduce stress, 2) for overall congestion and better road maintenance, 3) for safety and road-rage mitigation, and 4) for improved pollution control.",

However, considerable research and development is required to both improve device efficiencies and lifetimes, and reduce costs.

For example, if the energy used for lighting in residential, commercial and industrial sectors could be reduced by 50% in the U.S., over $25B per year could be saved .  Organic light emitting device (OLED) technology is now being developed as a new potential low cost, high efficiency source of solid state lighting.  However, considerable research and development is required to both improve the device efficiencies, lifetimes, and reduce costs.  Our goal is to realize an innovative approach to low cost solid state white light sources by combining two novel outcoupling schemes:  microlens arrays and aperiodic gratings.  We will achieve world record efficient phosphorescent OLED devices with power efficiency > 60 lm/W.  The purpose of the Phase I program was to demonstrate a white light phosphorescent OLED (PHOLED) light source employing microlens arrays, which has a power efficiency > 15 lm/W at 800 nits luminance.  To that end, we exceeded the Phase I efficiency goals by 60% by fabricating, on schedule, white PHOLEDs with microlenses having 24 lm/W at a luminance of 1,000 cd/m2.  We believe that this program clearly demonstrated the technical feasibility of our approach, and it is for this reason that in this Phase II proposal we intend to further pursue this effort to develop PHOLEDs with even higher outcoupling efficiencies, and produce prototype lighting panels, which will allow us to more fully evaluate the performance of these technologies to produce commercially viable solid-state light sources for general illumination.  In Phase II, UDC and Princeton University will demonstrate high power efficiency white phosphorescent OLED lighting panerls.  The team will build on their successful Phase I program and demonstrate white PHOLEDS that have improved ourcoupling efficiency through the atttachment of microlens arrays, in addition to incorporating novel aperiodic gratings consisting of stacks of dielectric materials deposited on the OLED glass substrate.  Specifically, the key objectives of Phase II are: Demonstrate the feasibility of aperiodic dielectric stacks at increasing the performance of white phosphorescent OLEDs  Fabricate microlens arrays that are permanently attached to the OLED substrate  Design and fagricate a prototype 3\u00c2\u00bf x 3\u00c2\u00bf white lighting array pane with the following characteristics:  CRI>75, and power efficiency > 1m/W at lighting luminance levels of 1,000 cd/m2.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The anticipated benefits of this work will be to demonstrate a new path for highly efficient white light sources by introducing a new dimension to the device design, i.e. high power, thereby significantly reducing the size of the substrate necessary for devices to produce optical power (>800 lumens) for room lighting.  In addition, by combining other efficiency enhancing techniques (e.g. aperiodic gratings to further increase the outcoupling efficiency) with white SOLED light sources, we believe that efficiencies >50 lm/W could be demonstrated within the next 2 years.  In parallel with these efforts, the Team will also be undertaking more fundamental research and development on high-efficiency PHOLED devices so as to improve both lifetime and efficiency.  The combination of all these innovations should lead to >100 lm/W white OLED light sources.  Such products will create real benefits for end users, manufacturers, and the general public.  These include:  energy savings, economic savings, environmental savings, domestic energy independence, new lighting solutions, and the growth of a new industry and markets.",

        "abstract": "The U.S. and many other industrial countries face a growing need for second language and cultural awareness training for business and industry. Reliance on English is no longer sufficient for trade in the world market, since the most important markets for American goods and services are non-English-speaking areas, especially in growing countries in Asia and the Middle East. In recent years there has been a growing need to offer courses in the less commonly taught languages, including Arabic, Indonesian, and Farsi. Consequently there is a growing need for educational resources to support this training. Finding instructional materials for the less commonly taught languages is frequently a challenge. For the beginners or introductory grade levels in particular, there are almost no textbooks, grammar books, or dictionaries. Finding interactive multimedia materials is even harder.  This means that there is no easy or fast way of learning these languages. For example, although there are thousands of potential learners of Farsi in the U.S. and other countries, it is extremely difficult to offer Farsi as a language course on any given campus due to the heterogeneous backgrounds and needs of students. This project will produce a self-learning interactive CD-ROM to be used by anybody, anywhere, anytime.",

        "abstract": "73102-This project will develop a near-net-shape manufacturing technology, Combustion Driven Compaction (CDC) of alloy powders, for critical parts used in Next Linear Collider (NLC) structures.  These parts include OFHC (oxygen-free high conductivity) copper disks and SiC-based microwave absorbers for Higher Order Mode Manifold Radio-Frequency (RF) Internal Load applications.  These parts are very important in linear accelerators that operate under intense RF microwave power and require cost-effective manufacturing.  The CDC process will be cost-effective and competitive with other traditional processes such as wrought process/casting/forging in terms of net shaping ability to fabricate simple to complex shapes, faster time of compaction, better densification, improved mechanical/conductivity, excellent sub-micron surface finish, controllable geometrical tolerances, and brazeable/machinable attributes.  Phase I showed that CDC processing could be used to fabricate copper samples of various geometrical shapes at various CDC high compaction pressures for NLC copper-disk structure applications.  Structure/property relationships and sintering responses were optimized for improving the density, microstructure, uniform microchemistry, and polycrystalline single phase in the crystal structure and sub-micron surface finishes.  Phase II will further develop the CDC processing, sintering responses, and structure/property optimization. Materials characterization and testing will include mechanical properties, microstrutural/microchemistry/crystal structures, helium leak resistance, conductivities,  RF properties of dielectric behavior, brazability, and machinability.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The CDC process should be applicable to the cost-effective manufacturing of RF microwave parts, x-ray targets (for bio-medical, homeland security, and quality control screening), sputtering targets, NLC copper disks, vacuum seals for accelerators , cryogenic components, high temperature heat shields/tiles/nozzle liners for missiles/rockets, automotive/aerospace brake parts, nuclear storage pellets, military ammunitions, bearings, valves/valve seats, piston-rings, pump covers, superconducting magnets, die inserts/molds/cutting tools, Functionally Gradient Materials, and dissimilar/difficult-to-weld material bonding.",

As an exemplar of the technology, VCom3D will develop, demonstrate, and evaluate the application of AML to making Web content accessible in American Sign Language (ASL).  This development will entail the implementation of an Encoder to create AML from English text, and a Decoder to generate grammatical ASL from AML.\n\nMultinational corporations and institutions have recognized the economic and social need to make information and instruction accessible to persons around the world for whom English is, at best, a second language.  To address this issue, international organizations, including the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) are defining methodologies for using Controlled Languages, systems of annotation and, in the future, the Semantic Web to increase accessibility in other languages.  These same emerging technologies and infrastructure can provide an unprecedented opportunity to make information available to underserved Americans with sensory, cognitive, and cultural differences.  This project will demonstrate the application of emerging information technology to make information accessible to Deaf persons, and will provide resources for further research into ASL linguistics. The initial commercial product based on this technology will be a translation and authoring tool that substantially automates the creation of grammatical, animated ASL from English text.  This product will be used to increase access by Deaf and Hard of Hearing children and adults to digital information and to promote inclusive education and employment in accordance with the New Freedom Initiative, recent amendments to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and Section 255 of the Telecommunications Act.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will support development and testing of Windows applications for creating and making available highly accessible SVG files.  Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a graphics markup language supporting features critical to accessibility by individuals with print disabilities.  One application permits authors easily to create and/or edit mainstream graphical information as SVG files fully usable by individuals with print disabilities.  Full accessibility requires only that authors supply names of important graphics objects, a task easily done with the SVG Editor.  Most individuals with print disabilities can comprehend graphical information better by moving the mouse over text or graphics objects displayed in the ViewPlus SVG Reader, whereupon they hear the text or names of graphics objects spoken aloud.  Blind users and those unable to use a normal mouse can also comprehend such information by creating a tactile copy on a ViewPlus Tiger embosser which can then be read with their fingers after placing it on a ViewPlus Touchpad.  Sighted users can obtain an embossed color image with the new Color Embosser.  Availability of an appropriate embosser and Touchpad means that even individuals with severe print disabilities can access mainstream graphical information without assistance by another human being. \n\nComputer users with severe print disabilities currently have good access to words but very poor access to graphical information.  Lack of good access to graphs, charts, and diagrams severely affects quality of life and educational and professional opportunities, particularly in the STEM fields, i.e., science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  Graphical information today is \"made accessible\" largely by written or verbal description.  There is currently no practical way to make most graphical information available in a form usable by individuals who are severely dyslexic or for blind people, who may or may not read Braille.  These new SVG applications will provide a user-friendly technology that fills that need.  Graphical information can simply be created and displayed on the web or in electronic documents as SVG files that are usable by everybody.  The hardware technologies needed by blind or severely dyslexic people should cost no more than a present-day Braille embosser, so it should be affordable for libraries and institutions to provide this capability thus to serve these clientele.  The largest user base for the SVG Reader will probably be individuals with less severe print disabilities who can improve their comprehension by supplementing visual with audio information.",

The problem with CVD diamond coatings for cutting tools is poor surface finish and weak adhesion. Nanocrystalline CVD diamond deposited using microwave plasma (MP) techniques overcomes these problems with a smooth finish that is well adhered. This makes the nanocrystalline diamond a potential competitor to PCD diamond by lowering the price and increasing productivity. The research proposed for Phase II will use a 30kW MP-CVD reactor to investigate the relationships between nanocrystalline structure and technical performance. The structure will be controlled by process variables. Technical performance will be measured by mechanical testing and field testing on the proposed target application of machining cast aluminum-silicon alloy. The anticipated technical result will be direct correlations between structure, properties and performance that can be used to optimize nanocrystalline diamond coatings for machining automotive drive-train components.\n\nCommercial applications of nanocrystalline diamond coatings are far reaching due to applications in the cutting tool industry that promote the use of hard-to-finish advanced materials; applications in pulp and paper for cutting and guides, applications in textiles for guides and applications in various bearing surface applications such as deep-well oil drill-head bearings. The National Institute of Health is also sponsoring research on nanocrystalline diamond applications in biomedical hardware surfaces subject to wear.

It includes a theoretical analysis to optimize the inspection procedure and laboratory and field tests as well as modifying and adapting th inspection procedure for optimal flaw detectability under these service conditions. The commercial version of this technology will have a major effect on the way in which inspection is carried out in the railway industry. This simplified, low-cost, high-speed system will alter inspection economics and provide the railway companies with much more flexibility in scheduling inspection and will enable them to deploy the technology on their own hi-rail inspection vehicles to supplement outside contractor services.",

This program will demonstrate how critical structural details are incorporated with TYCOR technology, leading to unitized structures that require less post-processing than composite laminate approaches. The work will be focused on a commercial jet engine application using WebCore?s relationship with aircraft engine manufacturers to identify the best application. Structural and physical properties will be verified in each component structure as well as the final, integrated fan case. The manufacturing processes used in the production of the engine case will be evaluated and refined. These include technologies to aid in the production of preforms, the methods for processing and molding the bodies of revolution. Of particular importance will be the molding of full-circumferential bodies and the production and molding of non-uniform cross-sections. Using the data collected during this program, a cost model will be generated to document the cost advantages of TYCOR/Resin Infusion Process technology vs. current baseline composite and metallic components. Finally, a full-scale demonstration article will be produced in which the components are integrated into the design. This fan case will show a full body of revolution with integral hard points and flange attachments.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project combines large-scale simulation of wave propagation phenomena with optimization.  Simulation in itself is seldom a final objective.  Rather, simulation is usually a step in an iterative process to solve the real problem, that could be the determination of material properties from indirect measurements, imaging, parameter estimation or optimal design, to name a few.  All these problems share the need to couple a large simulation package with an optimization one.  This project will formalize this concept and proceed to create a set of tools to facilitate this coupling in the area of transient wave propagation phenomena, with special applications to piezoelectric transducer design, oil exploration and production, and optimal and protective structural design.  These applications are chosen to exemplify the usage of the toolbox and emphasize its generality.  It will couple a wave propagation finite element system and a system for 3D forward and inverse geological modeling, with a number of optimization programs.\n\nThe target market for the proposed solution is small to medium sized companies in need of a set of affordable design tools that will cover a number of different classes of application areas which have been previously available only to large firms.  The results of this project will have a broad impact on a large number of small and medium size industries that rely on Computer Aided Design and Engineering to develop their products, accelerating and making more efficient the process between product conception, production and market introduction, key in a highly competitive world.",

        "abstract": "73114-In regions with relatively few seismic stations and small-to-intermediate-magnitude events, traditional location methods frequently fail to provide event depth estimates with the accuracy required for nuclear test monitoring.  Therefore, improved algorithms for precise depth estimation from regional seismic array data are needed.  This project will develop a synergistic tool that combines three different technologies for estimating depth from regional seismic waveforms:  (1) improved depth phase detection in the complex Pn coda of regional seismograms, (2) depth estimates from sparse-network locations with Monte Carlo confidence regions, and (3) focal depths resulting from surface-wave spectral inversions.  Phase I demonstrated that wavelet de-noising is a successful method of isolating depth phases on complex regional seismograms, thereby proving the feasibility of the first technique.  In addition, it was determined that optimal Wiener filtering offered increased depth phase detection over standard Fourier filtering.  Phase will continue the development of the depth phase detection algorithm by incorporating improved wavelet de-noising and optimal Wiener filtering.  The technique will be applied to regional array data from regions of high nuclear monitoring interest.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  Improved seismic event depth estimates should improve the detection and identification of nuclear tests in foreign countries.  In addition, the technology could be used by gas and oil exploration firms to remove unwanted multiples or ghosts (e.g., ocean bottom/surface reflections) from seismic reflection surveys, thereby improving their ability to process seismic data for the discovery of new oil reserves.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a highly innovative, high-speed optoelectronic sensor system capable of continuously monitoring molten metal alloy compositions during casting and melting operations. The goal is to design and construct a commercially-viable sensor system capable of performing highly-accurate quantitative measurement of molten aluminum alloy compositions in an aggressive industrial setting. Development of this sensor is among the highest priority technology needs identified by both the metal casting industry and the aluminum industry in their industry roadmaps of the future. In order to effectively compete, U.S. metal industries must increase their use of low cost scrap and must also find ways to increase production efficiency. The proposed sensor will acquire critical compositional data thousands of times faster than current commercial methods and will operate on a real-time basis without the need to place the sensor in contact with the molten metal. At these speeds, a melt shop could produce one extra metal production batch ('heat') per day, resulting in a 15% increase in productivity.\n\nThe incorporation of this innovative optoelectronic sensor system will result in a tremendous increase in production efficiency, providing for a 15% gain in productivity. Thus, the $30 billion aluminum smelting industry could realize a $4.5 billion increase in production output with little or no additional capital investment other than the cost of the sensor system. In fact, the most immediate broader impact of the proposed activity will be to enhance U.S. competitiveness of aluminum casters and smelters because of this productivity improvement. In addition, the proposed technology will have a significant positive effect on process control and quality assurance, thereby providing further competitive advantages. Broader impact to our society will also be brought about through reduced emissions and energy savings resulting from shorter melting cycles. Similar improvements would be possible for zinc, copper, brass, bronze, iron, ceramic and glass industries that also have need for a similar continuous sensor system to monitor and control composition and quality on a real-time basis.",

Optics of 10-m class and beyond must be active to maintain sufficient optical figure. However, traditional deformable mirrors are too massive and complex to launch into orbit. Electron beam actuation solves this problem by replacing the myriad of wires of current high spatial frequency deformable optics with an electron source. Pointing the electron beam anywhere on the mirror surface provides unparalleled flexibility and unlimited spatial frequency. Phase I results proved the ability to provide high authority, stable and repeatable actuation on an electron beam actuated optic. Flood loading induced 9-waves of power in a 1-in optic. Focusing and pointing the electron beam achieved localized deformations. A scalable design is introduced to allow for a 25-40 cm diameter, less than 5-kg/m2 optic actuated by electron beam control to be delivered on Phase II. The multi-parametric nature of electron beam actuation will be harnessed by developing novel control algorithms.

Our design can optionally incorporate in-situ chemical sensors, providing on line real time chemical analysis in support of homeland security initiatives, so in addition to meteorology, this technology is also important to evolving homeland defense requirements.",

        "abstract": "Problem Rural communities must invest in a range of infrastructure to support public services. Decision-making regarding municipal investments is often made by part-time, volunteer community leaders who lack access to up-to-date information about alternative technologies and approaches. In addition, federal programs promoting alternative technologies are often focused on urban areas, with limited resources to address rural differences in scale, capacity, and financial resources. Furthermore, technologies are always changing and improving, making it difficult to keep up with them. Yellow Wood Associates is offering an assessment approach to small communities that compares the performance, cost and capacity of existing and proposed rural community municipal infrastructure with the performance, cost and capacity of alternative technologies and approaches. Our systematic assessment process helps communities in formulating cost-effective plans for phased implementation of appropriate alternatives. Plus, we can take communities from assessment to implementation by connecting them with companies and methods of financing. Rural communities can benefit from the Green Community Technologies service through cost savings, cost avoidance, potential creation of new employment opportunities, and environmental benefits.",

        "abstract": "72731-Thermoelectric power plants account for 39% of the fresh water withdrawn from streams and lakes in the United States, second only to agriculture.  3.3 billion gallons daily are lost to evaporation and 190 billion returned as warm water discharge.  The link between adequate supplies of low-cost energy and freshwater is clearly recognized in President Bush\u00c2\u00bfs National Energy Policy.  The demands placed upon increasingly limited sources of fresh water could be reduced if more efficient power-plant cooling systems were to developed.  This project will develop heat exchangers made from high thermal conductivity carbon foam, which have demonstrated performance at 1.5 to 3.5 times that of metal fins.  The approach will address the low strength problems, which prevented the previous industrial implementation of carbon foam heat exchangers.  During Phase I, ceramic coatings were applied to the high thermal conductivity carbon foam using a variety of raw materials and processing conditions, and the samples evaluated.  Several compositions demonstrated more than double the compressive strength with a minimal impact upon thermal conductivity, making the foam sufficiently strong for implementation.  Phase II will model and evaluate the heat transfer performance of various enhanced strength carbon foam configurations, and refine the strength enhancement, bonding, and machining technologies.  A pilot-scale, steam-condenser heat exchanger will be produced and its performance determined by an industry partner.  An economic assessment of the carbon-foam heat exchanger fabrication will be performed.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  Higher efficiency heat transfer systems, fabricated from enhanced strength carbon foam, should reduce fresh water consumption in power plants and industrial chillers.  In addition, the reduction in system sizes should increase the acceptance of distributed energy systems such as microturbines and fuel cells, reduce the volume of aerospace heat exchangers and solar radiators, increase the efficiency of electronics cooling systems, and reduce the radiator size in vehicles.",

Reliance on English is no longer sufficient for trade in the world market, since the most important markets for American goods and services are non-English-speaking areas, especially in growing countries in Asia and the Middle East. In recent years there has been a growing need to offer courses in the less commonly taught languages, including Arabic, Indonesian, and Farsi. Consequently there is a growing need for educational resources to support this training. Finding instructional materials for the less commonly taught languages is frequently a challenge. For the beginners or introductory grade levels in particular, there are almost no textbooks, grammar books, or dictionaries. Finding interactive multimedia materials is even harder.  This means that there is no easy or fast way of learning these languages. For example, although there are thousands of potential learners of Farsi in the U.S. and other countries, it is extremely difficult to offer Farsi as a language course on any given campus due to the heterogeneous backgrounds and needs of students.
