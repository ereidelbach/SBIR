        "abstract": "The Phase II SBIR research proposed here extends and expands upon the results from our successful Phase I research to develop a hand-held electronic nose capable of rapid, sensitive, and accurate detection and identification of a broad range of low vapor pressure (LVP) compounds. The overall goal of this R&amp;D effort is to optimize detection of LVP compounds by improving system signal-to-noise through carefully evaluated modifications to the various subsystems of the device. We propose to enhance the device by: 1) continued development of sensitive chemical sensors for a range of LVP compounds, 2) deploying these chemical sensor on a novel filament substrate that increases signal amplitude, 3) improving the optoelectronics to efficiently illuminate and interrogate the chemical sensors, 4) improving vapor sampling to effectively present LVP odors to the sensor array, and 5) developing new data processing algorithms to reduce sensor signal variability. These enhancements will be incorporated into a new prototype device that will be thoroughly tested and quantitatively characterized. With inclusion of these improvements, our preliminary data provide strong evidence that this Phase II R&amp;D will lead to at least a 10-fold improvement in sensitivity, forming the basis for a commercially viable device for detecting LVP compounds.",

        "abstract": "A fully reconfigurable multi-carrier rf communications system requires a fast, versatile switch matrix, which will permit distribution of various signals between a set of antennas and a set of radios.  This is carried out most efficiently in the digital domain, but requires the use of ultrafast circuits that can accurately process multi-GHz rf signals.  Superconductor electronics can provide high-fidelity rf data converters, as well as fast digital logic circuits, both of which have already been demonstrated by HYPRES.  The present project proposes to apply the same ultrafast technology to the development of a high-speed digital switch matrix that connects the data converters to digital signal processors.  This represents the final essential component to a complete superconducting digital-RF transceiver, which will enable true software-defined radio functionality from the High Frequency (HF) to the Extremely High Frequency (EHF) communications band.  The goal of this Phase II project is to demonstrate a variety of asynchronous multi-rate and multi-casting switch matrices at speeds up to 40 GHz, with extendibility to 160 GHz using the next generation of niobium superconductor integrated circuit technology.",

A virtual laboratory that integrates a physical test-bed with a much larger simulated network, can incorporate realistic physical effects while simultaneously scaling the analysis to much larger networks than are physically accessible. The goal of this project is to develop PAMS, a PArallel, Multi-paradigm Modeling & Simulation environment for scalable, next generation networks.   PAMS will provide a framework where distinct modeling paradigms (i.e., discrete event simulation models, analytical models, operational software, and physical networks) can be integrated seamlessly and interact with operational applications.   Phase 2 will lead to the development of  interfaces and techniques to integrate these diverse paradigms and improve the efficiency of the time synchronization among instances of  the different paradigms.  At the end of Phase 2, we will demonstrate the use of PAMS for an integrated hardware/software/human-in-the-loop simulation of a hierarchical future force network with many thousands of communication devices that include ground, air, and space assets.  We will also demonstrate the use of PAMS in evaluating end-end performance in complex urban environments as well as to demonstrate interoperability between current and future force communication technology.",

Despite the significant lattice mismatch between Si and HgCdTe several companies have demonstrated high performance MBE grown MWIR (3-5 microns)-HgCdTe devices on large-area Si substrates. This success has not translated directly to LWIR (8-12 microns)-HgCdTe detectors because of their increased sensitivity to defects.   Amethyst Research Incorporated (ARI) has proposed that extension of HgCdTe on Si \u2013 based devices to LWIR and beyond can be readily achieved, with minimal modification to present FPA processing, by electrically neutralizing the defects originating at the substrate/epilayer interface using hydrogen passivation.  In Phase I, ARI has demonstrated that hydrogen acts as a passivant in HgCdTe, can be readily introduced into the HgCdTe epilayer in controlled concentrations, and can be introduced at various stages of FPA processing.  In Phase II, and in collaboration with Rockwell Scientific, ARI will develop the hydrogenation technology for full compatibility with HgCdTe FPA processing, improved diode characteristics, and FPA performance. ARI will deliver 640 x 480 LWIR HgCdTe- on Si FPA\u2019s treated with the hydrogenation passivation process, and a fully documented design for a \u2018plug-and-play\u2019 large area hydrogenation system.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this program is to develop a portable biosensor system to facilitate the rapid evaluation of complement activation in injured personnel. Traumatic blood loss and tissue damage resulting from civilian or battlefield trauma leads to complement activation that, if left untreated, contributes to further tissue damage, shock, respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure. Appropriate inhibition of complement activation is expected to limit tissue damage in such cases. However, since complement is central in the protection against infectious agents, extensive inhibition may lead to overwhelming infection and sepsis. The ability to determine and monitor the extent of complement activation in injured personnel is, therefore, the critical first step for providing appropriate inhibition treatment. In Phase I we successfully demonstrated the feasibility of our sensor technology by measuring two key complement proteins. In Phase II, methods developed in the Phase I will be refined and expanded through optimization of sensor and assay design, expansion of the Phase I sensor to a greater number of assays, and the development of a robust, reliable and portable multianalyte assaying system.",

The overall objective of this project is to develop, test, and validate NIRS/DOS instrument for blast lung injury. In Phase I we have developed a prototype device and tested it on animal models. Advanced optical simulations have been conducted to scale the device to human conditions (deeper penetration distance), for device design, and for optimization of source/detector geometry. Phase II work will concentrate on device maturation and on development of ultrasonically enhanced NIRS/DOS detection fur human scale optical penetration depths.

The principal challenge associated with the use of Si-based substrates is the presence of dislocations, created by the large lattice mismatch, that thread into the HgCdTe epilayers and thereby degrade device performance. Our Phase I effort showed that it is possible to passivate dislocations with the introduction of hydrogen atoms using a high density plasma source. Specifically, we found that hydrogen increases carrier recombination lifetimes and mobilities through the passivation of dislocations. In this proposed Phase II effort, we will employ the hydrogen passivation technique to improve the performance of LWIR HgCdTe single-element planar and mesa photodiodes on Si substrates.

Universal Display Corporation (UDC) is developing advanced organic light emitting diode (OLED) technology based on their proprietary high-efficiency phosphorescent OLED (PHOLED\u2122), transparent OLED (TOLED\u2122) and flexible OLED (FOLED\u00ae) technologies all of which are key enabling technologies to this program. The development of novel infrared-emitting PHOLED pixels integrated with UDC\u2019s visible color PHOLED technologies and a poly-Si TFT backplane on flexible metal foil is the best solution to meet the Army\u2019s flexible display requirements. These technologies will enable a high information content display that will not give away a Commander\u2019s position or location during night time situations and therefore will avoid signature detection. PHOLEDs are highly emissive with a wide viewing angle, are compatible with flexible substrates, and provide an all solid state monolithic, low power consumption emissive display technology. Our proposed approach of integrating visible and infrared-emitting OLEDs on a flexible metal foil substrate will also provide a rugged package to ensure survivability in an uncontrolled battlefield environment.",

Stirling Technology Company\u2019s (STC) experience with highly reliable, maintenance-free space power systems has been leveraged to develop a cost-effective, Low-Mass Stirling Power System (LSPS) conceptual design. Substantial mass reduction has been achieved through material selection, advanced alternator and heater head designs, and system-level optimization. In Phase II, STC will complete the final design, fabrication and testing of the lightweight Stirling Convertor Assembly (SCA) coupled to a high-efficiency JP-8 burner. The SCA and burner form the heart of the LSPS system conceptualized in Phase I, and their combined performance will enable the LSPS to deliver a minimum 2.5 kW net electrical output at an overall efficiency of 15%. This design for an LSPS at 2.5 kW will be readily scalable up or down in power, and will be capable of powering Future Combat System hardware in vehicle, robotic, or man-portable platforms.",

IBD can enable medical attendants to routinely diagnose lung hemorrhage and measure oxygen saturation of arterial (SaO2) and venous (SvO2) blood.  It can simultaneously detect lung edema.  The IBD design is compatible with the life support for trauma and transport, and can be used noninvasively in medical trauma centers, ambulances, and rescue helicopters to rapidly assess patient status, even in remote battlefields locations.  In the Phase II prototype, DSPs will control data acquisition, data processing, storage, and display.

First, on the atomistic scale model generation capabilities are needed that allow to create models with large numbers of defects. Second, to effectively solve problems of that size, multiscale simulations have to be applied. This SBIR Phase II will provide technologies to: - effectively define atomic structure problems with large numbers of defects and provide effective mechanism to integrate the information from various atomic level simulation tools. - enable effective multiscale simulation, integrating models from the atomic scale through the macro-scale including the transferring information between the scales. The developed tools will allow other commercial companies to reduce the time to market for their end user multiscale modeling software.

The 3BSM is a dynamic system susceptible to degradation and faults. A robust PHM system would enable diagnosis and prognosis of these faults, thus reducing maintenance cost and risk.     The PHM prototype developed during Phase I consisted of algorithms and models for fault detection, usage monitoring, and remaining useful life prediction for bearings, lubricant, hot section duct, motors and valves. During Phase II Impact proposes to further develop, enhance and verify the Phase I algorithms. As part of this effort, Impact proposes to provide near real-time monitoring of the JSF 3BSM in a test cell environment whenever such opportunities exist. This monitoring capability will employ advanced high temperature sensors and the aforementioned PHM models and algorithms for fault detection of critical 3BSM components.

Polarization provides additional information in these difficult detection scenarios and has strong potential to address a variety of Army and MDA needs. For midcourse scenarios, debris and decoy clouds, low thermal contrast, and target orientation determination can be addressed through the proposed imaging polarimeter.  For the re-entry phase of an RV\u2019s trajectory, this imaging polarization sensor can provide aimpoint selection and orientation determination in the presence of a wake in the same manner as for boost phase in the presence of a plume.  Polaris Sensor Technologies is developing such an imaging polarimeter incorporating an on-demand polarizer based on liquid crystal (LC) technology.  The liquid crystal cell modulates the polarization rather than the intensity of the transmitted light.  When the polarization mode is switched off, the liquid crystal does not limit the amount of unpolarized light reaching the focal plane due to the inherent loss of photons at the polarizer.

        "abstract": "As C4ISR systems continue to grow in size and complexity, the associated systems engineering efforts of architecting, design, integration, and adaptation becomes increasingly more difficult and costly.  This is not surprising because the engineering of a C4ISR system is predominantly a manual process at present and, consequently, error-prone.  COTS architecture design tools do not possess the requisite semantics and capabilities to support large-scale system of systems architecture development efforts that involve multiple geographically distributed teams of individuals with different specialties and perspectives on architecture-related issues.  In Phase I of this effort, we researched best practices in architecture development as well as architectural issues in tactical task organization.  We identified gaps in commercial tools relative to DoDAF requirements as well as challenges to developing an integrated approach.  We developed the system concept and technical architecture for a C4ISR toolkit/design support system that overcomes key limitations in existing tools.  In Phase II, we will refine the design of this support system based on lessons learned in Phase I, and then implement and transition this support system to defense, aerospace, and academic environments for evaluation and continued evolution.",

Specifically, POC demonstrated that soil texture at a particular observation point can be classified in situ in a few minutes (not hours as in conventional methods) by a minimally trained operator.  In addition, repeated measurements can be taken easily under computer control, increasing SOTCIS accuracy and reliability.   The SOTCIS architecture consists of two interconnected subsystems: the prediction level subsystem (PLS) and the measurement level subsystem (MLS).  The PLS determines expected soil texture types and recommends methods of soil properties measurement relevant to the inferred soil landscape.  The MLS measures three major soil properties:  particle size distribution, plasticity, and organic matter content.  Data collected by the MLS at the site along with GPS positioning information is saved in Army GIS-complaint format.  In Phase II POC will integrate the PLS and MLS with GPS and geophysical devices, and perform field test SOTCIS to predict soil textures in accordance with the USCS system.",

        "abstract": "In order to enhance missile performance, future missile designs will incorporate domes with a more aerodynamic shape than the traditional hemisphere.  Significant additional benefits in areas of performance and cost reduction would be realized if a new material with more robust properties and the ability to be formed to near net shape replaced more common materials, such as sapphire.  One promising replacement is polycrystalline alumina (PCA) with sub-micron grain size.  It can be made to have improved toughness and nearly the same optical transmission in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR) band as sapphire.  There is no established fabrication process suitable for this material or the aerodynamic shapes of interest; conventional finishing processes used to manufacture flat and spherical optics are not appropriate for such complex shapes.  A process that utilizes Magnetorheological Finishing (MRF\u00ae) and newly developed MR Jet\u2122 provides significant and unique advantages for finishing both the convex and concave surfaces of such conformal shapes.  Work in Phase I demonstrated the suitability for MRF and MR Jet to finish PCA material, as well as the advantages of using MR Jet to finish the concave surface of domes to achieve extremely high precision.  The work in Phase II will be a collaborative effort that will culminate in finished ogive domes suitable for testing in missile systems.",

The fluorescence lifetime of the target fluorophores is measured using the principle of \u201cfrequency-domain\u201d or \u201cphase-locked\u201d detection, a method that is totally insensitive to the excitation or fluorescence emission light intensity levels as well as insensitive to any background stray light. The detected lifetime signals are processed using fast software algorithms and displayed in real time in a spatially resolved 3-dimensional fluorescent lifetime image of the battlefield. As world governments have become more attentive to the potential threat of chemical and biological weapons, a premium has been place on technologies capable of reliably identifying airborne threats.

        "abstract": "Image noise is often a limiting factor in target detection and recognition using infrared cameras. Many techniques exist for limiting temporal noise, but the predominant solution for fixed pattern noise correction is radiometric non-uniformity correction (NUC). This adds moving parts to the camera design and requires taking the camera off-line every 10 minutes or so during operation. Our proposed scene-based (SB) NUC alternative uses real-time image processing to perform NUC continuously during normal camera operation. In Phase I we prototyped the best known SBNUC algorithms and evaluated them on video sequences exhibiting widely varying fixed pattern and temporal noise. We also characterized their performance as a function of image motion (due to camera or scene motion). Consequently, we identified the optimal operating conditions for three types of SBNUC algorithms: constant statistics, motion compensated temporal filtering, and spatial filtering. In Phase II we propose to develop image analysis algorithms capable of determining the camera\u2019s current operating condition in real-time, and hence specifying the most effective SBNUC to use for each video frame. Through our partner Nova Sensors, our algorithm suite will be implemented as an FPGA-accelerated dedicated image processor for NVESD\u2019s SE-IR cameras, enabling extensive system evaluations outside laboratory environments.",

        "abstract": "Sensor Electronic Technology, Inc. proposes a radically different approach for pushing the GaN HEMT performance above the 200 GHz range.  In this approach, called Drain Gate Recess, the shape of the recessed gate is such that the gate metal is CLOSER to the channel near the drain edge of the channel.  The result is a variation of the device threshold voltage along the channel that makes the electric field along the channel much more uniform and might roughly double the average electron velocity in the channel.  The conventional approach for improving the performance of GaN HEMTs involves field plates that work by introducing a metal gate extension over a dielectric.  The gate extension splits the high field region under the gate (typically at the drain side of the gate) between two high field regions rather than one, reducing the maximum field.  This results in (a) increase in the breakdown voltage and (b) improved device reliability.  Although the field plate approach reduces the maximum electric field under the gate, the additional capacitance and corresponding velocity profile limit high frequency operation for these devices.  We propose a radically different approach for pushing the GaN HEMT performance above the 200 GHz range.",

Currently, this integration process has been difficult to accomplish due to various factors: diversity of medical information systems, lack of universal data standards, plethora of data formats (text,images,video, audio), and the semantic mismatch between the different systems. The last issue, that of semantic integration, is particularly difficult. Dynamic integration involves the use of an integration engine that can perform semantic mapping of the different systems involved. Semantic interoperability is a challenging technical problem. Given any two (database) schemas, it is difficult to automatically map data elements to each other. Syntactically identical element names/labels may represent semantically different entities. Conversely, the same semantic element (such as a patient name) might be represented through different data structures in the two information systems.

The proposed research will analyze candidate repeater architectures.  Emphasis will be placed on cost, size, weight, power, functionality, time-to-market, ruggedness, and ability to be upgraded.  The repeater will be designed to operate at VHF and UHF, and will be compatible with radios and waveforms currently used by Special Operations Forces.  Attention will be given to system issues to insure the repeater fits in seamlessly with current hardware.  For example, cosite issues will be carefully examined.  The architecture will also be chosen such that use of the repeater will not involve soldier interaction that would detract from the main purpose of a mission.  The hardware architecture will be designed to accept several types of power sources, including external power.",

The proposed tools interface with commercial off-the-shelf products and are designed to streamline the HCI design and development process without forcing DD(X) personnel to significantly change the process they currently follow.  The approach centers on working closely with the ship system integrator industry to obtain input from experienced individuals to identify what is needed in engineering tools so as to develop HCIs that 1) promote commonality within the Total Ship Computing Environment (TSCE), 2) adhere to the Navy\u2019s proposed Open Architecture Computing Environment guidelines and 3) reduce lifecycle costs.  During Phase I of this SBIR, Harmonia identified four DD(X) engineering problem areas based on DD(X) program priorities and targeted HCI tools to address them.  Harmonia also worked on defining performance and functional requirements, identifying potential risks, conducting selected prototyping activities, and assessing commercial viability.  During Phase II, Harmonia will develop functioning versions of each of the tools that comprise the DD(X) HCI Tool Suite and provide training, guidance, and other support activities to the DD(X) program.",

        "abstract": "Today's SIGINT systems need to perform more tasks than ever before.  This requires separate, often bulky, pieces of equipment connected by many cables.  Employing multiple boxes does not conform to the U.S. Army's Future Combat Systems vision of fielding an \"Objective Force\" that is lighter, more mobile, agile, and sustainable.  Therefore, what is needed is a product that can perform advanced SIGINT functions all in one single unit.  Field operations will be greatly enhanced by such a smaller, lighter, one-box Sensor solution.  The purpose of this SBIR is to build such a next-generation SIGINT Sensor. The SIGINT Sensors that will be developed by NetworkFab will be multi frequency band, fast RF signal capture, DF, collection, and DSP analysis systems all-in-one.  They will be the fastest and most sophisticated SIGINT Sensors in the industry today.  Modularity and flexibility will be designed in to allow custom-built-to-order deliveries that match each customers' particular SIGINT requirements.  Once deployed, the Sensors will augment the Army's existing SIGINT networks and/or be a powerful node in a network of systems.  This next generation SIGINT Sensor will help to transform the U.S. Army into the FCS vision of a supremely agile, spectrum dominant force for the 21st century.",

        "abstract": "Active multistatic sonar systems have become the preferred solution for shallow water undersea warfare missions. Most airborne active multistatic systems operate in the low frequency range to provide increased range and reverberation resistance. Tactical follow up to large area search and target tracking are better accomplished by using higher frequencies, which provide high range resolution and speed computation. Tactical platforms such as the MH-60R multi-mission helicopter conduct tactical defensive and offensive operations in support of the battle group. They operate in a multistatic mode with the bow sonar source onboard the surface combatant and with their own onboard Airborne Low Frequency Sonar (ALFS) sonar by deploying sonobuoys to receive and transmit the echoes to the helicopter. These systems operate at a higher frequency than where the current receiving sonobuoys operate. Therefore, to optimally operate in a multistatic mode with these higher frequency sources, a new receiver is required which operates in the mid-frequency range of the ship sonars and ALFS. This new receiver will be compatible with existing digital RF links and employ in-buoy beamforming and processing. This new receiver will be capable of significant increase in weapon system operational performance over today\u2019s receivers.",

We propose a principled approach to information fusion in the context of Situation Development that is grounded in formal models and methods.  Situation development involves fusing information from battlefield sources in an attempt to understand what the enemy forces are doing or intending to do.  What makes this problem challenging is its dependence on deep domain knowledge concerning battlefield characteristics, enemy unit composition/disposition, patterns of enemy activities, etc. along with an ability to abductively reason from partial information to plausible hypotheses.  Phase I focused on demonstrating the feasibility of an ontologically-based automated reasoning approach to producing hypotheses of enemy activities; the fusion capabilities embodied in this approach were related to a formal process model representing an extension of the JDL model.  Phase II will involve 1) the development of a functional prototype of a situation development assistant that will generate ordered lists of plausible hypotheses of enemy activity, 2) investigation of tools for developing domain knowledge and working with hypotheses, and 3) an extended process model for level 2 fusion.

Next, we will refine our toolkit to fully support prototyping multimodal interface techniques and evaluating them in a simulation environment. Then, we will execute the evaluation plan developed under Phase I.  Finally, we will identify and pursue Phase III transition and commercialization opportunities for the resulting human-system interface.",

        "abstract": "Air Traffic Control (ATC) has received little attention as part of military simulation environments. Where ATC is played, it is typically only in a limited way, reducing the realism and validity of the results, and using human controllers, thereby increasing the cost of running the exercise. To address these needs, we propose the research and development of an automated air traffic control network appliance, called AutoATC, that can perform ATC tasks in simulation environments by interacting with human and synthetic pilots in natural ways, using standard military communications protocols. The AutoATC capability can be tailored to specific simulation exercises and environments, by allowing the user to switch between standard network protocols, and by providing information particular to the exercise\u2019s scenario before running or by passing dynamic updates while the exercise is in progress. Based on Phase I research in ATC task and language analysis, we propose to use a cognitive systems approach to developing a human behavior model of the ATC tasks, which can be used in different configurations for the needs of particular exercises. By taking a human-like cognitive systems approach, the behavior of the system can be made explainable and, therefore, more trusted and used.",

The second is to find ways to make model generation more efficient with the goal of eventual automation via finding specific ways to streamline workflows.   Of prime importance for this system are capabilities to: - map the total site of interest -- structures and surrounding terrain -- with accuracy, efficiency, and robustness; - utilize/add new data in model construction from multiple image sources and other externally acquired data; and - generate results (i.e., models) that can be transitioned for use in current and future Navy programs.

Thus novel lightweight, ultrahigh strength materials are needed to meet the ever-increasing challenges of weight reduction. The proposed SBIR Phase II program will involve: (1) designing, developing, and manufacturing a novel class of lightweight nanostructured metal matrix composites (NMMCs) with ultrahigh strength,hardness, and high impact energy that can be used for future lightweight ballistic armor package systems; (2) further identifying the underlying technical issues that govern the fabrication and performance of these novel composites; (3) using this knowledge to design and manufacture novel lightweight ballistic armor systems that exhibit high survivability characteristics as required by the Army; and (4) implementing technology transfer for commercial production of armor products that satisfies all of the required performance metrics.  These objectives are based upon the findings and success of Phase I that demonstrated: (1) the feasibility of Al-based NMMCs that can be potentially applied to lightweight ballistic armor systems, and (2) the feasibility of selecting mechanical milling as a process to fabricate nanostructured NMMCs powders, followed by consolidation into bulk geometries.  The proposed NMMCs are based upon innovative concepts demonstrated through recent developments in the synthesis of both nanostructured materials and metal matrix composites (MMCs).  Specifically, we will develop and manufacture nanostructured Al alloy based NMMCs that are reinforced with sub-micrometer- or micrometer-sized B4C or SiC particles.  The proposed Phase II research will focus on issues in optimizing parameters such as processing and material systems used.  In addition to ultrahigh strength and lightweight properties, other advantages of NMMCs over current armor materials include low cost, better formability, multi-hit capability, and compact size.  The NMMCs are intended for lightweight armor materials that will improve both the design and the fabrication of future armor package systems with unprecedented weight reduction.",

        "abstract": "Although improvements in body armor have had a significant impact on reducing mortality in soldiers, ballistic damage to appendages such as arms and legs often results in loss of function or loss of the entire limb, leading to significant reductions in warfighter capability, and an increased medical logistics burden.  At present, the ability to restore appendages or organ function in humans is marginal.  However, the fact that many vertebrate organisms can regenerate developing limb buds and that humans can regenerate the tips of their fingers suggest that the genetic capacity for regeneration is present but \u201cturned off\u201d in adult humans.  Consequently, a genetic and biochemical understanding of how regeneration occurs in an adult salamander could lead to insights as to how to \u201cturn on\u201d the latent regeneration cascade in humans, hence, leading to significant new therapies for battlefield wounds.  This SBIR application proposes to address the general problem of tissue repair and regeneration in mammals by using the Urodele salamander\u2019s ability to grow an ectopic limb as an assay to rapidly screen different factors for regenerative activity.  We believe that the development and use of this assay will eventually lead to the discovery and development of strategies for promoting the scarless healing of wounds and even the regeneration of severely damaged limbs.",

        "abstract": "Dampers in the present articulated rotor systems are all completely passive devices. They are high maintenance components in which internal dynamic seals are constantly subjected to sustained high vibratory pressures and motions causing fatigue and ultimate failure. Consequently, conventional dampers are among the most expensive maintenance items on helicopters and yet have unsatisfactory reliability. All conventional approaches to improving damper reliability have failed to recognize that dampers can be substantially improved if designed as active, or semi-active, rather than passive devices. We intend to revolutionize rotor damper technology by developing smart dampers that introduce damping into the rotor ONLY when required. Damping-on-demand is the only logical answer to the basic dilemma of lead-lag damper design. Damping is critical for the safe operation of helicopters; however, large amount of damping is necessary only for a small fraction of the vehicle flight regimes and for only limited portions of the flight spectrum. Lower internal pressures may enable designs with fewer dynamic seals thus even further improving component reliability. Our innovative smart damping concept can be applied to both hydraulic and fluid-elastic devices with equal facility. We propose to develop smart main rotor dampers that exhibit markedly lower lifecycle costs compared with currently available dampers by means of actively adapting to various flight conditions. Projected annual savings to the military: $97 million.",

        "abstract": "The pressure to reduce weight and maintain performance and safety is a significant driver in aviation technology development programs. Fuel and fuel systems are major contributors to weight on aircraft, including fuel cells, fittings, access panels and support structures.  The design of the fuel cell is dictated by requirements to integrate the fuel cell into the aircraft structure, facilitate access and maintenance, and most importantly to protect the warfighter in the event of a crash or assault.  The objective of the current program is to reduce the parasitic weight of MIL-DTL-27422 Type I, Class A fuel tanks by 50% below the lightest weight system construction currently qualified, which has a construction weight of approximately 0.9 lb/ft2 of surface area. The lightweight bladder construction should continue to meet all of the performance requirements of MIL-DTL-27422, allow easy removal and replacement at the unit maintenance level, and be scaleable and affordable. METSS proposes to address the program objectives through a combination of materials design changes including (1) a reduction in the number of laminate plies used in the existing MIL-DTL-27422 panel construction through the use of stronger, tougher, more damage and impact tolerant fabrics, (2) the use of lighter weight fabrics, and (3) by replacing the self-sealing layer with more effective sealing materials.  Based on the Phase I program results, METSS is targeting a total panel areal density of 0.30 lb/ft2 under the Phase II program. Importantly, the Phase II program plan includes full MIL-DTL-27422 Phase I test qualification and Phase II product qualification for an existing helicopter fuel cell design.",

The high level of redundancy enables sensitive detection while minimizing the effects of non-specific binding. Target specificity is achieved through highly selective interactions at the micro-cavity surface. The prototype integrated optical sensor will be tested on threat simulants in our laboratories, and real agents at a DoD facility such as the Water Security Research Test Loop. The results of these tests will provide a critical design review that will ultimately result in a Phase III commercialization product.

        "abstract": "Advanced coated conductor development for high current carrying capacity HTS wires and tapes requires a high current density and also a large YBCO film thickness in the coated conductor.  The inclusion of secondary phase particles, i.e., Chemical Pinning, is a highly viable approach to increase Jc from a production point of view, especially since in our application of metal organic chemical vapour deposition to coated conductor development, the chemical pinning step can be performed in situ during the growth of the superconducting layer without adding another step to a technological scheme.  This Phase II proposal will encompass the deposition of extended lengths of YBCO coated conductor onto continuously moving buffered metallic substrates, with the integration of the Chemical Pinning approach to increase Jc through the incorporation of Y2O3 secondary phase nano-inclusions, as well as through the growth of thick YBCO layers (~ 10 &#61549;m), in order to enhance the coated conductor performance to the 1,000 A/cm-width level.  The existing MetOx MOCVD facilities will be utilized in the fabrication of a quantity of 10+ metres of the high performance YBCO tape.  In addition, the Phase II plan will include the winding of pancake coils to test the performance of the coated conductor in actual coil configurations.",

        "abstract": "Conventional piezoelectric ceramic flap actuators have exhibited inadequate levels of stroke and/or force required to produce an angle of rotation in excess of \u00b16\u00b0 at 40 Hz. Single crystals represent a revolutionary advance in piezoelectric actuator technology.  Because crystal electromechanical properties are significantly different than those of ceramic, it should be expected that the use of crystals requires motion amplification techniques that are tailored to crystal behavior. This proposal describes a new, high authority trailing edge flap actuator concept for helicopter rotor blade vibration control that has been specifically designed for single crystal stack actuators. Invercon has analytically and experimentally evaluated the feasibility of using single crystals together with a novel, high-moment, high-displacement, buckling beam flap actuator concept, which is well-suited for single crystal stack actuation. Experimental results show that the buckling beam actuator can dramatically outperform state-of-the-art flap actuators, such as the X-frame, with the capability of displacing a 36 \u201c flap \u00b15\u00ba at 40 Hz under representative aerodynamic loading at 400 RPM.  Such actuators also consist of less parts, and are significantly lighter than existing designs.  The technology developed in Phase II will enable future Army technologies such as swashplateless rotors and trailing edge flaps for heavy lift rotorcraft.",

The Army loses an average of $58 million and 14 lives each year to obstacle strikes and the civilian helicopter industry is similarly devastated.  The ROAD is designed to provide pilots with an easily understood display of obstacles 360 degrees around the aircraft and provide auditory or tactile alerts to the cue the pilot to the most immediate unseen threats, especially those within 100 meters. Expert Army and civilian pilots have participated in structured interviews and simulator sessions to define the required content, format, and behavior of the ROAD, and are highly supportive of the concept.  Feasibility studies have shown that a short-range sensor and a terrain database can meet the defined requirements.  In Phase II, a specially designed flight simulator will be fabricated and employed in formal experiments to finalize the ROAD design. The testing of the pilot interface design concepts in the experiments will ensure that the ROAD is optimized for use during approach-to-landing, hover, landing, and take-off maneuvers, and reduces pilot workload while maximizing his situation awareness.",

        "abstract": "The proposed research effort addresses two main shortcomings in  the  state-of-art GPS anti-jam systems. One of them relates to antenna size and the other pertains to performance limitation imposed by antenna electronics implementations. The current antenna array GAS-1 CRPA has seven antenna elements and extends 14in diameter, making it too large for airborne platforms of interest. A modified version of this antenna array GAS-1 CRPA is significantly smaller in size (seven inches in diameter) but incorporates only four antenna elements, thus limiting its nulling capabilities under severe jamming conditions.  Ubiquitous use of GPS systems on missiles and airborne platforms  does, of course, imply a need for smaller real estate without compromise in anti-jamming capability.  Our Phase I work resulted in a novel miniature GPS antenna that can allow for a 4.25\" GPS array, and during Phase II  we propose to  develop and test such an array for GPS applications. We will still maintain 8 ports for agility in nulling and beamforming , and we will also consider platform effects in evaluating the performance of the new GPS array.",

We propose developing an Interactive Storytelling Architecture for Training (ISAT) using an intelligent agent, the director, that assembles training scenarios designed to test the skill level of specific trainees. The director also acts in the course of the execution of the training scenario to provide indirect feedback about trainee actions, subtly adapting the training environment to stress skills and suggest remediation.  The ISAT prototype will show how the director can use a skill model both to create a multi-scene training narrative to test specific skills and also to act within the evolution of a scene to provide feedback and guidance to a trainee.  Implementation will enable preliminary evaluation of ISAT. We will use three evaluation dimensions to evaluate ISAT\u2014authenticity of context, training effectiveness, and cost factors.",

In several recent development efforts, it has been demonstrated that manmade objects have a significantly stronger polarization signal than natural backgrounds resulting in good contrast that complements the conventionally imaged infrared signature.  Other recent research has suggested that polarization sensing may increase detection range through optically dense media such as fog or aerosol laden atmosphere.  However, these experimental systems frequently require long data acquisition times, which results in artifacts in the polarization imagery due to platform or target motion.  Additionally, calibration and investigation of systematic errors in these systems is difficult and robust calibration procedures have not been fully demonstrated.

On the other hand, it is clear that stochastic pursuit-evasion game problem spans a wide range covering various fields in optimal control, dynamic game, filtering, tracking, artificial intelligence and cooperative control.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase-II project further develops an exciting new invention in the field of quantum cryptography that will secure the physical layer of today's ubiquitous fiber-optic data networks. Unlike the techniques that are based on single-photon states which are confined to low bit rates and short distances, our approach is based on coherent states emitted by ordinary lasers that permits scaling to data-rates used in today's networks as well as deployment over realistic distances (>500 km). Our Phase-I project showed via simulations and experiments that operation of our data encryption technology in today\u2019s WDM networks is possible. We demonstrated data rates of 622Mb/s over 500 km in a live WDM network. We also created a block-level design for a system that would operate at 2.5Gb/s. In this Phase-II, we propose to build and demonstrate such a 2.5Gb/s optical encryption system. In addition to the rate upgrade, several other improvements will be made to the system to increase its security level, performance, and practicality. For instance, we will use the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to generate the internal stream cipher, exploit FEC coding and balanced detection, as well as include a method for automatically synchronizing the encryptor with the decryptor.",

The proposed simulation engine will hybridize a versatile full-wave technique like the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method with fast high frequency asymptotic techniques such as the Shooting and Bouncing Rays (SBR) method. The resulting approach will provide the accuracy of full-wave techniques where higher resolutions are needed and small structural details have to be taken into account. It also benefits from the computational efficiency of asymptotic techniques in the large-scale areas. The interface between the two techniques is defined based on the concept of Huygens surfaces. The proposed CAD tool will be demonstrated for vehicle-mounted antenna systems in complex propagation scenes as well as co-site interference in military vehicular communication systems.",

The Phase I SBIR studies recently demonstrated plasma sprayed hard coating concepts that show significantly greater damping than has been observed in previous investigations. Polymer-impregnated plasma sprayed coatings exhibited over 6 times the damping of typical plasma sprayed damping coatings at low dynamic strains and close to twice the damping at higher strains. High-cycle fatigue tests showed only a 10% drop in the maximum tolerable load when compared with specimens with no coating. Phase II efforts will investigate the effect of processing parameters on damping and overall mechanical properties. Studies will also include damping, fatigue, erosion, impact investigations and spin-pit testing of coated airfoils. The development of robotic manipulation programs for robotic plasma spraying of complex shaped prototype blades will provide consistent plasma sprayed coatings. A concerted effort to study a large sample of plasma sprayed damping metal and ceramic coatings in conjunction with the investigation of other viscoelastic materials should provide a significant number of candidate coating systems with exceptional damping properties over a wide temperature range.",

        "abstract": "The control of modern underwater vehicles presents a number of challenges, including significant nonlinearities in the vehicle dynamics and a potentially large suite of control effectors with widely differing properties.  Current generation control architectures for submarines are often characterized by independent control loops for each actuator or for different vehicle axes, which are not able to explicitly address interactions among loops, particularly nonlinear interactions, or to combine the full suite of control effectors to produce a desired vehicle response.  In Phase I, the team began developing inner-loop control approaches that address these deficiencies, and demonstrated these methods through their application to a fast-attack submarine model. The approaches combine model predictive control with a quadratic or piecewise linear programming based control allocator that explicitly accounts for actuator saturation nonlinearities.   The Phase II effort will focus on refining the design methodology so that it can be used to rapidly implement a control law for any specific vehicle of interest.   The proposed Phase II research effort will also add path planning and state estimation capabilities to provide a complete guidance and control system for submersibles.

Although generally accepted as the answer to such problems MEMS based products have well known disadvantages:  they have a natural increase in inaccuracy related to decreases in size, are difficult to manufacture reliably, and are costly.  For this reason the US Army is looking for alternative solutions in several applications including the One Tactical Engagement Simulation System (OneTESS).  OneTESS is developing a system for training which requires a high-precision, low cost, low power six degree-of-freedom sensor which can be embedded within the weaponry of soldiers able to track accurately the location and pointing vector of the weapons in order to take the place of traditional laser based systems used in army tactical training exercises.  Innalabs\u2019 unique six degree-of-freedom inertial measurement unit makes use of a sensor design that is based on the sensing of movement of a single proof mass suspended in a ferrofluid.  Through our Phase I effort we were able to show its ability to act as an angular and linear accelerometer in 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF).

        "abstract": "The Army has a strong need for very high-energy density (> 1000 WH/kg), light weight power sources for communications and other advanced electronic devices. The possible solution is replacing the battery with hydrogen based proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell. However, hydrogen storage and handling is a problem. Direct oxidation fuel cell (DOFC) with a PEM is quite attractive alternative. However, due to slow reduction and oxidation kinetics in the acidic media and fuel crossover issue, those systems have not reached their full potentials. It is well known that electrochemical oxidation of fuel and electrochemical reductions of oxygen are kinetically more favorable in an alkaline media at low temperature (T < 100oC). Therefore, alkaline electrolyte offers the best prospects for using non-noble metal as the catalyst. An alkaline electrolyte based direct oxidation fuel cell could provide a promising route toward the compact, high specific energy power sources.  Driven by the strong market pull for this technology, eVionyx Inc, a subsidiary of Reveo Inc., has conducted extensive investigations into solutions to those problems in the Phase I program. A novel direct oxidation alkaline fuel cell was developed and tested. In the phase II program, we are going to further develop the technology. By the end of the program, we expect that a prototype AFC will be delivered that meet the program objectives, i.e. to design, construct and evaluate a portable AFC that can deliver a specific energy of more than 1000 Wh/kg at 20W power with a total energy of 1.4 kWH.",

The pivotal role of microwave tubes in many on-board systems makes them a natural choice for careful optimization. Unfortunately, presently available software for modeling beam devices does not support the robust, automated optimization capabilities required for optimal tube design.  To address this critical need, we will link modern statistical optimizers to several established codes used for modeling microwave tube guns, collectors, and interaction circuits.

This system will allow three-dimensional parametric shape optimization in guns and collectors, optimization of external parameters such as collector plate voltages, and the optimization of interaction circuits.

Due to the dilution effect, the areas upstream of the utility plant are not of much concern.  The hazard associated with CB attacks downstream of the utility plant are currently not well understood and these form the focus of the proposed effort.   The goal of this project is to develop an accurate fate and transport model and interface it with sensors and disinfectant feeders via the SCADA system to effectively monitor, detect, and neutralize CB agents introduced into water distribution systems.  We selected an existing public domain hydraulics code called EPANET as the platform for the proposed effort.  It is extensively used by the U.S. Army, the EPA and in the industry.  During the proposed SBIR project, we will add necessary models and databases to EPANET and validate the model through tests in simulated water distribution loops.  We will also interface the model with a representative SCADA system.   The model can be used by military installations, the war fighter in the field or in foreign lands and by the water supply industry to monitor the water distribution networks for CB attacks and malfunctions in water treatment plants.

        "abstract": "YBCO film through MOD approach is one of the most cost effective methods for long length CC fabrications. Although, this process has shown success on films below 1 micron, thicker films with the performance goal of 500-1000 A/cm have not been demonstrated even on small samples. Hence, long length thicker films of 1-3 micron through MOD approach with pinning center enhancement are yet to be fully developed to attain higher Ic and Je. High-density nanoscale pinning centers is the only way to keep Jc from dramatic degradation for thick films. In Phase I the feasibility of Ic>286A/cm and Jc>2.4 MA/cm2 for 1.2 micron YBCO films has been demonstrated. In Phase II, we propose to further increase the Ic limit and scale-up thicker film fabrication process. The major tasks will include: (1) optimization of MOD process steps on short lengths of RABiTS, IBAD and ISD substrates with appropriate buffers for thicker YBCO films (>2 micron) with high density nano pinning centers, and (2) scale-up of the optimized process to longer (>1 meter) tapes. UES has teamed up with Oxford Instruments for RABiTS and Los Alamos National Laboratory for IBAD substrates for the Phase II research.",

        "abstract": "The proceedings from the 16 August 1999 HCF Probabilistics Steering Committee meeting indicate that material behavior is a leading root cause of HCF problems in blades, vanes, and seals. A conventionally used component lifing practice is to conduct a Goodman type analysis to estimate the resistance to HCF failure. However the true resistance of a component to HCF loading is dependent on the steady and vibratory stress gradients and the stressed volume of material. Because Goodman diagrams are based on specimens of simple geometry that do not have the same stress gradients as the component, the Goodman diagram provides only a rough estimate of fatigue response. This SBIR will build on an existing VEXTEC material fatigue response model, MICRO (microstructural-based probabilistic fatigue analysis), to properly account for the multi-scale aspect of early fatigue damage that drives the scatter in fatigue response. The ultimate SBIR objective will be to develop capability for accurately predicting HCF damage effects for a complex component (JSF 1st stage fan blade) based on a minimal amount of simple. In effect, this product will be a computationally efficient Goodman analysis that will allow for accelerated design analysis, redesign avoidance, less testing and minimal build-in design conservatism.",

A wideband antenna or a set of antennas are needed to support operation across the entire frequency spectrum of JTRS. To meet this need, Applied EM is proposing an innovative conformal design, which addresses the issues of ultra wide bandwidth, and conformality. The proposed design employs a novel material design to increase the bandwidth of conformal antennas. A unique design that covers the VHF/UHF bands and above (20-2000MHz) is proposed. For this adaptation,  broadband antenna design will be optimized using emerging materials and scaling for a design which satisfies the required size restrictions and satisfies gain, pattern, and return loss requirements. Under the proposed effort, we will develop engineering prototype antennas and validate the design through measurements. A design optimization study will also be conducted for placement of the antenna set on the aircraft. Field measurements are proposed to integrate the antenna with JTR System. Development of these ultra wideband antenna designs will provide for robust antenna systems capable of providing interface not only to JTRS, but also to a wide variety of broadband communication equipment.",

        "abstract": "The first and a key stage in military planning is the intelligence preparation of the battlespace (IPB). IPB is a continuous process that defines the battlespace environment and its effects and determines and evaluates likely enemy actions. Typically, characterization of the battlespace and its effects has focused on: performing terrain and spatial analysis (delineation of areas of operation, avenues of approach, cover and concealment, etc.); determining effects of weather on military operations (e.g. on mobility); and use of demographic information (population, cultural effects) to guide rules of engagement. However, a critical need exists to integrate the potential effects hazardous chemicals and material may have on subsequent mission plans. The presence of industrial toxic chemicals and materials can have a dramatic impact on mission success and is seen as a key impediment to force protection. Here we propose an Automated Toxicity Hazard Assessment Decision-aiding System (ATHADS) to support enhanced mission planning. Our approach leverages three synergistic technologies: intelligent agent-based information retrieval of toxicology data; a rule-based mechanism for information filtering based on retrieved information; and a Bayesian belief network approach to environmental hazard assessment and prediction. We see considerable potential for this approach in enhancing mission planning systems for operational forces.",

While this allows for great flexibility in implementing system modifications, it hinders the ability of the engineer or technician from analyzing problems and anomalies across the processors in the system.  In order to meet the in-service engineering support requirements that multiprocessor Navy systems require, a tool must be developed that provides the engineer or technician the ability to view, observe and analyze firmware instructions and data in real-time across multiple processors.  The driving force behind the development of the Firmware Analysis Test System (FATS) is to allow more comprehensive analysis of multiprocessor systems in the fleet.  The FATS meets this requirement and would be invaluable in all phases of Navy programs: development, production, installation and maintenance.   The FATS equipment will allow the Navy to improve performance of fielded systems at reduced costs.  The Phase II objective is to develop a fully functional prototype FATS unit.",

The design proceeds from engine cycle performance and meanline design through 3D viscous flow calculations (CFD) and finite element structural analysis (FEA).  Design studies may traverse this process many times, with routine tasks performed by engineers in a trial-and-error manner. The current turbomachinery design system integrates the initial meanline design considerations, the details of sophisticated blade design, modern CFD analysis, and structural and thermo-mechanical FEA.  Some knowledge-based engineering (KBE) aspects are applied to guide the initial design setup in directions of proven design techniques, and historical design and performance data is used to validate and calibrate the design tools. In addition, the iSIGHT optimization code is currently used to refine the specific vane shapes.   In the proposed work, KBE and multi-disciplinary optimization (MDO) will be employed to improve the turbomachinery design process by capturing critical design knowledge, automating routine design tasks, and optimizing the balance between conflicting design goals and criteria.  The open and extensible design system will use KBE to guide the engineer in performing design modifications, exploring trade studies, applying design criteria, and performing MDO.",

In the battlefield as well in rural areas of the US and in underdeveloped areas of the world, CTs are not available. Near infrared (NIR) may be a practical solution because of the unique light-absorbing properties of hemoglobin. In pilot studies conducted at Baylor College of Medicine by Dr. Claudia Robertson and Dr. Shankar Gopinath using the RunMan\u2122 NIR monitor, sensitivity for extracerebral (epidural and subdural) hematomas was 100% and sensitivity for intracerebral hematomas was 98%. There were no false positives. The pilot data demonstrates that the detection of presence of any type of hematoma is feasible with NIR. The main objective of this study is to develop a NIR monitor designed to detect the presence of an intracranial hematoma in the field settings.

Like thermal batteries, lithium oxyhalide batteries have unactivated storage lives in excess of 20 years and are mechanically rugged.  Some of the main advantages that lithium oxyhalide batteries offer are flat discharge voltage profiles and potentially long operating lives. However, battery performance deteriorates significantly when the temperature is less than  \u201320  degrees Celsius.  To preserve the advantages that lithium oxyhalide batteries have and extend them to low temperatures, we will develop a means to heat a cold electrolyte extremely rapidly--in less than two seconds--dramatically improving low temperature performance.  Key to this development will be to minimize any weight penalty associated with the rapid heating mechanism.  In Phase I, we proved the feasibility of our rapid heating approach.  In Phase II, we will demonstrate the approach under prototypical conditions.",

In Phase I work AHA demonstrated a significant reduction in near-field reverberation with mid-frequency active in-water test data using a short-time adaptive broadband adaptive beamformer (STABB).

These resin films were developed in many different areal weights and were vacuum encapsulated for long-term storage.  This approach provides a film or films that can be selected according to the fiber preform weight and cut to shape depending on the repair dimensions.

        "abstract": "Sensors are playing an increasingly important role in the Navy fleet. The advantages of wireless sensors are numerous, but the drawback of requiring frequent battery replacement outweighs the advantages in most instances. Adding RF power scavenging permits either the removal of the battery, or at least extends the battery life to a useable time frame.  Luna proposes a methodology to make RF power scavenging a viable alternative. Through a combination of improved efficencies in capturing and storing stray RF energy, and significantly decreasing the power requirement of the wireless sensor, Luna has determined that powering the sensors through scavenged energy will be possible within two years.",

A Pareto analysis of the current MSI process indicates that the two largest costs in radome production are the direct labor associated with fabrication and the cost of the raw materials.  In Phase I MSI demonstrated that COTS paint spraying technology reduced the direct labor costs associated with fabricating a radome and improved the quality of the radome.  Specifically, MSI developed an automated resin spraying system using a high-volume, low-pressure (HVLP) paint gun and a computer controlled positioning system.  In Phase II, MSI proposes to utilize the automated paint spraying technology to reduce the direct labor and materials costs associated with fabricating a full-scale radome and improve the quality of the radome.  This research will involve development of the hardware and software to control the process, the implementation of process control systems, and the fabrication and testing of full-scale radomes.  The solution proposed within this submission is scalable, and easily implemented into current parallel efforts at MSI such as the development of a full-scale prototype Nosecone TPS and Radome for the Kinetic Energy Interceptor (KEI) platform.",

External interfaces have been configured to accommodate open standards and \u201cplug-and-play\u201d system architectures. The optimal set of sensors chosen was a combination of MEMS accelerometers and a magnetic field sensor for high bandwidth, short term attitude tracking, and a GPS sensor and dual star tracker assembly for low bandwidth, high accuracy pointing and position capability. The GPS sensor is used in a unique configuration to provide both position and angular attitude determination when combined with the magnetic field sensor data. Requirements for this enhanced performance have been confirmed based on expressions of interest in using NSS from both major aerospace primes and government users. The results of this program will be a flight ready prototype NSS system capable of immediate follow on flight test.",

In numerous military applications, the number of different types of electronic modules required is large, whereas the quantities needed of each type of module are small, making the mask costs prohibitive.  Previous maskless lithography approaches of imaging a spatial light modulator array by a reduction lens are fundamentally limited in resolution by an individual micromodulator size and put great demands on the projection lens.  Thus, a maskless technology would be highly desirable that overcomes the basic limitation of the micromodulator pixel size (14-16 \u00b5m) and the projection lens reduction ratio (100-200), and is configurable as a massively parallel scanning system, thereby delivering moderate throughputs (2-10 wafers (200 mm) per hour) at very high resolutions (50-100 nm).  This proposal presents such a technology: a novel sub-pixel maskless nanolithography system that provides the capability to pattern very high-resolution features without using a physical mask; enables rapid programmability of the patterns to be imaged for quick prototyping and moderate-volume production; and provides high-throughput imaging on large areas.

The network is based on a high-performance COTS networking protocol with appropriate extensions and enhancements to support multi-level security. The goal of the Phase II effort is to develop a complete set of building blocks needed to implement an MLS system in the military or commercial environment. To achieve this goal a number of key components will be developed in Phase II. First, a high performance low-power MLS switch ASIC will be designed and fabricated, based on the FPGA version developed under Phase I. This switch will work directly with MLS-enabled processors for an efficient low-chip-count solution. In addition, Rydal will continue to work through the relevant trade association to address Navy requirements in future protocol extensions and application notes and to ensure that these developments are compatible with the requirements of certifying agencies. To support non MLS-enabled processors Rydal will design and fabricate a generic MLS- endpoint bridge chip. This will be based on the bridge chip FPGA demonstrated in Phase I but with a PCI Express core replacing the existing bus interface. The development of this component will maximize flexibility and applicability.",

DOD, DOE and NASA presently fund quantum well film development at Hi-Z and this support allows the module fabrication development to proceed at an accelerated pace.    Hi-Z's Phase I results on a preliminary design of a quantum well thermoelectric generator, quantum well materials tests, as well as 500,000 miles on a conventional Hi-Z thermoelectric generator on a diesel truck exhaust in a companion program, highlight the viability of this high efficiency quantum well generator approach.    The quantum well module development includes a high heat flux eggcrate, quantum well film production, element contact resistance reduction, bonding development, film assembly in eggcrate, and compression design with testing and fabrication qualification of numerous 2-Watt mini-modules which are the basic building blocks for 50 Watt modules. The generator will also be configured and fabricated to operate as a separate APU with the addition of a diesel fuel burner, blower and control system. Proof of generator design will be confirmed with both a mock-up and with advanced quantum well modules.",

However, the scope of useful missions for nanosatellites is restricted by the availability of components of suitable scale. One such component of major importance is the RF front-end, which includes the antennas and the electronics for communication and radar applications. In response to that need EMAG Technologies is proposing to develop a novel micromachined RF front-end that will combine an antenna array, monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMIC), and digital beamforming on a miniaturized multi-chip structure.

A CMI defines both global topology of a computational domain and local connectivity information on the mesh through a map of a multi-dimensional computational space onto a one-dimensional abstract index space. A critical property of a CMI is that it enables adaptive numerical algorithms to operate on an index space instead of a computational space, and frees the algorithms from topological and geometrical constraints either explicitly defined or implicitly imposed by application-specific and computer language-specific layouts of computational data in a computer memory, thus making the CMI-based adaptive algorithms flexible, portable, and universal.  An outcome of Phase II will be a distributed memory parallel version of a universal, platform-independent, stand-alone software library (CMILIB) for managing a geometrically and topologically complex adaptive computational mesh shared by multiple algorithms during integrated numerical simulations of multi-scale and multi-physics phenomena.

        "abstract": "Several design platforms are being considered for hypersonic vehicles for various DOD applications. The most probable candidate for air-breathing hypersonic propulsion is the supersonic combustion ramjet, or scramjet. At the inlet to a ramjet or scramjet engine, shocks may impinge on the surface of the vehicle, resulting in boundary layer separation from the vehicle surface and loss of total pressure into the engine, reducing engine efficiency or, in extreme cases, causing engine stall. The location of the shock impingement will vary with Mach number, indicating the need for an adaptive system to control flow separation. Multifunctional MHD devices, like those demonstrated in Phase I, can be designed to provide this control. If an array of these devices were to be placed on the surface of an engine inlet and controlled independently, they could be used to increase the static pressure at the precise location of the shock impingement and reduce vulnerability to boundary layer separation.  The experimental program supported by this SBIR Phase II funding will investigate this hypothesis of flow control during simulated reentry conditions.",

The inability to achieve such reconciliation during product development results in protracted production transition and costly quality escapes.   The project team led by Renaissance Services defined a digital solution for bringing intelligence to the documentation of design requirements and process capability at a fundamental level: individual part & process characteristics defined by geometries, dimensions, materials, and specifications.  The Phase 1 focused on the capability to develop a closed loop system for the systematic capture, application, and re-use of essential characteristic level data for the SM-3 Throttleable Divert Attitude Control System (TDACS).  The envisioned solution, known as EMPOWER (Enabling Manufacturing Process Optimization with Engineering Requirements), is focused on: a) Part Producibility Analysis \u2013 validating part characteristics based on manufacturing process constraints; b) Closed Loop Process Capability \u2013 comparing actual results for part characteristics versus design requirements; and, c) Manufacturing Process Control \u2013 Generating control plans linked to key process characteristics & failure modes. EMPOWER can be applied from the beginning of product development and continuously refined, ensuring design intent and process capability are reconciled, which dramatically enhances design-to-production transition.",

        "abstract": "Superconducting coils are capable of storing considerable amounts of energy.  Should a coil quench, due to overheating or exceeding the critical field or current, the stored energy in the coil must be dissipated safely - without endangering personnel or damaging the coil or control systems.  In any superconducting coil design, it is essential to design and build the system such that limits of the materials involved are not exceeded.  High temperature superconductors (HTS) are relatively new to applications in magnets and coils, but are rapidly growing in use.  However, not much is known concerning the quench protection design limits of the materials.  Thus far, quench protection in HTS coils has been largely overlooked due mainly to the fact that HTS materials have higher heat capacities at their operating points, and are often difficult to quench.  Unfortunately this high heat capacity also creates slow thermal propagation velocities that can cause catastrophic damage to the HTS.  The technical objectives for Phase II are to model and fabricate test coils to verify simulations, develop a predictable, reproducible quench protection scheme for HTS coils, and design, fabricate and evaluate a full scale HTS magnet for a gyrotron application to confirm the quench protection method.",

In this SBIR Phase II program Nanohmics proposes to fabricate high volumetric energy density, wound capacitors using high breakdown strength, flexible dielectrics films made using amorphous oxides.   This program will build on Phase I results which demonstrated that amorphous oxide dielectrics were flexible, had high breakdown strengths and could operate at high temperatures.  The Phase II program will take the best dielectric material found in Phase I and optimize the deposition process for lifetime, breakdown voltage, flexibility and scalability.  The dielectric will then be deposited on a metallized polymer web anode and wound into 1 microfarad, 500 volt capacitors and tested for performance improvements over standard wound capacitors.

Additionally, SiC devices have been shown to operate at high current density (~.5A/mm), and extreme temperatures (~600\u00b0C).

Re-implementation of the legacy software by hand is prohibitively expensive. A system is needed for automatically translating software written in obsolete languages like CMS-2 or assembly to a modern language like C. Previous attempts at translation have amounted to transliteration: the produced \"high-level\" code closely mimicks the low-level code, even using global variables for registers.  Translators that do more than this often assume that the low-level code was generated by a compiler, and hence adheres to certain conventions; such assumptions do not hold for legacy code.

Furthermore, we are collaborating with leading researchers at the University of Wisconsin for in developing analyses for discovering malicious and/or buggy code in binaries.

In essence, JIGSAW creates a new coordinating representation for coalition intelligence analysis that structures and clarifies the discourse between analysts. Discourse is structured through analysts posting each other consistently formatted, information objects (Intelligence Posts or \u00d2I-Posts\u00d3). Discourse is clarified through the use of a novel graphical evaluation space (Intelligence Landscape or \u00d2I-Scape\u00d3) that coordinates analyst's input. The Phase II proposal takes JIGSAW to the next level. In four work threads, PSE will (1) research, (2) develop, (3) validate and (4) identify a transition path for, a functional Web-based JIGSAW prototype. Two applied experiments will be conducted to determine JIGSAW's generalizability. Two operational exercises will be attended to showcase JIGSAW to real users. JIGSAW possesses the right attributes to make it transitionable - it is simple, elegant, useful and endorsed by analysts.",

With these recent technological advances in hand, the primary new innovation is a methodology for determining total scattering with a low-power/volume/cost sensor.

Although previous research has indicated that titanium matrix composites (TMCs) are a potential solution to this problem, the high cost of these materials has severely hindered their consideration. Recently, FMW has developed a series of nano-enhanced titanium alloys that possess tensile properties nearly equal to those of TMCs. As the enhancement is achieved during spray atomization of the starting alloy powder, the enhanced alloys are essentially cost neutral relative to the base alloy.   In this effort, FMW will demonstrate the successful scale-up of a nano-enhanced titanium pressure vessel through hot-rolled and welded-case process leaders. Once the baseline roll and welding technology is proven, two full-scale four inch diameter AMRAAM sized cases will be fabricated and tested. The first will be subjected to combined loads testing and hydro-burst, while the second will be insulated and static fired with a heavy wall nozzle and head closure. The results of the firing will be analyzed and revised case performance projections will be completed in the final report.",

        "abstract": "Sensors are vital during advanced turbine engine development testing. Essential data expedite engine development programs and accordingly bring new advanced propulsion and ground-power engines to market sooner. Ceramic thermal barrier coating (TBC) on first-stage turbine blades is now a vital component of advanced engines under development for future military aircraft, protecting the metal alloy blades from the extreme combustion temperature in these high-performance engines. TBC must be proven as a reliable means to prevent blade failure, but current engine development programs are mired since there is not a sensor available to map the surface temperature of TBC blades during engine operation. In fact, the engine sensor community has identified surface temperature mapping of TBC blades as the highest priority sensor development need. Phase I of this project demonstrated the feasibility of an optical sensor to provide TBC surface temperature mapping. Designed within the dimensional constraints of a current on-engine optical probe, the sensor was characterized for spatial resolution exceeding conventional heat flux gauge resolution of 0.125 inches. Whole-blade temperature measurements taken on the torch-heated blade were significant for demonstrating the thermal-mapping capability and for distinguishing TBC defects. Phase II will proceed with implementation of strategic optical and imaging hardware improvements identified for Phase II development. The high performance system is expected to achieve even better spatial resolution, and in a one microsecond sampling period which is necessary to capture images of high-speed TBC turbine blades. On-engine demonstrations will be performed.",

The results were that carbon aerogel reduced radiant heat transfer of the carbon foam substantially with no degradation of the foam mechanical properties. Phase II will focus on enhanced aerogel composition development to control shrinkage of the aerogel during pyrolysis and will explore other aerogel formulations such as silica and alumina. Target applications will be identified to benefit from the unique properties of low thermal conductivity, high strength, low weight, low CTE, and high use temperature. At least one identified application will be identified, and Finite Element Analysis will be utilized to model the thermal and physical response of the composite material within the required environment. A preliminary manufacturing plan will be established to allow for a cost-benefits analysis of competing/state-of-the-art materials systems.

Failure of a single key component that could easily be replaced or repaired on a manned vessel could cause an USSV to have to abort its mission or, perhaps, require a manned vessel to put itself and its crew at risk to retrieve the USSV.

        "abstract": "Defense against asymmetric threats such as small surface swarms is an important area of concern. For homeland security, drug trafficking surveillance, and the protection of Navy assets it is necessary to track these highly maneuverable targets, perhaps in large numbers. This requires a tracking system that provides high-fidelity correlation and state estimation in real-time and in the presence of merged measurements, high false alarm rates, and temporal target occlusion. Numerica has developed state-of-the-art tracking systems for air and missile defense based on its Multiple Frame Assignment (MFA) data correlation method. Phase I adapted this algorithm to the surface target tracking problem and demonstrated good performance on challenging scenarios. The proposed Phase II will fully mature this algorithm and transition it to a COTS ROTS. To support Navy's development of ship self-defense weapons systems two additional algorithm developments will be pursued: (i) merged measurement processing for mechanically scanned radar and (ii) assessment of data association ambiguity to compute interceptor guide-to-regions. The Phase II product will satisfy Navy's need for an advanced tracking solution in the littoral against asymmetric threats. The algorithm is adapted from a network-centric algorithm and thus may serve more general tracking needs within Navy's envisioned network-centric warfare concepts.",

Inspection of fastener holes in thick multi-layer structures described in the Topic AF04-134, is a big challenge to all existing or emerging nondestructive inspection (NDI) techniques, including ultrasonic techniques, X-ray, conventional eddy current techniques, super-conductive quanta interface device, etc. Among all ECT\u2019s, the FG RFEC & SSEC is the only technique that has a penetration depth not limited by Skin-Depth, because the signal received by its receiving unit has penetrated through the object wall twice and carries a clean signal about the wall conditions. Therefore, FG RFEC & SSEC is the most promising technique in reaching the goal set in this project topic description. There are three Phase II objectives:  Objective # 1: Detection of cracks on F-15 titanium (Ti) spar structures. Objective # 2: Detection of cracks through aircraft bushings. Objective # 3: Inspection of Titanium Structure through Composite Skin. Coupons and specifications of the above three objectives have been specified by US Air Force Research Laboratory. IMTT will develop and deliver a production prototype system based on the remote field eddy-current technology which is capable of addressing multi-layer crack detection in the three areas listed above \u2013 F-15 Ti spar structures, aircraft bushings, and Ti structures through a composite skin.

In fact, the elimination of flammable vapors in fuel tanks has made it to the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) \"Most Wanted\" list of aviation safety improvements.  Inerting systems displace air in the fuel tank with nitrogen and thus lower the oxygen content to a level that does not support combustion.  Unfortunately, there are no flight certified sensors capable of monitoring the gasses inside the fuel tank.  An oxygen sensor that operates in this harsh environment is needed to control the inerting system.  InterSpace proposes to continue development of a field prototype oxygen sensor capable of operating in an aircraft fuel tank.  This development builds on our Phase I laboratory prototype in which we demonstrated the feasibility of detecting oxygen in the presence of fuel vapor.  The sensor is intrinsically safe in fuel tank environments and avoids fouling problems associated with optical sensors currently under development.

We will also integrate Cerebra, an ontology and semantic integration tool; Confederation Web, a database concept to facilitate schema-less shared application data; and learning guided authoring systems tools to facilitate user interaction with the system.

Because of the importance of the mixing process, the simulation tool will be based on the large-eddy simulation technique. The code will be based on our unstructured LES code CHARLES, which is highly specialized and optimized for LES. The code uses appropriate LES filters and numerical methods. A state-of-the-art combustion model using detailed chemical kinetics for JP-8 fuel will be developed and employed to describe turbulence/chemistry interactions in gas turbine combustion. It is also proposed here to use the simulation tool to gain a better understanding of the interaction of combustion and the mixing process and to enable better control of the burnout of high FAR regions. The work will be performed in collaboration with our industrial partners from Pratt & Whitney Group, a division of the United Technologies Corporation, who will be involved in code development, capability assessment, validation with a real engine experiment, and the application of the LES tool in combustor performance optimization.",

MTLD offers unique advantages over conventional designators including precise multiple target designation, provision for ship-motion and environmental effects, low-cost, lightweight, modular multibeam, design for simultaneous designation of multiple targets, high-performance holographic optics as a high-gain antenna as well as a filter for background noise mitigation.  In Phase I, POC designed, analyzed, and fabricated a proof-of-concept system and demonstrated that MTLD has strong potential to meet U.S. Navy needs and to support many commercial applications.

Large numbers of medical personnel with varying specialties are rapidly mobilized.  Many of these medical personnel are unfamiliar with providing combat casualty care, much less during battle or in locations that are unfamiliar and in highly challenging situations.  To increase the effectiveness of trauma management on the battlefield the tri-services are adopting the principles and procedures of tactical combat casualty care (TCCC). Dissemination of the TCCC curriculum requires a training solution that can be delivered electronically or in print, and is usable by warfighters, medical personnel, and combat leaders across the tri-services.  To meet this need, Sapien Systems developed an online, prototype Electronic Combat Casualty Care Training (ECCCT) system.  ECCCT is an innovative, distributed Computer/Web Based Training (CBT/WBT) system which delivers TCCC training through the integration of conceptual, procedural, and case-based instruction. The prototype has received excellent reviews from training and subject matter experts.

Target interception within and outside the atmosphere, and engagements containing both endo- and exo-atmospheric trajectory segments were demonstrated.

The system must be able to provide realistic system level tests for GPS receivers, antennas, and amplifiers. Bedford Signals proposes the advanced development of innovative technologies to enable a Completely Integrated Jamming Test System (CIJTS): an Electromagnetic Wavefront Generator, digital exact delay and Doppler for jammer modulation and carrier, and frequency dependent channel modeling. The baseline CIJTS design supports 12 sources per band, and can correctly generate a multipath wavefront for a seven element CRPA. Frequency dependent channel models are developed on a computer workstation, and can be stored in the DIG. Multiple carrier frequencies (L1, L2, L5) are supported by linking multiple DIG boards. The EWG can be calibrated to support all frequencies that the antenna array does. Total system cost will be orders of magnitude less than analog wavefront simulators, but channel modeling will be much more realistic.",

        "abstract": "The overall goal of this Phase II SBIR project is to develop a platform biosensor technology for rapid, multianalyte detection of biological and chemical analytes such as proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, toxins, bacteria, viruses, drugs, narcotics, explosive materials, and other molecules of interest in the biodefense and biomedical areas. We propose to build a hand-held, robust device similar to a palm computer, equipped with cartridges designed for simultaneous detection of up to 100 analytes in a microliter-size sample. The sensitivity of the envisioned sensor is at the level of single molecule detection, with a typical response time from several seconds to a few minutes. An inexpensive, disposable sensor cartridge will have an array of receptor molecules and set of reagents for a one-step detection process. In contrast to existing technologies that utilize antibodies and require multiple stages of reagent injection and washing, the envisioned biosensor system employs a novel type of receptors -molecular and aptamer beacons constructed of nucleic acids. The proposed assay is based on a single stage process that allows detection of molecular signatures in a matter of seconds. This project builds upon the experience of the investigators at BioElectroSpec in developing total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) biosensor systems. We have built and currently are testing a prototype of a bench-top, analytical grade, versatile TIRF biosensor instrument, which has sensitivity at the level of single molecule detection. In Phase II we will use our previous experience and the results obtained in Phase I to develop rapid multianalyte biosensors capable of detecting single target molecules. In Phase I we demonstrated the feasibility of the envisioned TIRF biosensor and developed a \u00bfsinglepixel\u00bf model of the multianalyte TIRF biosensor. Detection of single target molecules with a response time of several seconds has been demonstrated in Phase I. The TIRF biosensor platform in conjunction with molecular beacons and aptamer beacons demonstrated superior sensitivity and excellent selectivity. A new conceptual design for the multianalyte biosensor has been developed and prototyped in Phase I. Based on successful results of Phase I we propose accelerated development of TIRF biosensors devices. In Year 1 of Phase II we will develop and test a portable TIRF sensor, an array printing station, an automated fluidics, respective methods and standard operation protocols (SOP) for simultaneous detection of up to 100 bioanalytes. In parallel with BioElectroSpec\u00bfs efforts, our collaborator, the Ellington lab, will adjust existing molecular and aptamer beacons to the TIRF platform and develop new aptamers for emerging biothreats. Year 2 of Phase II will complete prototyping and testing of a hand-held TIRF biosensor. Manufacturing and marketing of the portable and hand-held sensors can start in Year 2 of Phase II and Year 1 of Phase III, respectively. The envisioned TIRF biosensor technology has the potential to significantly enhance the biodefense potential of the Department of Homeland Security. However, the prospective market for the TIRF biosensor is not limited to biodefense applications. The envisioned portable and hand-held TIRF biosensors can become indispensable tools for rapid detection of a large variety of bioanalytes, such as pathogens, disease markers, toxins, drugs, and food additives. A broad customer base including DHS, DOD, NIH, FDA, EPA, USDA, clinical and research laboratories, state and local governments, and many commercial as well as nonprofit organizations will benefit from the envisioned biosensor devices.",

We will leverage the innovative nVision analysis, simulation, diagramming and user interface capabilities that were previously developed. For the base Phase 2 effort, we shall use a two step approach: first, we will demonstrate (via analysis and simulation) the evaluation of one chosen Technical Performance Measure (TPM) in the current DD(X) design release, using reconstructed, enhanced and sanitized data files; second, we will demonstrate the repeatability of the process to one or more chosen TPMs. The nVision toolset will be enhanced to use and augment the same project files that are being created and used by the DD(X) design team, performing data import and export out of the nVision environment. The Phase 2 Option task will develop necessary technology and demonstrate the applicability of the nVision toolset to run-time implementation artifacts, thus mitigating the risk of design-time and implementation-time performance mismatches. Phase 2 Option will utilize and demonstrate roundtrip data import from the run-time DD(X) C2I workflow generators, such as those developed as part of the DARPA ARMS program.",

        "abstract": "The primary sensor used by a submerged submarine for target detection, tracking and collision avoidance is passive SONAR. Modern SONARS have evolved to a point where contacts can be detected and tracked with a high degree of accuracy. There are situations however, when contacts are not detected or trackers become unstable due to acoustic conditions or relative position of the contact to the submarine.  This can result in a close encounter or even more disastrous, a collision.  All vessels emanate horizontal electric dipole (HED) and extremely low frequency electromagnetic signals (ELFE) caused by permanent galvanic corrosion currents on the hull of the vessel, which leak into the surrounding conducting seawater. These signals have been detected at ranges to 2000 meters. E-field sensors have specific advantages over acoustic sensors because they are not affected by acoustic conditions and are most effective inside SONAR near field ranges. An array of E-Field sensors on the submarine hull can provide enhanced short-range localization.  Acoustic and E-Field signal detections can be fused to provide an alert to the submarine Commander of contacts \u201cclose aboard\u201d therefore improving situational awareness and avoid disastrous consequences such as a collision at sea.",

        "abstract": "The increasing interference density of the modern RF environment is causing unacceptable degradation to the effectiveness of military electronic support (ES) and radar warning systems, which for economy must use wideband analog detection and discrimination devices in their front-end processing stages.  A Phase I SBIR study was completed in 2004, which showed that the core technology could be upgraded to operate through relatively severe interference environments, by replacing the DSP algorithms applied to the standard digitized outputs from these analog front-ends.  DSP retrofits were demonstrated on the Phase I study both for instantaneous frequency measurement (IFM) systems and wideband direction-finding (WDF) systems.  Through computer modeling and simulation, the proposed DSP algorithms were shown to maintain effective operation through up to 40 dB of interference, and to be highly robust to non-ideal hardware characteristics.  The Phase II program proposed herein will construct a brassboard implementation to retire the remaining technical risk, by replacing computer models with actual analog hardware.  It is divided into three sub-phases as follows:  A Base Effort, to implement and prove the basic technique in brassboard form, through controlled laboratory tests using digitized snapshots from actual analog hardware; An Option 1 Effort, to implement and demonstrate the objective IFM and WDF processors in similar brassboard form; And an Option 2 effort, to define the real-time retrofit product architecture.",

To date, however, very little effort has been focused on improving LPD/LPI properties of a waveform by leveraging the potential of MIMO space-time processing. In this work we aim to do exactly that. The phase 1 effort identified unique ways of combining MIMO techniques with conventional DSSS and FHSS communications, to provide an order of magnitude improvement in the achievable LPD/LPI/AJ properties of the waveform.

In less than a cubic inch, TGE measures all 6 degrees of freedom inertially, 3 axes magnetically, pressure, and temperature.  A low cost RTK enabled GPS receiver measures position, velocity, and time.  Optionally, if a fixed GPS receiver location is available, absolute buoy position is reported to centimeter accuracy.  The microcontroller is optimized for extremely low power consumption so a small solar cell allows indefinite operational life.  Inertial data provides a backup for GPS measurements and helps coast through possible outages due to temporary submergence.  Wave and other data will be compressed and then transmitted to Argos, Orbcomm or Iridium satellites or to local receivers, depending on the mission.  Additional sensors (depth, salinity, humidity, turbidity, conductivity etc.) can be added as desired.  This microbuoy can be moored on \u2018fishing line\u2019, or airdropped and left to drift.

Furthermore, the coherent generation of the T-ray pulse permits multiple signal detection modes, including phase, amplitude, and spectral.

        "abstract": "Leveraging our industry leading photonic delay commercial product offerings, Agiltron proposes to develop next-generation 8-bit time delay modules that meet the challenging requirements of lower insertion loss, higher switching speed, low weight, and low cost.   Next-level performance will be achieved through a novel configuration employing a new precision glass micro-optic fiber assembly technology combined with core-expanded fibers, promising a several fold device miniaturization. The development provides an inexpensive, compact and low loss fiber optic module for emerging microwave photonic applications. Our approach incorporates a state-of-the-art design in combination with proven fiber optic component manufacturing techniques to realize a practical optical digital time delay. The proposed all-solid-state switch overcomes speed and long-term reliability limitations associated with other approaches.  Phase I has successfully demonstrated the low loss and highly compact fiber-optic 8-bit reconfigurable true time delay having performance specifications not attained before, validating  this innovative approach.  We propose continued development of this high-speed fiber-optic 8 bit true time delay device by further reducing device size and to achieve lower loss and higher thermal stability.  Pre-production prototypes with electronic control circuit and algorithm will be produced and tested by our defense-industry customers in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "The goal of the Tessera\u2019s Phase II work proposed here is to demonstrate the effectiveness of advanced packaging technology for miniaturizing a nanosatellite C&DH sub-system.  The key objectives along the path to this goal are:    1) re-designing an existing small satellite C&DH sub-system with advanced packaging technology,  2) fabricating prototypes of the re-designed C&DH sub-system,  3) performing functional testing of the re-designed C&DH sub-system, and  4) comparing the performance and other metrics of the re-designed C&DH sub-system to the previous design.   Tessera will use chip-scale and stacked packaging technology plus system-in-package design approaches to miniaturize the C&DH sub-system.  The new C&DH sub-system will be designed to be compatible with the AFRL test bed so that:  1) the performance can be verified in a standard test environment, and  2) it will be compatible with other components being developed under the DARPA / AFRL nanosatellite program.   Miniaturization with Tessera\u2019s technology will also provide benefits in performance, reliability, and cost.  A successful demonstration of a miniaturized C&DH sub-system will accelerate the incorporation of advanced packaging technologies into nanosatellite components, with the resulting benefit of seeing progress toward the DoD\u2019s goals for space technology.",

Recent Operation evaluations for both bottled water and bulk water use indicates that significant improvements in safety, cost, taste, distribution, and security are required to meet the transformation goal.    WaterVisions International has developed improved drinking water purification technology which utilizes advanced composite materials.  These materials incorporate only food-grade components (no pesticides), are inexpensive to manufacture, and highly scalable.  System purification performance has been independently verified and meets EPA regulations.  The technology can be embedded in soldier and vehicle systems, used to improve bulk water production, and can improve the taste of bulk stored water.     Phase II objectives include evaluating microbiological and chemical purification efficiencies for prototype components designed to be embedded into tactile systems including the soldier system. Lightweight devices will be fabricated which provide 6-log reductions in bacteria, 4-log reductions in viruses, and 3-log reductions in cysts.  Strong interest from commercialization partners who are currently evaluating composites for use in residential water purification applications guarantees that this effort will impact both military and civilian organizations.",

        "abstract": "A high-speed supercavitating torpedo is an advanced weapons concept under consideration by the US Navy. Supercavitation is a state in which a gas cavity substantially encompasses a body immersed in a liquid, and the consequence for underwater bodies is a marked drag reduction over the non-wetted surface. This can be exploited to develop rapid reaction defensive weapons that provide tactical advantages for submarines, particularly for close-aboard, shallow water engagements addressed by the Littoral Antisubmarine Warfare Future Naval Capability. Alternatively, the technology can also yield a target vehicle for the US Navy to train sailors and develop countermeasures against high-speed weapons fielded by other navies. Control systems (algorithms and devices) are critical-path technologies to exploit the full potential of these vehicles, and Barron Associates and NextGen Aeronautics propose a collaborative Phase II program to increase the technology readiness level of the adaptive control laws, tail-fin micropump actuators, and the integrated concept. This is accomplished through an R&D program that (i) matures Phase I adaptive control algorithms and fin micropump hardware subsystems, (ii) ports the embedded control program to a real-time processor, (iii) conducts hardware-in-the-loop testing of the integrated control system, and (iv) validates the design in a set of water-tunnel demonstrations.",

The anticipated benefits of the program are the ability to fabricate unitized structures resulting in reduced labor costs, part count and improved quality while achieving desired weight requirements and fatigue life. We will demonstrate our innovative, scalable HPM process utilizing proprietary thermal management techniques in combination with machining modeling to V-22 firewalls. Teaming with Bell Helicopter, we will develop monolithic designs that dramatically reduce cycle time and part count; and achieve cost and weight reductions needed for V-22. We enable cost-effective fabrication of thin-section unitized structural elements; provide affordable fabrication of bulkheads that meet qualification criteria; and address the special thermal and tool life problems inherent in titanium machining.  Our technical program will push the performance envelope to achieve sections thinner than 0.030\u201d for large pockets and thin webs. Thin-section features from V-22 parts will be integrated into a unitized test coupon for machining demonstration. Performance improvements in material removal rate between 200%-300% will be achieved and demonstrated on three V-22 thin-section parts. An optional task for kellering processes is included.",

        "abstract": "The dual band beacon SMP2000 has been successfully deployed in various missions providing combat identification, multiple drop/landing/assault marking, and as point designators for targeting.  However, the SMP2000 does not satisfy the future requirement for Combat ID and Blue Force tracking due to size, weight, GPS capability, Joint-STARS compatibility, and radar reflective .aircraft for Blue Force tracking.  The advent of Silicon Germanium (SiGe) based RFICs permits the implementation of complex multi-GHz circuits onto a single chip. Sierra Monolithics proposes to develop a miniaturized version of SMP-2000 incorporating combat ID/blue force tracking capabilities onto a SiGe RFIC for each band.  The proposed architecture, frequency source, and modulation scheme will allow beacon, JSTARS, and radar reflective tag functions to be incorporated onto the same RFIC chip set. In the Phase I effort, using the SMI-1070 X-band transceiver chip, Sierra successfully demonstrated a prototype MMRB that performs beacon functions typical of the Microponder SMP-1000 as well as the JSTARS functionality.  The X-band MMRB also incorporates a stand-alone GPS receiver which provides position data and route tracking capabilities.  The proposed Phase II effort will develop two SiGe chips, one for X-band and one for Ku-band.  The two chips together will provide dual band beacon functions, dual band radar reflective function, and X-band JSTARS ID functions. A follow-on Option 1 is also proposed to build a prototype dual band MMRB module using the 2-chip set to provide dual band beacon functions, JSTARS ID functions and a GPS receiver, all in the same housing.",

This proposal presents the background and work necessary to develop and implement prototype remaining useful life models for JSF Li-ion batteries within the JSF Prognostic Health Maintenance (PHM) architecture under the sponsorship of the Navair JSF program office. In Phase I, data-driven prognostics architecture was proposed in consultation with US Navy to address self-learning prognostics, nonlinear modeling and uncertainty management.  Preliminary remaining useful life (RUL) model parameters were determined and a strategy was developed for collecting the information required to update battery health status after deep and lengthy discharges during abnormal operating conditions, shipping or storage.  A wavelet neural network based diagnostician and prognosticator were prototyped from simulated deep discharge data to assess the feasibility of detecting damaged Li-ion batteries and predicting the remaining useful life of Li-ion batteries. The goal of Phase II is to develop and implement prototype RUL models for deep discharged Li-ion cells within the JSF PHM architecture. This includes the development, documentation and verification of air vehicle, battery and Autolog parameters and interfaces necessary to update battery health status within the overall JSF architecture. An extensive cycle testing of representative cells or batteries will be conducted to develop and validate detailed RUL models to account for depth and duration of discharge below 2.0V/cell.

External threats for a ship can originate from underwater detonations, anti-ship missiles, and even low tech weapons like in the terrorist attack on USS Cole.  These threats become even more important as the focal point for naval operations has shifted towards littoral areas, where ships are exposed to a higher risk.  Current analysis methods do not provide levels of confidence and large structural design safety factors are used.  Thus, ships are heavier and more expensive to construct and maintain than may actually be required.  Models that quantify the level of confidence are required in order to provide meaningful and reliable information during the ship design stage.  The Completed Phase I effort demonstrated the feasibility of performing model update and error estimation in UNDEX simulation using FEA models with a large number of elements.  In the proposed Phase II effort additional computational capabilities will be developed in order to create a complete capability for model update and error estimation.

High Velocity Deformation (HVD) has been shown to produce micron-sized particles composed entirely of nanocrystalline structures, using commercially available machining equipment.  As such, these materials can be processed with standard consolidation equipment/processes and thereby avoid the expensive equipment and procedures required for nano-sized particles. Under Phase I, NanoDynamics produced over 1 kilogram of nanocrystalline tantalum and explored options for consolidation into liner plates.  Phase II will focus on optimizing and scale-up of production, exploring consolidation approaches, as well as producing tantalum plate for explosive testing by the USAF.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this multiphase SBIR project is to develop and commercialize a compact and robust system for removing oil from bilgewater using electrocoagulation (EC). Under Phase I, ADA Technologies tested the ability of EC to treat oily, emulsified bilgewater. Lab-scale tests verified that the EC process consistently breaks oily emulsions, producing a floc that can be separated from the water phase by simple filtration. The EC process was challenged with oily emulsions at pH from 3 to 9 and oil contents up to 10,000 ppm total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH). In all cases the process was able to deliver a clean water stream with TPH less than 5 ppm. Power consumption was approximately 140 W-per-gpm of treated water. Under Phase II, ADA proposes to test a 10-gpm pilot system pier-side on bilgewater from naval vessels. The portable unit will include all ancillary equipment necessary for effective field demonstration of the technology. Under the Phase II Option, the team will design a shipboard prototype and detail the testing and evaluation plan for shipboard demonstration. ADA has teamed with Screen Lore Corporation (Denver, CO) and Northrop Grumman Newport News Shipbuilding (Newport News, VA) for development, demonstration, and commercialization of the technology.",

Results include: (1) recovery of emergent behavior typical for crowd motion, (2) reasonable behavior of both fearful and curious Cognitive Pedestrian agents as they encounter a fire hazard, and (3) break-up of crowds due to the use of physical barriers.  In Phase II, the Cognitive Pedestrian agents will be enhanced in a principled manner to include an explicit framework for introducing epistemological beliefs. This will allow Cognitive Pedestrian agents to model individuals holding beliefs arising from diverse cultural norms. The (sub)-cognitive capability of way-finding will also be an enhancement to the agent capability. In Phase II, a scenario that is operationally relevant to the Air Force will be the simulated.

        "abstract": "The corrosion of military equipment is a significant and ongoing problem.  Corrosion costs the Department of Defense $20 billion annually and is the number one cost driver in military life-cycle costs (U.S. Army Material Command 1997).  To prevent this, metals are treated with protective coatings.  These coatings must maintain their integrity and provide corrosion protection in the many different environments faced in each application.  Aircraft fuel tank coatings must withstand:  temperatures ranging from far below freezing (-65 \u00b0F) to above boiling (250 \u00b0F) without cracking, immersion in jet fuel without delamination and exposure to microbes that live at the water/fuel interface without undergoing microbial influenced corrosion.   Long-term corrosion protection is particularly critical in integral fuel tanks because they are part of the aircraft structure and not easily repaired once in service.  Current SAE AMS-C-27725 fuel tank coatings use high levels of soluble chromates to meet the corrosion performance requirements.  Unfortunately, these hexavalent chromates are known carcinogens and their use and disposal is strictly regulated.  An ideal integral aircraft fuel tank coating would be chromate-free and yet still provide the same corrosion protection as current chromated coatings.  This SBIR project aims to develop a chromate-free, integral fuel tank primer using nanoparticle additives.",

Bearing components play an integral role in machine design and subsequent failures result in catastrophic damage, potentially incurring excessive downtime and costs for repair. With the military\u2019s continuing development of advanced drive train systems, traditional methods for estimating and tracking bearing health fall short in light of system complexities and the influence of highly dynamic, extreme operating conditions on the component. In Phase I, Impact developed a health management framework that resolves these difficulties by integrating information from multiple sensors with physics of failure models to provide a final prognostic output representative of the specific bearing being monitored and the operating conditions. Impact proposes to mature the system developed in Phase I by further advancing algorithms and models demonstrated in the first period to the application of high-performance conventional and ceramic bearings. In addition, Impact will integrate expert prognostic reasoning algorithms that will ultimately utilize a diverse array of health indicators, including: diagnostic features created from multi-sensor fusion, physics of failure model outputs, system operating parameters, historical failure modes, and inspection feedback. Based on these information metrics, the planned health management system will provide a health prognostic vector for decision support. Impact plans to offer the overall health management system in three variants: a complete hardware/software desktop package, an embedded hardware/software package, and a standalone software product. For Phase II demonstration, Impact will select one of three prototype platforms for full product fabrication but will also identify feasibility and transition readiness for the remaining options.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR program would develop a process for the integration of electrically networked sensors and actuators with physically large composite military structures and platforms.  NanoSonic would use its patented electrostatic self-assembly (ESA) process to form elastomeric, electrically conductive patterned interconnects in free-standing plies to allow the interfacing of multiple distributed sensor and actuator elements.  ESA involves the layer-by-layer deposition of polymers, nanoclusters and other molecules to form functional thin films with a wide degree of control over multiple constitutive properties.  Recent work has demonstrated the ability to control these properties both through the thickness of the film as well as patterned in the plane of the film.  Patterned functional films may be co-cured into advanced polymer matrix composites without affecting structural integrity, yielding an integrated multifunctional structural/electronic component.  Free-standing network plies may also be applied as decals to the surfaces of composites.  During Phase I, NanoSonic would work with major corporate partners and leading research universities to design, fabricate and evaluate the performance of sensor and actuator network-integrated and networked composites.  During Phase II, NanoSonic would work with defense industry partners to transition this technology to composite structural platforms to provide mission performance and health monitoring information.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this Phase II project is to demonstrate the engineering feasibility of a high power, unitized, regenerative fuel cell that uses sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) directly at the fuel cell (FC) electrodes. Such a Regenerative Fuel Cell (RFC) is ideally suited for the demanding Unconventional Space Power requirements set forth by DARPA. The engineering prototype proposed would be a kW-class unit, based on the scale-up of the highly successful NaBH4/ H2O2 fuel cell demonstrated by NPL Associates in Phase I. This cell, termed I-CHARGERTM, uses aqueous solutions of NaBH4 and H2O2 directly at the anode and cathode, respectively. This direct process, as shown in experiment, results in >30% higher voltage output compared to ordinary H2/O2 fuel cell, and consequently a 30% higher efficiency. Also the unique combination of the fuel and oxidizer, both being in aqueous form, paves the way for a unique unitized design which is inherently compact compared cells that use gas phase reactants, such as the conventional H2 and O2 fuel cell. Thus I-CHARGERTM is uniquely suited for space power applications, and that is the primary focus of the Phase II development.",

Once an optimal bearing configuration has been defined a single axis gimbal system (TBD: azimuthal axis only of STSS) will be built up using mock-up components based on the current STSS design/requirements, and the hybrid bearing element.  This single axis system will be available to MDA, Air Force, and/or Raytheon for performance and/or life testing in order to facilitate transfer of the long life bearing technology into the STSS program.

        "abstract": "Impact Technologies, in collaboration with The Boeing Company and Lord Corporation, propose to develop an affordable and lightweight health and usage monitoring system (HUMS) for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).   Based upon the requirements for UAV health monitoring investigated in Phase I, the Impact/Lord/Boeing team will re-design and mature the hardware/software concept, fabricate a prototype 3-lb unit, and fully demonstrate the capabilities by conducting realistic subsystem testing associate with a UAV such as the X-45 at Boeing. This will include embedding real-time health management algorithms for anomaly detection, fault classification and prediction into a newly designed COTS, aerospace-certified digital signal processing (DSP) based platform.   Based on an analysis of the common and critical UAV subsystems, vital parameters related to UAV performance and mechanical health will be monitored to address condition-based maintenance activities that are required to ensure UAV mission success.  Key UAV subsystems including the propulsion system, structures, actuators (fight control) and avionics that were the focus of Phase I will act as the core of the HUMS-UAV system development for this next Phase of the program.  The Phase II prototype HUMS system will be designed to track the health of the UAV subsystems on-board using anomaly detection and diagnostic reasoning software that will also be capable of communicating the health status of the vehicle through a specified data transfer mechanism. The software will implement proven signal processing and automatic signal feature extraction techniques that are capable of identifying abnormal system behavior and reporting it to the diagnostic reasoning software.  The development and integration of the advanced diagnostic and prognostic algorithms into a real-time health monitoring system is expected to improve UAV mission success rates and positively impact total ownership costs.  The proposed Phase II development program includes a newly designed 3-pound hardware design that addresses the needs of unmanned programs such as J-UCAS.  This work will leverage Impact's existing expertise in integrated vehicle prognostic health management (IVHM) systems, Lord\u2019s expertise in flight-qualified electronics hardware and Boeing\u2019s vehicle integration and design expertise.",

        "abstract": "Aluminum Oxide (sapphire) windows are a critical element Electro Optical (EO) and infrared (IR) imaging systems. As the demand for an increase in the performance of these optical systems rises, so must the quality of the sapphire windows. One of the most technically challenging aspects of producing high quality sapphire optics is achieving the required surface figure while maintaining a stress free optical surface with good surface finish (or micro-roughness). The desired surface figure error is now < 0.03 waves rms as tested at 632.8 nm for a 22\u201d diagonal sapphire window. Even with extremely skilled opticians, the conventional fabrication process to achieve this surface figure on sapphire optics while maintaining tight wedge specifications and high surface quality can be very slow and costly with the quality of the results being unpredictable. The purpose of the research proposed here is to develop a complete fabrication process (from blank to final shape) that will produce high quality sapphire windows by incorporating magnetorheological finishing (MRF) as the final step of the process. The research will show that by combining the MRF process with the proper CNC grinding and pre-polishing processes, low-cost, high-quality sapphire windows can be deterministically fabricated to repeatedly meet the desired specifications. Phase I of the research has demonstrated the ability of the deterministic MRF process to meet and exceed the surface figure requirement of 0.03 waves rms. Phase II will build upon these initial activities to scale up our process to meet the U.S. Navy's requirements.",

        "abstract": "Development of accurate and effective new diagnostic and prognostic capabilities for JSF PHM will require extensive data on both health and faulted systems states. While healthy signatures can be collected quickly and easily, faulted systems are only observed rarely, and duplicating faulted conditions with seeded fault tests is time-consuming and expensive. Simulation models for faulted conditions will allow sparse seeded fault data to be augmented with accurate simulated fault signatures to provide full data coverage across operating conditions, fault types, and fault severities for situations where extensive physical testing is prohibitively expensive. In addition, these models can be used to determine optimal sensor locations and diagnostic techniques. In Phase I, Sentient Corporation developed a fault signature simulation model for bearing vibration (referred to as the Fault Vibration Simulator or FVS) that was shown to accurately reproduce data from physical tests. In Phase II, Sentient will further develop the bearing model and will also create models for gears and other rotating machine components commonly used in aircraft propulsion. Tools and techniques for gathering system-specific transfer function information needed to calibrate the model will be developed to enable accurate modeling results from simple impulse hammer tests on actual hardware, or from FEA results if no hardware is available. The FVS models will be implemented in the COTS Simulink environment for maximum flexibility. The models will undergo a series of demonstration and refinement tests on real systems, beginning with simple test rigs and culminating in a full scale demonstration model of a selected JSF propulsion subsystem, such as the lift fan gearbox.",

Detailed block diagrams were developed for the critical subsystems that incorporate the techniques identified to provide the most benefit in performance.

We build one powerful meta-tool to automate many steps in creating the model, analyzing it to identify code segments to reuse, surgically extract those portions, and export to new programming languages.  The one meta-tool works across multiple programming languages.  Harmonia, Inc. is creating this tool, called the Legacy Analysis Workbench.   A user can visualize, search, browse, manipulate, and ask \u201cwhat if\u201d questions to navigate unfamiliar legacy code.

The kill vehicle is subjected to mechanical shock when the shroud separates from the interceptor and when the second stage separates from the third stage.  Both separation events are initiated by pyrotechnic devices.  To increase the probability of the kill vehicle withstanding these shocks, various shock isolation and attenuation systems have been proposed.  An alternate approach to protecting the kill vehicle is to reduce the shock generated by the separation systems.  The reduction of the magnitude of these source shocks warrants further investigation. Starsys Research Corporation (SRC) specializes in the development and commercialization of low-shock separation system technologies.  Under an on-going phase 1 SBIR with MDA, SRC is developing a low-shock separation technology that can be modified for direct application on the GMD vehicle to support a low-shock separation of the EKV.  CSA-Engineering specializes in shock and vibration isolation technologies, and has already developed an isolator prototype for the EKV.  Subsequently, SRC proposes providing MDA with an adapter that comprises both a low-shock separation of the EKV and isolation of the EKV from the GMD booster.  This proposed phase 2 program will provide MDA with a PDR-level design of the adapter, with key technologies of the adapter verified at the prototype level.

Significant effort is currently underway to test and regulate several packaged fuel options, including concentrated and dilute methanol packages, metal hydride based hydrogen storage systems, and logistics fuels.  Although several early portable fuel cell products plan to utilize chemical hydride based hydrogen generators as the fuel, little effort has been focused on this class of packaged fuel. The anticipated widespread adoption of portable fuel cell systems utilizing chemical hydride fuel packages will be delayed unless proper attention is focused on this packaged fuel option. Taking advantage of its experience in developing fuel cell systems utilizing a variety of packaged fuels and the test methodology and package development accomplished during Phase I, Lynntech proposes to implement the test methodology on existing and internally developed chemical hydride based systems as well as expand the environmental testing and development to include complete portable fuel cell systems.

        "abstract": "Composite Support & Solutions Inc (CSSI), proposes a Phase-II Project that involves the design, testing, and construction of a 135 foot tall prototype tower. The innovative nature of this tower is not only that it is made of composite materials, but also that it is completely fastenerless. Therefore tower design has the potential to operate for its design lifetime of 50 years in hot and humid environments with virtually no maintenance. As such the project adequately solves a significant problem posed by the Air Force engineers and managers, and their customers. In Phase-I a three legged tower was selected and designed for adequate stiffness and strength. Finite element modeling revealed that for the combined 50 mph wind load plus equipment load, plus its own weight it deflected no more than 21\u201d at the top. Therefore the three legged composite tower matches the stiffness of its steel counterpart at roughly half of the weight. Additionally, the composite structure can survive gale winds of 150 mph and there is substantial evidence that it won\u2019t collapse catastrophically, like a metal tower, in case one of its cross members or fastenerless joints fail.  In Phase-I we also detailed the fiber architecture of the truss member tubing, and developed these elements as pultrusions. The the manufacturing thus occurs with an automated process which points to the feasibility of an as installed cost which is competitive to that of a steel tower structure. The selected resin is a vinylester with an added UV stabilizing agent. Demo truss members were made in Phase-I. The Phase-II project consists of 25 tasks, each of which has a number of subtasks. The project will start off with a search for the most optimum tower configuration by using modern \u201cgenetic\u201d optimization algorithms. A substantial part of the project is dedicated to the development of a design database on the basis of coupons, truss members, and fastenerless connections. Effects of environmental exposure such as UV and temperature and also joint fatigue loading effects will be investigated. Pultrusion process design will lead to the pultrusion of the truss elements using CSSI\u2019s Glastruder pultrusion machine. These are assembled into a test section which is then instrumented and tested at CSSI. Subsequently a full scale 135 foot tower is delivered to Vandenberg AFB, where it is erected, instrumented, and monitored. The qualifications of the CSSI personnel are well documented and respected in the composites industry. The final tasks are the dissemination of information and the commercialization of this technology. In order to facilitate this CSSI has developed a strategic alliance with Composite Technology Corporation in Irvine, CA.",

This is due to wireless devices, upgrades in operating system and application software, and user configuration changes.  These changes result in a natural evolution of the network system that leads to new vulnerabilities for attackers to exploit.  Such changes may not expose the new vulnerabilities for months afterward, and then only after an attack succeeds.  The best situation awareness simply does not address the evolving nature of threats; situation awareness addresses response to attacks.  The Sentar Team developed a concept for the Protection Analysis Work Stations (PAWS) under a Phase I SBIR project.   The PAWS concept supports off-line analysis of computer network defense (CND) systems for the purpose of recommending improvements to their implementation.  The PAWS analyzes a CND system in order to improve its ability to protect both the network system and its critical applications from malicious or accidental damage.  The purpose of PAWS is to complement situation awareness system by providing off-line analysis and recommending improvements to it.

Progeny Systems Corporation with its teammate Ocean Systems Inc.

The focus was on keeping the ExAIV as inexpensive and reliable as possible for one time use, with the capability to deploy it after 5 years of storage with little or no maintenance. Innovative manufacturing techniques for the buoyancy tank, thrusters and covers, combined with the use of all COTS components will significantly reduce unit cost and simplify assembly.  This reduction in life-cycle cost can be accomplished by taking advantage of the fact that the ExAIV has a very short mission life and is thus expendable.

The code achieves outstanding error correction performance: 10 dB or more of net coding gain for random errors (at BER = 1E-12), and extremely long burst error correction - the duration of correctable burst errors is effectively limited only by the size of the codec's interleaver memory.  During SBIR Phase I we developed a Monte Carlo software simulation of a realistic space LaserCom channel and demonstrated the BER performance of our FEC code; and we implemented a prototype FEC codec on an FPGA development board.  During SBIR Phase II, we will develop a rad-tolerant single-chip ASIC version of our FEC Codec which operates up to 2.5 Gbps.

Realistic material modeling and simulation will not only provide a fundamental understanding, but also allow the a priori prediction of spectral properties such as color and intensity, leading to a more rational design and an accelerated development. The realistic modeling of optical properties will be accomplished by developing and implementing methods to incorporate vibronic and solvent effects into coupled cluster (CC) methods and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT).  The equations of motion (EOM)-CC methods provide consistently reliable access to excited states.  However, these methods are generally very time-consuming.

We have successfully extended our CFD software, 3DynaFS\u00a9, to the study of complex ship hulls with air plenums during Phase I.  The code enabled us to understand the fundamental hydrodynamics of the hull form, including the ventilated cavity dynamics, the effect of the air cavity on the wave-making resistance, and the stability of the air cavity.  In this proposed study, we will enhance the modeling capability of the code and extend its application to realistic simulations with oscillatory pitching motions and to practical hull forms with planing air tunnels.",

        "abstract": "Taggants are small objects used to label things or people that need to be traced. Synthetic DNA Taggants are ideal for this, since very small amounts can be detected if the sequence is known, and can be disguised by natural DNA in the environment. Known protocols for DNA amplification (e.g. PCR) allow for very sensitive DNA detection, but suffer from disadvantages: the apparatus is not very portable, require energy, and enzymes used degrade rapidly without refrigeration.  Our primary goal is to develop a prototype full-scale DNA Taggant system which includes (a) software to design the DNA strands comprising the DNA taggants, (b) means for dispersal of the DNA taggants, and (c) a detection device and associated biochemical protocols for detection of the DNA taggants.  The detection device uses two novel biochemical protocols for DNA detection. Like PCR, our protocols are also exquisitely sensitive: given only few molecules of single stranded DNA to be detected, the protocols increase the concentration of the DNA to be detected at a rate increasing exponentially with time. Unlike conventional PCR, our detection protocols are isothermal (that is, they operate without thermal cycling) and so our apparatus is very portable and needs no energy source.",

        "abstract": "Building cognitive systems that can interact with real world environments encompasses fields ranging from cognitive science, research artificial intelligence, robotics and control and many other research areas.   While significant advances have been made in all of these arenas, the integration of these capabilities into functional cognitive systems remains a significant challenge. Our approach is premised upon a number of observations and principles.  We observe that a general, unified theory of cognition has proven elusive.  Moreover, existing monolithic system development approaches cannot efficiently implement and integrate the full spectrum of cognitive knowledge representation and algorithms, nor can they take advantage of novel computer architectures and capabilities. In the proposed Phase II effort, we will develop an end-to-end framework, methodology and supporting tools for cognitive systems development.  The system-oriented development approach does not focus exclusively on single theories of cognition.  Rather, it addresses the design and specification of components and the integration and optimization of components into coherent cognitive systems.  It will include functional and behavioral components, control frameworks, and support tools and runtime infrastructures.  The goal of this effort is to make the approach sufficiently complete and usable so that it can be used in research into cognitive architectures and systems.",

Unlike the techniques based on single-photon states that are limited to low bit rates and short distances, our approach is based on coherent states emitted by ordinary lasers, permitting scaling to high speeds and deployment over realistic distances. We have already demonstrated single channel speeds of 622 Mb/s over 550 km distance in optical fiber. We aim to scale this technology to 2.5 Gb/s over free-space distances spanning LEO and MEO spacecrafts and ground networks. We believe this technology is also applicable to encrypting data over emerging commercial free-space-optics (FSO) networks. Specifically, in Phase II we will perform the following tasks: 1) Improve security with expanded electronics in the 622 Mb/s system. 2) Improve performance for up to 1 km free-space reach. 3) Add protocols and control circuitry to allow for fully automated operation. 4) Implement an on-demand key loading feature. 5) Build and characterize a working prototype suitable for trials in a deployed free-space system at the AFRL.

        "abstract": "Real-time fusion of data collected from a variety of radars that acquire information from multiple perspectives and/or different frequencies is being shown to provide a more accurate picture of the adversary threat cloud than any single radar or group of radars operating independently. In the ground midcourse problem, which involves the acquisition, tracking, and discrimination of multiple ballistic targets, it is important to distinguish between legitimate targets of opportunity and the threat cloud (clutter due to chaff, decoys, or other objects), and be able to consistently and reliably track the true target(s) during their midcourse trajectories. Hence, a \u201cbatched\u201d detection approach using \u201ccooperative\u201d radars together with applying distributed, decision-level algorithms is key to resolving closely-spaced objects within an expanding target object map area for the purpose of tracking legitimate targets in a continuous manner. The spatio-temporal-spectral characteristics of the problem can be exploited here to provide important strategic advantages. Also, it would seem that significant advantages could be gained by exploiting sensors of different modalities; such as overhead infrared (IR) and electro-optic (EO) sensors in addition to ground-based radars operating at different frequencies. Data fusion would require novel schemes of finely aligning (registering) and fusing multi-modality inputs to enhance the net accuracy of automated target detection, acquisition, tracking, and discrimination/recognition systems. This effort is to update and further develop the Phase I DataFusR track fusion algorithms, software, and hardware concept designs necessary to collect, process, and fuse information from multiple radars (either at the same or different frequency) to form a SIAP, and demonstrate the prototype technology in a realistic environment first using data from multiple radars, then show its ability to work in real-time in a high clutter environment. The approach will be extended in this effort to include other sources such as next-generation radars, IR and EO sensors to provide a versatile multi-modality sensor fusion capability to thoroughly address the present ground midcourse problem. This effort will concentrate on developing and applying multisensor track fusion algorithms to accurately characterize the threat cloud and provide a more definitive means of distinguishing between true target tracks and clutter object tracks. Technologies that enable this synergistic fusion and interpretation of data at several levels from disparate GMD radars and other types of sensors will enhance system acquisition, tracking and discrimination of threat objects in a cluttered environment and provide enhanced battle space awareness. In order to accomplish this, the generalized solution recently developed in Phase I will be extended, which adapts an intelligent multi-source data fusion (MSDF) simulation scheme for automatically selecting the most appropriate multi-target tracking, registration/fusion, and clutter rejection algorithms in forming a SIAP.",

        "abstract": "The dissemination of data collected from undersea systems historically has been accomplished via cable and/or by RF telemetry.  In many cases the available (limited) signal processing capability has required the transmission of raw or only slightly processed data to the end user.  Because of limited telemetry bandwidths, only a few sensors could therefore be active at any one time.  Due to recent major advances in DSP technology, it is now possible to develop systems of sensors with substantial organic computing power which permits in situ data processing and data fusion.  Because of recent major advances in undersea wireless acoustic communications, it is possible to deploy networks of such sensor systems covering large ocean areas, from very shallow water to the deepest oceans.  Benthos is a major participant in the Seaweb wide area network Program, and intend to leverage both from and to that program in developing local area networks (LANs).  However, the development of protocols, hardware, and firmware for LANs is not part of any of our programs.  This LAN technology is a critical part of our proposed autonomous 4-D observatory.  In this proposed effort we will work with the Seaweb community to develop the LAN-to-Seaweb protocols required to integrate the LAN into the larger network  A valuable addition to an otherwise fixed observatory is the incorporation of a mobile \u201cnode,\u201d (i.e., a UUV) which can explore the ocean space beyond the observation limits of the fixed LAN.  We propose to define the requirements for an arbitrary UUV to participate with our observatory.  However, because a key component in two of our related programs is the development of telesonar-based capabilities in the EMATT vehicle, we propose to concentrate on this vehicle for the observatory.  Our goal is to upgrade this very small and inexpensive vehicle to one capable of reacting to externally-received (via acomms) commands and to transmitting data to the observatory.  In summary, the Navy requires autonomous underwater systems which can collect environmental data, provide surveillance functions, and provide C2 and data connectivity with the outside world.",

        "abstract": "Application  of a unique separator material, ceramic fiber separator (CFS), developed by Inventek, can serve as the foundation for advanced thermal batteries to triple EKV battery capacity at high power. A new rapid method of thin-cell production would use the fiber separator CFS as a carrier for tapecast cell assembly and reduce unit cost by 25%.  In this method, a tunnel kiln process can produce pellets 40 times faster and free up hydraulic presses for other component production.  This approach overcomes the slow production time, expensive equipment, and limited handling characteristics of conventional thermal battery production using uniaxial-pressed powder parts. A major improvement is a 20 times increase in pellet strength with the CFS; both thinner and larger diameter separator can be handled. Phase I SBIR provided a proof of concept demonstration of the CFS in a pyro-initiated 12-cell thermal battery. Forty laminated cell components were produced to conduct more than 20 single cell and 12-cell battery tests. The Phase I SBIR also developed baseline processing for 15 mil thick tapecast FeS2 electrode, which was laminated with the CFS.  These achievements provide a basis to pursue a pilot plant for tapecast thin-cells, in addition to a continuous thin-cell production envisioned by Inventek. Both advanced production methods are carried out in collaboration with thermal battery manufacturer ENSER to be ready for phase III production.

This system features a novel trajectory design methodology integrated with an innovative on-line aerodynamic identification architecture.  The trajectory design methodology employs computationally efficient algorithms yielding feasible trajectories that are robust with respect to degraded vehicle performance resulting from vehicle damage and/or malfunction.  The aerodynamic identification scheme uses on-line measurements to produce a global estimate of the vehicle\u2019s aerodynamic characteristics augmented with local corrections from which global aerodynamic constraint estimates are derived and utilized in the trajectory reshaping/retargeting process as well as in the reconfigurable control system.  Overall system performance will be further enhanced through the application of modern nonlinear tracking and antiwindup compensation methods to the design of improved guidance and control laws.  The SBIR team also proposes to develop an integrated guidance and control (IG&C) architecture featuring an autonomous top-level flight manager that coordinates control reconfiguration, guidance reconfiguration, and trajectory reshaping/retargeting.  The SBIR team will leverage its recent experience in flight manager technology development to provide this significant enhancement to the Phase II project with relatively modest incremental effort.  The Phase II effort will culminate in the development of a working prototype of the fully integrated Trajectory Management System and demonstration in a high-fidelity simulation environment.",

This very accurate repair, which occurs whenever and wherever needed, would enable the self-repair of thermoset composite laminates such as airplanes components.

Its operation uniquely combines three independent optical techniques based on measurement of fluorescence and thermal signals generated within the Thermally Grown Oxide (TGO) layer. These signals are used to quantify the compressive stress inside the TGO, the TGO layer thickness, and the fraction of delaminated interface areas. A technical advantage of this approach is that it provides inherent subsurface selectivity at the location where TBC structures are most prone to fail. During Phase I, we successfully demonstrated the feasibility of these techniques by performing a blind test evaluation. The thrust of Phase II is to develop these techniques into an imaging mode, with the additional advantage of more rapid mapping of complex surfaces such as turbine engine components.

        "abstract": "Compact arrays of ultra-high-speed analog laser sources or lasers integrated with modulators are needed for LADAR sensors and scene generation. Multiplex, Inc., UC Berkeley and UCSD propose a novel Monolithic Injection-Locked Analog Transmitter Array (MILATA) for wide frequency range (>2GHz) operation with 60 dB to 72 dB optical extinction ratio. MILATA is a versatile technology platform that is built on our recent success in monolithic injection-locked lasers funded by DARPA RFLICS program. The monolithic injection locked laser we invented is the most compact and practical injection-locked semiconductor laser. For LADAR scene generation, the injection locked laser will be monolithically integrated with an electro-absorption modulator (EAM). Direct modulation of the injection locked laser will be combined with external modulation using the monolithically integrated EAM for the proposed LADAR simulators. A novel quarter-wave shifted DFB laser with strong gratings will be fabricated for high device yield, which is necessary for array integration. A long-interaction-length EA modulator design with low waveguide propagation loss will be used for high optical extinction ratio while maintaining high modulation speed. A selective-area MOCVD (metal organic chemical vapor deposition) method for InP-GaInAsP based materials will be optimized for high-density, chip-scale transmitter array integration. The output of this SBIR Phase-II program will be a fully packaged MILATA with 8 fiber channels per card. The 8-channel transmitter arrays can be stacked on the fiber output side to form a 2-dimensioanl 8 x 8 array. We will pursue the development of manufacturing technologies for growing from 8 x 8 to 256 x 256 fiber channels. The proposed MILATA is a general-purpose, application-specific photonic IC technology that can be tailored to both DOD (LADAR scene generation, RF photonic links, phased array radars, millimeter wave generation) and commercial applications (parallel optical interconnect in next generation super computers, CATV distribution, high speed digital data links, and instrumentation). The technology fits Multiplex\u2019s continuing marketing roadmap, and the ability for different applications to share the same technology platform is the key to cost reduction.",

        "abstract": "Testing and evaluation of torpedo active search and homing performance in reverberant environments is best done by high fidelity simulation. The Phase I part of the work being proposed here concluded that in order to provide high fidelity and computationally efficient broadband simulations of realistic reverberation, a new approach was required. Previous approaches were based on frequency domain-based spectral factorization, which could not easily be generalized to the broadband case and, at the same time, remain computationally feasible. This proposal describes a task with the goal of providing a time-domain based model of reverberation for torpedo simulators. It has the capability of providing a computationally feasible simulation that contains the broadband case in a natural manner. This means that the bandwidth and any associated Doppler shifts will be correctly modeled without any approximations, unlike the spectral factorization approaches. A further advantage is that, contrary to the spectral factorization approaches, this time-domain approach is not limited to quasi-stationarity and Gaussianity. The result will be a processor that can provide time series that faithfully and accurately represent the outputs of the individual hydrophones for a multi-beam torpedo sonar receiver.",

Zinc sulfide presents a wideband capability and will result in a significant system cost reduction of 70%-80% for the seeker window.  The transmission capabilities of the current window material have a limited waveband. A material which has the ability to transmit at a higher waveband will be beneficial for target acquisition and target discrimination.  Analysis has been conducted on alternate seeker window materials using rigorous computational fluid dynamics to predict the worst case aerodynamic heating combined with finite element thermal and structural analysis used to construct a statistical analysis model. In addition to the analysis conducted, thermophysical property testing and optical property testing has been accomplished under the Phase I Sbir effort to verify analytical predictions. This model, supported by test data, shows that ZnS can withstand worst case heating and will provide improved optical properties as compared to sapphire. To prepare zinc sulfide for system consideration, flight test, and Block Upgrade, thermostructural evaluation under worst case flight conditions and high fidelity over-testing of the worst case thermal conditions will be conducted to validate the selection of zinc sulfide.

In Phase I we showed proof of our high temperature non-linear dielectric concept and in Phase II we will optimize the technology for prototype demonstration in a commercial manufacturing environment using common mass production techniques, and demonstrate packaged device functionality for use in radiation environments. Phase III will be product introduction to the military and commercial space markets.",

        "abstract": "Complexity of immersive displays continues to grow and so does required setup and calibration.  A myriad of measurements and adjustments must be performed to verify compliance of systems and components to specifications.  Routine system maintenance sometimes necessitates less involved system alignment to minimize system down-time. Traditionally, a number of instruments are used.  Transits may be used to verify absolute locations of display imagery with respect to design specifications.  Luminance meters may be used to measure colorimetry for channel matching and edge blending. Large amounts of manual setup, measurement, and interpretation, followed by manual and/or computer based calculations provide feedback to the image source to correct parameters. Advances in amateur telescopes during the 1990s yielded computer controlled pointing devices with tracking precision accuracy on the order of arc-seconds.  Coupled with a calibrated video camera, a precision measurement and feedback device for verification and auto-alignment of complex display parameters can be developed. The proper mix of COTS components, adaptable mounting hardware, and computer control software, will produce an effective device which minimizes setup time, labor, and costs.  With open format data interface, the system becomes a tool which any display system or image generator (IG) vendor can take advantage of.",

        "abstract": "This effort is based on the outcome of a successful Phase I project that demonstrated the feasibility of generating logic pattern-based, OS-platform-independent, signatures for malicious program logic and detecting its presence within much larger binary modules. The detection (and localization) of a logic-based signature within a binary executable represents a significant advancement in automated code analysis. It also offers a new capability to test the hardness or vulnerability of protected software modules (e.g. test logic obfuscation hardness, vulnerability to exploitation, etc.). The approach taken involves the development of canonical signatures based on essential logic patterns required for a (malicious) function to occur. When logic patterns of certain malicious codes are extracted it is also possible to relate logic signatures to specific exploitive behaviors. This results in an OS/language/hardware independent signature for malicious exploits, strategies and tactics. We can then extract the logic structure from an arbitrary binary and scan it for specific malicious logic. Scanning a binary module requires disassembling and recovering features of the logical implementation (hence, it can potentially violate some software licensing agreements). A Phase II development will support information assurance within MDA\u2019s Computer Network Operations and directly support program objectives for the Common Operating Environment (COE)",

The ACLM will comprise of two functional modules: Prognostic Health Management (PHM) and Adaptive Intelligent Control (AIC). During Phase I, Impact developed an architecture, along with prototype PHM and AIC algorithms, and demonstrated them on a generic jet engine simulation model. The on-line generic PHM algorithms utilize a combination of sensor data, signal processing, data/knowledge fusion, physical/empirical models and an integrated probabilistic reasoner to predict degraded performance or health conditions.   During Phase II, Impact and Honeywell will adapt the PHM algorithms for application to engine, generator, lubrication system and gearbox health analysis for Honeywell\u2019s F124 engine. The PHM algorithms will include model-based parameter estimation, vibration monitoring, fault pattern recognition, and evolutionary prognostic techniques. The PHM system will use multiple algorithms on each subsystem and fuse their outcomes to improve the confidence of fault and health prognosis of each subsystem and its components. The hierarchical AIC module will use PHM information to perform a capability assessment of its respective system and perform operation re-planning and optimization, if necessary.

Elimination of the transmissive canopy, enabled by removing the need to retain pressure to maintain shape, significantly improves concentration efficiency (25% over SOA) while simultaneously greatly reducing/eliminating other concentrator sub-system mass contributers, such as the canopy, torus reaction structure, and torus/lenticular pressurization make-up gas systems.  The latter has strong mission life benefits as well.  In Phase II we will advance the technology readiness level by concentrating on refining understanding of the structural behavior of asymmetric single surface membrane shells, demonstrate packaging, deployment, and rim stabilization approaches, and investigate manufacturing paths for concentrators of the required mission driven sizes.  Scaled demonstrator is expected at end of Phase II.

In Phase II, Aret\u00e9 will develop, build, and test a small number of prototype, XSVA arrays. Aret\u00e9 will field test the prototype XSVA arrays on a platform of opportunity, if time and schedule permit. Aret\u00e9 has included a Phase II option task to allow leasing an aircraft or ship if a platform of opportunity proves not to be available.

        "abstract": "Building on Phase I results, Computational Sensor Corporation proposes a Phase-II Program to complete the design, fabrication and demonstration of the Multicolor Processor IC.  This effort will include the assembly of electrically interconnected layers to produce a compact and computationally efficient Alternate Architecture implementation featuring three-dimensional stacking of ICs directly below a 2-dimensional detector array.  Massively parallel operation is realized by integrating sensing and processing functions at the pixel level thereby relieving the severe data bottleneck found in conventional architectures attempting to satisfy large focal plane formats and emerging weapons system requirements.   Present architectures multiplex the tens of thousands to millions of individual pixel signals into very few high-speed video lines prior to complex signal processing occurring after digitization.  For example, typical infrared sensor formats now in production have output data rates around 6 MHz (60-Hz frame-rates).   The next generation of multicolor arrays requires data rates reaching well into the gigahertz.  Compact, low-power systems, especially requiring high dynamic range and high frame-rates, simply cannot handle the vast volume of raw data.  The Alternate Architecture constitutes the first new imaging system approach since the invention of hybrid infrared focal-plane arrays in the 1970\u2019s by incorporating innovative bulk pre-processing at the pixel-level.",

To realize the exciting potentials of distributed sensor systems, the fundamental problems of optimal sensor attribute selection and optimal sensor deployment have to been solved. This is a typical multi-objective optimization and control problem that results in an optimal design to best balance the conflicting performance objectives and to dynamically adapt to changes of environment conditions. In this proposal, Intelligent Automation Inc.

The general distributed sensor framework is capable of supporting various sensing and environment models, the METROC/C4I infrastructure, and optimal sensor system design and management. The development will be based on IAI\u2019s innovative Cybele agent infrastructure.

Technical requirements for suitable windows/domes include Laser/IR/RF transmission at all temperatures, resistance to erosion and heat damage, and strength, within an acceptable cost target. Magnesium aluminate spinel offers a low-cost option to fabricate the necessary components, which are potentially less costly to operate than competitive transparent ceramics, sapphire and ALON.  Spinel is optically superior in the infrared particularly from 3 to 5.5 microns. Its cubic crystal structure is optically isotropic, unlike sapphire, which exhibits birefringence. This Phase II development effort will focus on improving the manufacturability of high-transmission spinel and the material\u2019s engineering properties. Large flat spinel windows will be hot pressed and HIPed and large spinel domes will be pressureless sintered and HIPed. Both processes have been proven by TA&T for smaller windows and domes.

Spectral Sciences Incorporated (SSI), has demonstrated an instrument in Phase I which produces broadband two-dimensional imagery for target acquisition/tracking, and, simultaneously, multispectral images for discrimination.  The number of spectral channels resolved is adjustable in real time, making it possible to adopt different discrimination functions to match specific threat scenarios even during the course of a single mission. The system has high optical throughput, with data rates limited only by the detector readout speed. The instrument has no macro-scale moving parts, and can be built in a robust, small-volume and low-mass package, suitable for integration within the EKV.   The Phase II prototype will demonstrate multispectral imaging in the LWIR spectral range with laboratory simulated targets. The technology is generally applicable to any spectral range, from the UV to the LWIR, and therefore is suitable for a wide variety of multispectral imaging applications.",

        "abstract": "Several plume-hardbody handover algorithms under development are demonstrating capability to localize the missile body when the body is resolved or approximately the size of a pixel.  Several scenarios involving liquid propellant missile systems, such as those involving large angles of attack and those observed at moderate to long ranges and near nose-on viewing aspect angles, provide challenges to both single and dual band infrared concepts.  Since wavebands are typically optimized for plume detection, these conditions challenge space-based and airborne systems employed to provide accurate metrics for reconstruction of threat trajectories and to provide position information for midcourse intercept within the BMDS.  In the enhancement flight regime (typically 70-200 km altitude for ICBM class missiles), fluid dynamic considerations indicate that plume radiance patterns exhibit a characteristic parabolic shape.  This parabola is maintained even at large angles of attack, when the windward side of the plume may be significantly brighter than the leeward side or the localized \u201cvacuum core\u201d region used as an aim-point for certain handover algorithms.  Fitting the radiance pattern to this characteristic parabola provides a means to determine the plume symmetry axis.  Relatively straightforward interpretation of the radiance patterns, possibly augmented with off-board information or information gained from multiple frames of data, yields features that determine whether the threat is observed at near nose-on aspect angles or high angles of attack.  These features can then be used to select the correct \u201cbright point\u201d that includes the missile body.  Moreover, this parabola provides additional information revealing characteristics of the propulsion system for purposes of target identification.  In our Phase II studies we will refine the algorithms developed in Phase I for measuring and exploiting this parabolic shape of the plume.",

        "abstract": "AeroAstro proposes to leverage its existing innovative miniature star-tracker design to develop an improved star tracker that provides both spacecraft attitude and angular rate information. The resulting system will have minimal cost and impact to spacecraft resources and can easily handle typical spacecraft tumble conditions and provide for recovery from a lost-in-space (LIS) condition. AeroAstro along with MIT has been developing a miniature low cost star, known as MST, is a shift away from the industry trend of increasing star tracker attitude determination accuracy to the exclusion of all other performance metrics.  MST provides good performance with respect to speed of pattern recognition, field of view, star catalog size and accuracy while simultaneously reducing mass, size, complexity, and cost.  This SBIR Phase II effort will enhance MST with the ability to perform a lost-in-space initialization, and the ability to provide meaningful information during high angular rate motion.  Additionally, in recognition of the trend towards more modular and standardized Spacecraft systems, the MST star tracker will be given a standard USB interface for command and telemetry. The resulting system, FAR-MST, will provide a complete low-cost, low-power attitude determination solution ideal for small, rapid-response low earth orbit satellites.",

These conditions can significantly impact the performance and behavior characteristics of the composite motorcase structure. Fueling of the rocket motor adds an additional complexity in that inspection of the interior becomes impossible while creating the possibility of disbonds between the case and fuel. These factors can have potentially catastrophic consequences for the missile performance. Acellent Technologies has proposed to develop a cradle-to-grave structural health monitoring system for rocket motors by using an innovative combination of passive and active sensing techniques in combination with an intergrated piezoelectric sensor network. The developed system will have the ability to monitor impact location, extent and severity of damage in the case and between the case and propellant. Phase I focused on the development of a preliminary structural health monitoring system. Phase II will focus on developing the system further, qualifying it for rocket motors and using it to identify and quantify damage such as disbonds in rocket motors. The development will be conducted in close collaboration with ATK-Thiokol who fully support the developmental and commercialization efforts.",

Resistive heating technology is the most mature of the myriad IR scene projection technologies available today; and hence is the most appropriate and realistic foundation on which to base the development of the next generation of high dynamic range IR scene projectors.  Unfortunately, the materials used in fabricating existing generation of devices are not capable of withstanding the ultra-high temperatures required for the next generation of devices.  Materials research for this application, performed in a phase 1 effort, has turned up several potential material systems that are expected to be stable at the extreme temperatures required for the next generation of devices (~2500 K or higher).  The work outlined in this proposal is aimed at selecting the most promising of the material systems (and deposition techniques) based on process development, annealing experiments and measurements of the properties relevant to ultra-high temperature IRSP performance.

In particular, there are few polymeric materi-als that are suitable for replacing eutectic solder bonding in electronic devices used in high-temperature environments, such as the operating environment of high power wide bandgap elec-tronic devices. The US Navy Radar development roadmap plans for the insertion of high power microwave devices (High Voltage GaAs, SiC,GaN) into solid-state radar systems by 2007.  These new devices will operate at power densities over 10X of current GaAs MMICs.  Efficient device cooling is critical towards meeting device performance and reliability requirements. Due to manufacturing considerations, current packaging strategies utilize both solder and thermally conductive adhesives for device bonding. However, most conductive adhesives do not exhibit satisfactory thermal performance and are the majority contributor to thermal rise in device junc-tion temperatures (Tjc). We have developed a low-temperature sintering adhesive that, with some modification, will address these performance issues. Our unique formulation incorporates a novel polymeric resin that can be tailored to cure rapidly over a varied temperature range. It is solvent-free and easily processed. Incorporation of a combination of suitable alloy powders in this resin formulation allows the preparation of composite adhesives capable of forming metal-lurgical connections to a variety of metal surfaces.  Additional development will yield adhesives with electrical and thermal conductivity properties similar to solder materials but with the proc-essing advantages of current polymeric adhesives.",

        "abstract": "A key component of missile interceptor vehicles is the divert and attitude control system (DACS), which is responsible for maneuvering the interceptor vehicle to its target.  A vital component to the DACS is the thruster, which provides effective control of vehicle divert.  Solid propellant DACS thrusters employ an adjustable pintle for controlling the thrust level.  Movement of the pintle for smooth operation is typically accomplished with electro-mechanical (EM) actuators that require a significant portion of the total vehicle power.  As the DAC thrust duration requirements increase, the power needs for EM actuation severely impedes meeting weight and size requirements.  The focus of this effort is to minimize the electrical power requirements of the DACS by utilizing a small portion of energy from the solid propellant motor.   The proposed innovative technique utilizes hot gases from the gas generator to drive the pintle actuation in a proportional mode.  The Phase II effort will demonstrate a prototype hot gas actuator in relevant environment, which will verify the drastically reduced electrical power requirements for DACS for interceptor vehicles.  Hence, the weight, size, and cost of the interceptor vehicles will be significantly reduce, and provide a more reliable and effective ballistic missile defense system.",

Thermal batteries require four types of pellets that comprise the energy-producing portion of the battery.

A pellet is manufactured by compacting its powdered constituents in an automated press.  The powder is loaded into a feed shoe, which automatically fills a die cavity. Currently, pellet production is the rate-limiting step in thermal battery manufacture, hence, it is essential to optimize press throughput.  The chemical, physical, and mechanical differences between the powders are wildly different. The ultimate material would exhibit excellent flow behavior and compaction behavior. The pharmaceutical industry has done extensive work in this area.  One of the methods utilized to improve flow properties and compression characteristics is granulation.

The MCA will provide an urgently needed mobile C2BMC SATCOM solution for the BMDS by employing multiple simultaneous SATCOM connections, including UHF, EHF, SHF (X, KA, and Ku Band), NATO, and commercial.  During Phase II, ISAC will adapt its revolutionary new and proprietary communications architecture and requirements analysis tool for use in analyzing mobile C2BMC SATCOM requirements. ISAC will then develop a multiple simultaneous SATCOM for C2BMC software/hardware system design specifications, simulation, and software /hardware prototype. The MCA prototype will be tested and if feasible actually demonstrated at the JNIC using a live EHF connection by ISAC in the Phase II effort. The base effort deliverables consist of a complete hardware/software prototype system design along with a SATCOM simulation prototype that simulates at the JNIC an EHF link between a mobile C2BMC capable of worldwide deployment and a remote sensor. During Option 1, ISAC will complete development of the SATCOM prototype through TRL-5 and if feasible (based on SATCOM link, terminal, and facilities availability) ISAC will  demonstrate the actual multiple simultaneous SATCOM prototype.",

        "abstract": "MEMS accelerometers typically use force/torque rebalance applied by subcomponent actuators which, although well-understood, are seriously limited in performance by fundamental material and electronics stability issues, and some subcomponent design issues. These deficiencies can be overcome by the introduction of \"gyro-rebalance\", which substitutes inertial force balancing (the use of gyro torque to counterbalance pendulum torque) for the actuators. The best example of a gyro-rebalance accelerometer is the ultra-high performance Pendulous Integrating Gyro Accelerometer (the \"PIGA\") used in all U.S. strategic ballistic missile guidance systems.  This proposal begins with the design of existing MEMS gyros and MEMS accelerometers under development at MSSA as components of an Integrated MEMS IMU under a Phase II SBIR contract from the Air Force, and makes the necessary modifications to make a gyro-rebalance accelerometer.  The gyro-rebalance mechanization is expected to improve the scale factor accuracy to achieve performance levels that are orders of magnitude better than currently available from MEMS accelerometers.",

The fundamental innovation is the Ontology Life Cycle Management Methodology.  Rather than offer advanced ontology capabilities that only expert modelers can appreciate, instead we will link them into a cohesive whole that is accessible to novices as well.  The OLCM methodology is the key to this accessibility.

The instrument will rapidly and precisely detect extremely small changes in optical loss with high temporal resolution over an extended period of time, and provide a history for subsequent correlation with ABL system performance.  The system will provide a means of correlating a measured change in sensor performance with the reduction in performance of similar ABL components specifically at the relevant wavelength (e.g. 1315 nm, 1064 nm, etc).  The system will detect changes in performance that occur due to a host of different mechanisms, including adsorption, particle loading, and coating degradation.  The Phase I research demonstrated a prototype version of the sensor, and verified the ability to autonomously monitor small yet significant changes in high performance optics over an extended period of time.  Designs and associated subcomponents were identified for the Phase II Prototype, and the system was prepared for preliminary testing at an ABL test facility. The Phase II effort will comprise constructing a ruggedized sensor system that possesses expanded capabilities, including a suitably configured data acquisition and analysis system.  The Phase II prototype will be tested under a range of controlled environments to characterize system response, and subsequently installed and tested at an ABL test chamber to quantify performance.

The smart piping system will benefit the ABL by protecting its personnel and weapon system from the highly toxic and hazardous laser chemicals.  Literature shows that exposure to chlorine gas at concentrations of 40-60 ppm is very dangerous and that exposure at concentrations of 1000 ppm will cause death after a few breaths. Another corrosive gas used in the ABL laser is ammonia gas which may be explosion under the right conditions, especially in confined spaces and if exposed to a intense energy source such as static discharge. Chlorine gas can be highly corrosive to aluminum and titanium structure, as well as, electronic circuitry.  Phase I demonstrated that the smart pipe was 32% lighter over the baseline tubing (Hasteloy C-276).

This new approach will be developed into a prototype sensor during Phase II for proof of concept and allow for airborne tests during Phase III. Upon program completion we will have a prototype tunable spectral imager with demonstrated capability to measure the time/temperature profile of selective radiators in real time.  This technology will be developed with a transition into MDA midcourse discrimination sensor in mind. At program completion the technology will be ready to move into a Phase III program with the MDA Ground Based Midcourse (GMD) program office.

We propose the fabrication, integration and test of these subsystems via a phased antenna array range demonstration in which the test system is comprised of a wideband antenna array, prototype antenna modules and a PTTD beamformer.  The overarching goal of the range tests is to obtain a thorough understanding of how the performance of the photonic subsystems affect the overall system performance, and of practical issues such as array calibration. A key focus of the proposed Phase II development effort is to reduce the size, weight and power of the system.  In keeping with the long-term goal of eliminating the need for dc power at the antenna, the photonic antenna modules will support electrical power generation by a photovoltaic converter. High performance photonic components currently being developed under DARPA\u2019s ULTRA T/R program will be leveraged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the system as cost and availability permit, reducing the need for LNA gain and thus minimizing the dc power dissipation at each element.

Ignition of fuel vapor in aircraft fuel tanks has numerous times resulted in loss of life and property in commercial and military aviation.  The availability of an in-tank oxygen sensor would provide feedback for more efficient use of OBIGGS, saving fuel consumption by reducing ground time waiting for tank inerting, and in flight by activating OBIGGS only when required.  The in-tank oxygen sensor would also provide immediate notification of an OBIGGS malfunction, indicating the need for service.  The sensor elements used materials that have been qualified for fuel and aircraft applications.

Further, because there is frequently a need to integrate several experiments on a single satellite, modularization allows individual teams to develop its functions with less impact and reduced risk than for a highly-integrated experiment.  In previous efforts, we defined a modularized architecture for a networked data acquisition and control system.

        "abstract": "The Missile Defense Agency is engaged in deployment and operation of a Ground-based Mid-course, missile defense program under an overarching Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  The command and control portion of this program that will host a fusion system combining data from multiple sensor elements is known as the Command and Control Battle Management Communications (C2BMC) System.  As the complexity of the BMDS continues to increase, certain advancements to the C2BMC would be useful to improve its effectiveness and utility.  This proposal is focused on providing higher fidelity communications simulations that incorporate diverse communication and sensor platform characteristics.  We will develop a new adaptive communications-fusion architecture for the BMDS and provide scenario development and expanded missile flyout tools for the Benchmark simulation, along with advanced visualization.  Options are also included for other MDA sections, which may be interested in use of ad hoc networking payloads applicable to MDA\u2019s High Altitude Airship in future BMDS architectures, and modeling of those future architectures.  Perhaps most important, SkySentry will assemble a cohesive team of experts from within the company and teammates from Lockheed Martin IS&S, Numerica Corporation, and SPARTA for long-term improvement to the C2BMC.",

        "abstract": "Radiation-transport (RT) codes constitute the core component of the target, plume, background, and atmospheric signature models utilized by MDA and virtually every other government agency and commercial company involved in developing optically-based weapons, surveillance, and remote sensing systems. Critical to the accuracy and range of application of RT codes are the accuracy and completeness of their companion molecular spectral properties databases, e.g., HITRAN, HITEMP, SIRRM. These databases are incomplete and, in many spectral regions, are of insufficient accuracy for many applications. To address this problem Spectral Sciences, Inc. has successfully demonstrated in Phase I the potential of an innovative high-temperature spectral parameter modeling approach. Our approach, dubbed CHEMS (Computation of Highly Excited Molecular Spectra), uses classical dynamics to model the absorption by the high density of spectral lines found at high temperature, where lines blend together to form a continuum that can be described at a much lower spectral resolution. In Phase II we propose to build a complete CHEMS spectral database generation capability by implementing a general version of CHEMS integrated with a spectral line generation approach. We shall also generate the first version of the HITEMP-CHEMS database, merging HITEMP lines and CHEMS cross sections.",

In Phase II, MCScene will be enhanced with additional ELDT phenomenology, including 3D clouds and plumes, and dynamic scene elements. A novel acceleration algorithm will be developed for MCScene to facilitate the transition from an expert-user specialty code to a broad-based non-expert user workhorse simulation tool.

The model will include reflection from the target and a Doppler/ranging capability. In Phase I, a ladar model of the chaff deployment scenario was demonstrated using 100000 individual chaff elements. In Phase II, an upgraded ladar module will be integrated into FLITES.

The Phase II StateRover tool-set will solve the specification problem by extending UML statecharts with NTLChart capabilities, i.e., temporal logic (with real-time and time-series constraints) and natural language specifications integrated with non-deterministic statecharts. The NTLCharts language combines the two prominent formal specification languages namely UML statecharts and temporal logic. In Phase I we demonstrated the applicability of TLCharts and its formal syntax and semantics.  The Phase II StateRover tool-set will solve the verification problem by providing: 1. Tool for design, code generation and animation of NTLCharts specifications integrated with deterministic UML statechart models.  2.

        "abstract": "In recent years, as relevant technologies have advanced, there has been renewed interest at the Missile Defense Agency in Boost Phase Intercept (BPI).  One of the key capabilities necessary for a viable BPI system is an Early Launch Detection & Tracking (ELDT) system.  In order to provide enough time for an intercept to be made during its ascent phase, the target must be detected and characterized as a threat and its trajectory must be determined with high enough fidelity to accurately launch the interceptor missile.  In our Phase I study, we analyzed trades on the critical parameters associated with our basic, \u201cstrawman,\u201d concept for a staring, wide field of view, multi-spectral sensor.  This strawman concept was guided by our experience fielding and testing radiometers and imagers in the ultraviolet through IR spectral regions, processing and analyzing the data collected by these systems against ELDT targets, as well as by our analysis of simulations executed over a range of sensor types and advanced processing techniques.  These simulations incorporated the results from phenomenological modeling of a range of threat types, backgrounds and viewing conditions.  Our work during Phase I focused on selection of spectral bands that would enable high probability detection at low false alarm rates at cloud break and that would, furthermore, provide some capability for detection below cloud decks.  In addition, during Phase I we leveraged other SciTec contracts to establish working relationships with personnel at national laboratories and within the defense industry who are working key technologies for ELDT \u2013 Technologies that we will leverage to develop an ELDT system concept during Phase II of our effort.   Inherently scalable, a sensor of this type might be fielded on a series of different platforms - starting, perhaps, on the HALO-2 aircraft - and progressing to a space-based capability as the technology matures.  As part of this effort, we considered costs and benefits associated with implementing state-of-the-art techniques, such as hyper-temporal collection and processing to provide clutter suppression against bright sunlit backgrounds, in an ELDT system. The objective of this Phase II research project is to formally define the requirements for an ELDT system, continue developing specifications for an ELDT sensor capable of meeting those requirements (essentially flowing down mission requirements to system specifications), building upon the results of our Phase I studies to mature the capabilities of ELDT components and to generate a prototype sensor design.  Within the construct of MDA\u2019s Technical Readiness Levels, our Phase II activities will focus on executing the analyses and developing the software tools required for our ELDT sensor \u201csystem\u201d to meet the TRL-3 criteria and on building a defendable plan for meeting the TRL-4 criteria. The modeling, simulation and data exploitation tools developed during our proposed Phase II study will potentially benefit both the DoD and the Defense Industry by formalizing the flow-down from requirements to system-level specifications and allowing innovative technology concepts to be evaluated prior to costly implementations.  Our Phase II activities will depend upon extensive interactions with personnel within the larger MDA and space systems community in order to identify and define requirements, develop more comprehensive databases of target threats, coordinate additional test activities, verify performance of critical components to meet their requirements, and to determine how our ELDT sensor best fits within the larger MDA architecture.",

Detector ROC curves were developed to establish the detection probability (Pd) under a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) for various sensor signal-to-noise (SNR) values.  Background statistics were established using a novel in-scene technique by first creating the target subspace, and second, projecting the scene into an independent subspace.  Specific target subspaces can be generated from the Red Team-provided data, and engagement scenario simulations. During the proposed Phase-II, the operability of the algorithm will be tested under more stressing and BMDS-relevant engagement scenarios, with real sensor operating factors such as PSF, reduced number of bands, broader bandpass, etc.  OKSI will work with Project Hercules Blue and Red Teams and the Corporate Clutter Working Group (CCWG) to establish realistic threat signatures and demonstrate target detection, discrimination, and countermeasure and clutter mitigation capabilities.  Also, working with the Decision Architecture (DA) Team, OKSI will contribute to the physics-based discrimination and EO/IR sensor integration.  The proposed technology is applicable to all phases of the BMDS and the various support sensors such as DSP, STSS, SBIR High, CB, HALO-I/II, and AIRS, as well as the KV onboard-sensors for plume-to-hardbody handover and aim point selection (boost, exo-atmpshperic, and terminal intercept), and finally, in closely spaced object conditions.",

In some instances, mostly for the non-line-of-site configurations, Cd is replaced by Aluminum (Al) which is applied by Ion Vapor Deposition (IVD).

        "abstract": "Carbon fiber-based brakes are made out of so-called carbon-carbon composite material (CC) that consists of two components: weaved carbon cloth and solid carbon matrix. The limitations of oxidation protection systems for CC, especially in long duration, cyclic and/or reusable applications, have made an impact on continuous use of CC materials for aircraft brakes. During the exploitation they are exposed to very high heat, often above 1000\u00b0 F, as well as many contaminants including aircraft and runaway chemicals. Temp sticks that are utilized to monitor the surface temperature of the brakes, catalyze high temperature oxidation reactions on the surface of the carbon brakes causing premature embritlement and subsequently, reducing brake life and increasing brake failures and often fires. The objective of this work is to continue investigate and develop oxidation resistant coatings and systems to reduce and possibly eliminate the CC surface oxidation via utilization of the Electro-magnetically enhanced Physical Vapor Deposition (EPVD\u2122) technology.

        "abstract": "The current inventory of Department of Defense shelters and ancillary equipment relies on metallic structures as well as aluminum/foam and beam panels that are extremely susceptible to corrosion.  The primary reason for field and depot level repairs of military equipment is corrosion.  Metallic weapon systems and their components require extensive corrosion protection to extend service life and prevent operational failures. Current practices consist of polyurethane primers and topcoats for corrosion protection of metallic surfaces and structural members. These maintenance processes require significant resources (approximately 800 million dollars per year) for corrosion treatment applications and the related Haz-Mat disposal processes. Internal corrosion is especially harmful due to the absence of non-destructive methods for detection, prevention, removal or treatment. In order to mitigate the problem of internal corrosion, and reduce the associated costs that accompany it, an inhibitor that self-activates when exposed to moisture and effectively prevents the sustaining of corrosive conditions is a very effective option. In order to minimize the cost impact of such a system as well as reduce overall life-cycle costs, efficient integration and design into current manufacturing processes will be essential.",

This fairing would be usable on existing launch vehicles without extensive modifications of those launch vehicles and would minimize in-flight instability conditions, reduce lateral force induced peak stresses in the fairing, and minimize the effects on the launch vehicle GNC system. An innovative geometric design was developed in Phase I using an analysis-driven design approach. Extensive CFD analysis and shape optimization was used to achieve desired aerodynamic and launch vehicle interface loads. In Phase II this design will be further optimized and validated through wind tunnel testing of a scale model. A detailed structural design will then be developed which takes advantage of the latest large fairing manufacturing technologies. The end product of Phase II will be a fully detailed structural design of a half scale fairing prototype which can be taken to manufacturing as part of a Phase III program.

To accomplish this goal, an innovative approach to database management, self-learning and adaptation are required. It will include the development and integration of many core elements, ranging from model-based reasoning to OSA-CBM interface development, with various sources of data, information and knowledge being considered to obtain a truly intelligent and evolvable maintenance decision support system.  One of the key components of the proposed system consists of various reasoning agents and Maintenance Integrated Models (MIM) containing PHM, FMECA, sensor, and maintenance information.  In addition, the open systems architecture (OSA) and associated software interfaces to existing JSF asset management systems (i.e. ALIS) and PHM software containing pertinent maintenance and logistics management information will be addressed. Most importantly, the SEMOR system will employ a combination of case-based and Bayesian processes to evolve the underlying Maintenance Integrated Model (MIM) when given maintainer feedback.

        "abstract": "To protect USAF Tactical Shelters that are deployed throughout the world, Sunrez has developed novel anti-microbial plastics, which can be applied as a coating on composite shelters or on the current metallic shelter inventory.  Development of these novel polymers exploits the antibiotic activity found in certain organic materials that are Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) but are linked to surface deactivation of proteins in bacterial cell walls.  Testing under Phase I has verified that this produces a polymer with bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal properties.  These modified polymeric chemistries are also active against chemical agent weapons.  By changing the nature of the polymer used, we have also developed and completed preliminary testing on water-based decontamination systems that could quickly decon CBR agents without creating new hazards for the structure or surrounding personnel.  Both the coating and matrix resins and the water-soluble bioactive system obtain their unique characteristics because the reactive groups are permanently bound to polymeric chains, which limit the potential for skin absorption or adverse interactions with the typical materials of construction for military equipment.  Sunrez will further its development of these state-of-the-art materials to the point of product application through final research, development and testing projected under Phase II.",

Additionally, the material will be recyclable as a graphite-filled bulk molding compound or injection resin at end-of-life shelter disposal.  The advent of continuous, commodity-priced graphite as reinforcement in a vacuum-moldable, high-service-temperature polypropylene thermoplastic matrix will provide for panel stiffness to approach aluminum at equal skin thickness, allowing weight savings of approximately 25% relative to aluminum-skinned shelters currently in service.

For a complete study, the optimized coatings will be evaluated for the erosion resistance against runway sand and environmental protection against humidity, corrosion, and fatigue.",

        "abstract": "In Phase I of this effort RTI performed ammonia evaporative spray cooling (ESC) experiments on both 2 cm^2 and 21 cm^2 surfaces to establish feasibility and scalability of ESC to cool 500 W/cm^2 while maintaining temperature uniformity within +/-2.5C over the entire surface area.  RTI's two-phase ESC approach achieved this performance with 10x less coolant flow rate than traditional single-phase water micro-channel (MC) coolers.  These experimental results were used to complete a design trade study for a 100 kWo solid-state laser (SSL) cooling system intended for deployment on compact tactical platforms.  In Phase II of this effort RTI proposes to build a 25 kW breadboard cooling system that validates the cooling system architecture identified in Phase I, providing cooling for two 21 cm^2 large area diode array coolers, as well as cooling for a secondary heat source representative of gain material heat generation. As part of the Phase II effort, RTI will also design, build and test customized liquid pump and vapor compressor prototype units that are ammonia compatible, efficient, compact and lightweight.  The overall goal of the Phase II effort is to validate the ESC design by combining all the critical ESC components into a breadboard system showing system-level viability and providing a pathway for the further advancement of ESC technology as a thermal management approach for  HELs deployed on tactical platforms.",

        "abstract": "Sensor management in support of situation assessment (SA) presents a daunting theoretical and practical challenge. Scientific Systems Company, Inc. of Woburn MA and its subcontractor, Lockheed Martin Tactical Systems (LMTS) of Eagan MN, propose a foundational, joint control-theoretic approach to SA and SA sensor management that is based on three innovations: (1) a ``dynamic situational significance map'' that mathematically specifies the meaning of tactical significance for a given theater of interest at a given moment; (2) an intuitively meaningful and potentially computationally tractable objective function for SA, namely maximization of the expected number of (ordinary or group) targets of tactical interest; and (3) integration of these two concepts with approximate multitarget filters (specifically, first-order multitarget moment filters and multi-hypothesis correlator (MHC) engines).  Under this approach, sensors will be directed to preferentially collect observations from targets of actual or potential tactical significance, according to an adaptively modified definition of tactical significance. Phase I showed the feasibility assessment for sensor management based on these innovations with a significance map that depends on position, speed, and heading, and demonstrated: (1) tractable objective functions, (2) closed-form formulas for these objective functions and (3) excellent sensor management performance for simulated multi-target scenarios with tactical significance. The primary focus of the Phase II will be to design and develop advanced approaches for sensor management capable of encompassing a very broad range of applications and emphasize the development of a prototype integrated sensor management algorithm to be tested using realistic multisensor data.  Specific Phase II tasks are: (1) Extensions to the Multisensor Multistep Setting, (2) Extend the Significance Map to Include Target Type, Threat Level, and Changes in the Scene, (3) Extend to Group Targets and Force Structure, (4) Characterize the Effectiveness, Strengths, and Limitations of the  Algorithms, and (5) Phase III, Transfer of Technology, and Commercialization. The project team includes Dr. Ronald Mahler of Lockheed Martin.  Lockheed Martin will provide both technical and commercialization support in the application of sensor management technologies.",

The schedule for flight testing of a miniature kill vehicle necessitates that the full tactical capability for environments must take a lower priority to concept demonstration in a relatively benign laboratory or hover test environment.   A parallel (non-intrusive) development of a radiation tolerant miniature kill vehicle mission processor will allow the overall program to benefit by making the more capable system available to the program for hover test and subsequent flight testing.  This proposed, more capable, system includes a higher level of functional integration through the use of the latest generation of the system on a chip FPGA available (Xilinx Virtex-4) and possible inclusion of a widely used commercially available processor.  The resulting system, as shown in the figure would provide two key improvements.  Namely, the radiation environment would be addressed by design and assessment of parts capability.  Secondly, the signal processing, power dissipation, and volume requirements would be given significant consideration, allowing for overall system capability growth and lower cost.",

This is specifically relevant to the air campaign mission planning and analysis community where there have been several recent concept changes, advancements in information technology, sensors, and weapons, and expansion in the diversity and capabilities of potential adversaries. To fully support campaign plan development and analysis in this new environment, there is a need for systems and tools that enhance understanding of the behavior of battlespace entities, assess potential threat capabilities and vulnerabilities, perform C2 system trades, and provide methods to identify macro-level novel or emergent combat tactics and behavior derived from simpler micro-level rules. Such systems must also be interactive, collaborative, and semi-autonomous, providing the planning analyst with the means for exploration and potential exploitation of novel combatant behavior patterns. To address these issues, we propose to design and prototype a Complex Adaptive Systems-based Toolkit (CAST) for Dynamic Plan Assessment to support Air Force air campaign operations.

        "abstract": "Missile defense takes place in an unpredictable, real-time environment and thus requires an adaptive approach to optimization that dynamically allocates sensors and their supporting resources in response to changing goals and constraints. Here, we propose a system for Sensor Network Optimization using Multi-Agent Negotiation (SNOMAN) to meet the challenge of this real-time resource allocation problem. This approach applies solutions from economic theory, particularly game theory, to the resource allocation problem by creating an artificial market for sensor information and computational resources. Intelligent agents are the buyers and sellers in this market, and they represent all the elements of the sensor network, from sensors to sensor platforms to computational resources. These agents interact based on a negotiation mechanism that determines their bidding strategies. The negotiation mechanism and bidding strategies are based on game theory, and they are designed so that the aggregate result of the multi-agent negotiation process is a market in competitive equilibrium, which guarantees an optimal allocation of resources throughout the sensor network. Negotiation works continuously, providing dynamic adaptation to changes in the mission environment. Negotiation also minimizes communication resource requirements, ensuring that the system scales well to more complex sensor networks.",

The ADF also includes a xenon arc lamp as a conventional floodlight whose output is collimated by an innovative POC omnidirectional collimator and directed by a conical mirror.  The xenon lamp outputs the floodlight beam through the ring-shaped outer area of the ADF aperture, whose central area is occupied by the LED dazzler assembly.

This proposal describes a highly portable, extremely rugged approach for real time meteorological measurements that can either be hand-emplaced or air-deployed. Unlike presently fielded AWOS technology that measures the wind speed at the surface, the Deployable Micro-Weather Sensor uses a miniature phased array-based sound distance and ranging (sodar), to make wind measurements above treetop level. The sodar\u2019s remote sensing approach eliminates the surface roughness problem that greatly hampers the wind measurement accuracy of conventional tripod-mounted anemometers such as the TACMET equipment used by DoD today.  The design approach is a modular core sensor bus supporting multiple deployment strategies. In addition to the micro-sodar wind sensor, individual pressure, temperature, humidity, soil moisture and solar measurements are provided. There are no moving parts in the design, which is rugged enough to be dropped from the air. Once deployed, the sensor package provides a continuous data stream that is automatically retrieved via low earth orbiting satellite communications. Initial Phase II effort focuses on sensor development and field testing, while the option period involves air-deployment modification and testing.",

Advances in information and communications technologies have facilitated enhanced sensing and fusion of intelligence information, rapid processing, display, and visualization of information, and enhanced joint services and coalition communication, command, and control. The associated application and assimilation of these technologies provide a tremendous opportunity to enhance decision-making capabilities within Air Operation Centers (AOCs). Here, we propose a system for On-line Situation Awareness and Knowledge Acquisition (OSAKA). Our novel approach integrates an off-line component for knowledge acquisition and model learning and adaptation with an on-line mechanism for model instantiation and SA processing. Off-line model construction is supported via a cognitive task analysis based approach for identifying key domain requirements and a process for translating these requirements into a library of belief network (BN) based SA models. SA model adaptation and knowledge acquisition is supported via BN model structure and parameter learning. On-line model instantiation and SA processing and data visualization is addressed via the use of our commercially available belief network software.",

One effective way to counter an anti-missile interceptor is simply to include one or more maneuvers during ascent. Development of a capability for reacting as quickly as possible to target maneuvers will provide an interceptor with critical counter-counter measure capability and is therefore of significant importance to the MDA boost-phase intercept program.  In Phase II, CSC proposes to develop maneuver detection algorithms suitable to both exo-atmospheric and endo-atmospheric plumes, and implement the approaches in real-time hardware for hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) testing.  Algorithm development goals include (1) the enhancement of the Phase I interceptor-based maneuver detection algorithm with an emphasis on robustness and (2) development of a new surveillance platform-based algorithm for endo-atmospheric maneuver detection.   By the end of Phase II, robust, motion-based algorithms for missile maneuver detection suitable to late time-line exo-atmospheric plumes as imaged from an interceptor, as well as maneuver detection for low-altitude endo-atmospheric plumes as imaged from a surveillance platform (space-based and/or airborne sensing assets such as HALO and AIRS) will have been developed, implemented, and tested in prototype real-time hardware.",

However, detecting biological agents is difficult and time consuming because there are thousands of different pathogenic microorganisms.  Distinguishing the biological agents, from myriads of similar naturally occurring microorganisms, makes this task daunting.  In Phase I, we created a method capable of rapidly detecting microorganisms, and discriminating species at strain level more quickly than conventional methods.

        "abstract": "Flight test and on-board monitoring systems require multiple and different types of measurements, including pressure, temperature, heat flux, strain, flow position, vibration, and shock. As many as four to six wires from each sensor carry analog signals and power to and from the analog signal conditioning. For large numbers of sensors, this will mean large numbers of wires that add weight and occupy significant space. Traditional analog transducer systems result in large, long bundles of cables carrying analog signals that are difficult to manage and are susceptible to EMI/RFI noise pick up. Low-level sensor signals often require special shielding and elaborate grounding schemes.  Flight testing of future hypersonic vehicles compounds the above mentioned instrumentation challenges by requiring light weight, small volume hardware with harsh operational environmental requirements. The instrumentation must survive the high temperature and high vibration generated by the hypersonic speeds and aircraft maneuvers.  The sensor technology to perform the needed measurements on hypersonic vehicles is readily available. What are lacking are the ruggedized sensors and system components that are able to operate under the harsh environmental conditions, as well as an effective system architecture that drastically reduces volume and weight requirements.  VIP Sensors proposes to design a new ruggedized measurement system architecture that processes signals from multiple sensors and sensor types distributed throughout the hypersonic vehicle, to store the processed data at the transducer, and to transfer real time data to a central data storage unit or telemetry system. The system is based on networked digital sensors and highly integrated electronics technology. The proposed system consists of smart sensors, postage-stamp size interface modules (IBIM) that convert traditional analog sensors to smart ones, and a network interface controller (NIC) that controls the transducer digital bus and sends data to a COTS telemetry system and Ethernet-based systems.  Smart Sensors contain embedded analog signal conditioning and digital signal processing. They each interface with a digital network communication bus to form a multi-drop sensor measurement system. Small interface modules (IBIM), containing all of the electronic functions of a smart sensor, are used in those applications where temperatures of the transducer exceed the operating range of electronics circuits, or the transducer size limitations do not allow integration of the electronic functions. Smart Sensors and IBIMs have an onboard microprocessor, which allows them to function as stand-alone, distributed sensors and control nodes. They not only sense and process the signals, but also, based on the results from running local software algorithms, control actuators and switches. This practical feature increases the flexibility and attraction of the proposed  system architecture.  The Network Interface Controller is the master of the digital network. It provides DC power to the IBIM\u2019s, and it also has the option to provide to the IBIM a synchronization signal to achieve synchronous/simultaneous data sampling among all the IBIM\u2019s on the digital transducer bus. Smart Sensor systems offer highly desirable attributes, especially when dealing with large numbers of measurement channels, such as: elimination of traditional bulky analog signal conditioners and data acquisition boxes (less weight and volume); reduction of cables and interconnects (network instead of point to point wiring); increased reliability; improved EMI performance by transmitting digital signals instead of analog; improved Signal to Noise Ratio; common interface with multiple sensor types; lowered integration costs and lowered overall system cost. In Phase I, VIP Sensors accomplished the following objectives: (1) developed small ruggedized packaging concepts for sensors and other system components to be able to operate under the demanding hypersonic flight environmental conditions; (2) defined technical system characteristics such as sensor accuracy, bandwidth, data acquisition rate, sampling schedule, self-test, time synchronization among different measurements, etc.; (3) built a prototype measurement system with COTS components that proved the proposed smart sensor architecture concept; and (4) provided a detailed product development and commercialization plan.  In Phase II, a flight-worthy prototype system will be developed, built and tested at Wright-Patterson\u2019s Test Cell. It will be comprised of: 1) low frequency IBIM modules to interface with voltage or full bridge types of transducers such as flowmeters, thermocouples, strain gages and pressure transducers, 2) 3-channel Charge/IEPE IBIM modules to interface with Piezoelectric, integral electronics PE (IEPE, Isotron, ICP, etc.), and velocity coil types of sensors that are commonly used to measure vibration and dynamic pressure, 3) a Smart Accelerometer, which consists of a MEMS accelerometer sensor element in an IBIM package, 4) a Network Interface Controller (NIC) to control the transducer bus activity and provide a convenient Ethernet-based interface to a PC, and 5) a PC-based application software that provides a graphical user interface for system setup and data acquisition activities.",

There is a persistent need for reliable tunable filters with a wide bandwidth of operation. In response to this need, EMAG Technologies in collaboration with Purdue University proposes to develop a novel technique for creating tunable high-Q filters. A suspended microstrip resonator will be used for creating the filter, while the tuning mechanism will be provided by RF MEMS Varactors. The proposed architecture requires a number of novel technologies that permit excellent RF performance, limited power consumption, low size and cost, high reliability and space qualification. In addition to that, on-wafer packaging and three-dimensional integration will be utilized for the hermetic sealing of the filters. This packaging scheme will be based on EMAG\u2019s already developed low-loss, hermetic package for single RF MEMS switches. A class of evanescent mode filters will also be investigated as an alternative in the later part of the project.",

These structures will be thoroughly evaluated for their mechanical strength and durability under environments that simulate aircraft service conditions.  The prototype plasma tool, standard operating procedures, and database of mechanical properties of bonded PEEK composites will be delivered to the Air Force at the end of Phase II.

        "abstract": "The Naval Air Warfare Center is currently seeking environmentally acceptable methods of spray depositing aluminum coatings for field repair of damage to corrosion protective coatings on aircraft components.  Thermal spray processes cannot be used for applying aluminum coatings because of its high oxidation susceptibility in hot thermal spray plumes.  Field repairs of ion vapor deposition (IVD) aluminum coatings are currently restricted to brush plating processes, which are environmentally hazardous.  With the recent development of the low-temperature Kinetic Metallization (KM) spray process, it is now possible to economically deposit metallic aluminum powders directly onto high-strength steels.  AlTrans\u2122 coatings (aluminum composites) provide improved adhesion to steel relative to pure aluminum, while simultaneously protecting the steel through sacrificial anodic reaction.  The Phase I research successfully demonstrated that various AlTrans\u2122 composite-coating formulations applied to high-strength steels provide adequate corrosion protection.  The Phase II project will focus on the qualification of optimum AlTrans\u2122 composite coatings and the development of a turnkey portable KM system that can be used for making field repairs to IVD aluminum coatings.  This environmentally compliant coating will be used as a replacement coating for brush plating currently used to repair IVD coatings on military aircraft.",

        "abstract": "The MMCAS program leverages off of extensive Government investment in research to provide autonomous UAV operations in the NAS.  The focus of the program is to develop a prototype situation awareness system (MMCAS) for installation on UAVs that integrates the situation awareness information provided by TCAS with detection and tracking information on non-cooperative intruders to avoid a mid-air collision.  Non-cooperative intruders are detected and tracked by a relatively low cost, light weight, optical Detect and Avoid (DAA) system that has been developed and matured under other research programs.  The TCAS is already approved for installation on Global Hawk and demonstrations of DAA on surrogate UAV aircraft have verified that the DAA technology meets Global Hawk and Predator requirements.  This program upgrades the existing UAV collision avoidance capability, which now only supports cooperative aircraft operations, to include all aircraft in close proximity.  The innovative work to be accomplished on the program is to design the fusion software and user interface needed to implement the integration of the two systems.  The fusion software can reside in either the existing onboard TCAS interface computer or on a separate microprocessor added for this purpose, depending on the specific UAV system requirements",

        "abstract": "Impact Technologies, in cooperation with Pratt & Whitney and Qualtech Systems Inc., propose to develop and commercialize a simulation-based design application for dynamic failure mode and effects analysis (FMECA++) that specifically focuses on designing and verifying EHM technologies for legacy and new acquisition engines.  The proposed FMECA++ design software will be capable of; 1.) Automated failure mode insertion and propagation analysis, 2.) EHM algorithm design and verification, 3.) Full dynamic engine simulations, 4.) Embedded code generation for the ICF and 5.) Direct interfacing with the QSI TEAMS Product.  In order to address this multi-scale modeling functionality, the Impact team will leverage the COTS software suite by Mathworks called Simulink/Stateflow and use XML data schema for integration with the QSI software.   Utilizing the Simulink software as the core analysis engine, the design software will be capable of providing full functionality from the specific EHM algorithm level to the higher-level engine health management reasoners.  The Impact team believes this innovative approach to EHM design/analysis will truly represent the next generation in capability needed for the VAATE Intelligent Engine focus area and can be directly incorporated into the AFRL\u2019s ICF facility.  In addition, the JSF Program Office (JPO) has recently supported a program at Impact focused on vehicle-level modeling and will be leveraged during this Phase II program, thus reducing our Phase II proposed cost by over $150K. The end goal is to create a comprehensive simulation-based design tool to support dynamic fault propagation analysis; EHM cost/benefit analysis, as well as EHM testing and validation that enables EHM design and trade studies much earlier in the overall design process where significant cost savings can be realized. A realistic application of the software will be based on comprehensive EHM analysis for the Pratt & Whitney F119 and F135 engines.",

This effort is aimed at developing hardware and software for a distributed network of low cost, all weather ground based ionospheric imagers to monitor real time space weather conditions. This nighttime observational network will be able to capture space weather events that disrupt electromagnetic communications systems, including the effectiveness of GPS-guided ordinance. DoD has C4I assets spread across the globe. Reliable and predictable communications is a very high priority. Our approach involves low light multi-spectral imaging of the ionosphere from multiple locations on the ground. In addition to working in realistic field conditions, the imagers will have the ability to discern cloud movement that can occlude vision to the upper reaches of the ionosphere. This technology will therefore provide valuable real time weather, seeing and atmospheric slant path visibility data that is highly useful to both ground and air operations as well as space based reconnaissance activities.",

This technique makes the thermal properties and temperature history of the substrate on which the test surface is installed irrelevant to the emissivity/absorptivity measurement, eliminating the need for thermal insulation of the test surface from the rest of structure.  This advantage enables our technique to test multiple samples on the same device or the monitoring for spatial variations across a single thermal device.  The small size of the sensors will allow the necessary spatial resolution to resolve the performance variation across the active coatings or thermal structures.

LBO can occur either during rapid engine deceleration or during operation at idle conditions with water/steam ingestion.  Current practice is to design adequate safety margins to avoid the onset of blowout. However, significant engine performance improvements can be realized though the development of a system that identifies and prevents blowout. Such a closed-loop, active control system is proposed for development in this SBIR. In Phase I, experiments were conducted and both chemiluminescence and pressure signal characteristics were identified that precede blowout.  A prototype gas turbine injector being developed for JSF application under Navy sponsorship was used to provide a realistic and representative test environment.  In Phase II, the complete system will be developed and demonstrated. A novel Artificial Neural Network (ANN) on-line direct controller will be developed to identify LBO precursors in real time and control the fuel injector response. An ANN-based direct controller does not require a system model and the controller automatically adjusts to changing dynamic system conditions.  For LBO control, an innovative plasma-based flame stabilization system will be incorporated into the fuel injector and used to stabilize the flame beyond the lean blowout limits by introducing a pulsed corona discharge at the injector exit.

Emerging technologies such as a common application programming interface (API) for store control software (as demonstrated under the previous WINTEC OASIS effort) and common interface function/messaging services (as being defined under the Air Force Universal Armament Initiative) offer the possibility to significantly reduce or eliminate platform software modifications typically required for each new store integration.  For these technologies to provide maximum payoff, they need to be effectively integrated into legacy platforms.  The Phase I Legacy Platform Weapon Integration (LPWI) effort developed and established initial feasibility of a software architecture for incorporation of such technologies into existing platform store control systems.  The effort proposed here would provide for detailed design and demonstration of the Phase I concept, either in a platform system integration laboratory (SIL) or through modeling of a legacy system environment, ultimately paving the way for more of a \u201cplug-and-play\u201d approach to aircraft/store integration.",

One critical design goal for T/R modules, therefore, is maximization of the power-added efficiency (PAE) of the transmitter power amplifier.  As more sophisticated modulation waveforms are introduced, however, power amplifiers in (or near) saturation introduce non-linear distortion of the signal in the form of amplitude and phase distortion and accompanying spectrum spreading and growth of unwanted side bands.  This proposal is addressed to those requirements, and novel circuit techniques such as pre-distortion circuits and the Doherty type amplifier circuits aimed at reduction of signal distortion and efficiency enhancement of power amplifiers are implemented in and extended Doherty power amplifier.

        "abstract": "A well structured approach based on sound theory is realized through a strategy to achieve affordable V&V of critical software.  With this approach, we propose the development of tools needed to provide the context for assessing safety and dependability. Our approach uses formalized attributes with comprehensive treatment of all possible error types.  The techniques employed to provide on-line V&V are based on properties that are required by the software component and monitoring of declared \u201csafe operating conditions and behavior\u201d by the components.  Our theory shows the degree of deterministic and bounded fault detection that can be achieved in a complex distributed system given either existing or transformed attributes.  When these techniques are combined with a sound understanding of safety hazards and the corresponding functional requirements, transformations of the system performance can be realized through the integration and monitoring of detectors in target systems.  With the appropriate mechanisms, on-line monitoring of these conditions can be carried out.  The WWTG middleware framework is transformed into an on-line verifier/validator of the software, helping to extend coverage and visibility into systems under test while simultaneously reducing costs and reducing the risk of flaws that impede correct and safe system operation.",

        "abstract": "The Air Force is developing a wide variety of technologies for aircraft propulsion system health management (PHM). Unfortunately many promising new sensor technologies and new algorithms cannot easily be deployed for on-wing demonstration.  On Phase I IAC, with Hamilton Sundstrand and Luppold & Associates support, developed a requirements specification, h/w and s/w design for a PC-104 based generic system. A preliminary Simulink demonstration to perform engine virtual sensing was also developed. That Simulink script is the first target application for transition to the full generic system. On the initial Phase II, working with Hamilton Sundstrand IAC will build the actual hardware and software system. The system will be used to implement an inlet distortion sensing system for the Active Integrated Inlet Duct Engine Demonstrator (AIIDED) UAV. The system is ideal for a variety of other UAV health monitoring and control applications. A single card system will be developed. The system is based on the Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA. This will allow for a smaller, lighter, faster, and larger operating temperature h/w suite that is well suited to UAV applications. The MathWorks Simulink\u2122 and Xilinx System Generator\u2122 are used for algorithm development and validation of the integrated system operation.",

        "abstract": "The Real-Time Structure From Motion (RTSFM) system combines state-of-the-art techniques and novel methods to compute 3D models of battlefields in real time from calibrated image sequences.  Unlike most computational stereo approaches, the work is tailored for long sequences of calibrated imagery under near-planar small-baseline motion \u2013 sequences typically generated from loitering unmanned aerial vehicles.  The stereo correspondence approach is based on simulated annealing, a stochastic iterative optimization technique, and depth estimates are also influenced recursively by previous estimates.  An abstract 3D surface model based on a hybrid Voronoi-BSPT (binary space partition tree) representation is incrementally generated and refined, enabling low-bandwidth incremental transmission off the aerial platform.  RTSFM is a combined hardware/software system with some critical system components implemented in field-programmable gate arrays.  This approach facilitates novel methods for optimizing image frame processing order, for seeding stereo correspondence calculations, and for recursive camera parameter estimate refinement.  Together these reduce the computational requirements of the system such that accurate real-time 3D modeling is feasible.  RTSFM directly increases the warfighter\u2019s ability to execute combat operations by improved situational awareness.  It also enables improved approaches for automatic target recognition, operations against aboveground and underground structures, battlefield damage assessment, and many other tasks.",

This method offers an alternative to more conventional methods, such as extrusion or isostatic pressing.  The method is less capital intensive than conventional methods, has potential for being automated and tubes made by the process require much less care in drying and organic burnout.  The colloidal processing method involves preparation of a suspension of particles containing a small amount of organics, low pressure injection into a die, solidification in the die by a temperature change, removal of tube(s) from the die, drying and firing to obtain the desired properties of permeability, mechanical strength and electrical conductivity.  Both short (8 inch) and long cathode tubes (32 inch) were made during Phase I and a better understanding obtained as to key processing variables.

        "abstract": "It is proposed to develop and implement a computational technique based on Energy Finite Element Analysis (EFEA) for interior noise prediction of advanced aerospace vehicles that will expand NASA's noise prediction capability at the early stage of design process. In many situations, aerospace structures are subjected to high frequency mechanical and/or acoustic excitations. Presently, noise performances of these products are determined experimentally, which is not feasible at the early design stage or by using computational simulation technique based on Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA). SEA requires high level of analyst expertise and in some instances, testing of the product's components. An alternative computational simulation technique for high frequency vibration and noise prediction based on EFEA conceptually offers several unique features. EFEA can predict the spatial variation of the energy in structures and the acoustic cavities. Local power input and damping treatments can also be modeled in EFEA. More importantly, EFEA is based on extensively used and comprehensively developed finite element method. The use of finite element method for both low and high frequency noise and vibration problems will provide the users a unified framework for the resolution of problems where the frequency spans a wide range.",

The strips are scattered by air or sea and then establish a network by sending simple acoustic chirps to designated secondary nodes, which concentrate and preprocess the information, using neural net methodology.  When a detector senses a contact or notices a chirp occlusion from its neighbors, it generates a detection chirp, which is processed by the secondary nodes.  When the secondary nodes a pattern of recognized detections, the generate distinctive chirps that are detected and located by a small array of sonobuoys.

        "abstract": "By continuing teaming up with one of the most reputable university teams in THz science and technology, ArkLight proposes to carry out the tasks set for a Phase-II program following our success in Phase I. We are aimed at the further development of novel spectrometers to analyze chemicals in the vapor phase based on accurate measurements of the emission and absorption spectra due to the molecular inter-rotational transitions in the THz domain (100-1000 \u00b5m). The proposed analyzers are characterized by simplicity, reasonably high sensitivity, and high reliability. They are designed to analyze the gas samples taken from the hazardous battlefields or sites to stations or labs. The high reliability (i.e. low error probability) is assured by the fact that we plan to combine the unique sharp peaks determined from the THz emission with absorption spectra of the molecules. In addition, in order to achieve high sensitivities the proposed analyzers utilize 2-D photonic bandgap crystals (PBC\u2019s) as narrowband filters to remove the unwanted background while minimizing the false alarm rate, cavities, and tightly-confined waveguide modes. Compared with other spectrum analyzers, our systems should have lower false alarm rates since we propose to match both the strengths and wavelengths for a large number of the transition peaks measured in an extremely wide wavelength range to those on the known hazardous chemicals stored in our data bank, using a software to be developed during Phase II. To achieve our goal we have taken advantages of our expertise in the tunable THz sources and the state-of-the-art fabrication and characterization. Moreover, our goal is built upon our most recent and preliminary results on chemical analysis including our achievements in the Phase I. We will fabricate and characterize the Bragg gratings and 2-D PBC's for the THz waves. The spatial confinement will be achieved by introducing defects into the PBC's. The next step will be the implementation of a tunable and coherent mid-IR source in the range of 9-11 \u00b5m \u2013 this range is sufficient to pump the most of the molecules of interest to the first vibrational transitions such that they can subsequently emit THz radiations between the rotational transitions. We plan to develop tunable mid-IR sources using intracavity difference-frequency generation in an optical parametric oscillator. We will implement a THz emission spectrometer after combining a mid-IR source, PBC\u2019s, and a bolometer. We will also investigate a few novel configurations for increasing the conversion efficiencies for the THz generation by using intracavity frequency mixing in a waveguide for the THz wave and external frequency conversion in a THz waveguide combined with a pair of the THz Bragg gratings incorporated into the nonlinear materials through the fabrication. We will then implement an absorption spectrometer by combining an efficient and tunable THz source based on difference-frequency generation in GaP with a pyroelectric detector. In order to explore the ultimate detection limit of the proposed spectrometer, we are going to investigate an up-conversion process in GaP. For the emission spectrometer, we will be able to achieve a sensitivity of better than 1 ppm. On the other hand, for the absorption spectrometer our goal is to be able to measure the absorbance as low as 3 ppm.",

        "abstract": "This phase II SBIR proposal is aimed at development of low-power field emission display devices. Flat panel display market is one of the fastest growing technology sectors. Despite its fundamental strengths, the role of field emission (FE) technology in the market place is marginal at best. This is in part due to the inability to operate efficiently at low power. Low-power operation requires a highly efficient cold cathode and phosphor films capable of producing suitable fluorescence at low electron energies. We address efficient cathode formation though geometric field enhancement using our nanoscale patterning expertise. The low-power phosphor films will be addressed through partnership with the display research group at the University of Texas at El Paso. Finally, we  propose a novel multilayer emitter concept aimed at lateral field emission displays. The technology developed will also find military and air force applications through low-power, low-weight, temperature-insensitive, and rad-hard device characteristics.",

The proposed system incorporates laser tracking technology with advanced optical imaging and infrared search and track technologies to produce an integrated multi-sensor system for space object detection, tracking, characterization, discrimination, and event and threat detection. The proposed integrated system will use imaging technology with active target illumination allowing its operation in both day and night and for \u201cdark pass\u201d tracking of space objects through the Earth\u2019s shadow. Additionally, active illumination provides a means for optical signal gating, which can greatly enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in an acquired image. System operation with multiple wavelengths to acquire high-quality multi-spectral images of space objects will improve the discrimination capabilities, aiding in target identification. The resulting ability to improve the diagnostic quality of such images by exploiting the entire data set will greatly enhance the capabilities of present imaging systems. In addition, the operational principles of the proposed system can significantly improve capabilities in free space communication, as well as in ranging, designation and retrieval of spectral, photogrammetric and polarimetric data from a target.",

RT level converters play a key role in the integration of multiple replaceable parts within the same infrastructure. In order to increase the expandability, interoperability, and upgrade abilities of the future electronic systems, we propose a novel, bi-directional, universal, RT voltage level converter. This user programmable device will increase the systems flexibility, minimize the cost and efforts required for their development, and help to fulfill the requirements of Plug-and-Play concept. The high speed (up to 10Gb/s) and radiation tolerance will be achieved through utilization of our proprietary differential RT cells developed in the SiGe technology from Jazz Semiconductor.

These modules will achieve greater than 10 Watts of output power, with higher than 40% efficiency, across the X band. Then we will integrate 16 of the modules into our proprietary coaxial waveguide spatial combiner. The expected overall output power is 150 Watt across the X band with over 35% efficiency. This amplifier system can become a replacement for widely used TWTs which are notorious for limited operational life, and higher life cycle costs.

        "abstract": "Arsenic contamination in water supplies poses a severe health risk to world-wide populations.  The US EPA has recently lowered As water standards from 50 ppb to 10 ppb to address this risk.  Many states, including California, either have passed or are soon to pass even stricter regulations.  Currently available As detection methods suffer from numerous drawbacks including non-real-time, costly, bulky, complicated, and inaccurate.  The sensor demonstrated in Phase I overcomes all these obstacles. Carbon nanotubes have found exciting new applications in technologies ranging from batteries to heat transfer, and sensor technologies are now proving to hold equal potential.  In Phase I, the feasibility of using ionization-based carbon nanotube sensors for As detection was successfully demonstrated by fabricating carbon sensors and measuring breakdown voltages and the variation of discharge current as a function of concentration.   The objective of the Phase II effort is to optimize the carbon nanotube manufacturing process to achieve maximum performance and lower operating voltages, design the extraneous sub-systems, and test the complete sensor.  Optional tasks handle prototype system installation and field testing and an investigation of manufacturing quality control.  By the end of Phase II, a full prototype sensor will have been developed, fabricated, and tested.",

        "abstract": "Space control missions require a high angular brightness and minimal jitter laser beam on the target. These characteristics are difficult to achieve on a real beam path through turbulent atmospheric conditions. MetroLaser\u2019s proposal outlines an innovative approach in designing an Adaptive Laser System (ADLAS) based on a combination of linear and non-linear optical phase conjugation mirrors. This concept enables real time correction of the wavefront of a high-energy laser beam, resulting in a high Strehl ratio of the beam and significant increase of the energy density on the target. During Phase I, we performed a systematic analysis of the phase-conjugate, mirror-based laser, and proof-of-concept experiments to characterize key system parameters. In addition, the operational limits and constraints imposed by spatial aberrations on the beam path and the delivered energy requirements were identified and the projected performance envelope was estimated. A design trade-off analysis of the prototype architecture was also conducted. Results of Phase I confirmed feasibility of the proposed ADLAS concept. During Phase II, we plan to scale up the technology, build the brassboard, and perform its field demonstration.",

Different types of vehicles, and sometimes even different individual vehicles of the same type, have widely varying sensor loadouts.  With current Instrumentation Support Systems (ISSs), each sensor configuration must be manually described to the ISS.  This process is tedious, time consuming, and error prone.  Nomadics proposes to design and build a Labeling, Interrogation, and Loading System (LILS) that is composed of two logical components: a Labeler (software that runs on a PocketPC&#8722;based PDA and can be used to retrieve, modify, and store TEDS in native IEEE 1451 transducers or in SITEDS) and Selector (software that runs on 32-bit Windows\u2122 operating systems and is used to collect sensor information from the labeler into a large database of sensors, allow selection of subsets of sensors, and store those subsets into ISS systems), which combines the Interrogator and Loader components from Phase 1.  Phase II will involve creation of production-ready versions of both components of LILS.  This will allow us to create a functional end-to-end system that works with currently available IEEE 1451 sensors.",

Laser tracking and pointing of remote targets for space/air surveillance and control applications require a suitable image amplifier covering a wide field of view to improve signal to noise in image detection, leading to longer target range capability and/or stronger immunity to atmospheric disturbance. Our approach centers on a new phosphate glass and fiber technology that enables much higher ytterbium doping than previously possible - resulting in high gain per unit length and short fiber lengths (~10 cm). NP Photonics pre-form and fiber drawing technology makes possible the fabrication of two-dimensional arrays of doped cores embedded in a pump cladding layer -where each core represents a pixel in the image amplifier. We expect to produce an active array with many dozens of pixels arranged in a two-dimensional pattern with each pixel capable of high gain (>17 dB), low noise, and large acceptance angle (>8 degrees). The amplifier will have high electrical efficiency (>40%) when pumped with commercially available 915 nm or 975 nm multimode diodes.",

The performance of transmitters built through both approaches will be evaluated by environmental testing of the devices during the program.  Two iterations of prototype builds are planned for in the program.

We have two unique strategies to achieve these objectives.

The varying levels of hierarchy allow the technology to be applied to a range of systems from micro-satellites to very large antennae, always providing high structural and packaging efficiency.

        "abstract": "Tactical aircraft pilots are provided with ever increasing amounts of information about the battlefield and the threats they face, providing the opportunity for achieving overwhelming information superiority over our adversaries.  This potential faces two difficult challenges: 1) each aircraft must be individually capable of synthesizing/fusing all available information into a coherent tactical situational awareness and threat assessment capability and 2) the consistency of the tactical picture for all aircraft involved in a mission must be assured.  Overcoming these challenges will allow commanders to incorporate doctrinal changes that allow multiple aircraft to execute highly coordinated missions, greatly improving overall mission effectiveness.   A fundamental aspect of any fusion process is the representation of the uncertainty of the data.  In Phase I, we demonstrated a hybrid Fuzzy Logic/Bayesian fusion architecture that demonstrated the strengths of these two inference techniques for a single aircraft capability.  In Phase II, we extend the Phase I architecture to allow multiple, distributed hybrid Fuzzy/Bayesian networks to be combined into effectively one virtual network through Multiply-Sectioned Bayesian Network (MSBN) techniques. This fusion 2+ architecture is dependent on the output of a level 1 fusion model and will be provided by the Canadian test bed called CASE_ATTI .",

        "abstract": "In Phase I, EM Photonics demonstrated the viability of using a reconfigurable hardware approach to accelerating the simulation of electronic circuits based on their electromagnetic properties.  In Phase II, this technology will be used to create a solver capable of analyzing mixed signal circuits 64 times faster than is currently available from equivalent software.  The resulting device will shrink design cycles and allow for more rigorous analysis of the user\u2019s problem.  Consequently, devices that previously required two months to simulate, can now be run in less than a day.  This advance will directly translate to products reaching the market faster and will allow for the modeling of more complex devices.  The key to this technology is the use of a reconfigurable computing platform build around a field-programmable gate array (FPGA).  This allows for the creation of a device capable of rivaling the speeds of large Beowulf clusters while maintaining the size of a standard desktop PC.  This proposal contains details on the enabling technologies, our success to date, and our plans for realizing the final system.",

        "abstract": "High performance military gas turbine engines are often equipped with augmenters also known as afterburners, to provide increased levels of thrust for relatively short periods of time.  The level of thrust desired is determined by the requirement for specific excess power for maneuver.  However, the augmentation level, which can be supplied by engines, is limited by the oxygen in the air after the turbine, by cooling requirements for augmenter walls and downstream nozzle, and by the onset of the debilitating combustion instabilities of screech and rumble.  The instrumentation development proposed herein is addressed to avoid these instabilities.  The objective of this proposal is to combine the latest research and the successful results of Phase I into a single small, rugged, highly accurate high temperature pressure transducer suitable for the severe environment in the augmenter.  The use of piezoresistive technology and the MEM fabrication procedures make possible the obtaining of highly accurate static and dynamic pressure data.  It is anticipated that this transducer will have a natural frequency in excess of 100KHz and excellent static characteristics.  Moreover, the transducer will be designed to resist shock and vibration in excess of 100g, and will provide output in a digital format.",

High density materials with high flow strength, strain to failure ductility, texture, and lethal energy release are desirable.  The refractory materials meet many of these requirements, but not all of these attributes in a single elemental composition.  It would be highly desirable to produce a layered composite of Zr and Ta, but conventional routes to produce the desired layers result in an abrupt interface between Ta and Zr, which would be prone to delamination during firing.  In a Phase I program, MER demonstrated the capability to produce layered composites of Zr/Ta/Zr with a functionally graded interface and excellent bonding between the two metals.  The process used was plasma transferred arc solid free form fabrication.  In the Phase II program, the process conditions for producing this composite will be optimized versus ballistic performance and manufacturability.",

        "abstract": "The \"troop-target\" problem of automatic detection, tracking, and prediction of the formations of dismounted ground troops concealed in foliage, using FOPEN-GMTI radars introduces challenges well beyond those encountered in more conventional group-target problems.  AD HOC troop formations are considerably more amorphous and unpredictable and they must be deduced from the constituent individuals.  Yet these individuals may be small in number, may rapidly change direction and speed, can be widely dispersed, and will usually form no predictable pattern.  We address this problem with a theoretically rigorous generalization of the constant-gain Kalman filter to the multitarget domain. The resulting PHD filter propagates a first-order multitarget moment of the multitarget posterior distribution, and first detects and tracks the over-all bulk behavior of a formation.  What is being tracked at any time is an estimate of the geographical shape and density of the troop formation. Phase I showed the feasibility assessment for this PHD \"bulk\" tracking, and demonstrated: (1) successful bulk troop tracking, (2) considerable improvements in CROSS-RANGE accuracy when using two sensors with suitable triangulation geometry, (3) successful inference of troop parameters, and (4) successful formation typing (patrol, skirmish, bivouac, ambush, etc.) inferred from the estimated troop parameters.  Phase II emphasis will be on more realistic implementations of the algorithms that include realistic sensor models, higher clutter densities, and hybrid tracking of an individual target and troop-target.  The Phase II results will be examined by LM-Orincon with the goal of a Phase III delivery to FORESTER, providing a realistic and concrete Phase III technology transition path into FORESTER and potentially in the Army Future Combat Systems (FCS) program. The project team includes Dr. Ronald Mahler of Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin will provide both technical and commercialization support in the application of detection/tracking technologies.",

        "abstract": "The growing complexity of aerospace systems has given rise to increased susceptibility to failure as a result of improper integration of the design and optimization of components. Therefore, a critical need exists for improved analysis and optimization methods for modeling, evaluating, and optimizing synthesis/design and performance. Thaerocomp Technical Corporation (TTC) is proposing to develop and commercialize an advanced, high-fidelity, innovative software tool for system-level integration of synthesis/design analysis and large-scale optimization of aerospace systems. Exergy and traditional energy methods will be integrated with an engineering database and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modules to obtain accurate design data for some of the components of the aircraft system. This approach will significantly streamline the analysis and optimization process, helping to minimize ground-based testing; and substantially reduce certification time and costs. The TTC product will be the first commercially available software tool to support physical decomposition-based iterative local-global optimization. Furthermore, the exergy component of the proposed tool will guarantee that the loss mechanisms in every subsystem component can be related to overall system requirements in a framework of common metrics. All required levels of design activity will be supported in a unified fashion, from conceptual comparisons through to the final configuration, leading to system-level optimized syntheses/designs.",

Stringent dimensional tolerance and surface finish requirements necessitate precision manufacturing and consequently, resulting in increased cost. Our Phase II proposal will demonstrate innovative high speed machining (HSM) technologies the Air Force needs for affordable fabrication of titanium and nickel IBRs. Our approach meets the program target by providing an immediate 45% cost reduction for F-119 and F-135 engines and requires no capital equipment investment. Our program will ultimately: (a) Achieve dramatic cost and cycle time reductions for titanium and nickel alloy IBRs with no capital equipment investment; (b) Eliminate expensive, environmentally unfriendly electrochemical machining and improve surface finish; (c) Meet program affordability target of 35-50% for IBRs which meet qualification criteria; and (d) Achieve life cycle cost savings for F-135 and F-119 engines of $3 billion. Our disciplined three-phase development program will: (a) Apply innovative HSM technologies to nickel-based alloys to extend the cost savings to these materials; (b) Demonstrate innovative HSM technologies for titanium-based alloys via fabrication of IBR features; and (c) Fabricate full-scale IBR to demonstrate innovative HSM technologies for titanium and nickel based alloys that meet the affordability target.",

        "abstract": "Precision-guided weapons have proven invaluable during the past decade of anti-terrorist military actions other than conventional wars. Two of the most successful of these are the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) and the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM). Several efforts have been initiated to improve the effectiveness of these weapons by adding an imaging device to transmit target images or even video to a man-in-the-loop (MITL) operator who can change target priorities and conduct target identification and bomb damage assessment (BDA) in real time. The greatest impediment to the realization of this enhanced capability is the limited bandwidth of radio frequency (RF) data link. It is precisely this limitation to delivering image and/or video data of sufficiently high quality that is addressed in this program. UtopiaCompression Corporation (UC) has devised an effective algorithm for compressing the image/video such that it can be transmitted over a low-cost data link while still preserving detail for the MITL to do target evaluation and BDA.  UC proved the viability of this concept using recorded digital video data during Phase I and is teaming with Defense Research Associates (DRA) Inc. to transform the idea to practice in a brassboard system during Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Injection of a liquid stream into a high-speed crossflow is applicable to many combustion applications was well as other general applications.  As a result, liquid stream injection has been studied extensively in recent years.  Theses studies have resulted in some design tools directed at jet breakup length, jet penetration, and spray features.  Despite this progress, however, wide variations in expressions describing even basic features, such as jet penetration, are apparent, reaffirming the lack of sufficient design tools.  Relative to CFD applications, correlations developed largely in an empirical manner from data at non-augmentor like conditions are assembled and used to generate source terms within the CFD domain that are associated with the droplets.  The current project will develop and validate models describing key phenomena such as jet breakup, droplet sizes, vaporization, mixing and the subsequent spatial and temporal distribution of the fuel.  Extensive data will be collected using experiments designed to provide the necessary information to validate the models.  The validated models will be assembled into a standalone analytical tools as well as a CFD subroutine that will be incorporated into a CFD code.",

Most obvious is the resulting high temperatures encountered as the aircraft approaches Mach 3 and above. The encountered high temperatures and shaft speeds of engines require rethinking in the areas of material selections, component design and component operating life. For the engine design engineer, the challenge lies in components that make up the bearings and seals region of the aircraft engine that encounter severe operational requirements. High operating temperatures and pressures and longer cycle durations are among these. The seals, which are used to seal the bearing compartments, or sumps, from high airflow ingestion, maintain a favorable air pressure gradient, and minimize engine lubricant loss, is such a component. In the area of sump compartment sealing, one of the most difficult sealing applications is the sealing of an engine\u2019s rear sump. Normally this sump will need some method of sealing between two rotating shafts.

        "abstract": "The F-22 Data Compression program addresses the problem of the insufficient imagery storage capacity of the F-22.  This impacts the ability of the aircraft to deploy munitions or transfer imagery for tactical planning.  The imagery capacity of the targeting system is significantly smaller than the area of operations thus restricting the ability to attack targets.  For reconnaissance operations, due to the large size of the images, the amount of data that can be recorded is limited and must be manually processed and distributed.  The data compression algorithms used by the DRA/UtopiaCompression team will allow the F-22 SAR imagery to be compressed using a pattern driven approach whereby images and, specifically, regions in images with defined visual characteristics are considered as relational entities, classifiable according to the presence or absence of patterns, their relationships, and the frequency of their occurrence.  The algorithm seeks to minimize the set of extracted features with the application of statistical machine learning to extract features and model patterns.  The codec is trained on such patterns to \u201clearn\u201d their nature so that variable-sized segments of the image can be accurately reconstructed.  The algorithm results in a five to ten fold improvement over JPEG compression technology.",

Our Conformal receive antenna will be installed on a realistic piece of a structural element of a generic UAV platform,  and tested for its performance in the frequency range of 200 MHz-2 GHz.  We have considered the Global Hawk as a potential airborne platform. Northrop Grumman Corporation is serving as one of the subcontractors in providing us the design data of a structural element of a notional UAV platform. Knowing the electrical properties of this element, our conformal antenna will be tailored to perform in this environment. Conformal array will be designed, fabricated and tested in this effort. The design goal is to cover a frequency range of 200 MHz to 2 GHz and the antenna elements are basically planar bow-tie antennas. The elements are electrically interconnected, with the entire array serving to receive the lower frequencies, while individual element receives the higher frequencies resulting in the desired 10 to 1 band ratio. The array elements will be optimized and performance in terms of TDR, S11, VSWR and antenna receiving patterns (same as transmitting patterns) will be measured and optimized.",

        "abstract": "The current approach to providing thermal protection to aero-vehicles is to use a parasitic thermal protection system (TPS) that protects the primary structure while transferring the aerodynamic loads to the same primary structure.  This approach increases the complexity of the vehicle system that, in turn, complicates fabrication and inspection of the structure.  In addition, this approach also increases production and maintenance costs.  Thus, there is a clear need for a low-cost approach to manufacturing thermal protection systems capable of supporting load and are integral to the vehicle structure.  This alternate TPS proposed by FMW, with design support from Boeing, would utilize discontinuous reinforcement of titanium (TiB) skins with a possible combination of traditional titanium matrix composite (TMC)/TiB support structure.  The TiB skins would become an integral part of the vehicle structure and capable of sharing loads while maintain strength at temperature.  These combined titanium composite technologies would offer a very robust solution to the TPS problem.  During the Phase I SBIR, FMW successfully demonstrated that the material properties of a rolled TiB skin would be suitable for the TPS skin.  In the program described herein, FMW, in conjunction with Boeing, proposes the fabrication several subscale TPS elements along with a representative full scale article.",

The multispectral image will be processed to ensure that the optical properties match those expected, and thereby confirm that the fingerprint was collected from a real, live, unaltered finger. The collection of both images will occur with a single user action, which has the advantages of greater user convenience, high user throughput, and increased security by having the biometric acquisition and spoof detection occurring on the same skin site at the same point in time.

The system will implement a magnetic detection scheme in which a widely distributed sensor array will form a barrier with bounded probability of detection and false alarm rates. NanoSonic will also continue to characterize and adapt a unique magnetic sensor for specific application to this program. The sensitivity of this sensor exceeds that of other low-cost magnetic sensors. NanoSonic would continue to work with Virginia Tech researchers who have specific experience with small autonomous underwater platforms and their cooperative navigation, search and track functions. This system will indicate and localize submarine contacts while complementing existing acoustic systems. NanoSonic specifically anticipates the transition of developed technology in cooperation with the DoD contractor.

The performance of the architecture has been confirmed with Matlab and a schematic design for a 12-bit PLP ADC has been completed using TSMC 0.18 um technology and successfully simulated using Cadence tools.

This technique uses an unbiased balanced timing messaging system to determine the clock offsets and relative range between a reference platform and an associated vehicle.  In addition, by tracking the offsets and the magnitudes of the offset corrections, the frequency difference between the sensor local oscillators can be determined.  This method is mostly implemented in the sensor and communications system processing and has minimal impact on the hardware.  Similarly, for the synchronizing sensors on a single platform, we take the same approach but use the internal platform bus for maintaining the coherence.  The advantage for synchronizing distributed sensors was shown using a validated computer simulation.  The simulation showed a dramatic performance improvement over current capabilities.

We have developed innovative millimeter wave power amplifiers designs in Phase I for Q-band and in Phase II, we will fabricate, test, and productize these designs in a low cost commercial SiGe HBT (heterojunction bipoloar) IC process.  Development of millimeter-wave IC components has traditionally proven to be a costly exercise of exotic semiconductor process development and optimization, without much emphasis on innovative circuit design techniques.  This has resulted in development of costly compound semiconductor power processes with low manufacturability and yield, and in turned, eliminated the commercial viability of millimeter-wave ICs, most specifically power amplifier ICs. Currently, the cost of millimeter-wave components is one of the major hurdles in the deployment of millimeter-wave commercial communications systems, military radar, and electronic warfare systems. Therefore, the advent of 300 GHz Ft SiGe IC processes has enabled the development of high performance and low cost millimeter wave ICs. VT Silicon will fabricate their novel power amplifier designs in a commercial SiGe IC process and use Boeing's Q-band transmit module as the insertion vehicle.",

With the addition of a surface flow controller the aircraft could have both a fixed flight performance, due to its physical shape and a dynamic flight performance capability that is adaptive to the flight environment.  Electrically generated and controlled plasma has the potential to be used as a flow controller embodying these characteristics that will lead to a practical means of electrohydrodynamic (EHD) shaping of the net aerodynamic flight performance of the aircraft.

        "abstract": "Tunable single frequency high power lasers have been considered to be an enabling technology for Air Force\u2019s active laser tracking systems for space surveillance and control. PolarOnyx proposes, for the first time, an ultra fast electronically tuned high power (100 mW) single frequency (< 1 KHz) fiber laser source to meet with the requirement of active laser tracking systems for fast and accurate frequency tuning. It is a specialty fiber based ring cavity, while the fast and wide tuning is achieved by using an electro-optical tunable filter. The tuning frequency can be addressed accurately and repeatedly without any hysteresis associated. In Phase I time frame, we have demonstrated in experiment major functions of the proposed fiber laser, such as high power, single frequency, stability, and high speed frequency tuning. Packaging feasibility is also successfully investigated. These provide a solid foundation for further fine tuning of the approach in Phase II. A compact prototype will be delivered at the end of Phase II.",

During Phase I of this program, Hittite investigated integrating MMIC down-converters with advanced ADCs currently in the marketplace. An extensive study of available ADCs lead to selection of a candidate device and its evaluation. In addition, two single-chip MMIC down-converters at X-band and K-band were developed for EHF applications. The Phase II research will establish a design baseline for high sampling rate ADCs with fully integrated down-converters, including fabrication and demonstration of prototypes. The down-converter/ADC incorporates a built-in MMIC Phase-Locked Oscillator (PLO) used for the Local Oscillator (LO) source and ADC clock generation, which translates the applied EHF signals to lower Intermediate Frequency (IF) ranges for ADC processing.

Phase II research will focus on generalization the proposed methodologies with emphasis on development of the mature computational tools that will address the complete chain of the DNA computer design issues: synthesis of the DNA code; device-level multiphysics/biochemistry high-fidelity modeling; and system-level simulations of DNA computer based on an electric-equivalent-circuit reduced-order model. We will demonstrate the tools on the information technology problems of interest to the AF and validate them with laboratory experiments.",

        "abstract": "CCT proposes a model driven composable architecture for C3I gateway systems that will provide a generic platform independent software toolkit for creation of communication gateways. This new approach will simplify interoperability of new and legacy systems by leveraging transport and semantic exchange standardization. Use of product line architecture methods will be employed to ensure large-scale system reuse, enabling component-based gateways to be generated from high-level specifications. Central to the scope of the gateway architectural approach is accommodation for variation and evolutionary extension of communications and exchange services.  This dual focus on architectural strategy and standards is critical to dealing with the historical problems of stove piped architectures and N(N-1) interfaces between systems. The benefits of this approach include simplification of creation of domain specific gateways, and improved interoperability between systems. Phase 1 of the research evaluated alternative architectural strategies and methods for generation of gateways from the toolkit, culminating in a proof of concept prototype. Phase 2 will create a fully functional toolkit of reusable gateway components that can be automatically composed into operational configuration, demonstrating both systems interoperability of heterogeneous systems and method of instance specific generation.",

Both the microwave application and the diode based laser applications require significant amount of power.  Application of power is a transient phenomenon that takes time and its effects ripple through the whole system. In this case, the large applied power, which is required for a short duration, can have a more significant effect on the system. There are four entities that interact affecting the performance of the control system: Controls, Power Generation, Propulsion and Load  IPS is proposing to explore the interaction between these systems and provide an optimal solution for controlling this class of Megawatt generators. IPS is proposing to use PC Krause as their consultants who will help with system modeling so that realistic results will be attained.   IPS is currently under contract on an SBIR Phase II (AF01-178) to develop a 1 MW intermittent power generator. To test this generator once it is built, a regulator, will be required.

ADA Technologies, Inc., successfully demonstrated the\n\n  performance of a novel reactive scrubbing technology for the removal of vapor-phase\n\n  mercury from incinerator exhaust gas streams. The technology has two major\n\n  features. First, it is very efficient in the capture of mercury. Second, the\n\n  final reaction product is granular solid mercuric sulfide, which is a compact,\n\n  concentrated form of mercury that is stable under all environmental conditions.\n\n  The final reaction product can be handled as nonhazardous waste because it\n\n  easily passes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s Toxicity Characteristic\n\n  Leaching Procedure (TCLP) test for mercury leaching. In Phase I laboratory-scale\n\n  tests, more than 99 percent of the vapor-phase mercury was captured in the\n\n  scrubber and was successfully converted to a stable mercuric sulfide compound\n\n  in the secondary waste treatment process. TCLP tests that were run on the treated\n\n  waste showed mercury leachate levels well below the 200 ppb standard of the\n\n  protocol. An economic model of the scrubber process was created and used to\n\n  evaluate the cost of reactive scrubbing applied to an existing hazardous waste\n\n  incinerator. The model predicted a cost savings for the reactive scrubbing\n\n  technology of more than 28 percent when compared to the current technology\n\nof activated carbon injection.\n\nThe Phase II research project will be directed at refining this process by\n\n  identifying the most cost-effective technologies for specific functions, including\n\n  the separation of reaction product solids and treatment of the gas stream with\n\n  the scrubbing liquid. The secondary treatment process&#8212;to generate the\n\n  concentrated mercuric sulfide final reaction product&#8212;also will be optimized\n\n  in a series of laboratory tests.

Because of the low surface tension and\n\n  viscosity of the CO2 phase, the precursor will penetrate uniformly into the\n\n  narrow gaps on the surface of the patterned substrate. After the conversion\n\n  of the metal precursor, a solid metallic layer remains on the surface that\n\n  forms the desired interconnect, thin layer structure, or barrier layer. \n\nBecause of the never-ending demand for faster processor speeds and enhanced\n\n  storage capacities, smaller and more sophisticated structures are required\n\n  in modern semiconductor products. As dimensions shrink, copper interconnects\n\n  and metallic barrier and seed layers will be scrutinized like never before\n\n  in efforts to achieve maximum yields. New processes and materials will be adopted\n\n  in the coming years to meet the challenges of evolving semiconductor products.\n\n  As an environmentally benign and technically superior process, metal deposition\n\n  from supercritical CO2 will have a preferred position in the marketplace.",

        "abstract": "Biocidal additives are vital for both the preservation of coatings in the\n\n  can and for long-term coating integrity after applications. Antifungal additives\n\n  are critical for delaying attack by fungal and algal growth once an architectural\n\n  coating is in place. Biocidal coatings are designed to kill microbes and fungi\n\n  by slowly and steadily releasing biocide from the dried film. Unfortunately,\n\n  this mechanism also is responsible for the ultimate deactivation of the biocidal\n\n  activity; once the biocide has leached out or washed out of the coating, all\n\n  protection against microbes is lost. The protection of the coating by the biocide\n\n  typically lasts only around 18 months and even less in hot, humid environments\n\nlike the South and Southeast United States. \n\n\n\nOnce the biocides have leached out, a new coating must be reapplied, often\n\n  after a labor-intensive washing or removal of the previous coating. This process\n\n  creates a variety of undesirable environmental impacts, from the contamination\n\n  of surrounding areas by nonspecific biocide leaching to the increased volatile\n\n  organic compounds (VOC) emitted during the reapplication of the coating. A\n\n  system that prolongs biocidal coating lifetime and decreases the environmental\n\n  impacts of the current system would benefit both the environment and property\n\n  owners. \n\nTDA Research, Inc., will develop a new biocidal-coating system that prolongs\n\n  biocidal activity by immobilizing biocidal additives in a coating. Biocides\n\n  are largely wasted because they are emitted continuously but slowly, which\n\n  contaminates the surrounding area. A nonleaching biocide, however, would eliminate\n\n  the undesired contamination of the surrounding area and it would stay within\n\n  a coating for longer time periods. A coating that retains biocidal activity\n\n  for twice as long, for example, would require repainting only half as often,\n\n  also leading to a decrease in VOC emissions and waste production during painting.\n\n  Such a biocide also would prevent the formation of biocide-resistant bacteria\n\n  that can form from a traditional slow-release biocide.",

        "abstract": "The state of affairs facing engineers and scientists attempting to treat low-level\n\ncontaminated water using current technologies has resulted in the selection of\n\na process that has significant shortcomings. A technically superior, yet operationally\n\nsimpler treatment process that is less expensive is needed to assist industries\n\nin meeting ever-changing environmental regulations. KenGro Corporation is working\n\nto provide kenaf-based products as an effective biobased alternative for treating\n\ncontaminated aqueous streams.\n\nThe envisioned process involves loading a vertical contact tank packed with\n\n  chopped kenaf. Contaminated water will be passed through the column and contaminants\n\n  will adsorb onto kenaf fibers. This adsorption step will be operated much like\n\n  an activated carbon column. The results of Phase I provided a strong basis\n\n  to continue efforts for commercialization of a kenaf-based biosorptive process\n\n  for use in water treatment. Once the kenaf becomes spent, the fibers will be\n\n  removed and placed into a compost bed. The compost bed will be used to reduce\n\n  the volume of the kenaf mass (the adsorbent) while concentrating the heavy\n\n  metals and degrading the adsorbed biodegradable contaminants (adsorbates) via\n\n  biotreatment. The envisioned compost units are easy to operate and fit nicely\n\n  into a rural industry&#8217;s capability because of a realistic footprint and\n\n  low-tech training requirements. \n\nThe main goal of Phase I was to develop key performance information on the\n\n  use of kenaf for its ability to remove diesel fuel, zinc, and lead from aqueous\n\n  solutions. This was performed via preparation of adsorption isotherms for the\n\n  three water contaminants using three processed forms of kenaf (stalk, core,\n\n  and bast). The effect of prewashing and/or preoxidizing the kenaf on the adsorption\n\n  isotherms was evaluated for zinc and lead. The loadings show that kenaf fibers\n\n  do have an adsorption affinity for both inorganic and organic adsorbates. Ozonation\n\n  and washing appeared to provide some benefit, but differences in the value\n\n  of this processing step were quite dramatic, indicating a need for more development\n\n  of this novel approach. An additional goal of Phase I was to evaluate the rate\n\n  of compost degradation and track the fate of a pollutant during this degradation\n\n  process. Composting kenaf fibers was found to be a relatively straightforward\n\n  process with relatively high mass degradation rates observed. \n\nThe goals of Phase II are to: \n\n\n\n   Study the effect of numerous washing techniques on adsorption\n\n    capacity. \n\n   More closely evaluate the surface benefits of surface oxidation\n\n    on kenaf adsorption capacity. \n\n   Evaluate the impact of product storage on the kenaf product toward\n\n      lead, methylisoborneol, toluene, ethylbenzene, and o-xylene.\n\n   Evaluate kenaf for adsorption of additional pollutant classes.\n\n   Examine competitive adsorption of key contaminant classes.\n\n   Optimize the rate of degradation observed within the composters\n\n    and evaluate the impact of high levels of heavy metals on the observed compost\n\n      rate.\n\n   Set up a pilot system that fully mimics the envisioned full-scale\n\n      system to be commercialized.\n\n   Record the results of Phase II in a detailed project report. \n\n\n\nA common method to be used to conduct all necessary experimental tasks is\n\n  the generation of adsorption isotherm data. Chemical analyses and reactor configurations\n\n  will be performed using duplicate experimentation. Analytical techniques to\n\n  be employed will be those approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n\n  and/or published peer-reviewed standard techniques. \n\nIt is expected that the successful implementation of Phase II will yield the\n\n  necessary information to determine the efficiency and commercialization potential\n\n  of kenaf as a bioadsorbent for treating organic and inorganic contaminated\n\n  waters.",

        "abstract": "Wet weather pollution is reported to be the largest water quality problem\n\n  in the nation. In a regulation-driven market, a solution is estimated to be\n\n  $400 billion for cities and industries to control stormwater and sewer overflows.\n\n  Studies show that flow control to attenuate hydraulic rates by utilizing available\n\n  storage will optimize treatment capacity and reduce downstream water quality\n\n  impacts, making it the most cost-effective component of almost every wet weather\n\n  control system. There is a significant market opportunity for a nonmechanical,\n\n  maintenance-free flow control technology that will not inhibit existing capacities\n\nor aquatic biology. \n\n\n\nThe Wet Weather Engineering &amp; Technology (WWETCO) device consists of a\n\n  downward-closing flexible bladder containing a static fluid (adjustable) that\n\n  seals the bladder against all or a portion of a conduit that transports base\n\n  flow and/or stormwater flow. The hypothesis is that the bladder will open from\n\n  the bottom to relieve excess flow or solids to maintain a maximum upstream\n\n  level equal to the contained static liquid level. The bladder will operate\n\n  to optimize diversion to treatment and/or attenuation of wet weather flows.\n\n  Operation is passive, riding on the optimized drainage system hydraulic gradient,\n\n  without the need for control instrumentation or mechanical devices. It is non-clogging\n\n  and inverts, providing full-bore peak flow through that does not alter system\n\n  capacity. An option allows base flow for combined sewer or stream flow for\n\n  aquatic biology-tolerant applications. \n\nPhase I objectives included hypotheses testing under a range of flow and debris\n\n  conditions. Phase II objectives include the design development of a full-scale\n\n  product, prototype fabrications, and verification testing. \n\nThe Phase I efforts included pilot testing for hydraulic measurement and observation\n\n  with debris injection for different static control and backwater levels and\n\n  an evaluation of different bladder materials. Phase II efforts include recommended\n\n  material strength testing, pilot-scale grit erosion testing, and full-scale\n\n  fabrication and field testing. \n\nHydraulic testing demonstrated smooth operation and upstream gradient control,\n\n  requiring minimal head (4 inches) under all constant and rapidly varying flows,\n\n  with the bladder automatically adjusting to free any debris. The implication\n\n  of the demonstrated approach is a simple, low-cost, no maintenance adjustable\n\n  flow control, applicable anywhere in the natural or constructed drainage network\n\n  without inhibiting capacity. Commercial applications include inline and offline\n\n  storage and treatment control and optimization.",

        "abstract": "VOC Technologies, Inc. (VOCTEC) developed a patent-pending new technology\n\n  for analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and hazardous air pollutants\n\n  (HAPs) by compressing an air sample to high pressure before injecting it into\n\n  a specially designed gas chromatograph (GC). This GC is constructed entirely\n\n  within a personal computer (the &#8220;GC-in-a-PC&#8221;), which operates unattended\n\n  and indefinitely in the field with network communication. Compression both\n\n  concentrates the sample and removes water vapor by condensation. This procedure\n\nis called pneumatic focusing gas chromatography (PFGC). \n\n\n\nThis highly automated new technology has the potential to lower the cost of\n\n  a VOC/HAP analysis by a factor of 100, requiring no special operator skills.\n\n  With PFGC, a 300 cc sample can be injected directly on the column and achieve\n\n  a 50 ppb level of detection (LOD) for benzene, with 500,000 theoretical plates\n\n  using either flame or photoionization detection. Samples as small as 0.1 cc\n\n  allow for direct stack monitoring. Because the entire air sample passes the\n\n  column and detector, ambient methane serves as an internal standard on every\n\n  analysis. \n\nIn Phase I, two PFGC instruments were constructed. These instruments were\n\n  equipped with commercial dual flame and photoionization detectors (FID/PID),\n\n  and demonstrated their ruggedness, sensitivity, and precision in monitoring\n\n  Portland&#8217;s outdoor air. Monitoring was carried out with one PFGC at an\n\n  urban monitoring station run by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality\n\n  (DEQ). One goal was to compare the performances of the PID and the FID in a\n\n  TO-14 type environment as conducted on a typical sixth-day canister analysis\n\n  schedule. The second PFGC, used for laboratory testing and calibration, delivered\n\n  1 ppbV precision (standard error in the mean) for sub-ppbV levels of chlorobenzene.\n\n  In Phase II, VOCTEC will carry out a year-long ambient TO-14 inter-comparison\n\n  under contract to the DEQ at no cost to the Small Business Innovation Research\n\n  (SBIR) Program. This will involve DEQ&#8217;s traditional U.S. Environmental\n\n  Protection Agency-approved sixth-day TO-14 canister analysis and VOCTEC&#8217;s\n\n  24/7 in situ ambient air analysis. Additionally, the TO-14 canisters will be\n\n  analyzed using PFGC for comparison with the in situ data. In past work, VOCTEC\n\n  has followed diurnal variation of a major VOC component that was not present\n\n  when the canister was analyzed. Apparently, this compound either adsorbs or\n\n  decomposes in the canister. During Phase II, major improvements will be made\n\n  in chromatographic resolution to better separate HAPs from less toxic VOCs.\n\n  This will involve novel and proprietary software and hardware modifications\n\n  of the existing PFGC instrument.",

Baker at the University of Michigan Medical School over a period\n\n  of 7 years. Research was funded through grants from the Defense Advanced Research\n\n  Program Agency, which identified a need to have a nontoxic, noncorrosive biodefense\n\n  decontaminate material that can decontaminate equipment, personnel, structures,\n\n  and terrain in the event of a bioincident. A series of surfactant lipid nanoemulsions,\n\n  which have extensive antimicrobial activity and are not toxic to tissues, resulted\n\n  from this effort. Nanoemulsions are oil-in-water emulsions that employ droplets\n\n  ranging from 200-800 nm. They are composed of detergents, vegetable oil, salt,\n\n  water, and a food-grade alcohol, and for anthrax decontamination, a spore germination\n\n  enhancer. The physical structure of the nanoemulsion contains the surfactants\n\n  that mediate the antimicrobial activity. The emulsion droplet disrupts microorganisms\n\nthrough fusion and the destabilization of the cell membrane leading to lysis. \n\nIn December 1999, the U.S. Army tested a broad spectrum nanoemulsion and nine\n\n  other biodecontamination technologies in Dugway, Utah, against an anthrax surrogate,\n\n  Bacillus globigii. Nanoemulsion was one of four technologies that proved effective\n\n  and was the only nontoxic formulation available. Other tests against the vaccine\n\n  strain of B. anthracis (Sterne strain) were conducted by the John Hopkins University\n\n  Applied Physics Laboratory and by the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research. \n\nThe Phase I research project funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n\n  (EPA) focused on optimization of NanoProtect&#8482;&#8217;s formulations for\n\n  efficacy against B. anthracis and confirmation of product stability. The objective\n\n  of this Phase II project is to confirm field use and post-use protocols for\n\n  NanoProtect&#8482; nontoxic decontamination for facilities and equipment following\n\n  a bioincident. The most efficacious decontamination protocol will be determined\n\n  through efficacy tests against Bacillus spores and other possible &#8220;bio-attack&#8221; pathogens.\n\n  Tests will be conducted on materials typically found in buildings.

        "abstract": "Integral radiators integrate the primary structural system and the thermal rejection system into a dual function subsystem allowing for reduced weight. The design of these systems require a careful trade-off of thermal fluids, structural materials, thermal coatings and structural shape.  The Paragon Crescent panels are a family of solutions that allow a highly efficient stressed skin, semi-monocoque structure to also be a radiator on the external surface of a Apollo-like Service Module as envisioned for the CEV.  The resulting design optimizes the structural/thermal trade-off while allowing for practical considerations of manufacturability, ground handling, testing, and access.  The baseline materials and fluids chosen address cost, safety and robust design.  Some coating development is still needed to meet the handling requirements.  The structural concept will need to be tested to validate modeling predictions and gain experience in structural behavior.  Finally, full up radiator panels need to be manufactured and tested to validate the manufacturing methods, thermal analysis, and overall radiator/thermal fluid choices.",

The concept is based on the development of composite RO/RO ship ramp structures that incorporate unique design features enabling the structure to respond in an acceptable manner to dynamic conditions.  These design features are: (1) a lightweight, high-strength and modular composite structure based upon application of \"Cell Core\" technology; (2) smart manufacturing processes to permit low-cost and reliable manufacture of composite structures; (3) integrated flexible structural joints using elastomeric bushings; and (4) an integrated semi-active motion mitigation system using magnetorheological fluid dampers.  Work will include finite element analysis, demonstration of \u201cSmart\u201d manufacturing processes, design optimization, and testing of full-scale and scaled specimens.  The concept offers a potential to manufacture affordable composite ramps with a 40-60 % weight reduction compared to conventional steel ramps. The modular fabrication approach provides tremendous flexibility during design and manufacture of composite ramp structures of various dimensions, weight requirements, and rated load capacities.

Each antenna element requires an RF electronics package with three receivers, two at 20 GHz and one at 15 GHz.  Each receiver chain needs to provide enough gain to establish system noise figure and overcome combiner network losses along with a digitally controlled phase shifter for beam forming.  The multi band element receiver RF electronics would be fabricated on a single MMIC chip and packaged along with a digital latch for phase shifter control in a surface mount chip scale package.  The custom MMIC would include two multi-stage LNA amplifiers with gain >24 dB.  The first LNA would be used for the 20 GHz LHCP signal and the other would be used to amplify the RHCP signal for both the 15 GHz and 20 GHz bands.

        "abstract": "The role of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) in the future battlespace is projected to increase tremendously in the immediate future.  Currently, viable mission scenarios for MAVs are constrained by their limited size and flight dynamics.  MAVs have difficulty maintaining constant surveillance as they must remain in constant motion to stay aloft and hence may not be able to provide constant target surveillance or have sufficient endurance.  One potential approach to mitigating these shortcomings is to endow the MAV with a terrestrial locomotion capability so that it can maneuver itself to an appropriate location and perch while performing the desired ISR or RSTA operations.  The proposed work seeks to extend the results obtained by Orbital Research and Theiss Aviation during a successful Phase I SBIR program that established the feasibility of a Multi-mode MAV design.  The selected vehicle design tightly integrates terrestrial locomotion and flight systems in order to reduce weight, size and mobility system specific structures.  Orbital Research will build upon this work to develop and demonstrate a prototype Multi-mode MAV.  The program will culminate with a full demonstration of the MAV's ability to take off, fly, land, negotiate terrain in order to accomplish mission objectives, and return to flight.",

One system uses substituted imidazolium salts with LiBOB as a passivating agent for the lithium and lithium-alloy anodes.  Other lower-melting halide-based systems (one melting at 151\u00b0C, for example)can be achieved by forming a pentanary eutectic.  A candidate battery has been successfully tested at Sandia Labs in a 5 cell configuration.  Alternative electrolytes that show promise are based on nitrates melting at 124.5\u00b0C.  This electrolyte system can be tested in a 5-cell configuration.  All of the above systems show promise. It is proposed that the above candidate systems be further evaluated in 5-cell battery tests. Prior to carrying our these tests, single-cell tests will be conducted to characterize each system and to select those that show the most promise. Following the result of successful 5-cell battery tests, the most promising candidates would then be built into full-sized hermitically sealed,15 cell batteries using standard hardware.  Testing will be subjected to acceptance, stand-life and simulated qualification testing.  Selecting an initiation source has been already established in earlier work at Sandia Labs. However, additional pyrotechnic development will be necessary if the nitrate candidate is selected, but recent research at Sandia has identified carbonyl iron as a suitable material for moderating the burn rate and heat output for the standard Fe/KClO4 pyrotechnic.",

        "abstract": "In this proposal, Intelligent Automation, Incorporated (IAI) and its subcontractors, Prof. Richard Stern of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and Dr. Rita Singh of Haikya Corp., propose a novel integrated system to improve speech recognition performance for people with foreign accents. It is emphasized that this team has rich experience in understanding the speech characteristics in non-native speakers. The temporal and intra-phoneme variations introduce mismatches between the baseline speech recognition model and a particular non-native speaker model. Hence some adaptations are needed to update the speaker models for non-native speakers. The proposed system consists of three parts: 1) a speech enhancement module to eliminate background noise; 2) a speaker adaptation algorithm that uses a small training data set to update the speakers\u2019 models in the speech recognition part; 3) a speech recognition system to recognition speech. Our Phase 1 results have clearly demonstrated the feasibility of the individual algorithms. The goal of this Phase 2 research is to develop and demonstrate a real-time prototype speech recognition system for non-native speakers. The system can be portable to any platform such as PowerPC. The system also has continuous and unsupervised learning capability.",

EAMS models adversarial actions through a distinct link to adversarial intent and emergent (or dynamic) behavior.   The Phase I effort proved the EAMS environment\u2019s ability to model emergent behavior based upon adversarial intent and observable actions.  In Phase II the EAMS concept will be expanded to include: 1) adversarial models based on adversary intent, 2) modification of those models for emergent behavior, 3) specifying models with an Adversarial Knowledge Specification Language (AKSL), 4) tools for tuning and optimization of adversary components, and 5) validation through a working prototype.   The objective of EAMS is to provide a realistic simulation of emergent behavior of Red (enemy) force actions/reactions based on Blue force actions.  In cold war era conflicts where likely adversaries were expected to exhibit similar capabilities and doctrine to Blue forces attrition based simulations achieved capable results.  In the post-cold war era of limited conflict and unconventional enemy response, simulations based on attrition principles do not yield realistic or useable results.  Non-conventional enemies seldom have capabilities that rival US or coalition forces in technology or technique.  In these cases adversarial intent and response behavior become important considerations.  EAMS will demonstrate alterations of Red force behavior in response to observed Blue force actions.  This type of fluid dynamic response will move beyond the attrition-based \u201cwho can knock out what first\u201d doctrine and provide military planners and intelligence analysts with a more realistic simulation of adversarial actions.",

The approach integrates the key components into a single, monolithic, injection-molded structure that is low in cost and easily scaleable from the baseline 100 LPM sampling rate. The flow rates of the two secondary channels are only 5% of the primary airflow. The segregated and concentrated particulates from each channel may be captured into either a dry (filter) matrix or a wet (aqueous) matrix. System modeling indicates the device will only consume about 5 watts and the project manufacturing cost is $500. Such an air sampler is needed for the detection and identification of biological materials in a number of arenas. Foremost is the need to protect infrastructure and populations from bioterrorism.

        "abstract": "Recent military operations demonstrate the heavy reliance of U.S. military operations on space assets for intelligence, surveillance, communications, and targeting. Using anti-satellite methods such as lasers or kinetic energy vehicles, potential adversaries have the capability to attack space assets and severely degrade the U.S.\u2019s military superiority. To maintain dominance, Defensive Counterspace (DCS) techniques and attack detection algorithms are aggressively being developed. Due to the complexities and limitations in current techniques and algorithms, improved work-centered user interface systems are needed to assist operators in analyzing the wide variety of available information (e.g. interpreting decision aid outputs) in order to decrease decision and reporting time. To address this problem, we propose to construct a prototype Agent-based Satellite Attack Analysis System (ASAAS) for satellite operators or national asset managers who are in off-nominal situations due to anti-satellite attacks. Our approach is to use a work-centered support system (WCSS) design that combines work-centered analysis and evaluation with intelligent agents and argumentation-based decision support.

Multistatic operations can potentially improve ASW effectiveness in challenging shallow-water environments while allowing critical assets to remain acoustically covert or at a safe standoff distance.   The Navy uses multistatic acoustic sensor systems with aircraft and surface ships, in network-centric ASW surveillance missions. Current incoherent systems suffer from high false alarm rates when operating in shallow water. A method of reducing false alarms and not unnecessarily alerting our adversaries is needed.   For future multistatic systems, coherent active sonar techniques are being investigated, because of the potential to extract motion target classification clues. Exploiting Doppler in multistatic systems is challenging because of target scattering effects. Increasing the duty cycle results in many potential echoes from the target, and the task of combining these target echoes in the presence of is critical. This project will develop a signal, information and data fusion processing software prototype that will extract Doppler and motion features contained in coherent waveforms.  We will use a Likelihood Ratio Tracking track-before-detect approach to optimally combine multiple echoes, in order to form consistent tracks over space and time that discriminate between targets and clutter.",

It also allows for explicit incorporation of the road information and interactions with other targets into the filters. Together with features aiding from HRRR and/or SAR (simulated from FATSO in Phase II), it provides additional means for better report-to-track association and tracking of targets across an intersection (move-stop-move with or without turn). Furthermore, the measurement nonlinearity arising from the 1D modeling of roads and target feature aiding is well handled by the proposed nonlinear filters. In Phase II, the computational algorithms developed in Phase I will be implemented into well-structured software modules toward a software development toolkit as part of the Phase II deliverable and a \u201cmarketable\u201d product to pursue after Phase II.

        "abstract": "Composite structures for submarines require high strength and high fracture toughness to survive underwater shock blasts.  These structures have historically been built using rubber-toughened epoxy pre-impregnated (pre-pregs) reinforcements.  However, experience has shown that pre-pregs can be difficult to work with, especially for thick section parts, and require expensive, size-limited, autoclave curing.  The opportunity described in this proposal is the demonstration of relatively low cost alternatives to pre-preg/autoclave fabrication for submarine composite hardware. A combination of design and analysis, materials development, and manufacturing process development is required for the phase II effort.  The proposed team members are experts in their respective fields, and have successfully demonstrated their combined capability on numerous advanced composites programs for military applications.",

The Phase II technical objective is to increase the maturity and scale of Trex\u2019s manufacturing process to meet the specifications for a specific DoD program.  To meet this objective, Trex will refine the Phase I program design and fabricate a 750 mm aperture mirror for testing.  In addition, we will fabricate, coat and test 4\u201d sample coupons and several lightweight mirrors.  We have also proposed three options for this program.  The first addresses the coating and HEL testing of the 750 mm mirror design and the second is targeted at developing the optimal mounting structures for use with CVC SiC and determining the mechanical performance and tolerance capabilities for 0.75-1.5m class mirrors.  The third can provide additional large aperture test mirrors.",

        "abstract": "The proposed work addresses the need to rapidly detect certain sulfur contaminants in aviation fuel vapors to permit continuous operation of hydrodesulfurization units in hydrogen reformers.  A sensor design has been developed which will permit differentiation of sulfur contaminants based on differences in the physical characteristics of the gases which affect their adsorption and desorption from certain mixed metal oxide surfaces.  The Phase I work is focusing on the characterization of a family of metal oxides which interact strongly with the target gas, dibenzothiophene (DBT), and which are tolerant to the harsh operating environment of the aviation fuel reformer.  Accurate mass balance measurements on two of the candidate oxides have shown that the adsorption of DBT is rapid and is sensitive to the partial pressure of the gas at about 100ppm.  The sensor, together with associated electronics and embedded software will permit rapid analysis of the target gas.  The sensor and electronics will provide a means of re-zeroing the sensor response during use and compensation for changing temperatures over the range of 300-600oC.  The sensor will have a goal of  1-10 ppm DBT resolution with a span of 1-400 ppm.  The electronic package currently in use requires less than 0.5 Watt.",

        "abstract": "Current image generator architectures force topographic features to conform to an underlying terrain model.  This technique is backwards in terms of training value, because the positional accuracy of topographic features is of greater interest to pilots versus the general accuracy of a featureless terrain skin.  As the cost and time associated with generating terrain databases is steadily becoming a larger percentage of the total cost of procuring training devices, a need exists for an IG architecture that addresses these issues. As the US Military transitions to a more mobile force, the Warfighter needs to rapidly visualize specific terrain features any where in the world from various sources of data.  Diamond Visionics has recognized the value of this capability by developing technology that combines source data at run-time on a COTS PC, greatly reducing the time and cost required to produce high-fidelity visual databases. The technology proposed for Phase II will enable rapid modification and visualization of terrain databases for use in a wide variety of applications including training and simulation, mission planning and rehearsal, and command and control.

To achieve this search, ExPERT maintains a knowledge base enhanced with learning (inductive) algorithms that enable an intelligent search.  This knowledge base is contained within an ontology designed with a novel structure that permits greater freedom for detecting inference chains and performing induction, each of which greatly enhance the accuracy of the search.

The 50W power achievable over a multi-octave bandwidth of [200MHz-1,000MHz] and [1,000MHz-4,000MHz] with efficiencies [PAE] exceeding 40%, coupled with high temperature operation [< 600C] and high break-down voltage [< 100V] make this technology ideally suited for efficient battery operation. F&H proposes Phase II program aiming at the development of a prototype GaN HPA for Efficient High Power Amplification for Munitions. This program, solidly based on our Phase I results, will also avail this novel technology to numerous commercial applications including 3G & 4G [W-CDMA & UMTS] cellular base stations, LMDS, Repeaters and Emergency Services, among others. As the WBG technology moves from R&D to production, F&H intends to lead this effort bringing new products to market. We plan to achieve the commercialization objectives through teaming arrangements with established microwave components manufacturers, experienced in high volume production and having existing sales channel. We are currently involved in such negotiations. The necessary additional funding will be sought from available outside sources, as needed.",

        "abstract": "The lack of an active sensor for ranging eliminates the airburst capability on many existing conventional weapons used for impact and penetrating missions.  The Air Force has a desire to add a height of burst (HOB) capability to these weapons in order to expand their operational use. FIRST RF recognizes the need for a fuzing system with the real beam accuracy of MMW frequencies, the foliage penetration and cost of low frequency systems, and no alterations to the skin of existing missile systems such as JASSM.  FIRST RF Corporation has developed an innovative concept that will provide all these benefits over the wide range of applications including the JASSM platform. A robust fuze providing better than 0.5 meter accuracy is required in the presence of adverse weather, battlefield obscurants, ECM/EMI and thick vegetation and tree canopies. The fuze concept exploits radiation from existing national or commercial assets.  The proposed program takes advantage of developments on other Phase II programs to put together a fuze demonstration testbed with final validation of the concept at Eglin AFB.",

        "abstract": "Diesel engines are attractive for military use because of good fuel economy and ability to use JP8-type fuels.  However naturally-aspirated (n.a.) diesel engines have low power density, and small diesel engines are not amenable to turbo-charging.  To overcome this disadvantage for weight-sensitive applications such as portable generators (gensets), the use of a novel supercharger is proposed.  In Phase I, engine modeling predicted the ability of supercharging with a new variable compression ratio Hansen supercharger to increase power from a small diesel engine by more than 50% while maintaining high fuel economy.  This would allow about a 50% reduction in the size and weight of a diesel genset.  Phase II will build and test the new supercharger, and construct a supercharged diesel genset to verify the modeling results and demonstrate the above benefits.",

Current-generation controllers are already reaching a level of complexity that pushes the envelopes of existing V&V approaches, with little hope for affordable V&V of next-generation intelligent systems.  One possible solution is to combine run-time monitors for subsystem components with simple backup modules that provide a safe reversionary mode during undesirable conditions.  Such an architecture allows the V&V to be partitioned into design-time V&V (for the relatively simple monitor and fail-safe subsystems), and run-time V&V (for the full complex controller).  Barron Associates proposes a Phase II plan of research to develop and demonstrate run-time monitoring approaches for flight-critical systems.  The Phase II research will refine the Phase I approach, leverage recent research in safety-critical systems outside the aerospace community, and apply lessons learned during Lockheed\u2019s Verification and Validation of Intelligent and Adaptive Control Systems (VVIACS) program.

        "abstract": "The performance of the JSF can be improved by reducing the weight of the propulsion system.  The JSF is powered by either Pratt & Whitney\u2019s (P&W) F135 engine or General Electric\u2019s F136 engine.  Both engines use a common exhaust system produced by P&W.  One attractive approach to reducing the weight of the JSF propulsion system is to replace high density metal nozzle compo-nents with CMCs. In fact, CMCs have shown promise as flaps and seals on F110 turbojets that are presently undergoing flight testing at Hill AFB.  Very promising results have been exhibited by S200 CMC (Nicalon/SiNC) flaps and seals.  Specifically several S200 5\u201d x 21\u201d x 0.070\u201d 0/90 laminates have survived hundreds of hours of flight testing, including hundreds of afterburner lights.  Not only do the CMCs weigh less than the existing metal components but they also eliminate the cracking and warping that the metal parts exhibit due to the high thermal gradients and high acous-tic loads.  However, after several hundred hours of exposure the CMC flaps begin to delaminate and lose surface plies.  Test experi-ence coupled with stress analysis indicates that if the material maintained its original properties the flaps would not suffer damage.  However, the flight tests show that over time the CMC properties degrade, leading to delamination and ply loss.  Thus in order to employ CMCs in JSF propulsion components it is nec-essary to understand the material degradation mechanisms and ap-ply that understanding to the design of CMC components.  The degraded properties of the S200 CMCs are controlled by several environmental variables including loads, temperatures, atmosphere, time, and preconditioning.  The loads include static and fatigue events, and mechanical and thermal loads.  The ambi-ent temperature will affect the CMC behavior even if the CMC is undamaged and stress free.  The chemistry of the surrounding at-mosphere may include air and moisture, which will affect the ma-terial behavior.  Furthermore the CMC behavior will depend on exposure time.  Finally the condition of the CMC prior to test-ing will theoretically affect the behavior so the program will address the properties of both virgin and precracked materials.  It may be possible to develop design information on de-graded properties and CMC lifetimes through a purely empirical approach in which materials are exposed to various environments and tested to determine their properties.  The number of mate-rial properties and environmental variables, however, will in-clude several hundred sets of data making a purely empirical ap-proach prohibitively expensive and time consuming.  An alterna-tive approach, proposed here, is to develop a physics-based mi-cromechanical model, grounded by correlation with critical meas-ured properties that can compute degraded properties and life-times.  This material model can be subsequently coupled with fi-nite element models of CMC components to design parts accounting for degraded properties and long term behavior.",

The Air Force desires a SCRAMJET-powered missile for time-critical targets and deeply buried targets. Currently, there exists a void in the development of sensor system architectures that are capable of withstanding the flight conditions that SCRAMJET-powered vehicles will encounter. Typically, sensors exist to measure the necessary parameters, e.g. temperature, strain, speed, etc. However, designers currently lack a flexible, robust means of networking the sensors; in other words, designers lack an appropriate architecture for the sensor system. Zolo Technologies proposes the development and demonstration of an all-optical flight sensor system architecture to provide detailed information on the condition of SCRAMJET-powered flight vehicles. The sensor system utilizes a unique architecture employing optical fiber as its backbone to measure hypersonic combustion parameters, skin temperature, inlet velocity, and the shock front position in the inlet. The proposed system provides a clear path for the incorporation of additional sensors and should prove extremely robust for embedded flight applications since it primarily employs components that have passed stringent environmental tests for telecommunications applications.",

        "abstract": "The current free-drifting sonobuoy systems provide information that is uplinked on a very high frequency to distribute collected data needed by the aircrew to detect, localize, track and attack hostile submarines. The addition of a capability for multiple-sensor node and platform networking is essential in the future utilization of sonobuoys in a network-centric battlespace. True multi-node, routed networking among sonobuoys, with improved telemetry permitting higher bandwidth data to be transmitted from platform to platform and from deployed sensors to platform and shore stations, unmanned autonomous vehicles, surface vessels, submarines, aircraft, and shore-based installations is highly desirable. A local area network is envisioned using standard or modified commercial off-the-shelf protocols with the capability of point-to-point, peer-to-peer, and multicast connectivity among multiple sensor nodes and platforms. An important point is that any intra-platform communication protocol should not be selected with simple point-to-point applications in mind so that obstacles for future multiple-node networking can be avoided. Furthermore, sensor networks should be self-organizing to permit an easy deployment and to be fault tolerant. Traffic should be evenly distributed over all the nodes, such that all nodes die approximately at the same time within given power constraints. As a result, NAL Research proposes the use of Iridium modem, the Iridium network, and the iSAT communication software modules to meet these requirements.",

When exposed to CW agent simulants, CWICs react to become fluorescent under UV stimulation. In the first phase, we implemented a system employing CWICs to indicate whether an area is contaminated by chemical agents. Tests conducted on military-type assets proved the feasibility of this approach.  In Phase II, we will extend the research to enhance sensitivity and to optimize the process to support military operations and to reduce risks to the environment, the public, and allied warfighters.  An especially important feature of these chromophores is that they have been shown to be responsive only to chemicals that are in fact hazardous even if they are not typically considered CW agents.  Similarly, because the CWICs respond only to reactive materials, they are not subject to interference even from compounds that normally serve as surrogates for CW agents. Thus, the proposed work should lead to development of an effective system for assessing CW agent contamination.",

        "abstract": "Imaging laser radar is evolving into an important tactical sensor, which may be fielded on UAVs.  However, UAV systems range in size from micro systems, which have payload requirements of a few ounces to the mini UAVs with payload requirements of tens of pounds.  This provides the designer of UAV based laser radars with considerable problems in selecting laser sources to fit in these vehicles.  The Multiple Fiber Phased Array (MuFPAS) System is an eye-safe short pulse laser device, which is based on a common laser substructure consisting of distributed components, which can be scaled to meet laser power and weight requirements for various UAV platforms.  MuFPAS utilizes compact optical and electronic component technologies to minimize volume requirements and by using fiber technologies can design the laser to utilize volumes in the vehicle currently being utilize d.  By selecting the appropriate modules the laser system can operate at powers up to 50 watts with kilohertz up-rates and a 3 nsec pulselength.  By providing a modular laser approach with a user toolbox, eye-safe laser radars can be incorporated into various UAVs and missions faster with less development cost.",

The project has the need for advanced optical modeling and design tools that include physical optical calculations to support propagation results at a contrast level of 1x10-11 at the image plane of the coronagraph. The CODE V software is the most advanced software available for a wide variety of optical system modeling tasks and would be ideally suited for the TPF project once the proposed capabilities are integrated.

During Phase II, we will further develop the stochastic models to include a wide range of agent-neutralizer combinations, along with approaches for modeling uncertainty in the initial distribution of bioagent within the target. Neutralization model fidelity will be maximized by inferring information from semi-classical pathogen population experiments and quantitative models of cellular physiological processes. Hydrodynamic models will be further enhanced by coupling advanced turbulence and free-surface models with the Surface Marker approach. Extensive model/software testing and demonstration will be performed. Modular software, along with an easy-to-use interface and detailed documentation will be developed and transferred to the Air Force at the end of the project.",

        "abstract": "In these times of increasing deficits and limited budgets, the Office of the Secretary of Defense is using the idea of Capability-Based Acquisitions. This concept limits spending by focusing investments only for key capabilities. With this concept, Research and Development at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) now also needs to be such that  funding is focused on R&D that supports these key capabilities.  AFRL has developed a Capability Focused Technology Investment (CFTI) philosophy that utilizes top down planning to support their strategic planning process. This has resulted in a suite of programs that support LRS vehicles, UAVs, sensorcraft suites, and weapons platforms that are quantifiable through numerical modeling. Unfortunately, this only extends to the platform level; the subsystems and payloads are not prioritized. To resolve this issue and to enable subsystem/payload strategic planning, Modelogics has developed Model Engineer, a tool that is capable of modeling major vehicle subsystems. With selection of this Phase II proposal, this capability will be extended to all major vehicle subsystems as well as all relevant platform payloads. Once all these payloads and subsystems are developed, Model Engineer will be demonstrated to work with AFRL/VA CFTI modeling process as well as with competitive future systems.",

        "abstract": "MRLets Technologies, Inc. proposes an innovative technology  for high performance and computationally efficient ground target tracking and identification using powerful multiresolutional particle filters  with finite mixtures and  GMTI/HRR measurements.  This innovative technology consists of four  major functional components:  particle filters for  handling nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity,  multiresolutional processing for computational efficiency,   finite mixture models with  an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for effective information exploitation, invariant-based joint tracking and identification for technology application. In addition to these four  components, a set of  high performance and innovative nonlinear and non-Gaussian filters will be developed to provide the theoretical foundations. A tight integration  of these four functional components will provide us with  unprecedented power in information exploitation, target modeling, data association, state filtering, and target identification.  Nonlinear and non-Gaussian phenomena have  long existed in almost every area of target tracking and identification and have become the  bottleneck for developing high performance algorithms.  Particle filters have been proven to be very effective for nonlinear/non-Gaussian estimation. However, the most notorious disadvantage of a particle filter is its formidable computational complexity, since thousands particles are usually needed, which is equivalent to running thousands of  filters simultaneously.  The heart of this research is to drastically reduce the computational complexity of particle filters while maintaining  their full power.  It has  been proven that the only technique of truly solving an algorithmic  computation problem is multiresolutional processing, both in temporal and spatial domains. Therefore, we propose a multiresolutional particle filter to reduce significantly the number of particles and update them at a lower rate, while maintaining the full strength of a particle filter. In addition, when applying a particle filter to a density function with multi-modality due to multiple targets, weak targets could be dropped or merged because of the poor localization property of a particle filter. We will improve localization accuracy by using a finite mixture with particles. Information extraction and target modeling for rigid-body targets could be greatly benefited from the invariant principle. In this project, we will extend our invariant-based tracking and identification algorithms to a multiresolutional particle filter implementation. We will also introduce a mixture-EM technique for effective HRR information exploitation.  During the course of this research, we will develop a set of new  techniques for nonlinear and non-Gaussian estimation. This proposal is packed with many important innovations. When  fully developed, the proposed research should have a significant impact on the target tracking and recognition communities. Raytheon Company, a subcontractor, will investigate the possibility of transferring this innovative technology into their product lines.",

To address Navy requirements, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) has developed in Phase I a new Adaptive Turbofan Noise Active Control (ATNAC) system based on an entirely novel concept that combines passive/active cancellation technology and adaptive feedback controls.  The ATNAC system consists primarily of a reactive noise suppression device and an adaptive neural network control module.  In Phase II, POC proposes to develop a fully functional ATNAC system for turbofan engines, including real-time control hardware and smart material hi-fi actuators, and to test our system in a scale near-real turbofan model in an anechoic chamber facility to verify its performance.    Phase II will concentrate on developing smart reactive noise suppression devices consisting of smart actuators with passive noise absorbers, for generation of high-fidelity acoustic counter energy and on implementing a further refined adaptive neural network prediction algorithm into fast, real-time parallel processing hardware, including all necessary interfaces and system packaging.

EGLEAN will combine the strengths of an accurate high-fidelity model of human performance with a simple behavior description language for hierarchical task decomposition and a usable developer interface. EGLEAN will facilitate rapid modeling and analysis of interface candidates in complex team environments, allowing a broader exploration of the design space and a deeper understanding of the design tradeoffs than possible in typical development processes. EGLEAN will result in lower development and operational costs for resulting designs, and safer, more effective, and more error-tolerant systems. Although some tools exist for analyzing designs for usability, and techniques exist for identifying human error, no tool or associated technique exists that is easy enough to be used by normal engineers on a regular basis.

A novel approach for the destruction of CW agents involves genetically engineering microorganisms to produce recombinant enzymes that can efficiently degrade CW agents.  Such a system would allow these toxic compounds to be efficiently degraded to harmless products.  There are a number of advantages to a biological based system for degrading CW agents.  First, a properly designed biological system would be easy to use by non-science personnel, such as Special Operation units of the armed forces.  Also, a biological-based system would be cost effective because it would be self-generating, and each enzyme molecule can degrade many molecules of a CW agent due to their catalytic nature.  In the Phase I, Agave BioSystems was highly successful in demonstrating proof of concept by genetically engineering B. megaterium to surface express OPH and show degradation activity.

Using interferometric radar processing, X-WACS can extract surface topography with meter-scale resolution to ranges of several hundred meters. The RF unit, mounted on a mast above the deck of the USV,  encloses a solid state radar and a rotating pair of fan beam antennas to provide 360-degree coverage. Data from the antenna pair is sampled with a digital receiver then processed in real time on a standard computer.

A revolutionary new inspection technology invented at Boeing and under development at LSP Technologies, Inc., offers a practical solution to locating composite damage/defect regions in laminate and laminate-adhesive bonds in aircraft structures.  This inspection technique, known as Laser Bond Inspection (LBI), is a proof-testing method that applies a well-controlled dynamic stress to the composite structure, and senses the failure of weak laminate or weak adhesive bonds in response to the stress.  The LBI process has been developed using a research laser that is not optimized for the process.  Now, as a result of the SBIR Phase I, LBI can be implemented by a new advanced laser device that will reduce both the size and cost of the presently used research laser.  This advancement is essential for rapid insertion of the LBI process into aircraft manufacturing plants operations and aircraft maintenance depots.",

        "abstract": "Signature-based hyperspectral target-detection algorithms have demonstrated encouraging performance over a range of imagery.  These algorithms require as input a spectral signature for the target material of interest.  Signature-based detection algorithms  are often demonstrated using a carefully measured laboratory  spectrum for an ideal sample of a target material.  In many situations, however,  a laboratory spectrum will not be available for a target material.  In some cases,  we may have a remotely sensed radiance spectrum obtained by an image analyst for  a target or multiple field measurements from different sources.  In the most  challenging cases, the remotely sensed radiance spectrum may be for a subpixel or concealed target.  We have shown that the performance of signature-based detection  algorithms has a significant dependence on the input target spectral model.  Thus,  the generation of optimized target models from different input sources is a  critical issue for the success of target detection systems in operational  environments.  In this project, we will develop an innovative software product  called MODGEN that produces optimized target models using input laboratory, field,  and remote spectral measurements.  This product can be used in combination with  signature-based detection algorithms to provide a system that can be used  operationally for model selection and target detection.

Measurement of TEC is utilized in order to assess environmental or system impacts, with possibilities for correction or mitigation. The current primary source of TEC measurements is dual-frequency Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver systems.  These measurements contain contributions from the ionosphere and the plasmasphere, as well as biases arising from instrumental sources.  While plasmasphere charge densities are considerably less than those of the ionosphere, the large extent of the plasmasphere can produce a significant integrated contribution relative to that of the ionosphere.  The instrumental biases can be of any magnitude. To achieve highly accurate measurements of ionospheric TEC, an accurate technique to eliminate the bias effects from the GPS TEC measurements and partition the observed TEC into ionosphere and plasmasphere components is required.  Developments of a mathematical technique, based on observed characteristics of the ionosphere, have presented the opportunity for conducting separate measurements of the ionosphere and plasmasphere contributions to TEC.

A key part of PHM includes electronic prognostics, where an impending failure in an electronic module can be predicted before it occurs and thus is very useful for such critical systems.  Power converters are ubiquitous, but often are prone to unexpected failures in military systems.  Using a commercial DC to DC Power Converter as a test case, Ridgetop will develop prognostic methods, physics-of-failure component models (for pre-cursor measurement) and provide useful \u201cremaining life\u201d predictions.  The work can easily be extended to other DC to DC power converters in Naval and DoD Systems.    Ridgetop proposes a prognostic solution to detect 80% of impending random and end-of-life failures in the DC to DC Converter. When used together with Condition-Based maintenance, such a prognostic methodology will effectively increase the mean time between failure (MTBF) five fold.   Ridgetop focuses its prognostics approach on a commercial switch-mode power converter having a conversion efficiency of 92%, and employing a forward topology (variation of a common buck topology).    Ridgetop believes that the approach can be applied on power systems found in the JSF to help prevent catastrophic failures and increasing operational readiness",

        "abstract": "Impact Technologies, in cooperation with The Northrop Grumman Corporation and Harris Government Communications Systems (developer of electronic power supplies for the JSF), proposes to develop and demonstrate an on-board integrated diagnostic/prognostic system for assessing the remaining useful life of aircraft electronic system power supplies.  Implementation of the prognostic and health management (PHM) concept requires an ability to relate equipment health state information, including operational history and detection of incipient faults, to accurate remaining useful life predictions at any point in the system\u2019s life cycle. The dominant failure modes of switching mode power supplies were identified by a Pareto analysis in the Phase I program and will provide the prioritization of the approaches taken in this Phase II Program.   The Phase II program described herein will integrate collaborative diagnostic and prognostic techniques from engineering disciplines including statistical reliability modeling, damage accumulation models, physics of failure modeling, and sensor-based condition monitoring using automated reasoning algorithms. Novel features extracted from sensed parameters such as temperature, power quality, and load will be analyzed using advanced fault detection and damage accumulation algorithms. Using model-based assessments in the absence of fault indications, and updating the model-based assessments with sensed information when it becomes available provides health state awareness at any point in time.  Intelligent fusion of this diagnostic information with historical component reliability statistics will provide a robust health state awareness as the basis for accurate prognostic predictions. Complementary prognostic techniques including analysis of projected operating conditions by physics-based component aging models, empirical (trending) models, and system level failure progression models will be used to develop verifiable prognostic models. The Phase II program will emphasize accelerated failure testing of relevant switching mode power supplies made available from our partners. An IPT has been formed consisting of Impact, VEXTEC, Ridgetop, Northrop Grumman, Smiths, Harris and NG, that will work together and provide the \u201cbest of breed\u201d technologies that can be applied to JSF specific SMPS.",

        "abstract": "In most gas turbine engines, the blades are held in rotating disks by a dovetail attachment that fits into a matching slot in the rim of the disk.  The contact area between the blade dovetail and the dovetail slot is subjected to vibration and high stresses, leading to fretting conditions.  Eventually, fretting fatigue cracks initiate in the fretting area and propagate into the disk and/or dovetail slot.  Consequently, the disks are retired at a very conservative point in their service lives because of concerns about catastrophic fatigue failures.  The application of a soft metallic coating to the blade dovetails helps to decrease this problem, but recoating and eventual retirement disks for fretting damage remains a significant problem and incurs a high cost.  This program will build on a previous program to further develop the method to process inside hidden surfaces such as dovetail disk slots.  Two issues will be addressed.  The magnitude of the beneficial effect of laser peening with the laser system developed in this program to increase the fretting fatigue life associated with dovetail fretting will be evaluated.  Also, the method for laser peening the inside fretting surfaces of dovetail slots will be matured.  Lower equipment cost, ease-of-use reliability, and maintainability of hardware will be primary drivers.",

        "abstract": "The Short Take-Off Vertical Landing (STOVL) version of Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) employs a unique propulsion system utilizing a three bearing swivel duct (3-BSD) to direct the thrust of the engine exhaust.  The 3-BSD operates at high temperatures and incorporates large moving parts.  The life cycle of the 3-BSD depends directly upon the reliability of the lubricant used in the mechanical components.  This lubricant will greatly affect how well the 3-BSD will be able to perform during operation.  The 3-BSD requires a lubricant that can endure extreme temperatures and remain chemically stable with no performance degradation for the life of the three-bearing swivel duct, approximately 4,000 hours.  The lubricant must also allow easy movement of the 3-BSD throughout its full temperature operating range of roughly -40\u00b0F to +625\u00b0F.  Current lubricants being considered for use in the 3-BSD mechanical components can not maintain viscosity throughout the entire range of operation.  Under the Phase I program, METSS investigated the technical feasibility of developing new high temperature lubricants for the 3-BSD by evaluating a number of candidates for their antiwear properties, volatility, rust protection, thermal stability and corrosivity, and low temperature properties.  Under the proposed Phase II program, METSS will optimize the performance of these new materials with regard to these properties in order to develop an advanced lubricant capable of maintaining its properties throughout the wide range of operating temperatures through which the 3-BSD is required to operate.  The Phase II efforts will clearly define and support a viable path for technology commercialization and field implementation.",

There are clear advantages both operationally and environmentally to utilizing bioluminescent materials that can be lighter and do not leave behind non-biodegradable debris.  In Phase I, Agave BioSystems successfully demonstrated the use of bioluminescent technology in biodegradable packaging as a stable, easy to use and effective illumination system to replace current chemical and electrical systems.  To accomplish this, we genetically engineered the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce luciferase, an enzyme produced by fireflies which when combined with luciferin generates the well know light emission. In addition to successfully completing the originally proposed work, we expanded our genetic engineering for expression in two other organisms, the bacterium E. coli and the yeast Pichia Pastoris.  Furthermore, we were able to express not only the firefly luciferin (yellow-green) but also a blue and red emitting luciferin as well.  Having demonstrated the versatility and effectiveness of this technology, we are now ready to develop important applications in Phase II.",

We demonstrated its operation by switching the emissivity of a thermal control material incorporated into the calorimeter and verified the resulting change in equilibrium temperature with the calorimeter facing a blackbody in vacuum.

In a successful Phase I effort, PSI developed a THz wavelength Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) at 63.2 microns, corresponding to a strong fine-structure transition of atomic oxygen.  Using an external cavity design, we showed that the laser wavelength could be coarsely tuned to the atomic oxygen transition.  Rapid and repeatable injection current tuning at this wavelength was also demonstrated.  In the proposed Phase II program, the external cavity QCL design will be refined to include a wider continuous tuning range, higher laser operating temperature, and improved output power.  The laser operation will be automated and integrated into a computer-controlled atomic oxygen sensor, providing continuous, real-time measurements of atomic oxygen concentration with a sensitivity of 10^13 atoms per cubic centimeter in a 10 Hz bandwidth.  PSI will deliver, install, and test the sensor at the NASA Ames Aerodynamic Heating Facility, an arc-jet heated high-enthalpy flow facility.",

Integrated holographics harnesses the nanofabrication capability of state-of-the-art DUV photolithographic tools and planar waveguides to provide high performance and low cost devices for communications, optical signal processing, and spectral filtering/spectral target recognition.  Integrated holographics forms a powerful basis for uniquely photonic integrated circuits wherein signal streams freely overlap and intersect as they are transported and processed. Coarse multiplexer devices may prove disruptive to the commercial multiplexer market and uniquely provide upgrade paths of existing DoD avionics platforms through hybrid integration with lasers and detectors.  HBR multiplexers, optimized for DoD avionics solutions, may be configured to operate in single or multimode environments with the latter configuration supporting existing fiber infrastructure.  HBR multiplexers offer pathways to low cost replication which is vital in meeting emerging communication needs in data communications and access networks as well as in DoD networks.",

The proposal builds upon a successful Phase I effort that compared existing and produced new flow control tools, as well as the necessary measurement and analytical tools that led to a concept feasibility demonstration. The demonstration proved the possibility of forcing a turbulent flow and its associated optical distortion into a state that is more favorable for aero-optical management. The basic idea is that by forcing the large scale structure of turbulent flow into a predictable state we can develop an optimal procedure for mitigating aero-optical distortion; for example, with adaptive optics.  In Phase I we examined, compared, and demonstrated flow forcing concepts, as well as measurement tools for both the flow and wavefront sensing and propose to provide the best of these to the U.S. Air Force. During Phase II, specific tools will be refined, adapted and transferred to the USAF to provide a unique in-house capability to model, test and analyze the effectiveness of flow control in minimizing aero-optical degradation of wavefronts.",

As the range of torpedoes increases, the bandwidth of this link decreases, and the rate of data transmission drops.  The use of optical fiber cables in place of the conventional wire promises very significant increases in bandwidth and also a saving in space, since a single fiber can be used in place of the current 2 wires.  The need therefore is for a small diameter (0.030\u201d) lightweight, low cost optical fiber cable that is sufficiently durable and robust to withstand the stresses associated with torpedo launch and deployment.    We propose the use of a novel polymeric coating to produce a tight jacketed fiber optic cable, capable of sustaining loads of up to 30 lbs and with excellent moisture barrier properties.

Pure (proprietary) video extension is another essential function of modern visualization facilities. Hence we will also develop a digital extension technology that can be used where multi-mode fiber infrastructure has been previously deployed.",

The cost of conventional testing of air vehicles and ships continues to escalate in a world of tightening project budgets; therefore, the required flight testing time must be decreased by pursuing efforts which optimize the use of existing and future data and that support other approaches such as analytic models and wind tunnel tests. The proposed work will create an intelligent data retrieval and archiving tool which supports real and virtual testing of aircraft and rotorcraft aboard various classes of ships.  The tool will assist the T&E engineer in the development and implementation of test plans for the evaluation and certification of aircraft and rotorcraft both in and out of the vicinity of ships.  It will operate over a network allowing geographically dispersed test team members access during all test phases and will provide access to externally distributed data.

        "abstract": "The objective of this proposal is to develop a new and affordable resin that is curable and has a low viscosity at ambient temperature when used in the fabrication of fiberglass reinforced composite articles.  The article, a 48\u201dx48\u201dx0.25\u201d fiberglass fabric (24 ounces per square yard), will be subjected to a room corner test by the Navy as a proof of concept and validation of the superiority of the newly developed resin.    The Problem  Many have tried to accomplish the objective of developing an affordable, low viscosity resin that is curable at ambient temperature in the past.   Although Derakane\u00ae 510A, the workhorse of the industry, meets almost all the requirements at ambient temperature; it has a very short pot-life as well as a short time to ignition when subjected to flame.  The presence of styrene and other suspect carcinogens as well as the high heat release of the cured laminate make it unsuitable for the Navy\u2019s present and future usage.   The solution to this problem is clear, development of an affordable, lower viscosity, non-carcinogenic, non-toxic replacement for phenolic resins and halogenated vinyl esters, specifically Derakane\u00ae 510A must be achieved.  The composite panels produced from this new resin are expected to meet the time to ignition, low heat release and non-smoking requirements set forth by the Navy.  This resin will be superior to Derakane\u00ae 510A in physical, thermal and rheological properties, as well as flame and chemical resistance.  The Opportunity  It has been shown that a thermoset system based on bisphenol C when properly processed will meet and exceed most fire or flame resistance requirements.  However, there are associated processing limitations to the Cyanation of bisphenol C.",

Especially for aerospace applications, increased power generation with reduced size and weight is a continuous design objective that taxes life limiting components such as bearings, windings, diode assembles, and rectifiers in already harsh operating environments. Both time and money are lost as generator failures can lead to mission aborts and expensive, time-consuming maintenance procedures that affect overall fleet performance. To address this need, new technologies are required that permit continuous real-time monitoring of these generators to provide long-range forecasting of problems, preserve valuable hardware, improve safety of flight, extend time between maintenance, and increase vehicle autonomy. Luna Innovations proposes to develop an on-board generator health-management system that integrates data from fiber-optic sensors and supplemental data with a prognostic software architecture. This system will consist of two primary elements: a fiber-optic sensing system developed to measure critical indicators of failure in generators and health management software to fuse sensory information into a complete prognostic architecture that will ensure early damage detection, thereby learning of a problem when it is least costly to repair and before it becomes a threat to either crew safety or mission success.",

In the Phase I, JRM will design three key components: (1) an automated N-channel signature-predictive material classification algorithm, (2) a pixel-material spatial-correlation refinement algorithm and (3) an iterative context adjustment algorithm. The signature-predictive classifier will improve upon the current-art automated material DHR-fitting methods with phenomenology-based predictions of the at-aperture material spectral radiance that actually drive pixel intensity. This algorithm will use JRM's proven SigSim spectral signature prediction library, 0.2-25 um material property databases, improved fitting algorithms, and user-supplied sensor, environment and image-truth to produce likely pixel-material and mixture hypotheses and associated confidence metrics. The spatial-correlation refinement algorithm will reduce each pixel to a single, most-likely hypothesis with nearest-neighbor analysis methods. The iterative context adjuster will permit user re-finement under a different set of contexts. JRM will demonstrate feasibility of the Phase I designs in a proof-of-concept demonstration that produces a material-classified texture from an arbitrary photo-texture into a material-encoded texture, and simulating environmentally-dependent, radiometrically-correct OTW visual, NVG, FLIR and SAR outputs with it's VixSen real-time sensor simulation software from the resultant material-encoded texture.",

Our approach offers the singularly attractive characteristics that it does not require any targeting aids on the asset of interest; it can provide long-range rendezvous at potentially tens of kilometers in addition to close-range inspection; and its solid-state design (no moving parts), minimal size, mass and power, make it practical for micro-satellite platforms.  The proposed sensor also differs from similar 3-D approaches in that it is based on a commercially available unit that has a clear path to low cost production for commercial applications.  While Phase I focused on establishing feasibility, developing a methodology and preliminary algorithms for processing the range data, Phase II will involve the build and test of a prototype,  developing a toolbox of algorithms for processing the data, and addressing a path to space qualification.

Instead of cooling the vane, cooling air can interact with the hotpath flow to release heat near the vane surface, resulting in durability challenges and possibly catastrophic damage. In this SBIR, we propose to develop 3D CFD software that accurately predicts the effects of heat release and heat transfer into the vane. The software will utilize combustion Large Eddy Simulation (LES) methods. Key aspects to be modeled include: 1) mixing of cooling air into the hot gas flow, 2) heat release occurring near the vane surface, and 3) near wall velocity/thermal boundary layer and heat transfer to the vane. In Phase I, the overall feasibility of this approach was demonstrated and needed improvements in thermal boundary layer models for LES were identified.  In Phase II, the TBLE (Turbulent Boundary Layer Equation) model implemented in Phase I for velocity boundary layers will be expanded, and a new thermal boundary layer model will be development and implemented.  Detailed validation of all capabilities will take place using fundamental laboratory data, followed by more complex validation in realistic environments.  Analyses of JSF vanes will then be performed in cooperation with Rolls-Royce, and potential design improvements will be assessed.",

The process involves the passivation of carbon fiber to enable low cost processing of very high performance, low cost metal matrix composite components using low-pressure infiltration techniques.  The passivation layer on the surface of the fiber enables wetting of aluminum at low pressure, protection of the carbon from aluminum during infiltration and corrosion protection in service conditions.

        "abstract": "Tanner Research proposes to develop variable-sized thrusters packaged in digital-controlled arrays for high g applications in the ongoing development of exo-atmospheric hypervelocity projectiles (exo-HVP). Tanner\u2019s multifunctional thruster concept is designed to be extensible for near-term use with gun-launched proof-of-concept prototypes, and the emerging EM gun-launched exo-HVP devices.  The long-range exo-HVP must be reoriented at apogee into a nose-down attitude to achieve a smooth angle-of-attack for atmospheric reentry. A MEMS-based attitude control system (ACS) provides a low-cost methodology for embedding digital-controlled arrays of micro and macro-scale propulsion elements on an exo-HVP. MEMS fabricated devices have inherent gun-launch survivability at high g acceleration levels. Tanner\u2019s thrusters were initially developed as a DACS for exo-atmospheric use with the miniature kill vehicle (MKV), a ballistic missile defense system (BMDS) concept implemented in hardware.  Tanner\u2019s digital-controlled micro thrusters are now being implemented in \u00b5UAV surfaces for maneuver control of endo-atmospheric applications, and other precision-guided autonomous munitions applications.",

In Phase II several 3D displays, based on Phase I designs, will be produced.  The 3D display uses two liquid crystal display (LCD) panels stacked on top of one another.  On the first panel two stereo images are superposed.  The second panel encodes the two images in polarization.  Finally the viewer\u2019s polarized glasses decode the images to produce a stereoscopic view.    The 3D displays constructed in Phase II will be fully integrated.  A small custom electronics and image processing board will be developed in Phase II to take 2 video inputs and convert them to the drive signals for the two LCD panels.

        "abstract": "The IMLD program addresses the lack of an affordable missile launch detection system.  The IMLD will provide the host aircraft with protection against the MANPADS threat by providing missile detection with high probabilities of declaration and a low false alarm rate.  The IMLD technology is based on fusing an innovative motion detection algorithm called Passive Moving target Detection (PMTD) with two color sensor detection in the silicon band.  PMTD allows the sensor to distinguish the motion of small moving targets (missiles) relative to the background.  Using two color sensors allows for enhanced missile plume detection.  The focus of this program is to optimize the PMTD algorithm and integrate it with an existing developmental two color silicon detector resulting in a top-level warning system prototype design.  The PMTD algorithm has evolved via other research programs resulting in significant advances in reducing the computational complexity of the algorithm The silicon detector uses two sensors with custom optics that are optimized for accurate detection of the launched missile plume.  Because the silicon detectors and PMTD algorithm rely on different phenomenology, the expectation is that the correlation between false detections from each mechanism will be very low resulting in a low false alarm rate.",

Using a stronger epoxy matrix, the specific strength of the composite developed during Phase II could easily equal or surpass that of Al 2219.  During Phase II, radiation testing will be performed.

Unlike Geiger Mode detectors, the receiver can operate at 77K, without the limitations of afterpulsing, so that dark current can de reduced and bit errors rates reduced.

Presently, these systems are outfitted with monolithic carbon brushes that have a tendency to wear unevenly. Uneven brush wear and the large volume of brush wear debris produced results in the brushes mechanically sticking within the brush holder and fracturing while in service. Brush fracture then causes a loss of brush electrical contact with the contact ring and, left unchecked, can result in an electrical overload on the remaining brushes, ring overheating and finally, a Class \u201cC\u201d engine fire.  Every 250 flight hours, preventative maintenance is conducted that includes: hub removal, system cleaning, re-brushing, hub reinstallation and system retesting.

In addition we will produce protocols and reagents that are transferable to Investigational New Drug (IND) applications and FDA directed studies.

        "abstract": "Systems often fail because of unknown or unanticipated errors. Software/hardware components that can detect and correct errors would provide substantial cost savings and greatly enhance system reliability.  The first step in achieving this goal is to create a paradigm in which the system becomes more \u201caware\u201d of its operating performance characteristics and conditions that prompt intervention to prevent failure. The goal of SystemCritics is to provide this initial capability, with the additional long term goal of creating a system design tool and methodology that provides the means for developing a robust, adaptable, and error correcting system.  During the Phase I contract, we formulated a demonstrable system concept that allows the user to enter system information, model error conditions, specify repair strategies; generate tests to detect error conditions; and act to correct those error conditions. Our approach leveraged Rosetta, a Systems Level Design Language (SLDL), and VectorGen\u2122, ECI\u2019s test vector generator. Further, we analyzed scalability, the practicality of the Design for Critique style, and using VectorGen\u2122 with a system under operation. We concluded that the enhancements necessary to our toolset are feasible and within the scope of a Phase II SBIR project.",

        "abstract": "As the US Navy fleet reduces in size, the requirement for multiple capabilities on remaining ships is increasing. Combined with the requirement to reduce crew compliments, these capabilities are becoming unmanned, increasing the utilization of the ships, while allowing a safer distance from the threat. The use of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV), Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) and other vehicles such as the Remote Minehunting System (RMS) on surface combatant vessels is highly desirable. An Automated Launch and Recovery System (AutoLARS) for these vehicles and for other offboard vehicles is also highly desirable. This handling system would ideally be capable of handling multiple vehicles, requiring no manual intervention for operations, operation in high sea states, and maintaining practicality for a variety of different installations.    This Phase II proposal outlines our plan to further the AutoLARS design, build and test a scale AutoLARS model, investigate COTS components for use in AutoLARS production and produce weight, cost and shipalt estimates for the AutoLARS. The AutoLARS concept is a viable solution to the US Navy\u2019s current requirements for automated handling of unmanned vehicles. This system combines off the shelf components (telescopic knuckle boom crane, constant tension winch) and applies new and existing technology and specially designed components (automated tracking device, capture mechanism, crane end effector, tow boom). This combination of off the shelf and specially designed components allows for a high level of automation with proven launch and recovery principles learned from experience.",

The framework architecture will be designed so that it can be adapted and extended for application to other VxO's. 2) Develop a metadata/data access toolkit that enables visualization and data analysis clients to browse VxO resources directly and retrieve discovered data from the source (PI) archive and demonstrate the capability through extensions to the VSPO Gateway API using VisBARD. 3) Support the creation, validation, and maintenance of product description metadata for VxO's through simplified metadata management tools whose configuration is driven by the same XML Schema that defines the VxO's data model. The tools include a configurable metadata editor backed by a central repository and XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) utility scripts. The XSLT scripts enable generation of the tool configuration schema from a master XML Schema, output of product metadata that complies with the VxO data model, and partially automate the update process for product description metadata as the VxO and SPASE data models evolve.",

The proposed Correlated Noise Calibration Standard (CNCS) is able to generate pairs of broad bandwidth stochastic noise signals with a wide variety of statistical properties. The CNCS can be used with synthetic aperture interferometers to generate specific visibility functions. It can be used with fully polarimetric radiometers to generate specific 3rd and 4th Stokes parameters of brightness temperature. It can also be used with spectrometers to generate specific power spectra and autocorrelations. It is possible to combine these features and, for example, generate the pair of signals that would be measured by a fully polarimetric, spectrally resolving, synthetic aperture radiometer at a particular pair of polarizations and antenna baselines for a specified scene over a specified frequency band.  The proposed CNCS will cover all the frequencies used for radiometric observations in the 1 to 40 GHz range. In specific, the Phase II project will develop the system prototypes for L and X bands.

SSVDTMs merge solid state semiconductor technology, including process fabrication techniques, with vacuum electronics, and, in this case, specifically thermionic vacuum electronics. SSVDTMs have already been demonstrated for highly demanding high frequency applications. Thermionic SSVDTMs, in which vacuum transport is by thermionically emitted electrons, are especially promising due to their intrinsic internal high temperature operation and radiation hardness.  SSVDTMs are extremely well suited for extreme environments that, for example, exist on or near Venus.  InnoSys proposed and successfully demonstrated in Phase I of this SBIR project SSVDTM triodes/field effect transistors and the associated assembly and sealing to meet the requirements needed for extreme high temperature electronics.  In particular, SSVDTM electronics were successfully experimentally demonstrated fully operational at 500C. In addition, radiation insensitive SSVDTM electronics were also successfully experimentally demonstrated during Phase I of this SBIR project.  Small scale extreme temperature, radiation insensitive SSVDTM integrated circuits (ICs) will be developed during Phase II of this SBIR project.

Current analytical prediction methods often over estimate or under estimate the failure load by 25% or more.

A relatively new failure theory for composites, the Strain Invariant Failure Theory (SIFT), is proving to be far more accurate at predicting failure.  SIFT in conjunction with a robust finite element analysis (FEA) tool offer an efficient method aimed at streamlining the design certification process for laminated composite structures.

For more complex digital or hybrid modulation schemes, passive modulator components may also need elaborate calibration look-up tables to achieve desired phase and amplitude modulation accuracy with respect to process and temperature variations.

We will develop the algorithms using the SLAMEM testbed which is currently in use at AFRL and Joint Forces Command where it is serving as a testbed for the development and demonstration of fusion algorithms. At the end of Phase II, we will demonstrate the algorithms using SLAMEM or another testbed designated by AFRL.",

The metrology accuracy goals, supported by previous measurements, are 1 nanometer rms for full aperture figure, and 0.1 nm rms for mid-frequency and micro-roughness.  The full-aperture and mid-frequency metrology approaches are based on previous successful SBIR projects, while the micro-roughness metrology is an improvement on standard Total Integrated Scatter measurements developed under Phase I.  All of the metrology instrumentation is integrated into a single measurement head.

Class discovery techniques explored in Phase I can generate a library of biomarkers for a number of toxic agents and exposures levels. The focus in Phase II will be on the development of class prediction and interpretation techniques that, based on a short list of biomarkers, can: 1) determine exposure vs. non-exposure; 2) identify the toxic agent; 3) determine the exposure level. The classification framework will make joint use of biomarkers derived from genomic, proteomic, and metabonomic profiles. The introduction of powerful literature mining techniques adds another dimension, by reinforcing experimental design with an interpretation layer. The benefits of text mining are two fold. In the short term, it can provide instantaneous feedback by linking highly correlated gene expression measures to known patterns of interactions. In the long term, it has the potential to relate groups of biomarkers to actual networks and mechanisms of action for a more reliable understanding of toxicogenomic fingerprints.",

One of the most important aspects of the design involves devising a system for effectively dispensing the payload from inside the round to create a uniform penetrator pattern over a large footprint.  Additionally, they must be dispersed at a high-velocity in a controlled manner to ensure maximum penetration and lethality.  An existing round, the MK-182 Kinetic-Energy Electronic-Timed round, dispenses tungsten alloy BBs out the rear of the projectile at a velocity of 150 ft/sec.  The objective of the proposed Phase II effort is to develop a system that will deploy the non-energetic payload in the forward direction rather than the rearward direction.  In so doing, the payload kinetic energy can be increased by 2-5 times, thereby substantially increasing the lethality of the round.  The specific objectives of the Phase II effort are to refine the Phase I design to maximize the forward payload expulsion velocity and improve the penetrator dispersion characteristics.  The development effort will focus on component development and integration with a full-scale functional demonstration at the conclusion of the Phase II program.",

This system uses a thermal radiator, a solar PV array, and a vapor compression refrigeration device.  Such a system significantly reduces total system mass as compared to an all radiator cooling architecture.  Since the start of initial prototype testing in the mid 1990s, several refrigeration systems have been proposed, studied, built, and tested.  The basic goal of each system has been to achieve the highest possible efficiency at the optimal system lift.  Most notably, a two-stage refrigeration system and an expander turbine for a single-stage system were developed.  Both sought to eliminate or recover the energy loss associated with irreversible expansion at the throttling valve, but both fell short of efficiency targets.  Then, Paragon proposed a novel refrigeration architecture that was successfully demonstrated during the Phase I period.  This system can achieve, in theory, near Carnot efficiency limits and does so in a practical and achievable way.  Not only can this technology provide significantly improved performance (reduced weight) for NASA's Lunar habitat cooling application, but it has excellent potential as a commercial product.",

Two proposed NASA missions will require anticoincidence shielding for gamma-ray spectrometers: the Mars Lander and a Space Science Vision Mission expected to visit Titan, one of Saturn's moons. Shielding improves the performance of gamma-ray spectrometers by reducing the effect of charged particle interactions which can not be distinguished from true gamma-ray interactions by the spectrometer. Active shields produce a blanking signal when a charged particle is detected, so that the signal from the spectrometer can be ignored during the spectrometer's charged-particle interaction. While it is well know that this technique produces significant improvement in gamma-ray spectrometer performance, the technology to implement it is lacking. The attributes of mercuric iodide make it an excellent candidate for anticoincidence shielding detectors. Because of its detection characteristics, light weight, small size, low cost, robustness, and ease of application to non-planar geometries, this material can replace the costly, heavy, and bulky scintillator/photomultiplier tube (PMT) systems currently in use. The application of this new material for space-based astrophysical observations provides excellent background suppression with improved mass and volume characteristics.",

It will be used in robotic inspection of spacecraft on-orbit, making re-entry safer for manned spacecraft. It will also improve the safety of air travel by producing a new type of aircraft altimeter which will tell the pilot the true position of the aircraft above the ground.  A vehicle (aircraft, spacecraft, satellite, planetary rover or submersible) is sent forth with an internal digital map of the topography of an area to explore. As exploration proceeds sensors (video cameras for example) on the explorer will collect data as always, but now the SmartTopo software will process the data and update the original digital map data in real time, resulting in a higher resolution topographic model of the surface that it has surveyed.

One such detector will be optimized for the 0.9 to 1.7 micron band for use with 1.55 micron eye-safe lasers, and another will be optimized for the 0.9 to 1.1 micron band for use with neodymium lasers.  By optimizing the bandgap of the InGaAsP APD for operation near 1 micron, we expect to obtain much higher QE than commercial silicon APDs simultaneously with dark count rates comparable to those of commercial silicon photon counters.\n\nThe entire system will be packaged in a compact and rugged modular unit requiring only 110 VAC power and passive ambient air cooling.  An entirely solid-state miniature refrigeration system based upon the system developed in Phase I will enable operation of the APD detectors at temperatures below 200 K without the need for cryogenic liquids or external liquid chillers.

The hydrophobic aerogel beads have excellent compression strength, resisting thermal cycling and mechanical loads without breaking or settling.  Investigations of the thermal performance of hybrid aerogel beads by nitrogen boil-off tests and the mechanical strength by compression tests have shown that carbon-opacified PMMA beads of diameter below 1 mm outperform perlite to the greatest extent.  The Phase II work will continue with PMMA systems to optimize the formula and to determine the processing conditions required for controlling bead size distribution and achieving the desired thermal and mechanical performance characteristics.

        "abstract": "The product of the Phase II effort will be a Multi-Use Non-Intrusive Flow Characterization System (FCS) for densified, normal boiling point, and two-phase cryogenic flows, capable of accurately measuring several fluid parameters in real-time.  Cryogenic fluids are ubiquitous in the aerospace industry; however, adequate flow instrumentation to support terrestrial, in-space, and planetary operations is currently unavailable.  FCS was originated to address this issue and greatly enhance the quantification, reliability, and safety of propulsion test operations, as well as reduce operational expenses.  FCS will also play a significant role in initiatives for the exploration of the Moon and Mars through supporting the design, development, and operation of gravity-dependant processes.  FCS handles both transient and steady state flows, and can operate in the following five modes: (1) on-line analysis of fluid mixtures; (2) mass flow rate measurement; (3) temperature measurement; (4) fluid conditioning and health monitoring; and (5) model validation for a cryogenic or non-cryogenic fluid flow.  The Phase II effort will develop an FCS system that has broad application throughout NASA and the rest of the aerospace community.  A fully functional FCS system will be delivered to NASA/SSC upon completion of the program for use in the E1 or other facility.",

Instruments for these missions are severely constrained by size and mass considerations, and any technology that allows a reduction of size and/or mass without reducing image quality would contribute significantly to NASA's ongoing instrumentation development.\n\nAngular resolution is a function of the grid-pitch and distance between grids in a bi-grid collimator. Consequently, this advance in technology will have a significant effect on the angular resolution and/or instrument length and mass of grid-based optics required for x-ray and gamma-ray imaging in space. In Phase I, MSI demonstrated the technical feasibility of producing collimator grids with pitch as fine as 16 microns.",

The Aerosonde Corporation has agreed to commit technical consulting and materials to support the Phase II effort.  The Micro-CPI will measure the size distributions of both water and ice particles.

Low power, TID and SEU resistant and high bandwidth upgradeable communication between computer nodes are of utmost importance for future NASA missions.

The high power consumption of the SFs limit their application in the next generation of nano-satellites. In order to minimize latency and reduce power consumption, we propose a novel, robust, radiation tolerant and easy-to-align SF based on a multi-level power efficient Low Voltage Differential Signal interface. Our approach uses differential multilevel signals to mark a reference high-level bit position in one of the differential channels. Because the marked pilots will follow the high logic level in one of the differential outputs, they will regularly occur at the same bit position and ensure stable and easy recovery of the low-speed clock signal, which will be used as a reference for multi-channel data alignment and will synchronize high speed clocking circuitry using a standard clock multiplier technique.",

For ATR algorithms to robustly recognize targets while retaining low false alarm rates, they must be able to identify the conditions under which they are operating and tune their parameters on the fly. In this proposal, we present a method for tuning the parameters of a model-based ATR algorithm using estimates of the current OC. The problem has two components: 1) identifying the current OCs and 2) using that information to tune parameters to improve performance. In Phase I, we demonstrated feasibility of using reinforcement learning techniques for parameter adaptation. We first define a set of valid states describing the world (the OCs of interest, such as the expected level of obscuration). Next, ATR parameter settings for that state are learned using an off-line reinforcement learning feedback loop. The result is a lookup table to select optimal parameter settings for each OC. In Phase II, we will also develop an OC detection method using Bayesian belief networks and self-organized clustering, and a continuous alternative to state look-up tables using function approximation.",

Multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) algorithms maintain alternative data associations to represent report-to-track association ambiguities.  In Phase 1 we developed a prototype MHT algorithm not requiring the Bayes\u2019 posterior distribution for the target state to be Gaussian. State estimation is accomplished using the deformation method, a form of particle filtering (sequential Monte Carlo state estimation) that requires neither hypothesis pruning nor hypothesis regeneration.  The deformation method transforms existing target state estimates into samples that closely approximate draws from the Bayes\u2019 posterior distribution for the target state.  Data association is treated as an assignment problem and is solved using the Munkres algorithm.  The smooth deformation of the continuous target state variables is through the action of a stochastic differential equation.  The discontinuous deformation of the discrete target state variables is through the application of the Metropolis algorithm. In Phase 2 we will incorporate the processing of target signature information from high range resolution (HRR) data.  We also will model the effects of terrain on vehicle motion and observability.

Some of these  factors include the relatively poor angular accuracy of  GMTI sensors, the presence of persistent clutter and target  obscuration, and the complexity of target maneuvers.  Because these difficulties can lead to a multimodal  posterior density, a Bayesian filtering solution is more appropriate than a point estimate.  Recently, the particle filter has emerged as a  Bayesian inference technique that is both powerful and  simple to implement. In Phase I, we established both the feasibility and necessity of using multiple-target  particle filters when two or more tracks are linked through  measurement contention.

        "abstract": "Significant emphasis has been placed on aircraft fuel tank safety following the TWA Flight 800 accident in July 1996.  Upon investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the explosion of the center wing tank (CWT) resulted most likely from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture.  The growing concern of aircraft fuel tank safety has taken an added dimension in the post 9/11 world where both commercial and military aircrafts are vulnerable to terrorist attacks utilizing MANPADS (MAN-Portable Air Defense Systems), explosives in shoe/socks, and small arms fire.  Fuel tanks also need protection from explosions caused by ballistic impact, lightning, and other sources of ignition.  In Phase I,  InnoSense LLC has demonstrated the feasibility of an all-optical oxygen sensor capable of detecting oxygen at 40,000 feet elevation down to the ambient level.  This Phase II proposal discusses how InnoSense LLC would develop a prototype and perform field testing. The project team possesses seventy person-years of optical sensor related hardware and software expertise.  InnoSense has attracted $300,000 in Phase III follow-on funding for further engineering.  Innosense will deliver the prototype to NASA, complete with software, manuals, and schematics.",

        "abstract": "Precision Combustion, Inc. (PCI), utilizing patented Microlith\u00ae substrates, has demonstrated small, modular reactors for reforming liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon fuels at exceptionally high power densities. During Phase I, in addition to demonstrating efficient JP-8 and Diesel reforming capability, PCI successfully integrated the fuel injection, mixing and vaporization within the catalytic reactor by taking advantage of the Microlith technology\u2019s ability to impede soot formation, its diffusive capabilities to boost mixing, and its high surface area to augment vaporization, resulting in a Microlith Reactor for Gasification and Reforming (MRGR). The size of the 10-kWe ATR was 6in3 (0.1l). The catalyst was successfully tested in dry and wet mode, with multiple fuels, and was fully operational in 1 minute. The MRGR was shown to be sulfur tolerant and coke resistant for the test duration.  During Phase II, PCI is proposing to develop and demonstrate a standalone, 5-kWe prototype reformer operating on low-sulfur diesel. The MRGR reformate will be tested with a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell to advance toward a \u201clogistic-fuel to electrons\u201d device. A model for the entire APU will be developed.  Additionally, it is capable of meeting multi-service needs, and a Navy-ONR Option has been added to deliver a 50 kWe MRGR.",

The Phase I Option adds a tilt-rotor design to the list of vehicle types. Also, as a result of experience gained in Phase I, other objectives of Phase II include improvements in task and pilot model configuration management, and visualization of results.

In Phase I we proved the feasibility of the concept and demonstrated the ability of the panel to operate at high temperature.

Thus, this timely proposal can fulfill the need of the multifunctional binder based products that have a required thermal shock, thermal cycling performance and potential to improve the affordability.  The proposed efforts will generate needed validation data to generate the confidence in the developed products and will carry out needed optimization of the proposed products.  It will also provide needed input to Phase III opportunities to the mission officials from JIMO, ISS and to the various officials of DoD and NRO on the issues, where the next generation materials can make a significant difference.",

Existing commercial OCT tools are focused in ophthalmology, where examination is external to the eye, the size of the probe is not important, and cellular level resolution is not required.  The patent-pending 3D OCT will provide three-dimensional imaging in scattering media with improved resolution, depth of field, and minimal mechanical adjustment.  The proposed approach is based on novel probe designs, original coherence scanning, and advanced signal processing.  The flexible imaging probe will have dramatically reduced cross-section, compared to the existing systems, enabling the first \"3D camera through a needle\" for functional imagery, including in-vivo histological examination.  Phase I has demonstrated the proof of concept by theoretical studies and implementation of a limited experimental prototype.  First generation packaged prototype will be developed in Phase II of the project and delivered to NASA Glenn Research Center for evaluation and field tests.

        "abstract": "Icing environments are of great concern in commercial and military aviation. An aircraft-based, imaging probe is being proposed for the reliable and accurate measurement of liquid water content (LWC) and droplet size distributions in environments variously referred to as freezing rain, freezing drizzle, supercooled drizzle drops, and supercooled large drops (SLD). The innovative aspect of the proposed probe is the use of multiple laser beams (of differing wavelengths) to create high quality shadows of individual particles (droplets and ice crystals) on a 2-d CCD array. Conventional aircraft-based probes such as the OAP suffer from measurement uncertainties arising from the detection of droplets that are out-of-focus. The use of multiple intersecting laser beams will also minimize the background noise created by other particles that may be present along the laser beam path but outside of the measurement volume. Finally, the incorporation of a means for differentiating between ice-crystals and droplets, while counting and measuring both, allows computation of water content in both liquid and solid phases. These innovations, and the other features of the probe to be discussed later, directly address the need for aircraft-based icing monitoring systems that NASA has identified in topic A1.02 of the 2003 SBIR solicitation. The Phase I study has clearly demonstrated the feasibility of the probe. A prototype system will be developed in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Why are rugged, low temperature actuator materials important? By themselves, they are useless; however, when fabricated into thin films and integrated into optical devices that require movement of optical surfaces for functionality, they extend the device operational envelope into temperature and environmental extremes not previously accessible. The actuator media also serves as a compliant adhesive that holds optical surfaces to rigid mechanical supports and allows optical devices to survive extremely low temperatures and harsh vibration environments such as vehicle launch without producing deleterious high voltage. Our actuator technology enables tunable optical devices without a media like liquid crystals in the optical path. Consequently, our optical devices will have superior optical performance limited only by the quality of the optical coatings and substrate surfaces. Several areas will be advanced by this new low-temperature actuator technology. High-resolution tunable optical filters such as Fabry-Perot optical filters are needed in direct-detection LIDAR applications to spectrally resolve the back scattered radiation broadened by temperature and Doppler-shifted by atmospheric winds. When used in imaging spectrometers, the ability to cool the narrowband optical filter and retain etalon plate motion will allow greater instrumental sensitivity to resolving trace ChemBio species.

Niobium alloys offer a good combination of temperature capability, density, and cost, while the silicide coating has been successful in providing moderate oxidation resistance and use temperature. However, for many current applications the silicide coating is now proving to be the limiting factor in achieving the required chamber performance and/or lifetime, and the chamber manufacturing cost is excessive. NASA is seeking advanced bipropellant propulsion systems for Earth science spacecraft and space exploration vehicles, while DoD is seeking economical and high-performance bipropellant thrusters for liquid divert and attitude control systems in kinetic energy kill vehicles for ballistic missile defense (a high-volume application). These goals cannot be achieved using standard silicided C103 chambers. In this project, Ultramet proposes to develop and demonstrate a combustion chamber with substantially improved manufacturability, cost, and performance. In Phase I, Ultramet successfully demonstrated both improved chamber manufacturing and a more robust and higher performance oxidation-resistant coating as a replacement for the silicide. This was accomplished through a unique manufacturing process involving low temperature spray deposition of C103 on removable plastic mandrels produced by rapid prototyping. Thin vapor-deposited platinum coatings were shown to substantially improve oxidation resistance relative to the standard silicide coating. In Phase II, Ultramet will expand upon the Phase I results by performing a comprehensive optimization of the combustion chamber processing including mandrel development, cold-spray material/process optimization, and oxidation-resistant coating optimization. Performance will then be demonstrated through hot-fire testing.",

UWB radios are very suitable to the above needs because it can be made to be very low power, low-cost, compact, and lightweight. Furthermore, UWB transceivers for relative navigation will have wide field-of-view compared to optical or image based sensors. Another benefit of UWB is that can co-exist with other radio equipment used by the spacecraft without causing co-site interferences or being interfered by other radio transmission. UWB radios have been demonstrated to be able to perform high-speed communication and good ranging rate separately, but the data rate or the ranging update rate will be greatly compromised if one wants to perform UWB communication and tracking simultaneously.

        "abstract": "Future NASA planetary and astrophysics missions will require various enhancements in multi-stage cryocoolers.  These include increased efficiency, reduced vibration and reductions in overall system mass and power consumption.  For the small coolers required, pulse tube and Stirling coolers offer the best opportunities.  At present, the efficiency of these coolers is limited by the effectiveness of low-temperature-stage regenerators.  Below about 60 K, two factors play key roles in reducing the effectiveness of regenerators.  One is that the heat capacity of most materials falls rapidly with decreasing temperature, thereby, severely limiting the number of useful materials to a few in common use.  A second factor is that these commonly used materials are only available in powder form, a form known to raise reliability issues.  In this effort, we will address both factors.  We will use newly developed materials with high heat capacities at temperatures below 60 K, higher than that of commonly used materials.  Further, we will develop a novel low-temperature regenerator matrix that will address both the aspect of high-efficiency and regenerator durability.  Both the void fraction and the ratio of surface area to solid fraction of the regenerator matrix will be varied to achieve high efficiency.",

The first-of-a-kind nature of such systems and the range of unpredictable events they are likely to be confronted with raises considerable design issues. To address this challenge we propose the development of an environment for Evolvable Work-practice Interfaces between Humans and Agents, which adapts activity theory to the situated nature of action. During Phase I we have developed a scenario for modeling interactions with Advanced Life Support Systems, we have modeled the associated human activities, and criteria through which activities and actions are employed. The experiments conducted using the BRAHMS work-practice simulation environment have demonstrated the feasibility of the approach and its potential to generate and capture critical interaction cases.\nDuring Phase II we will expand our scenario to include additional potential challenges, we will expand our model for describing work activities and work practices, and the way they operate during human system interaction. We also propose to expand the simulation capabilities of the BRAHMS environment to increase the insight of experimenters into their simulations, and we will provide criteria for evaluating the soundness and performance of the proposed model and implementations.",

These materials have the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of large aerospace structures, because they allow processing without resorting to hugely expensive autoclaves.

        "abstract": "Ballutes, or inflatable decelerators, offer significant advantages over rigid shells for aerocapture of planetary spacecraft and for earth reentry of cargo by providing mass savings and simplified packaging features. Traditional ballutes, however, have provided little or no trajectory control. For new platform functionality, high drag must be accompanied by some degree of control; also, incorporating thermal protection into the design provides additional weight savings. Ballutes are typically designed to create a low ballistic coefficient, reducing heating rates. However, a low ballistic coefficient also makes them inherently susceptible to insertion trajectory errors, atmospheric density variations, and winds. The use of a variable drag design allows for in-flight adjustment of ballistic coefficient. This significantly lowers downrange dispersions, resulting in a higher reliability recovery system. The specific innovation proposed is the design of a forward-attached, variable drag ballute for atmospheric entry. To demonstrate dispersion control in a forward-mounted ballute, Andrews proposes two flight tests of a subscale, pressure-supported, symmetric ballute that modulates drag by internal pressure control. The experiments are designed to demonstrate the ability to actively vary drag and prove transonic stability while avoiding an aeroheating environment requiring specialized thermal materials.",

In particular they must be able to withstand flexing at liquid nitrogen temperatures (77K) without developing pinhole gas leaks. To meet this requirement, it was proposed that a multiple layer laminate of thin PET films would be better than an equivalent thickness single layer of the same film.\n\nIn the Phase I work, some of the laminating variables were studied. Through this effort, significant improvements in the material for Titan aerobot use were realized. The cold temperature flex durability against pinhole failure was increase by 70% due to changes in the weave counts of the fabric. Tests also demonstrated that a 50% reduction could be made in the adhesive weight used to laminate the films without sacrificing bond or flex durability.\n\nThis Phase II proposal is for continued development of the Titan aerobot envelope material based on the results of Phase I.

Current trace contaminant control (TCC) systems for removal of trace contaminant gases from cabin air are based on activated carbon filters and high temperature catalytic oxidation (HTCO). However, HTCO suffers from poisoning, and activated carbon suffers from absorbent saturation, which leads to off gassing. It also generates a secondary waste stream and becomes a microorganism breeding ground. During the Phase I effort, a bench scale TCC system utilizing a nanoparticulate photocatalytic filter was fabricated. Testing performed successfully demonstrated the technology feasibility for eliminating airborne chemicals and microorganisms. Preliminary equivalent system mass analysis shows the system efficacy and applicability to space missions. During the Phase II, a scaled-up, fully operational, flight qualifiable, microgravity compatible breadboard will be developed, tested with chemicals known to be present in International Space Station (ISS) cabin air, and delivered to NASA. Benefits of this reagentless approach are its low cost, low maintenance, reliability, longevity, size, performance, and elimination of a secondary waste stream.

Importantly, Tm3+ can be highly doped into germanate glasses, which results in so called cross-relaxation, dramatically improving the quantum efficiency. We will develop double-clad single mode germanate glass fibers with greater than 6wt% Tm3+ concentration to take full advantages of this Tm3+ cross-relaxation process, developing highly efficient fiber lasers at 2-micron.

On the Moon, similar chemistry is applied with emphasis on oxygen production. \n\nMost lunar LOx processes only reduce FeO, which is generally present at just 10 to 15 percent in soils.

        "abstract": "Aviation and Air Traffic Management researchers are increasingly utilizing complex regional or NAS-wide simulations to evaluate future concepts.  These analyses require many thousands of flights (a flight schedule) that are each accurately defined for every stage of the flight (a flight plan).  Current methods of generating these huge input datasets are costly and time-intensive. The largely manual nature of the current process and lack of existing automation tools leaves great potential for significant errors in the data sets.  We propose to develop a powerful automated system for future demand generation. This tool will be able to input a variety of existing FAA and NASA flight data sets, provide the user with extensive options on defining the future demand data set, and output new flight data sets in formats compatible with major research simulation and analysis tools.  This capability will provide NASA and FAA research programs with significantly better analysis conclusions through the new ability to perform extensive sensitivity studies on new concepts to ensure they are robust to alternate potential future demand scenarios.  This is crucial to ensuring the decision to proceed with a multi-million dollar Decision Support Tool development is robust to alternate future demand possibilities.",

        "abstract": "Trace contamination of the International Space Station (ISS) by formaldehyde -- a known carcinogen -- is a significant threat to crew health. The spacecraft maximum allowable concentration (SMAC) in air is only 40 parts per billion and ambient concentrations appear to be increasing as formaldehyde outgasses from a variety of plastic components. Monitoring formaldehyde levels is difficult because few analytical methods can achieve sufficient sensitivity from instrumentation that can be adapted for space-based operation. The current detection method -- using absorbent \"badges\" -- relies on post-flight analysis of the adsorbent material. Some of those measurements show formaldehyde concentrations close to the SMAC upper bound. As a result, a need exists for a reliable, fully automated analyzer that can provide continuous monitoring of formaldehyde concentrations on board the ISS. The target detection sensitivity is 10 ppb and the response time should be < 10 minutes. Southwest Sciences proposes the development of an optical analyzer for formaldehyde that is expected to meet the requirements of space-based operation. The instrument will be compact, light weight, require little electrical power and no consumables, and will be able to operate for extended periods (months to years) without maintenance or re-calibration.",

If a deterioration of the state of awareness of an individual can be detected before that individual's performance is affected, serious accidents or lapses in operator performance could be avoided.

Based on these successful Phase I results, Phase II will miniaturize the system size to a wearable format, and optimize the system performance.

A second objective is to develop an innovative method of control for deployable aerocapture decelerators employing shape-morphing lift modulation.  Aerocapture is strongly enhancing for planetary exploration because the decelerator mass is less than the fuel mass needed for the same delta-V, and therefore results in a higher payload fraction in orbit.  Inflatable drag devices are a promising type of aerocapture decelerator because (1) they are lighter than conventional fixed-geometry aeroshells, and (2) they can be much larger than the interior of a launch fairing and thus enable heavier spacecraft.  This aerocapture technology also applies to supersonic decelerators for Entry, Descent and Landing Systems (EDLS) and to other systems requiring supersonic deceleration and stabilization.  Trajectory control by shape-morphing lift modulation also enhances EDLS as part of precision guided landing capability.

An innovative Runge-Kutta temporal update was developed to advance all grid levels independently. The feasibility and accuracy of the MRES technology was demonstrated by predicting noise sources and acoustic waves generated by vortex shedding. The Phase I results indicate that the proposed technology will provide up to two orders-of-magnitude reductions in CPU time over existing techniques.\n\nIn Phase II, we propose to improve the 3D MRES software to handle multi-block, curvilinear, viscous and massively parallel applications.

The algorithms estimate the number of Tactical Tomahawk missiles that are required for a region of conflict, coordinate the actions of multiple missiles, and determine Pareto-optimal loiter paths.  These algorithms perform in near-real time.  The proposed Phase-II prototype software application is called the Tactical Tomahawk Interface for Monitoring and Retargeting, with Loiter planning functionality (TTIMR+L).",

        "abstract": "The development and performance evaluation of new carbon/carbon (C/C) and carbon/silicon-carbide (SiC) composite structural components has been hampered by the lack of reliable strain sensors that can survive up to the exceedingly high temperatures (3000 F) up to which these materials must be tested. Existing off-the-shelf high-temperature strain sensors, including free filament electrical strain gages and optical fiber based strain sensors, currently do not have the necessary performance characteristics to tackle the next generation of C/C and SiC composite material testing programs. Free filament electrical strain gages cannot be used reliably over 1800 F (1000 C) and conventional optical fiber strain sensors with the appropriate protective metal coatings can operate reliably only up to close to the melting point of the silica (2000 F/1100 C). To meet the growing needs for strain sensors that can withstand future high temperature testing regimes, Lambda Instruments, Inc. proposes to develop sapphire optical fiber sensors. The 3600 F (1987 C) melting temperature of optical quality sapphire fibers, their low profile geometry, and the inherent immunity of optical fiber sensors to electromagnetic interference make sapphire fiber-based sensors particularly well suited for the proposed application.",

A program is proposed to sufficiently develop a vehicle-specific design to address how a thermal bus would be integrated with a vehicle and show the vehicle level benefits (reduced weight, improved thermal control, increased device reliability and life expectancy), and to demonstrate this technology with a test on a functioning hardware mock-up.

        "abstract": "Harmonia, Inc. proposes an innovative approach to modernize and integrate new HCIs into legacy software.  The approach centers on a software design tool called Computer-Assisted Design-Human/Computer Interface (CAD-HCI) that supports an enhanced, user-centered, UIML-based user interface design process.  The enhanced process uses the best available model-based techniques to generate HCIs.  It starts with a user task model and each subsequent model progressively adds detail to the design.  The approach uses XML representations of task models, abstract HCIs, concrete HCIs, target platforms, and legacy code application programming interfaces (APIs) to improve traceability through the process and increase portability of design artifacts.  CAD-HCI automates transitions between models by allowing the HCI designer to manage and establish mappings between these XML representations.  The approach will span the gap between usability and object-oriented software engineering by supporting rapid prototyping of user interfaces for usability engineering and derivation of tactical HCI code for deployment.",

The sensors incorporate molecular recognition and fluorescent reporter molecules that are chosen to uniquely detect classes of biological material such as bacteria, spores, toxins and viruses.  ETI has recently completed a Phase I program that demonstrated the feasibility of using large, globular polymer molecules, known as dendrimers, to enhance sensor performance.  The Phase I results were promising with the following accomplishments:  \u2022 > 4-fold increase in sensor operational lifetime under various conditions  \u2022 > 2-fold increase in sensor storage stability  \u2022 extension of the technology to sensors for monitoring waterborne agents.    In Phase II the dendrimer-enhanced biosensors will be more fully characterized and the approach extended to biosensors for other BWAs.  The fundamental mechanism responsible for this enhanced performance will be studied to allow rational selection or design of optimum dendrimer molecules for use with the sensors.

        "abstract": "With the current tight monetary constraints placed on the US military there is a continuous need to reduce the cost of ownership of the Army ground vehicles. The consideration of uncertainty and design optimization is critical for designing high-performance, reliable, cost-effective Army combat vehicles. The proposed work develops an adequate computational tool for accurately performing military vehicle reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) using large-scale finite element models in distributed computing environments. To approach vigorously the RBDO problem for the Army vehicles, GP Technologies has teamed with University of Iowa CCAD and University of California at Berkeley. Under this project a new, powerful computational stochastic mechanics technology is developed and then is integrated with the RBDO software developed by University of Iowa CCAD. The proposed computational stochastic finite element technology includes two key components: (i) an accurate stochastic approximation of highly complex physical behavior using high-order stochastic field models and (ii) a fast physics-based stochastic simulation using a parallel multigrid solver for unstructured mesh problems. The new computational stochastic tools will be demonstrated on critical components of the Army High-Mobility Trailer and the Stryker.  The resulted RBDO technologies will enable TACOM to design more cost-effective high-performance, durable & affordable military vehicles.",

Logistic fuels are a desirable fuel choice for military based fuel cell applications.  However, distillate fuels must be processed to a fuel useable by the fuel cell.  Diesel fuels have high sulfur levels (0.5 \u2013 1.0 wt%), and sulfur deactivates catalysts used for hydrogen generation as well as fuel cell electrode catalysts.  It is also a toxic emission into the environment.  Sulfur is removed from diesel fuels using hydrodesulfurization followed by adsorption.  ZnO based adsorbents from commercial sources provide low capacity for sulfur removal, resulting in large bed size and cost.  Novel stabilized nano-ZnO desulfurizer adsorbents have shown significant increase in desulfurization capacity.  Phase I results demonstrated performance benefits with nano ZnO adsorbents for diesel desulfurization.  Nano ZnO had 4 times higher capacity than commercial ZnO with excellent regenerability.  The desulfurizer bed size can be reduced by more than 15 times or maintenance time can be extended significantly. The Phase II study will focus on nano ZnO synthesis scale-up, manufacturability and performance demonstration in bench scale power plant design with marine diesel fuel.",

Currently, the PING program is using a bi-static arrangement with separate transmit and receive antennas.  The frequency range of interest is between 150 MHz and 2 GHz.  A major technological barrier to the success of the PING program is rooted in the cross-talk between the transmit and receive antennas.  One approach to reducing or eliminating the cross-talk is to configure the system with one antenna (mono-static) that is coupled to both the transmitter source and the receive instrumentation through a directional coupler. The work in Phase I has demonstrated the feasibility of such a directional coupler.  Additionally, Phase I research has demonstrated the feasibility of using a gas breakdown switch to further protect the sensitive (and expensive) receive instrumentation from any over volt transients that may occur.  During Phase II, both of these technologies will be developed and demonstrated in a complete mono-static transmit/receive system.",

The primary advantages of fuel cell power generation include increased efficiency, lower weight and smaller size, less pollution, and reduced acoustic signature.  Another potential advantage for ship service fuel cells is the concept of \u201cdistributed power\u201d \u2013 with multiple fuel cell power plants at different locations on a ship, backup power would be available if the primary fuel cell system was damaged.  Currently, a single diesel-fueled turbine engine provides power, which makes ships vulnerable if the engine is damaged.  Fuel cell based power generation is intrinsically more efficient than current turbine-based systems (~40 percent versus ~25 percent).  This provides a key strategic advantage of longer mission durations without re-supply.  For ship-service applications, logistic (diesel) fuels, which are laden with sulfur, are required.   Thus, fuel processors are required to convert the logistic fuel into a hydrogen-rich gas with little or no carbon monoxide or sulfur.

        "abstract": "The quality and quantity of information directly available to command authorities is becoming a dominant factor in modern force projection.  The demand for information in the form of digital imagery and real time video has exposed the severe bandwidth limitations of current data link resources.  This demand is due to the recognition that \u201ctip of the spear,\u201d front line data is increasingly important to all command levels, even the National Command Authority (NCA).  The ideal solution is to compress the data.  Until now, the only compression options have been lossless techniques, which do not compress the data much, and lossy techniques (JPEG being the most common example) which destroy too much critical detail.    The DRA Team designed an Enhanced Image Capture and Transfer system that uses a revolutionary compression algorithm to increase the information bandwidth of existing data links by at least 1000%.  The tool interfaces with existing sensors and data links.  The DRA-UC Team tested an unoptimized, early version on recorded digital video data from a UAV.  The algorithm delivered 500% better performance.  The DRA-UC Team accomplished this within the SBIR funding profile by leveraging extensive investment in the underlying core compression technology.",

The optical hydrophone enables the use of all optical interrogation systems and results in a very economical wet end to the array system. The most common design for optical hydrophones is an air-backed mandrel. When the hydrophone is required to work over large pressure ranges, the wall thickness of this mandrel becomes very thick to prevent buckling failure and reduces the sensitivity of the hydrophone proportionality. This reduced sensitivity places stringent requirements on the optical interrogation system. The optical hydrophone designs proposed in this SBIR overcome this sensitivity degradation with depth by developing several innovative pressure compensation schemes into the fiber optic hydrophone without unduly complicating the design or dramatically increasing the costs.",

IS nodes service a selected set of TCAs within a given LAN or sub-network, forming a Consequence Management Cluster (CMC). Each CMC functions as a simple client-server based network of computers. IS nodes have the duty of communicating with other IS nodes that are managing other CMCs (peer CMCs). The IS nodes intelligently and selectively replicate information of interest to their peer CMCs, forming a synchronized network of distributed information.

        "abstract": "In shallow water environments or using broadband processing,detection statistics enerated from sonar data can exhibit highly non-Gaussian statistics due to the discrete nature of the returns from different clutter elements in different range resolution cells. Optimal likelihood detectors rely crucially on accurate estimation of the clutter distribution, and poor fits to an assumed Gaussian probability distribution function may lead to increased false alarm rates when the true PDF is heavy-tailed. We propose to implement a new class of physics-based models of non-Gaussian clutter statistics, developed under phase I of this effort, in order to construct improved likelihood detectors. Our approach smoothly interpolates between the low frequency regime (100 Hz to 1000 Hz) to mid and high frequency ranges. This is because our acoustic models have natural low, middle and high frequency implementations, and because of the adaptive nature of our models for the clutter returns. We also propose to develop criteria to optimize active waveforms for suppression of clutter interference. Finally, we propose to specialize the general development to the waveform and aperture characteristics of various tactical systems to demonstrate improved performance.",

However, current diving equipment was not designed to operate in such conditions, much less protect divers from exposure to contaminants in the water. These environments are so severe that equipment deteriorates to the point of breakthrough and failure in a matter of minutes, threatening the safety of the diver as well as the mission. Divers working in these conditions need robust equipment, such as Paragon\u2019s proposed Regulated Surface Exhaust (RSE) system, that provides reliable protection and isolation from hazardous materials.    Phase I results from laboratory tests and analysis of critical components show that the Navy\u2019s dive equipment can be modified to act like a spacesuit, completely isolating the diver from the water.  Further, extensive material compatibility and permeability testing conducted by Paragon identified materials that can be used to replace the vulnerable exposed soft parts of the diving system.  Existing Navy diving equipment can be cost effectively modified with a field deployable retrofit kit, providing reliable isolation from contaminated, hazardous environments. The Phase II objective is to provide a tested prototype retrofit kit.",

This effort builds on the great success of the Phase I effort that demostrated a benchtop system that could measure birefringent samples with high spatial resolution (~1mm) and high accuracy (0.1m). From this basis we will develop an engineering prototype that meets the needs of industry and the military: lightweight, compact, robust, low cost and high performance.  Precise characterization of birefringent materials is a necessity for the next generation of electro-optic devices. These birefringent devices are in widespread use as modulators and switches. One key application of this microscope is the analysis of densely packed optical components needed for applications such as advanced optical communications and optical computing.  Birefringence microscopy offers the ability to provide quality control and development feedback for these components. The benchtop prototype has already generated great interest. Three manufacturers have provided electro-optical components for testing. However, a commercial birefringent microscope must be a low cost analytical tool, capable of high speed characterization in a convenient and efficient manner and this is the focus of the Phase II effort.",

In Phase I, the feasibility of a novel high growth rate method to grow single crystal 4H n-type SiC boules at high growth rates was demonstrated.  In Phase II, the high growth rates process will be optimized for cost effectiveness, yield, and crystal quality, especially a significant improvement in polytype homogeneity to develop a commercial product.

These features would greatly  enhance missile targeting ability.  A key component of the future RF seeker is a steering antenna which is required to be very light -weight and low in cost.  Currently used gimbal mounted antennas are slow and bulky, while phased arrays remain prohibitively expensive and complex for this application.    To solve the problem, Waveband Corporation proposes to develop and demonstate a new type of steering antenna that has no discrete phase shifting elements and offers a compact planar design.  It uses a property of semiconductor material to affect the propagation of millimeter waves(MMWs) when an electron-hole plasma is generated inside it.  By changing rapidly the plasma spatial pattern, the beam steering functionality can be attained.    The antenna design provides flezibility to accommodate different frequency band requirments as well as room limitation characteristics of the missile environment.    The proposed work has its foundation in Waveband's patented technology and its recent proof-of-principle theoretical and experimental work.  It will be focused on the design and fabrication of the prototype of the specifically selected fuze sensor antenna.",

These cladded quantum dots, grown in a photoassisted microwave plasma (PMP) metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) reator, are self-assembled in layers to achieve anjection or high-field electroluminescent (EL) display devices.  This technology, which has been under development for over four years to realize blue-green quantum dot lasers at the university of Connecticut, is being adapted under the sponsor ship of  BMDO's SBIR program for the purpose of developing efficient, high brightness, and reliable long lifetime displays.

        "abstract": "75521S  Radio frequency (RF) cavities are a key component in particle accelerators for fundamental high-energy physics research and medical applications.  To enhance their capabilities, niobium-coated superconducting copper cavities have shown promise for supporting higher electric field gradients when compared to non-superconducting designs.  However, a satisfactory coating method has not been developed that can deposit high-quality superconducting films on the insides of these cavities.  To date the maximum field gradient that can be supported in niobium coated copper cavities is about 15 MV/m, which is not adequate for future accelerator designs.  Also, sheet niobium in use is expensive.  This project will develop a deposition process for coating the inside of copper RF accelerator cavities with high-quality, superconducting films that will allow particle accelerators to achieve field gradients greater than 15 MV/m.  In Phase I, copper test samples, along with several sapphire and copper witness plates, were coated with niobium films using the Coaxial Energetic Deposition process.  The superconducting transition temperature, Tc, and Residual Resistivity Ratio (RRR) for the films was measured to determine the superconducting properties, and film properties were assessed.  Finally, a segment of an actual RF accelerator cavity was coated with niobium.  Phase II will develop a Coaxial Energetic Deposition system that is capable of accommodating and coating 1.3 and 1.5 GHz RF accelerator cavities.  In addition, a production system for transition to Phase III will be developed.  Commercial Applications And Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The superconducting thin film coatings for accelerator cavities should reduce the development and operating costs of particle accelerators, and allow them to achieve higher particle energies.  Other applications include enhanced protective coatings for coal gasification, olefin manufacturing, and gun barrels for the military.",

Cells within the bone marrow are known to possess bone regenerative capacity, but they are limited in number. Increasing these osteoprogenitor cell populations through the use of ex vivo expansion technologies and combining these cells with a matrix material may significantly increase the amount and rate of new bone formation, and replace the need for autologous grafts. Phase I studies identified expansion variables for osteoprogenitor cell expansion and showed that this process can be scaled up into the automated clinical-scale cell culture system, the AastromReplicell(r) Cell Production System (ARS). In Aim 1 of the Phase II studies, optimization of the osteoprogenitor expansion process will continue. Optimization will be measured by not only biological performance in vitro and in vivo, but also the ease of commercialization of the expansion process. Specifically, the role of other cell populations in osteoprogenitor cell expansion and function will be determined, the minimal requirements for including exogenous factors in cultures will be identified, inoculation densities and maximized feeding schedules will be determined to support expansion from small volume bone marrow aspirates, the potential for expansion in an animal serum-free environment will be examined. In Aim 2, the angiogenic potential of these same cell products will be measured in vitro by colony assay and tube formation assays, as blood vessel formation is important for optimal bone regeneration. Aim 3 will validate optimal expansion processes in the ARS and evaluate bone and vascular regeneration in vivo in an ectopic mouse model. Aim 4 will include a Phase l/ll clinical trial using the selected cell product in combination with matrix material to treat tibial non-union fractures. Successful completion of these studies will lead to the development of a cell therapy kit that can be used for bone regeneration.",

As a result, the motivation to commercialize patient-specific \"cell products\" is increasing rapidly as well. A large unmet need exists for the development of reliable clinical and commercial ceil manufacturing capability for these cell products in compliance with increasingly strict regulatory guidelines and where the production economics are more favorable so that the benefits of cell therapy can be more widely enjoyed. In Phase I, a prototype system was defined and constructed that incorporated Aastrom's single-pass perfusion technology for highly effective primary human cell production along with a sterile, closed fluid path and a robotic instrument to perform operational steps (e.g. priming, inoculation, harvest). The approach provides general flexibility to enable researchers to develop and optimize a wide range of production processes, over a variety of cell types, as well.as cost-effective scale-up to clinical and commercial cell manufacturing. A non-adherent T-Cell process and an adherent stromal cell process were successfully demonstrated with the prototype. In Phase II, process control methods and additional automation technology will be developed, a modular configuration strategy will be defined, system components developed to enable cell manufacturing over a wide range of scale, and a test configuration constructed and tested to validate the design. Successful completion of Phase II will provide the technology and results necessary to initiate a commercialization phase to include both the use of the modular system as component technology to support commercialization of Aastrom's proprietary Tissue Repair Cell (TRC) products as well as the direct commercialization of the system for use by other institutions planning to commercialize therapeutic cell products.",

For these students and adults, absence of reading skills in our largely text-based society puts substantial emphasis on development of listening comprehension/auditory recall skills as primary for independent functioning in community environments (e.g., school, work, social activities). Current tools and methods for assessing and instructing listening skills involve a facilitated process with a high implementation cost associated with one-to-one facilitator/student ratios and therefore do not afford much opportunity for independent practice. To address these issues, this project proposes development and evaluation of an internet-based multimedia Listening Comprehension Assessment and Instruction (LCAI) system that is independently usable by individuals whose intellectual or other cognitive disabilities have prohibited the acquisition of functional reading skills.

Recent studies show prevalence rates in the US may be as high as 1% of live births (Burd L, Cotsonas-Hassler, et al., 2003). This means that each year, as many as 39,000 babies are born with FAS. Many more are born with fetal alcohol effects (FAE). Early diagnosis and appropriate management has repeatedly been shown to significantly reduce the risk of secondary disabilities and increase positive outcomes (Streissguth et al. 1997). AEI is developing a set of multimedia and web components about FAS that target lay care providers, particularly foster and adoptive parents. The project seeks to increase early and accurate diagnosis of children exposed to alcohol prenatally and to facilitate appropriate treatment and ongoing management of those affected by the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and its associated disorders.  Phase I resoundingly met its technical and evaluative tests of feasibility, going well beyond the originally envisioned deliverables. Phase I produced a commercial quality CD-ROM that focused on helping lay care providers recognize problems and seek diagnosis. This CD-ROM was examined in a randomized, controlled field trial and was found to increase subject knowledge of FAS significantly more than the comparison condition. The program was also considered by subjects to be better than the comparison condition on measures of usefulness, effect on confidence, and usability. The program surpassed the experimentally postulated values for all usability measures. Qualitative feedback further supported success of the project. The Phase I FAS Multimedia Guide and the results of the evaluation strongly support continuance to Phase II. Phase II of the project will continue this effort by (1) creating a significant new module on treatment and management, (2) revising and extending the Phase I module, (3) enhancing and extending the Phase I web site, (4) creating VMS and DVD versions for wider distribution of the core materials. Evaluation will be conducted through (1) subject matter expert reviews, (2) end-user focus groups, and (3) a quasi-experimental field trial, and (4) commercializing the products from Phases I and II through parent associations, distributors, and state agencies.",

The CDC found the warni\nng symbol in use at the time of the study on some teratogenic pharmaceuticals to be confusing and subject to harmful misinterpretation. The warning label is often the first and central intervention. There is, therefore, an urgent need for symbols, warning \nlabels, and educational media that convey the danger of taking teratogenic pharmaceuticals while pregnant or preconceptional. Following ANSI guidelines for symbol development and evaluation, the researchers canvassed existing symbols, generated root concep\nts, and internally developed preliminary candidate images and styles for a new symbol. As the project ensued, focus groups were conducted. The purpose of the focus groups shifted over time from generation of new symbol, text, and label ideas to evaluation \nof pre-developed symbols, text, and text symbol combinations. A final set of six pilot symbols were selected. The six pilot symbols were evaluated in a nationally distributed field trial that utilized a one-on-one interview methodology (n=300, 50 per image\n). The evaluation demonstrated significant progress toward a validated pharmaceutical label. Results have been accepted for publication. Phase II will further refine and validate the pharmaceutical symbol and label, create a series of similar symbols and w\narnings for use in other settings and with other hazards, and create a series of educational media modules to increase awareness of the symbols and warnings and to educate professionals and the public on teratogenicity.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II research project strives to develop an Advanced Ultrasonic Beamformer that is unparalleled in its scalability and signal processing features. The ultrasonic beamformer architecture will be unique in its breadth of features. The architecture was developed as the superset of features across several fields including medical imaging, medical therapy, bone density measurement, vascular imaging, and materials characterization. This approach provides each field with an instrument capable of operating outside the normal performance envelope, thereby presenting opportunities for the development of new uses of ultrasound. The benefits of this array include better frame rates, crisper images, and more accurate surgery.  The higher frequencies used in materials characterization, when brought to medical imaging, will allow array transducer to be used where only conventional, single element probes could used in the past, for example in intra-cardiac imaging for surgical instruments, and also for tumor ablation. By design, the proposed architecture encompasses the abilities of many different fields. Each field then enjoys performance capabilities beyond what is normally available, providing a general-purpose tool for research.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to  design and construct an ultra-high-resolution, high-precision phase-shift integrated measurement system suitable for metrology of advanced phase-shifting photomasks. A number of semiconductor manufacturers now expect to progress from the 90 nm through the 45 nm nodes using an exposure wavelength of 193 nm. Advanced photolithographic techniques are necessary to print these sub-wavelength features. Phase-shifting photomasks, i.e. those in which the optical thickness, as well as the opacity is controlled, are a key reticle enhancement technology. Fast and accurate metrology of critical-layer phase-shift masks is becoming necessary both for process control and repair validation, but the enabling tools do not yet exist. The goal of this Phase II program is to integrate the actinic high-repetition rate laser built in Phase I into an interferometric laser microscope involving the design, construction, and integration of a stable phase-shifting interferometer and laser microscope, and the incorporation and optimization of phase-shifting interferometry signal processing algorithms. The integrated optical system will enable phase metrology on advanced photomasks, with the measurement precision and spatial resolution required by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), mask makers and mask users.   Commercially, the primary beneficiary of the Phase II photomask phase metrology system is the semiconductor optical lithography industry. The ITRS 'roadmap' for the 90-nm node and beyond requires measurements of photomask optical path difference with sub-0.4 degree precision. This metrology must be performed at spatial resolution scales consistent with feature sizes of the respective technology nodes, and for both isolated and densely-packed structures. No commercial metrology tools yet exist which satisfy these demands. The Phase II high-precision metrology system will enable manufactures to characterize, predict, and control mask-loading effects and other repair and process control issues essential to the reliable fabrication of phaseshifting masks. It is also likely that the integrated phase metrology system will find utility in the area of nano-MEMS testing and other nano-scale interferometry.",

The proposed work will transform the Phase I prototype into production-ready commercial quality software, and demonstrate it on 3-D seismic data. The key technical innovations of the Phase II project are (1) a multi-resolution data visualizer, (2) a data-staging tool, and (3) a multi-channel collaboration tool to support collaborative visualization and data analysis on the grid. The proposed technology will allow multiple users to share and interact with multidimensional grid-dispersed data sets, while viewing independent multiple renderings with resolutions and bandwidths commensurate to their local display and network capabilities. The proposed technology will be enabled by implementing several grid services, and a virtual file system, that make grid deployed data sets appear local to the user. This implementation comprises the bulk of the technical tasks, and leverages the middleware. The immediate outcome of the Phase II project will be a version of Internet Seismic Processing production software (INSP) with specialized features for remote visualization, data staging, and collaborative analysis of seismic images on the grid.  The ultimate objective of the Phase II project is a commercial grid-enabled software product providing scientific data, services, computing power, and visualization on demand, not only to the oil and gas industry but to a much wider range of application areas, such as geographic information systems, education, medical imaging, and battlefield management. The product will push the limits of what can be done, and fully contribute to a new business paradigm, made possible by the advent of the grid, allowing businesses to concentrate on their core competencies and rely on other entities for grid-enabled context technologies, without deterring from their primary objectives. The outcome of Phase II will be a commercial implementation and utilization of the grid, and the toolkit, which up until now, has been used mostly in academic and research applications. This technology will first be commercialized in a strategically important economic sector; namely, for the exploration of new energy resources. Specific to U.S. energy needs, this unique application of high end information technology to an area of economic and national importance will ultimately open up new exploration venues in extremely complicated geological conditions, leading to new discoveries, and decreasing US dependence on imported oil.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will implement and demonstrate the feasibility of a new technology that enables enhance seismic resolution and imaging of deep water complex geologic structures by using variable azimuth wave-equation migration (VAWEM).    VAWEM will provide much greater resolution and accuracy than what can be accomplished today for towed marine streamer data, and at significantly less computational cost.  The software will be optimized for deployment on Linux clusters, and testing will be conducted to determine the optimal geophysical parameters for obtaining the best possible images. The project involves significant computer engineering to obtain the maximum efficiency required to image terabyte size data sets and significant geophysical work to demonstrate the validity of the approach.    This advanced imaging methodology will improve success rate and cost effectiveness for new field discoveries and increase recovery efficiency for the development of existing fields.    This technology is a fundamental revolutionary advance, and is a necessary building block in any seismic processing system that images 3-D prestack data using wave-equation methods for imaging deep water, under-salt complex geological structures which are the focus of modern oil and gas exploration.  Societal and economic benefits from the proposed VAWEM technology will accrue directly to the nation by lowering energy costs and reducing dependence on foreign energy sources.  Energy is at the core of the U.S. and world economies; therefore, the political, societal, and economic benefits of the proposed technology go well beyond the substantial direct economic benefit that this technology will bring to the proposing company and its customers. Commercial potential of the proposed technology is directly applicable to the fastest growing and strategically most important area of U.S. exploration, namely the deepwater subsalt oil and gas province of the Gulf of Mexico federal waters.  It is estimated that most of the Gulf's untapped resources (45 Billion barrels of oil and 207 trillion cubic feet of natural gas) are trapped in deepwater subsalt reservoirs, and in ultra deep (over 15,000 ft) gas deposits. Since exploratory wells in these areas typically cost more than $30 million, tapping these reserves will require advanced imaging technology such as VAWEM to reduce risk and make exploration feasible.  Reduction USA's dependence on Persian Gulf sources and the strategic benefits of maintaining strong U.S.A. leadership in oil technology transcend purely financial considerations.",

Two different technical innovations are required to make this possible. First, new software will be created to allow the unfolding of the complex geometry of a protein into a collection of fragments, each of which is moldable. Second, further development of the PHAST rapid tooling process will be required. In this process, ceramic molds are first cast from a complex master-pattern created by rapid prototyping. The final metal injection molding tool is then created from powdered metal packed against the ceramic mold and infiltrated at high temperature with a molten copper alloy. This approach creates a hard metal injection mold with a complex geometry that would be virtually impossible to create by traditional methods, at a fraction of the cost of traditional machining.      The successful completion of this project will result in the production of a collection of physical models that can be used to introduce students to concepts of molecular structure and function. No other technology currently exists with which physical models of these structures can be produced at a cost that will allow their widespread dissemination. The physical models of proteins and other molecular structures that will result from this project will be used in science classrooms at both the secondary and undergraduate levels to attract a broader spectrum of students to careers in the molecular biosciences.

        "abstract": "The release of mercury into the environment via combustion processes has become an issue of concern for the US and the entire world.  Major sources either are regulated or are under review to develop regulations to reduce emissions.  ADA Technologies has successfully demonstrated the performance of a novel reactive scrubbing technology for the removal of vapor-phase mercury from incinerator exhaust gas streams.  The technology has two major features; first, it is very efficient in the capture of mercury, and second, the final reaction product is granular solid mercuric sulfide, which is a compact, concentrated form of mercury that is stable under all environmental conditions.  Indeed, the final reaction product can be handled as a nonhazardous waste, as it easily passes the EPA TCLP test for mercury leaching.  In Phase I, lab-scale tests, over 99% of the vapor-phase mercury was captured in the scrubber, and was successfully converted to a stable mercuric sulfide compound in the secondary waste treatment process.  TCLP tests run on the treated waste showed mercury leachate levels well below the 200 part  per billion standard of the protocol.  An economic model of the scrubber process was created, and used to evaluate the cost of reactive scrubbing applied to and existing hazardous waste incinerator.  The model predicted a cost savings for the reactive scrubbing technology of over 28% when compared to current technology of activated carbon injection.                                                                                                                 The Phase II project will be directed at refining the process through the identification of most cost-effective technologies for specific functions, including separation of reaction product solids and contact of the gas stream being treated with the scrubbing liquid.  The secondary treatment process to generate the concentrated mercuric sulfide final reaction product will also be optimized in a series of laboratory tests.  These process improvements will be incorporated into a portable pilot-scale reactive scrubber system to be demonstrated on slipstreams of exhaust gas from operating incinerators in the Phase II Option task.  ADA has partnered with Aketon Technologies, a subsidiary of CH2M HILL, to commercialize the reactive scrubbing technology.  Aketon will participate in the Phase II design of the portable pilot-scale system, and has the expertise and market presence to deliver scrubber systems to customers.

The unique intrinsic properties of GaN microLEDs - high brightness (> 10 microwatt  optical output power for microLEDs of 18 micrometer in diameter), wide viewing angle (~ 160 degrees), fast response time (< 1 ns), and high thermal and vibrational resistance, make GaN microdisplays a perfect solution for environmentally demanding applications such as head-up displays (HUD) in modern vehicles and aircrafts, head-mounted displays (HMD) for firefighters and other rescue operatives, and hand-held mini-projectors for field applications.  Microdisplays have a small size (typically less than 1 inch diagonal) with a resolution from low end to above XVGA format. They are magnified by optics to form enlarged virtual or projected images for viewing by a user. Microdisplays can be used in a variety of devices such as head-mounted displays, video headsets, camcorder viewfinders, projection TV, head-up displays, etc. and have many commercial applications. GaN microdisplay, with its superior performance over other microdisplay technologies, is especially suitable for environmentally demanding applications that require high brightness, high reliability, and wide operating temperature range. With a slight modification of the material composition, GaN microLED arrays developed here can vary the emitted wavelength from the green to the ultraviolet range, which is very suitable for fluorescence analysis used in new type chemical-biology agent detector array or DNA/protein microchips. The GaN microLED array also has the potential for applications such as optical links and parallel computing. Other applications also include spatially resolved optical studies of biological, medical, and health care systems. The research will also enrich the general knowledge of wide bandgap semiconductor micro- and nano-photonics.",

        "abstract": "75554B  Fuel cells are an efficient, combustion-less, virtually pollution-free source of power.  In particular, Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells are ideal for a number of applications, due to their \u00bfquick\u00bf warm-up characteristics.  However, these fuel cells contain some inherent inefficiencies, which results in waste heat that must be removed rapidly via a coolant \u00bf currently, either Deionized (DI) water or glycol/water solutions with a DI canister.  Although these coolants are non-flammable and thermally efficient, their electrical conductivity increases rapidly unless the DI canister is replaced frequently, which significantly increases capital and maintenance costs.  This problem will be addressed by developing a novel Complex Coolant Fluid (CCF), comprised of a base composition and an additive package.  The base composition addresses the non-flammability, thermal efficiency, freeze point, and materials compatibility issues, whereas the additive package maintains a low electrical conductivity in the CCF.  In Phase I, key ingredients of the proposed additive package were prepared and incorporated into the coolant fluid.  The resultant complex coolant fluid formulations were tested in two dynamic loops, and the additives were shown to maintain the electrical conductivity of the coolant below 2.0 microSiemens/cm for more than 325 hours.  In Phase II, the additive package will be optimized and a more detailed study of the coolant performance and longevity will be carried out in a dynamic test loop that simulates fuel cell conditions.  Optimized coolant samples will tested and validated in actual fuel cells under various operating conditions.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new complex coolant fluid should significantly expand the versatility of the PEM fuel cells in both mobile and stationary applications by offering the advantages of freeze protection, corrosion inhibition, and low electrical conductivity in a single aqueous-based fluid, attributes that are not available in competitive alternates.  The commercial applications include, but are not limited to, automotive fuel cell engines, power generation for residential and commercial buildings, back-up power for hospitals and other emergency establishments, fuel cells used in ships and space vehicles, and mobile machinery and equipment.",

Currently, the accumulation of manures from animal husbandry operations is a serious threat to water supplies and challenges the capacity of existing landfills. However, this potential problem also represents an opportunity for remote biomass power production systems based on heating the manure in the absence of air to produce combustible gases. Poultry manure is a good candidate since it is available in large quantities. The technology for converting poutry manure into combustible gases can be integrated with various electrical power generation devices and have widespread agricultural use for poultry manure removal, resource recovery, and power generation. Export opportunities will exist for underdeveloped countries with limited central power production capabilities.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This project is to develop an instrument to measure the polarization of a hyperpolarized noble gas, Helium- 3 and Xenon-129, for enhanced lung MRIs in a clinical environment. It is essential to have some means of measuring polarization at various stages in the handling of these gases, e.g. at production, storage, transport and administration to a patient. The instrument we propose will be portable, compact (about 6 in. cube), self contained and versatile, able to operate in several modes and in various environments, yet capable of being integrated in a larger system. Unlike presently used methods of measuring polarization, this is a direct measure of nuclear polarization that does not destroy any of the polarization of the sample being measured.      It operates on the principle that two coupled resonant systems, in this case an electronic L-C circuit and the magnetically resonating nuclei, oscillate in unison in either of two frequencies, neither of which is the same as the magnetic resonant frequency of the nuclei. The system is made to oscillate at a very low amplitude, and polarization is derived from measurements of frequency. Since the magnetic field probing the nuclei is not much stronger than thermal noise, and at a frequency different from their resonant frequency, the nuclei are not disturbed.      The program is to investigate different modes of exploiting this phenomenon (the splitting of the resonance), to devise protocols for efficient implementation, and to develop software to enable the instrument to operate automatically and in an intelligent user friendly manner; to design plug in modules to enable the instrument to work in a variety of environments; to calibrate the instrument to give a direct output of the polarization at the instant when it is measured for 3He and 129Xe, to package, test, and arrange the manufacture of a final model.      MR imaging of the lungs and airways using hyperpolarized noble gases (3He and 129Xe) is particularly useful in the early diagnosis and management of, e.g. emphysema, asthma, cystic fibrosis, COPD etc., as it reveals, with zero radiation dose, information about morphology and functioning of the lungs, circulation and soft tissues, not available with other techniques.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common, significant, life threatening and unaddressed infectious disease problem that occurs in patients who are intubated with an endotracheal tube and require mechanical ventilation. Of the l .6 million patients per year in the US who require mechanical ventilation, 15-25% will develop VAP and 24-71% will die of the disease. In addition, VAP costs the US healthcare industry $1.2 billion dollars annually. A major cause of VAP is the proliferation of microorganisms and microbial biofilm on the interior of the endotracheal tube, which during mechanical ventilation is dislodged into the lung resulting in tracheobronchitis and pneumonia.  The primary objective of the proposed SBIR-AT-NIAID project is to perform a controlled, double armed, multi-institutional IRB approved human clinical trial to determine the safety and efficacy of using Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) to reduce endotracheal tube microorganisms and associated biofilm. The reduction of the endotracheal tube microorganisms is expected to result in a significant reduction of the incidence of VAP with reduced morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay and overall cost of treatment.  PDT is a treatment modality that combines the use of a photosensitizing solution and light to create oxygen radicals resulting in the destruction of microorganisms. Advanced Photodynamic Technologies, Inc. has developed and optimized a PDT System that has been proven to be effective in the broad spectrum eradication of antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria, fungi and biofilms during in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo experiments. In addition, the safety of the proposed photosensitizer solution and light combination has been established in a GLP controlled large mammal study. The proposed clinical study will demonstrate the safety and efficacy of PDT treatment as a means to reduce endotracheal tube biofilm resulting in a reduction in the incidence of VAP. The proposed PDT System is unique in that no effective alternative treatment of endotracheal tube microbial biofilms is currently available for clinical use.",

This research will generate the commercially viable conditions for growth of large boules of single crystals suitable for use in diode pumped solid-state lasers. The hydrothermal method is a low temperature growth technique that leads to crystals  containing less thermal strain, much fewer defects and  greater homogeneity than conventional methods. These defects combine to cause considerable optical loss and concomitant reduction in performance. The hydrothermal technique has slower growth kinetics and requires chemical development for economically viable growth. In the Phase I project, preliminary growth conditions that lead to suitable single crystals were identified. These conditions include approximate thermal ranges, a variety of starting materials, seed crystals and mineralizer concentrations.  In the Phase II project growth conditions will be systematically optimized to provide suitable transport rates and crystal quality. Once an acceptable growth is developed, the resulting boules will be evaluated for performance efficiency and loss.  Commercially benefits will emerge as the company introduces new higher performance crystal materials to the market that cannot be grown by existing crystal growth methods.

The blindness associated with wet AMD is caused by neovascularization and treatments are aimed at inhibiting this progress. The Advanced Vision Therapies, Inc. (AVT) strategy is to combine its gene delivery system with a novel and potent anti-angiogenic transgene to rapidly develop and market a superior product for wet AMD. AVT developed a state-of-the-art gene delivery system based on the bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), a bovine lentivirus that does not cause human disease. AVT will  combine the BIV vector system with a novel anti-angiogenic transgene, T2-TrpRS, and evaluate this system in relevant rodent models of ocular neovascularization. There are three specific aims for this Phase I project. 1). Generation and in vitro characterization of T2-TrpRS expression  cassettes. T2-TrpRS is a proteolytic cleavage fragment of the Trp tRNA synthetase, and is not  normally secreted from cells. Therefore, several expression cassettes will be generated, containing  alternative signal sequences, and evaluated for efficient secretion following transfection into human   cells. 2) Generation and production of a BIV-T2-TrpRS vector. Using the best T2-TrpRS   expression cassette from Specific Aim 1, a BIV vector will be made, scaled up for in vivo studies,  and evaluated for T2-TrpRS expression following vector transduction of human cells. 3). Evaluation  of the T2-TrpRS vector efficacy in a relevant rodent model of ocular neovascularization. The vector  generated and characterized in Specific Aim 2 will be evaluated for efficacy following subretinal injection into a mouse model of retinal neovascularization.

In Phase I, a direct-frequency-generation (DFG) light source was designed, and the feasibility of obtaining sufficient power in an ultra-compact package was shown.  A pulsed quantum cascade laser (QCL) was shown to provide measurement precision of 0.1 parts-per-thousand for the 13CO2/12CO2 ratio with an averaging time of 200 s.

A custom lamp to produce VUV photons was designed and coupled to the aerosol mass spectrometer.  Selective detection of organic test aerosols was accomplished.  A Li+ ion source was integrated into the aerosol mass spectrometer and successfully used to detect organic particles.  Designs for prototype soft ionization modules that couple to the aerosol mass spectrometer were completed.

Virtually all pathological conditions, particularly neuropsychological disorders such as anxiety and depression, and a variety of different classes of drugs, can lead to the alteration of behavior and disturbance of sleep. Although a battery of behavioral assessments is frequently conducted in animals exposed to new compounds or in genetically altered mice (e.g., gene knockout), sleep assessments are rarely performed in these subjects because of the technical difficulty of using electroencephalographs (EEGs) and electromyographs (EMGs). In general, behavioral assessments and drug behavioral safety and efficacy screening in animals have become a bottleneck in the modern drug discovery process because of the lack of high-throughput screening (HTS) tools available. Promising results obtained in our SBIR Phase I feasibility study have demonstrated that the non-invasive piezoelectric (piezo)-system is not only capable of monitoring sleep/wake activity, but can also detect abnormal behavior such as tremors and seizures in mice. In the proposed Phase II project, we will expand this novel approach by incorporating other proven biosensor technologies (e.g., imaging tracking and force transducers) into an individual piezo-homecage to create a flexible and comprehensive behavioral assay toolkit. Our specific aims are to (1) extend the current piezo monitoring application by integrating it with other biosensors, (2) refine algorithms for pattern recognition of characteristic behavior and improve software to enable fully automated data analysis, and (3) validate this novel system with pharmacological studies in mice and by comparison with conventional methods. Multiple behavioral parameters generated from this non-invasive and efficient homecage monitor will provide integrated information about agent or gene mutant effects on specialized functions of the animal.

Asthma is one of the most prevalent chronic inflammatory diseases in the United States affecting approximately 15 percent of the population. Despite intensive research on asthma over the past decade the prevalence, morbidity and mortality rates continue to increase in the U.S. and the developed world and there remains a large unmet medical need for new orally administered drugs that can more effectively and safely treat this disease.   Lactoferrin is a multifunctional immunomodulatory protein found in serum and exocrine secretions such as milk and colostrum where it acts as a component of the primary host defense system. It is also a component of the neutrophil secondary granules and is released locally at the site of inflammation. RhLF, a recombinant version of the protein, is identical to the native protein in all material respects, differing only in the nature of its glycosylation. Pharmaceutical grade rhLF can be produced at large scale (tons of product per year).   We have shown that oral rhLF protects against airway effects and inflammatory infiltration in both sheep and primate models of asthma. In the sheep model of allergic asthma, oral rhLF inhibited the early and late asthmatic responses and airway hypersensitivity by up to 77 percent, 90 percent and 100 percent, respectively. These results are comparable or superior to those obtained by leading approved drugs such as ZileutonTM and Montelukast Sodium (Singulair(tm)) in the same preclinical model. In Phase I of this SBIR grant, the anti-asthma activity of rhLF, previously observed in sheep, was confirmed in Cynmolgus monkeys, a non-human primate model of asthma. The primate work also helped identify an appropriate clinical dose for our Phase 2 trial. Details of this work are provided in the Phase I Report accompanying this application.   RhLF's anti-asthma activity appears to act by a novel mechanism. Oral rhLF induces the production on key cytokines, including IL-18, in the gut resulting in a systemic TH2 to TH1 shift that helps reduce the inflammation associated with asthma. Oral rhLF has also shown to be safe and well tolerated in animal studies and in human trials. RhLF has been administered to mice and monkeys at doses as high as 1000 mg/kg and for up to 183 days in a 6-month monkey safety-toxicity study. No drug related adverse events were noted during the treatment phase, in laboratory tests or on histopathology. In humans, rhLF has been administered at a dose of up to 15 g in a 24 hour period and for up to 9 g/day for sustained periods of time. Oral rhLF has been administered orally to 211 people without a single drug related serious adverse event.   Few orally administered effective anti-asthma drugs are available to patients. Given the robust safety profile and ease of administration of oral rhLF there exists a possibility that rhLF may represent an exciting, safe and novel therapy for asthma. Thus, we are requesting support to conduct a Phase 2 human clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of oral rhLF in asthmatic patients.   This research will seek to determine the efficacy of oral lactoferrin in treating the symptoms of mild to moderate asthma. We will conduct a 28 day double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 30 patients with mild to moderate asthma to assess the effectiveness of lactoferrin in relieving asthma symptoms as measured by standard parameters including FEV, asthma symptom scores and use of inhaled beta2-agonist rescue medications. Patient enrollment and evaluation will be conducted independently at major academic institutions by independent clinicians",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build a first-release Web-based system for content authoring and delivery that supports multiple approaches to pedagogical practice and provides efficient, easy to use methodologies with which course designers can employ system capabilities.  Specifically, this project will continue the work started and demonstrated to be feasible in Phase I to create online authoring and complementary course management systems, which have features and benefits that are immediately available to innovative instructional designers.  The goal is to enable the development of technology-mediated instruction through cost-effective means for producing new content and to do so with a focus on supporting instructional design innovation without compromising the capabilities of the technology.  The goal is an innovation that will empower content providers to use principled learning theories and pedagogical practices for creating new online curricula that support technology-mediated instruction.  The project will produce a new type of authoring and delivery system in which the functionality available to create course structure; manage multimedia content development; translate course specification into reliable production delivery; and access course-related activities for learners and their teachers or mentors, including dynamic learning interactions and real-time behavior tracking and reporting reflects the authors' preferred learning theories and pedagogies.  This project seeks to provide a set of enabling tools that support the development of technology-mediated instruction through cost-effective means for producing content, focused on supporting instructional design innovation without compromising the capabilities of the technology.  The commercial applications of the research result are sales and licenses of the created systems, both with and without content, to content developers, publishers, and also middle and high schools, districts, and other local entities for use by individuals and groups who desire to create and to publish content and assessments for communities of practice and who are impeded by cost and time constraints.  The resulting systems will address a major problem in education: the consolidation of content development and dissemination in the hands of a small number of publishing conglomerates and the consequent lack of quality and diversity of choice that have been a result of that consolidation.  With an extensible authoring system, the company would be positioned to tap into a large market with a business model that supports both new business development and the legacy assets of publishers and eLearning providers, and to create major new opportunities for many other types of content providers.",

However, currently available OLED devices do not meet the power efficiency and lifetime requirements for general lighting.  Among several limiting factors, two very important ones are:  (1) non-efficient and non-balanced charge injection and (2) poor device structural stability.  This project will develop innovative, low cost, OLED anode surface modification technology, which will increase device energy efficiency by 5 to 10 times, and simultaneously promote significant thermal stability and long life for the device.  In Phase I, anode surface modification agents TPD-(SiCl3)2 and TPD-[Si(OCH3)3]2 were successfully synthesized with high yield and purity.  Improvements of approximately 200% in luminance and 50% in energy efficiency were achieved with these materials compared to industry standard, PEDOT-PSS.  In Phase II, the TPD-(SiCl3)2 and TPD-[Si(OCH3)3]2 synthesis processes will be optimized for OLED polymers and scaled up cost-effectively to 6 inch wafers.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The novel substrates should improve OLED performance and help it realize its potential applications: solid state lighting, high brightness image displays, sign indicators, automobile displays, and wearable electronics.",

        "abstract": "75239S  Municipal solid waste landfills are the single largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions in the United States, producing 7 million tons, or 34% of the nation's total methane pollution.  According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Control\u00bfs third assessment report, methane has a global warming potential 21 times that of carbon dioxide and is a key contributor to global climate change.  This project will develop technology for capturing methane emissions from landfills and converting nearly 100% of these emissions into a high quality synthetic diesel fuel, using a commercially viable gas-to-liquids (GTL) process.  This proprietary GTL technology, now being used in oil and natural gas fields, will be adapted for use with municipal solid waste landfills.  During Phase I, a GTL processing unit with a 25,000 scf/day capacity was built; a catalyst manufacturing process was designed; a proprietary catalyst was produced for the project; and a field test was performed at a rural stranded gas well.  The test demonstratead that a synthetic diesel fuel could be made directly from wellgas methane.  During Phase II, additional gas stream clean-up technology will be developed and incorporated to remove corosives and catalyst poisons, in order to make a relatively pure methane/carbon dioxide gas stream for the GTL unit.  Finally, the system will be evaluated to determine if the technology can be commercially applied to landfill gas, and if so, at what range of processing volumes.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should be applicable to the servicing of a considerable portion of the 2,000 active landfills in the US, as well as a significant number of the 4,000 closed sites.  The initial target market will be landfills with much smaller gas streams than can sustain electrical generation, liquified natural gas, or other technologies.  The landfills would benefit from a new revenue source (sales of the waste gas stream and use of a non-sulfur synthetic diesel).  Methane emissions would be significantly reduced, and the resulting synthetic diesel would provide a high-centane, sulfur-free, fuel that would burn with lower NOx and particulate emissions, compared to conventional diesel fuels.",

Moreover, transgenic and knock-out techniques for manipulating the genome allow us to tailor animal models that accurately recapitulate human tumorigenesis as well as cancer biology and its genetic underpinnings.   With the ever-increasing number and importance of human disease models, particularly in the smaller animals such as mice and rats, the potential of high-resolution nuclear medicine technologies to contribute unique information is becoming apparent to many researchers.

For these reasons, nuclear imaging techniques (such as SPECT) are becoming powerful new tools in imaging biological processes in small laboratory animals.  However, the demands on small animal radionuclide imaging for these applications are significant.  The radionuclide imaging system must offer spatial resolution in the range of 1-2 mm or better, and with excellent detection efficiency so that the study can be completed in reasonable time with small amounts of radioactivity and with radiation doses that do not perturb the biological model.

These images allow investigation of metabolism in the region being studied and are a useful tool for diagnosing symptoms of diseases such as cancer and myocardial ischemia. SPECT is also showing promise in imaging of biological processes in small laboratory animal in vivo. Recently, there have been significant advances in development of human disease models in such small animals. High resolution SPECT studies of small animals can therefore improve our understanding of human diseases.  At present, the detectors used in SPECT systems often limit their performance (for clinical and small animal imaging).  Modern SPECT detectors consist of scintillators coupled to PMTs. Important requirements for scintillators used in SPECT include high light output, high energy resolution, decent stopping efficiency, fast response, and low cost.  At present, no established scintillator meets all these requirements. The goal of the proposed effort is to investigate the feasibility of using a new scintillator in SPECT imaging in the Phase I research and build and evaluate a small animal SPECT system using arrays of such a scintillator in the Phase II project.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Dramatic advances in imaging technology, especially for small-animal imaging, have been an important driving force in establishing the field of molecular and genomic imaging. One of these new technologies, microPET, has demonstrated a tremendous potential in the study of small animal models, allowing the measurement of biological parameters and permitting in vivo imaging of transgene expression. Although rich in information content, interpretation of data for these studies can be very difficult due to the fact that PET images lack anatomical information. Thus, current trends are towards combining PET with CT so that the functional information from PET can be co-related to the anatomic information provided by CT. However, the use of this powerful combined modality is limited by the current x-ray detectors which provide excellent spatial resolution, but have low sensitivities and poor signal to noise ratios (SNR), resulting in a high dose to the animal.        To improve the SNR and to reduce the x-ray dose to the animal, we propose to develop a novel x-ray detector for combined PET/CT systems. The detector will be based on a high efficiency scintillator coupled to a new imaging sensor that simultaneously provides high resolution, an internal avalanche gain, and a very low total noise. The system will allow for dramatic improvements in visualization, interpretation, and quantification of PET data using superior anatomical CT images obtained at a substantially reduced dose. The availability of a high-sensitivity, high-resolution, large area x-ray detector will allow development of new generation of combined small animal imagers, which provide a powerful tool for studies of such disease as cancer. As such, this detector will be of great interest to the pharmaceutical industry. In addition to the small animal imaging, the detector will have tremendous application potential in areas such as medical imaging, structural biology, nondestructive testing etc. The current market for x-ray detector is estimated to be in hundreds of millions of dollars, a significant fraction of which represents applications where proposed technology would be of great help.",

        "abstract": "75096S  Although CsI(Tl) has become the scintillator of choice for a wide variety of applications, it is not been widely used in radionuclide imaging or computed tomography (CT).  The primary reason is the presence of an afterglow component in its scintillation decay, which reduces the energy resolution in emission tomography and results in image blur in CT.  In addition, thick, pixelated scintillator structures, needed to overcome the traditional tradeoff between detection efficiency and spatial resolution, do not currently exist.  This project addresses the first issue by co-doping the scintillator with ions capable of suppressing the afterglow.  The issue of tradeoff between detection efficiency and spatial resolution will be addressed by developing thick, microcolumnar, films of co-doped CsI(Tl).  In Phase I:  (1) single crystals of co-doped CsI(Tl) material were grown and characterized; (2) a synthesis effort demonstrated the feasibility of depositing the material as a microcolumnar film by vapor deposition techniques; and (3) the resulting films were evaluated to confirm the appropriate scintillation properties.  The codoped CsI(Tl) scintillator exhibited a reduction in afterglow of almost two orders of magnitude, compared to current commercial CsI(Tl).  Phase II will (1) study the physics of afterglow to gain a better understanding of underlying mechanisms, (2) incorporate selected co-dopants into the CsI(Tl) lattice, (3) characterize the decay time, afterglow, light yield, and time-dependent spectral distribution of the crystals and the microcolumnar films under x-ray excitation, and (4) develop thick, fast films for x-ray and nuclear imaging.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Due to its low cost and excellent properties, the proposed scintillator should find widespread use in small animal/human SPECT/CT imaging systems in particular, and nuclear medicine systems in general.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a nuclear imaging modality that makes use of a range of positron-emitting tracers to provide images that reflect different parameters relevant to tumor biology. Tumor cells generally differ from normal cells in many respects, including rates of glucose utilization, proliferation and protein synthesis. PET tracers such as glucose and thymidine analogs, and amino acids, generally show high uptake in tumor cells. Indeed, whole-body PET imaging with 18Ffluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is now a well established diagnostic procedure that is used for staging and assisting in management choices of patients with many different types of cancers. Recent developments in PET technology are leading towards more specialized PET systems, particularly for breast imaging and applications in breast cancer. The motivation is to obtain better performance at a lower cost than with conventional whole-body PET scanners.  It is clear that PET technology is playing a prominent and an increasingly visible role in modem cancer research and clinical diagnosis. However, there is urgent need for improvement in PET instrumentation in order to exploit the full potential of this powerful imaging modality. The goal of the proposed effort is to investigate crystals of a new promising scintillator for PET imaging.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Breakthrough pain is a feared symptom afflicting the majority of cancer patients at some point in their illness. It is characterized by rapid onset, with pain intensity reaching excruciating level within several minutes, and brief duration (median duration approximately 30 minutes). Although commonly used, due to their delayed onset and long duration of action, oral opioids do not relieve breakthrough pain adequately and often result in excess plasma drug concentration after the pain has subsided, thus introduce adverse effects. A recently approved oral transmucosal fentanyl product has been commercially successful by marginally accelerating the onset of breakthrough pain treatment relative to oral opioids. However, there remains a substantial unmet need for a faster onset treatment with minimal side effects. The goal of this proposal is to develop an inhalation device for rapid systemic delivery of fentanyl, a potent opioid analgesic, for the treatment of breakthrough pain. The inhalation device applies a novel technology pioneered by Alexza MDC to generate a pure fentanyl aerosol appropriate for systemic delivery through the deep lung. Preliminary animal studies have shown rapid, IV-like, systemic delivery of several FDA-approved drugs to dogs using our technology. In Phase I of this grant, we will demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating this aerosol generation technology into a handheld, multi-dose delivery device with features ensuring patient safety and minimizing opioid abuse and diversion. In Phase II, we will determine the safety of fentanyl inhalation in animal toxicology studies, design and manufacture devices for use in clinical trials, and complete all product testing required prior to human use of our device. By the end of the grant period, we will be ready to initiate human testing of the multi-dose device. Eventual FDA approval of our fentanyl product will allow cancer patients to relieve breakthrough pain more effectively, thus improving their overall quality of life. In addition, the secure, convenient multi-dose device platform for rapid systemic delivery will likely find other valuable applications in clinical practices.",

Therefore, the industry has adopted, among other methods, post-packaging pasteurization to control Listeria monocytogenes on the products' surfaces. However, in-package heat treatments may require up to eight minutes or more to achieve a 3-log reduction of Listeria monocytogenes, thus affecting products' quality.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This Phase II proposal aims to simplify, expedite, and stabilize the recovery of high quality RNA from tissue samples. In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of a hands-off, closed tube tissue disruption method termed \"MELT\" (Multi-Enzymatic Liquefaction of Tissue). MELT enlists potent catabolic enzymes to liquefy tissue within minutes without invasive mechanical force. High yields of intact RNA are obtained after MELT. Importantly, MELT enzymes destroy cellular RNases and stabilize RNA in tissue lysates for up to 5 days at ambient temperatures. Additionally, MELT is compatible with freshly harvested, flash-frozen, or RNAIater(R)-treated tissues, both mouse and human, and including tumor specimens. Taken together, these advances promise faster, simpler, safer, and more robust methods for stabilizing and quantifying gene expression in tissues through innovations in RNA stability, closed-tube tissue disruption, and rapid single-tube sample preparation.   In Phase II we will integrate continuing MELT enhancements with new ways to facilitate RNA processing. First, we will accelerate MELT tissue digestions and maximize the quality of the resulting RNA. Second, we will link MELT improvements with novel magnetic beads that can enable the purification of DNA-free RNA in as little as 20 min. This method will secure the recovery of large amounts of RNA for analysis by any expression profiling method, including microarrays. Last, we will enable an ultra rapid RNA sample preparation strategy specifically suited for qRT-PCR (\"Tissue-to-RT-PCR\") that skips RNA isolation altogether. Using novel approaches for tissue disruption, RNase control, DNA removal, and the management of RT-PCR inhibition, we will enable Tissue-to-RT-PCR in less than 10 minutes, with all of the steps but the RT-PCR reaction itself occurring in the same tube.   Success in these objectives will result in easy-to-use products that offer improved RNA yields, greater sample throughput, more ready automation, and reduced variability, contamination, and biohazard risk compared to current methods. The beneficiaries of MELT technology will include life science researches and clinical diagnostic labs, where emerging RNA biomarkers can be combined with simpler sample preparation methods to hasten the adoption of molecular diagnostics procedures.",

Several companies are using capped RNA to produce human vaccines against cancers and infectious diseases such as HIV and biowarfare agents. Ambion's patented mMESSAGEmMACHINE(r) kit provides high-yielding transcription reactions for the synthesis of capped RNA. Although this is the best available technology, the costs of producing capped RNA for therapeutic purposes in accordance to the FDA Quality System Requirement (21 CFR, Part 820) are too high for commercial viability. Our objective is to reduce the manufacturing costs such that the use of capped RNA for vaccine development and other therapeutic applications is economically feasible. Our specific aims are: 1. Increase the functional unit activity (purity, homogeneity, orientation) of capped RNA. 2. Decrease the overall cost of capped RNA manufacturing. In Phase I, we 1) developed a batch-fed transcription system that increased the RNA yield by 5-fold, 2) enhanced capped RNA unit activity by producing greater than 80% properly oriented caps, 3) improved the template DNA removal step, 4) produced two key reaction components in animal-free systems, and 5) reduced the cost per dose by -10-fold. For Phase II, we will build on this success by further optimizing the reaction and reducing production costs. We will design and test a reactor for large-scale reactions that allows continuous monitoring and adjusting of the relevant components of the reaction. We will also investigate new cap analogs and optimize RNA polyadenylation and purification to both reduce costs and improve unit activity. Finally, we will manufacture FDA-compliant enzymes and reagents to synthesize capped RNA at a lower cost. Based on our prior success, we believe we can further decrease the costs to approximately $10/dose for human use, and thereby enable the development of RNA-based vaccines for existing and emerging pathogens.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term objectives of this proposal are to permit the isolation of RNA from fixed and imbedded tissues for gene expression analysis. The widespread use of tissue fixation and embedding in both clinical and research settings has resulted in the accumulation of large stores of fixed and embedded tissues in medical schools, hospitals, and universities. The ability to correlate changes in either specific or global gene expression with the morphological, diagnostic and disease progression information associated with these samples would be tremendously informative. Mining this data would greatly aid our understanding of the roles of specific genes in disease and development and would help identify markers and causative genes for a variety of human diseases, ultimately leading to improved diagnostics and therapeutics. Unfortunately, the RNA in these samples has been practically unavailable for these studies, due to the crosslinking and chemical modifications induced by the fixing and embedding processes. During Phase I of this proposal, we demonstrated that we can extract RNA suitable for RT-PCR analysis from fixed and embedded tissues and have begun optimizing the procedures involved. We also established sensitive assays for modifications to the RNA and have demonstrated that the modifications to RNA induced by fixation and embedding can be reversed, at least partially. Under Phase II we will develop products and procedures to allow gene expression analysis from fixed and embedded tissue samples. Our specific aims are:  1. Continue to develop procedures to increase the quality and quantity of functional RNA from fixed samples, especially from archives.  2. Develop a robust procedure to amplify RNA obtained from formaldehyde-fixed tissue, by modifying both the reaction conditions and enzyme itself for the reverse transcription reaction.  3. Determine optimal fixing and embedding parameters for obtaining RNA from these samples and provide this information to the medical community.  From these aims, we will develop and release kits, reagents, and improved protocols for RNA extraction, reversal of modifications, reverse transcription and RNA amplification, and improved fixation and embedding procedures to better reclaim RNA from these tissues.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a long-term, debilitating disorder that causes loss of memory and cognitive functions. There is an urgent need for effective therapeutic agents to ameliorate the symptoms of AD. Important molecular drug targets in AD are the gamma-secretases that produce the neurotoxic Abeta peptides in AD. The regulated secretory pathway of neurons represents the major source of secreted Abeta peptides that accumulate in extracellular amyloid plaques in AD.   However, previous screens for inhibitors of gamma-secretase have only analyzed the minor constitutive secretory pathway for Abeta peptide production. Different proteases are present in the regulated secretory pathway compared to the constitutive secretory pathway. Clearly, gamma-secretase in the regulated secretory pathway must be targeted for drug inhibition to provide the greatest reduction of Abeta. Therefore, the Phase I project developed high-throughput assays for gamma-secretases in regulated secretory vesicles that produce Abeta. A candidate inhibitor of gamma-secretases was identified, which will provide the basis for design and synthesis of 'focused' and 'optimized' libraries for this Phase II project. Phase I results also indicate feasibility to find agents that selectively inhibit gamma-secretases-42 compared to gamma-secretases-40. The Phase I project also developed neuronal chromaffin cell and brain cortical neuron assays for Abeta in the regulated secretory pathway. The goal of this phase II project will be to utilize the regulated secretory vesicle as the major site and target of Abeta peptide production in neuronal cells, for identifying inhibitor molecules that selectively inhibit gamma-secretases-42 compared to gamma-secretases-40. Such inhibitors will be considered as lead compounds. In specific aim 1, efforts for 'focused' library compounds will be screened in the high throughput in vitro assays to identify inhibitors of gamma-secretases-40 and gamma-secretases-42 in chromaffin vesicles; inhibitors will then be tested in chromaffin cells for reduction of Abeta. In the second aim, further 'optimized' libraries will be designed and synthesized based on structural features of inhibitors from the 'focused' library, screened in the high throughput assays, and tested for reduction of Abeta in the regulated secretory pathway of neuronal chromaffin cells. In the third aim, lead compounds will undergo evaluation in brain neuronal cells to identify compounds that reduce production of Abeta peptides in the regulated secretory pathway. Results will likely identify novel lead compounds for future pre-clinical animal studies for development of effective drugs for AD.",

However, if solar energy could be used to produce hydrogen, then the hydrogen could be used as a fuel source for fuel cells, which in turn could produce totally clean energy 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will scale-up a new technology for producing high-surface area tantalum powders for the electronic capacitor industry.  The existing technology is over 30 years old and cannot keep pace with the needs of smaller electronics, which require tantalum particles in the nanometer size range.  In addition, environmental factors are driving the industry away from the fluorinated precursors that are presently used to make tantalum.  The proposed technology employs the Sodium Flame Encapsulation (SFE) technology to address this problem by producing nano-tantalum powders encapsulated in sodium chloride.  In-situ encapsulation allows for control of morphology and prevents oxidation of the nano-tantalum by air or moisture.  The technology has been shown to produce state-of-the-art capacitor materials with an environmentally-friendly process.  Nonetheless, the present process is a two step process involving post-processing of the nanopowders into the agglomerated structure needed by capacitor manufacturers.  This program will specifically develop the flame technology so that the post-processing step is unnecessary.  In this way powders can be produced with the appropriate morphology such that they only need to be washed and re-encapsulated to be a drop in replacement for existing materials.  The results will be a less expensive, higher efficiency, higher surface area material that is produced by a green technology.   Commercially, this technology will enable smaller, more versatile electronics by ensuring that the tantalum capacitor industry can continue to reduce its package size in line with the rest of the industry.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Influenza virus causes a pandemic disease of the respiratory tract that results in significant human morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis of influenza virus infection during the winter months makes up a large component of the clinical virology workload. The goal of this application is to develop transgenic cell lines that facilitate the detection of influenza virus (IV) in clinical specimens. Previously, we developed and patented methods for detecting and quantitating other RNA viruses such as Sindbis virus, a positive-strand RNA virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a negative-strand RNA virus. The RSV system, while very useful as a research tool, is too complicated in its present format to be useful in a diagnostic test for clinical virology laboratories. Recently, we began working to develop an influenza virus detection system. We constructed a plasmid in which a polymerase I promoter drives transcription of an influenza A virus artificial genomic RNA segment that carries a firefly luciferase gene. Interestingly, we have found that infection of cells transfected with this eDNA exhibited a high level of luciferase whereas uninfected cells expressed background levels. We plan to build on this result and make equivalent influenza B artificial genomic RNA. We will then use these constructs to generate stable cell lines that express a reporter gene only in response to influenza A and/or influenza B virus infection. Such cell lines will form the basis of an influenza detection test which will be developed in Phase II in collaboration with Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. Athens, OH, and modeled after an existing FDA approved test for herpes simplex virus (ELVIS(r)-HSV).",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project will develop highly miniaturized power converters by developing a functional, scaled-down hardware prototype of a high-temperature multichip power module (MCPM). To achieve this goal, the company has taken advantages of the key benefits of silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors  which include high-temperature operation, high switching frequencies, low switching losses, and high power densities. While Phase I of the project was focused upon successfully proving the feasibility of high-temperature MCPM's, Phase II will be focused on developing full prototype modules. The Phase II project will further develop high-temperature packaging techniques and investigate long term reliability issues associated with high-temperature operation. At the conclusion of Phase II, the company will deliver two high-temperature MCPM modules. The first prototype delivery will be a fully functional 4-hp 3-phase motor drive MCPM capable of 250 degrees C operation, and the second prototype will be a 30 kW 3-phase motor drive that demonstrates an order of magnitude miniaturization over modern state-of-the-art silicon based systems. Since current silicon electronics are typically limited to approximately 150 degrees C maximum temperature of operation, the high-temperature research proposed in this project has the potential to greatly enhance scientific understanding of high-temperature failure mechanisms, thermal induced electronic packaging stresses, and long-term interconnect reliability issues, in addition to technical advancement of state-of-the-art power electronics systems. The commercialization of SiC based MCPM's has the potential to find benefit in nearly every electric motor drive, power supply, or power converter conceivable. The application of such MCPM's could save electrical energy consumption worldwide, due to the improved electrical efficiency of SiC power switches alone. Furthermore, an immediate commercialization application is possible in the development of high-temperature geological petroleum exploration instrumentation and  also in industrial motors.  Other long term benefits would be found with application to complex weight critical power systems (such as in spacecraft), high-temperature systems (such as fuel cell electronics or electric vehicle motors), and other high efficiency power systems.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop and implement as software methods for entering, processing, and analyzing species distribution monitoring data, which is one of the most basic forms of biological information that comes from surveys, censuses, and other routine assessments. These methods will use basic monitoring data to (1) assess the status and trends of the monitored species at the population-level, and (2) estimate the input parameters for the more advanced quantitative models, thereby increasing the use of these models, which include population viability analysis models, habitat models and other GIS-based methods, and quantitative risk criteria, such those used by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and the NatureServe. One of the major innovations of the proposed software will be its treatment of uncertainty. Ecological data are often scarce and uncertain, including spatial and temporal variation, measurement and sampling errors, and demographic variance. The methods to be implemented in the proposed software will account for this uncertainty and incorporate it into the assessment of status and other outputs produced. Broader impacts of the project will include standardization of the monitoring process for a broad spectrum of species, significantly reducing the cost of processing and analyzing monitoring data and increasing the use of advanced quantitative models in relation to environmental issues. This will, in turn, increase the use of scientific information in environmental decision-making and policy formulation. The methods developed in this project will also allow incorporating data uncertainties in an objective, transparent, and credible way, thereby providing scientifically credible and sound summary of the status and trends of the species monitored. The proposed methods will be implemented as software. Expected commercial applications include software sales and contracts for specific applications of the software.",

        "abstract": "The pulp and paper industry require the removal or bleaching of lignin as an important manufacturing step for many of their products. Chemical bleaching is the preferred current process for whitening because of its relatively low cost. The bleaching process uses large amounts of chlorinated and caustic chemicals to brighten raw pulp which is brown in color due to the presence of residual lignin. Depending on the bleaching chemicals used, the liquid waste stream may contain a number of toxic chemicals which may eventually accumulate in rivers and oceans. Additionally, wastes from bleaching tanks may emit hazardous air pollutants. Consequently, large amounts of chlorinated organic byproducts such as dioxin are generated. The successful completion of this project would provide an enzymatic alternative to chemical bleaching. This process would have a positive impact on the environment by eliminating many of the unwanted caustic products released. The key to the successful adoption of an enzymatic process will be to develop a system of production for the enzyme that can compete favorably in function and cost. Early work has suggested that transgenic plants may be able to provide such as system and the work proposed here is focused on demonstrating this in a practical manner.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project develops the concept of using hand-held, mobile devices to link the physical world to information networks using advanced pattern and symbol recognition technology that will be deployed on the mobile device. The proposed mobile symbol recognition technology will enable many opportunities for mobile e-commerce by recognizing bar codes, text on documents and user-customizable icons that are used to carry and convey information. To address these opportunities, technical challenges associated with limited processing power and memory resources, lower-quality optics in cameras, varying available network bandwidth, and the diversified development platforms they represent must be overcome.  The advances proposed include the ability to unwarp images to account for distortions due to perspective imaging and lenses, removing imaging artifacts such as non-uniform lighting and highlights, deblurring images caused by fixed focus and motion, and improving the image contrast all within the resource constraints of the mobile devices.  Recognition algorithms in the system must be able to automatically identify and decode various barcodes symbologies, handle multiple languages and fonts for Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and be trainable for user customizable icons.  Special consideration must be given to cross platform development so algorithms can be efficiently and robustly embedded in different development platforms. The ability to perform image processing and pattern recognition algorithms on diversified handheld devices will provide advances in fields such as computer vision, mobile computing, and software engineering.  This concept is powerful in that it requires no new infrastructure, since it uses popular mobile devices, and existing symbols such as barcode tags, text, and user-customizable icons. The downloadable symbol recognition component will enable many applications. Other than service providers and OEMs, merchants, advertisers, information providers and other service providers are likely partners and customers for our technology. Finally, the technology can be used to help disadvantaged groups (handicapped or visually impaired, for example) get access to product information (prescription drug instructions, for example) or transact commerce activity conveniently, using a device they may already have, or that is easily acquired. These include applications in medical care delivery, military applications, sign recognition for the visually challenged, and others.",

Double-beta decay experiments, solar neutrino experiments, and dark matter searches would all benefit from this technology.  Plastics are among the materials with lowest radioactive contaminations, but they are usually not considered suitable because of their modest range of operating temperatures and their outgassing properties.  This project will develop vessels made from high purity fluoropolymers, addressing the common problems of thermal expansion and stability at extreme temperatures, and vacuum/pressure sealing and plumbing, while maintaining ultra-low radioactivity properties.  In particular, modified polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) sintering and sealing process methods will be developed, leading to the production a 67 liter chamber for the Enriched Xenon Observatory (EXO). In Phase I, PTFE welding techniques were developed both for sealing the chamber and for attaching plumbing and adapter fittings; a technique was developed that successfully fused the chamber material while maintaining an interior temperature low enough to avoid damaging the drift cell components installed inside; and the chamber was installed at the EXO laboratory at Stanford University.  Phase II will fabricate a larger prototype chamber for the EXO Project, and also develop PTFE welding techniques for thicker container wall sections.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The processing methods developed to fabricate the modified PTFE chamber should have application to semiconductor processing and chemical handling components, bio-reactors and other high purity bio-pharmaceutical labware, and medical devices.  The ultra-low radioactive background properties may have use national security applications.

        "abstract": "Spray drift is one of the most significant issues presently facing agricultural applicators. Agricultural applicators are committed to the management of chemical drift and take responsibility on a daily basis for making good decisions in the field. Material that drifts off-site is material that is not applied to the target crop or pest and represents both wasted time and wasted material. This equals increased costs for the farmer, applicator and consumer. Materials that drift off-site can be a serious financial liability, particularly if surrounding crops are negatively impacted either by actual crop damage or by unacceptable, off-label, residues present on the crop. Environmental concerns for air and water quality protection and for habitat and endangered species protection make off-site spray drift an increasingly \"hot issue\". Many waterways, protected habitats and endangered species are adjacent to agricultural areas where materials are applied. Drift into/onto protected or particularly sensitive areas presents a serious liability for both the applicator and the environment. The proposed reverse venturi atomization (RVA) chamber is a potential strategy to mitigate the problem of off-site drift. By creating droplets within the RVA chamber where air speed in controlled, we propose to minimize the effects of air shear, reduce the overall percentage of droplets in the less than 200 micron range.",

There exists a critical clinical need for the identification and development of novel therapies for psychosis, a major unmet medical need. Low levels of the brain peptide neurotensin (NT) have been linked to schizophrenia, hence NT receptor agonists that can be delivered to the brain have significant potential for development as a new class of antipsychotics that might not have the side- effects associated with current drugs. In Phase I and the first year of Phase II of this program, ABS201, a derivative of the active fragment of NT, NT[8-13], was identified as the most promising lead for development from a comprehensive screen of over 50 NT[8-13] analogs. This compound showed strong efficacy in the key rat models of psychosis, did not cause catalepsy, and animals did not develop resistance to it. Most notably, it is active at a  druggable  dose when administered orally. During the rest of the Phase II proposal, a detailed preclinical and clinical plan was completed for further development of ABS201, and many of the IND-enabling experiments were completed with successful outcomes. In addition, a critical set of experiments to define the site and mechanism of action of the compound was completed successfully. The goal of this follow-on Phase II is to perform activities necessary for advancing ABS201 through Phase I of clinical trials. This will be achieved through completion of four Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, GMP synthesis of sufficient amounts of the compound to finish preclinicals and bridge it into the Phase I clinical trial will be performed. In Specific Aim 2 the outstanding preclinical experiments will be completed enabling preparation and submission of the IND, the goal of Specific Aim 3. Completion of the Phase I clinical trial is the objective of Specific Aim 4. Specific Aim 1 will be completed at Genzyme Pharmaceuticals, the designated GMP synthesis laboratory. Specific Aim 2 will be managed by Argolyn in collaboration with Summit Drug Development (who wrote the clinical plan) using high quality CROs to perform the experiments. Specific Aims 3 and 4 will be managed by Argolyn and Summit with the site(s) of the Phase I trials to be determined. Evidence linking NT to schizophrenia has accumulated over the last 30 years, the proposed clinical trial would be the first in which a NT derivative is evaluated in humans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: During Phase I and II of this project a derivative of the endogenous brain peptide neurotensin, ABS-201, has demonstrated the characteristics necessary for development as an orally available, first-in-class antipsychotic. Completion of various activities designed to take ABS201 through Phase I of clinical trials, including synthesis of GMP-grade material, completion of preclinicals, and the preparation and submission of an IND, is the goal of this proposal.",

In Phase I, we developed a unique, multi-parameter, individualized, trainable seizure predetection system which extracts spectral, wavelet and time domain features and uses recurrent neural networks to analyze many hours of multichannel EEG and predetect seizure onsets with a high level of accuracy and reliability. The underlying analytical software for this system was tested on large database of scalp EEG recordings from five epilepsy centers and contained over 373 hours of recordings from 17 patients containing 50 seizures. This is a large database compared to those reported by most investigators in this field. Phase I results were very accurate and reliable (sensitivity: 100%, false positive rate 0.02/hr and detection times that occurred an average of 9.1 seconds, before seizure onset). This is entirely acceptable for our primary target application, of warning of a seizure onset to enable timely diagnostic injection to locate the brain region where the seizure starts using SPECT imaging. In Phase II we will refine the detection process, validate performance in a large data set, implement the software in C++ modules, and test the commercial prototype in a clinical setting. These steps will result in a company supported Phase III product development, integration into existing EEG recording systems, beta testing and commercialization. While Phase 2 will concentrate on the SPECT application using scalp electrodes, the scalp EEG techniques developed will be applicable without change for general use in an epilepsy monitoring facility to alert staff of impending seizures and allow them to attend to patient safety in a timely manner. Predetection will also facilitate neuropsychological or other testing in the epilepsy monitoring environment. With additional work, the techniques developed can be applied to ambulatory devices for seizure alert, or for episodic vagal nerve stimulation to block seizures.",

This machine is capable of machining metal parts that are sized within 50mm cube to an accuracy within one micron. Our goal is to develop a micro machine that is applicable to a broad commercial market. Three additional features need to be added to make the machine fully commercially viable. These three features are: an automatic tool sensor; an automatic tool changer; and, automatic part programming utilizing data from computer aided design programs. The proposed Phase 2 research focuses on developing those three features. Our proposed research will also focus on developing a micro machine that is to be operated in an office or laboratory environment, away from the usual manufacturing factory settings. When this capacity is fully developed a significant reduction in initial investment, energy usage, shipping costs and delay times will occur, with corresponding benefits throughout this now untapped market.   COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The present technology for making micro sized parts uses large and costly machines. Typically these machines are Swiss-made turning centers that cost between $300,000 and $600,000 each. The technology developed by Atometric during the proposed Phase 2 research will enable micro sized parts to be manufactured at a greatly reduced cost. The parts will be made at the point where they are needed, not at a remote factory location. The capital investment required to support the manufacturing process will be reduced by a factor of four. The energy required will be reduced by, at a minimum, a factor of ten. The procurement time required to actually acquire the micro part will be reduced by eliminating the need to work through distant factories. Therefore, the commercial application for the Atometric micro machine is wherever micro sized parts are now made and/or utilized. This market is now large and is expanding.",

        "abstract": "75661S  The production of hydrogen fuel from renewable resources such as solar and wind in distributed-generation, small-scale applications would provide an environmentally-benign, truly sustainable transportation fuel supply.  But before this can be achieved, the hydrogen generating systems must become as reliable as home appliances (e.g., central air conditioning or furnaces), which require only annual maintenance.  The primary source of reliability problems is the separate mechanical compressor, which supplies high pressure hydrogen for portable applications, and its elimination is critical to achieving this goal.  This project will develop a prototype of a renewably powered, hydrogen fuel producer that supplies high-pressure gas (5,000 to 10,000 psi) to a hydrogen fuel dispenser for the depot-style fueling of commercial or agricultural vehicles, without  additional compression or power conditioning equipment.  The approach will be based on an innovative ultra-high pressure electrolysis system that has the potential to deliver hydrogen fuel at pressures exceeding 10,000 psi, directly from the electrolysis cell.  Phase I:  (1) ran parametric tests on an ultra-high pressure electrolysis cell to determine the efficiency of producing fuel grade hydrogen; (2) linked an existing high-pressure electrolyzer to a PV array and ran additional tests to determine production at various light conditions and electrolyzer cell configurations; and (3) developed a conceptual design for a stand-alone, PV-powered, high-pressure electrolyzer system that includes a hydrogen fuel dispenser.  Phase II will complete the detailed system design and demonstrate key systems related to the safety and manufacture of a hydrogen fueling station.  Then, the hydrogen fueling station will be fabricated and tested.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should contribute to the substantial market for distributed hydrogen fuel generation for vehicles (including internal combustion engines in the near term, and general fuel cell powered transportation in the long term).  The technology should also support small-scale renewable energy storage for 24/7 availability, peak shaving, and load leveling.",

Chickens are able to produce large amounts of protein in their eggs at relatively low cost. We seek to harness this capability to synthesize pharmaceutical proteins, such as humanized monoclonal antibodies, that are needed in large amounts.  The efficiency of transgenesis in chickens, particularly with large transgenes, is exceedingly low. We propose here to overcome this hurdle by the use of integration-promoting enzymes which are able to recombine specific DMA sequences with a high efficiency.  In Phase II of this project, the integration-promoting enzymes will be used to insert transgenes encoding pharmaceutical proteins, and driven by egg white specific promoters, into the genome of chickens. This novel technology will expedite the creation of chickens that can produce Pharmaceuticals, thereby facilitating drug development, enhancing clinical trials and lowering the cost of Pharmaceuticals.",

Such a system would also be valuable in various other applications where body segment 6-DOF three-dimensional (3-D) motion tracking is needed. Examples of such applications include outcome evaluation after total knee or hip replacement, external prosthesis adjustment for amputees, monitoring of rehabilitation progress, and gait analysis in patients with neurological diseases. Presently available systems for measuring gait parameters are limited by one or more of the following constraints: (1) small \"capture volumes\" that severely limit the number of contiguous steps that can be collected without interruption (e.g., turns); (2) collection of temporal gait information only (no spatial parameters); (3) high cost; and/or (4) inconvenience (e.g., need to mount foot switches within shoes or taped to the bottoms of the feet, access to a motion laboratory, etc.). Barren Associates, Inc.

Our proposed technique provides the ability to quantify pathogenic bacteria down to less than 10 cells/mL in less than one hour with a minimum of false positives or negatives. The proposed instrument is fully integrated and includes a cartridge containing multiple capillary column-based bioseparator/bioreactors (for pathogen capture), and a liquid core waveguide (LCW) optical detector (for pathogen detection). It will not require pre-enrichment of target bacteria in growth medium and all steps of the assay will require minimal operator skill. Microbial contamination of food products by pathogenic bacteria is a major concern of our society. Contaminated food is estimated to cause 76 million illnesses, 325,000 serious illnesses resulting in hospitalization, and 5,000 deaths in the United States each year. The economic impact of foodborne illness has been estimated as high as $10 billion annually. The Center for Science in the Public Interest reported that fruits and vegetables are the leading culprits in confirmed cases of foodborne illness in the United States. Of particular concern is the presence of pathogens in imported produce. Because of the persistence of these pathogens on fresh produce, both FDA and USDA have supported research on developing standardized methods to determine the efficacy of proposed sanitizer strategies for inactivating these pathogens on fresh produce. A heat kill step is not feasible for such foods. An obvious companion need in the U.S. food safety program is a rapid, simple method, such as is proposed here, to determine the number of pathogens that persist after the sanitizing step has been administered.",

We propose to significantly expand the course content and its evaluation in Phase II. We will again use an iterative process of development, relying on extensive end-user testing as well as feedback from a panel of scientific and DBT experts.

Drug metabolism problems such as drug interactions and production of toxic metabolites cause many of the adverse reactions that contribute to the extremely high failure rate of clinical trials. The most promising approach for effectively managing individual differences in drug response is the implementation of pharmacogenetic strategies for predicting drug metabolism in each patient. However, critical information on which enzymes are metabolizing drug candidates and how enzyme function is affected by genetic variation is lacking because in vitro assays for profiling compound metabolism with individual drug metabolizing enzymes are not available. Sulfation is a major route of drug metabolism carried out by a family of 12 enzymes in humans, and recently an additional 25 sulotransferase allozymes were identified, many with functional phenotypes. In Phase I, we developed a homogenous, fluorescent high throughput screening (HTS) method called donor product fluorescence polarization immunoassay (DP-FPIA) that provides a universal screening platform for measuring sulfation of any compound by any SUIT isoform. In Phase II, we will optimize the performance of the assay for pharma HTS isolating a highly selective monoclonal antibody against a nucleotide and synthesizing conjugates of red fluors-to' the same nucleotide. In addition a full panel of 20 human sulfotransferases - including several important genetic variants - will be expressed, and purified in parallel using automated, multfwell methods. We will then validate the assay for high throughput screening and kinetic analysis using prototypic substrates, drugs, and hormones screened against the full panel of sulfotransferases. The sulfotransferase DP-FPIA platform will be marketed in a kit format to pharmacuetical companies for preclinical metabolism studies and lead optimization. The unique capabilities of the DP-FPIA and the availability of a panel of recombinant sulfotransferases will enable a systematic delineation of human drug sulfation capacity and how it is affected by genetic variation.",

This product does not currently exist due to technical difficulties in measuring the substrate or gallium nitride (GaN) epilayer in a region where they absorb energy.  During Phase I of this program the company  showed possible solutions to this problem that it can implement as the work progresses to Phase II.  This SBIR Phase II program will address scientific and technical issues that  has hindered the  adoption of the Reflectivity Compensated Pyrometry (RCP) in the growth  of  GaN  light  emitting  diodes  (LEDs),  the  basis  of  solid  state  lighting  sources.    This program will result in a commercial instrument for directly measuring surface temperature during manufacture of visible and UV LEDs.  Typical temperature variations during the growth of GaN-based LEDs results in a product which, even over a 2dimensional substrate, requires the LEDs to be separated  into  those  with  similar  characteristics.    Existing  temperature  measurements  do  not allow the accurate measurement of the substrate or the GaN epilayer because they are transparent at the measurement wavelength of ~1 micron.  Commercially, this project will increase manufacturing productivity in wide-bandgap materials and LED manufacture by providing better process control data. The improved manufacturing yields of LED's enabled by this work will lead to more widespread adoption of LEDs for solid state lighting with the accompanying economic and environmental benefits.  For example, the use of LEDs has already saved the US economy nearly 10 TWh per year (equivalent to one large power plant) of energy in the niche applications implemented so far.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will fabricate a prototype betavoltaic battery in a form factor the size of a quarter coin. The goal will be to generate approximately 100 microwatts of electrical power in a volume less than half a cubic centimeter from a tritiated energy source. Research conducted for the Phase I portion of this project established the feasibility of constructing a semiconductor device that directly and efficiently converts the energy released from radioactive decay directly into electric current. Three dimensional (3D) diodes were constructed in macroporous silicon by placing p-n junctions along the walls of all the pores. These junctions formed the betavoltaic conversion layer for beta particles (electrons) emitted by gaseous tritium (the radioisotope of hydrogen with a half life of 12.3 years) that was distributed throughout the pore space. Measurements of the current-voltage responses for this novel 3D geometry demonstrated an order of magnitude efficiency increase compared to conventional 2Dplanar diodes. In the 3D diode nearly every decay electron entered the p-n conversion layers. The focus of the Phase II research will be to enhance the performance of the 3D diodes to maximize conversion efficiency. Also, the source energy density will be increased markedly by developing a tritiated solid that can be easily and routinely dispersed in the pore space. This research will lead to the development of a practical nuclear battery. Commercially, betavoltaic batteries will be useful in a wide variety of sensors and devices used for remote and extended missions in many inaccessible locations. Successful commercialization of this nuclear battery with its order of magnitude increase in useful life is to increase significantly the utilization of self-powered devices and sensors. Stringent efforts will be made to ensure the radiological safety  of these nuclear batteries at every step in the development, manufacturing and commercialization processes.",

The primary goal of this project is to make the LFCR methodology more accessible to researchers by providing a both a product and extensive support services. In Phase I, a prototype system was built and used to collect simultaneous physiological and cognitive data from 41 elementary school children. The LFCR consistently decreased when children attended to computerized tasks (i.e., under conditions requiring cognitive persistence). In a preliminary pilot study, children with ADHD did not have the same decrease in the LFCR when they attempted to pay attention on the same tasks; however, they did have decreased LFCR after taking their psycho stimulant medication. A secondary goal of this project is to more firmly establish the biological underpinnings of the LFCR. Prior to the Phase I work, angiotensin activity was hypothesized to mediate the relationship between LFCR, cerebral blood flow and cognitive activity. This hypothesis was partially confirmed with the empirical evidence collected in Phase I. Blood assays validated the connection between LFCR and circulating levels of angiotensin. Transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) data validated that connection between cerebral blood flow and LFCR. These results provide strong empirical support for the proposed biological model of cognitive persistence. This work will be expanded in Phase II through three main tasks. 1) The prototype will be further refined into a user-friendly commercial product. 2) The database of physiological changes in children and adults during cognitive performance will be enlarged using LFCR, TCD, and blood assays (adults only); ADHD participants will be tested before and after taking medication. 3) Strategic collaborations with researchers will be formed to demonstrate the value of the biological measure in other areas of research. Two impediments currently limit the use of LFCR in research studies. First, the biological basis of LFCR was inadequately characterized. The Phase I and II findings will address this limitation. Second, the methodology is too complex for most researchers without expertise in this area. BioAssessments will overcome this impediment by providing both turnkey equipment and extensive support throughout all stages of the research project. The feasibility of this business model will be demonstrated by Phase II collaborations and publications that serve as case studies. The anticipated Phase III customer will be a researcher studying impulsivity in disorders such as Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and substance abuse.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Beta-Amino acids are rapidly growing in importance as a key class of pharmaceutical intermediates, with applications in a number of current and future drugs. A cost-effective process for the production of optically pure beta-amino acids will be developed in this project to accommodate the commercial needs for beta-amino acids. The method involves two enzymatic reactions starting from conveniently prepared racemic substituted dihydrouracils. The 5,6-dihydrouracil, which may be substituted at either the 5 or 6 positions with various functional groups, is contacted with a dihydrouracilase enzyme to catalyze a stereoselective hydrolysis reaction, producing an enantiomerically-enriched chiral N-carbamoyl-beta-amino acid and an enantiomerically enriched, unreacted chiral 5,6-dihydrouracil. The chiral N-carbamoyl-(-amino acid was then decarbamoylated enzymatically to produce an optically pure (-amino acid. The opposite enantiomer of the beta-amino acid can be produced in pure form by recovering and hydrolyzing the unreacted chiral 5,6- dihydrouracil using the enzymes with opposite stereoselectivity. An important feature of this method is that the two enzyme reaction can be carried out in one pot and it is not necessary to isolate the intermediate N-carbamoyl-beta-amino acids. This proof of concept has been demonstrated in Phase 1 using 5,6-dihydrouracil and 5-methyl-5,6-dihydrouracil.      In Phase II, the top priority will be searching for carbamoylase enzymes with a broader substrate range, particularly including aryl-substituted N-carbamoyl-(-amino acids using directed evolution technology. Dihydrouracilases with opposite enantioselectivity (i.e. enantioselectively hydrolyzing the R-enantiomer of dihydrouracils) will also be found and produced. The cost-effective one-pot process to convert racemic substituted dihydrouracils to the corresponding enantiomerically pure beta-amino acids via the coupled dihydrouracilase/carbamoylase two-enzyme system in the non-immobilized and immobilized forms will be developed further using the enzymes acquired in Phase 2. Finally, the production of enantiomerically-pure beta-amino acids will be demonstrated on the 100 gram scale for important commercial targets.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glucuronidation is a major metabolic pathway for the inactivation and detoxification of endogenous and exogenous compounds in the human body. Glucuronides are formed by a super family of uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferases (UGTs) that convert a number of lipophilic xenobiotics (drugs, steroids, pollutants and pesticides) into more hydrophilic species by linking them to a polar sugar, which are then more readily eliminated from the body. Glucuronosyl derivatives of xenobiotic compounds are useful as standards in the analysis of urine or blood samples for illegal drugs, or exposure to biocides. They are also important in studies of the metabolism of new drugs, as metabolites might be more toxic or cause undesirable side effects. More recently, glucuronyl derivatives of pharmacologically active compounds have been investigated as potential prodrugs. As a result, efficient and economical methods for glucuronide production have been sought. The two main limitations for the preparative production of glucuronides needed as analytical standards are (1) the high cost of the UDP-glucuronic acid (UDPGA) co-factor and (2) the lack of availability and the relative instability of the human UGT isoforms, themselves. The former problem was resolved in the Phase I sponsored research, in which an efficient method was developed for the regeneration of UDPGA using a coupled enzyme method, thus reducing the cost of glucuronide production significantly. However, the lack of availability of the human UGTs remains to be a problem, as a result of the low yields produced in the baculovirus-infected insect cells currently used. In Phase II, we intend to solve the latter problem, by cloning and expressing 5 different UGT isozymes in E. coll., using our patented method for gene redesign and synthesis. To date, we have used this proprietary method to produce 7 human cytochromes with high activity at quantities not previously commercially available. We intend to use the knowledge gained from this to clone, express and produce human UGTs 1A1, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9 and 2B7 in the amounts necessary for the efficient synthesis of glucuronides at the preparative level.",

Phase II will develop the engineering and scale-up parameters for commercialization of the technology.  Tasks include culture isolation and optimization studies, further continuous reactor studies, light delivery studies, high-pressure studies, process scale-up, and economic projections.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In addition to the sequestration of carbon dioxide in cell biomass, the technology should have immediate application in desulfurizing LQNG or other gas streams.

IAC will develop an integrated, user friendly software program that will provide a reliable detailed classification of glaucomatous and non-glaucomatous defects with the main emphasis on glaucomatous defects and early detection. The aim is to achieve classification accuracy close to that of a highly skilled human expert. The diagnosis suggested by the software will be supported by a set of comprehensive rules extracted from the classification algorithm. Optionally, the program will provide measures of visual field and glaucoma progression.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to amplify and subsequent detection a target sequence with a limited length may satisfy the need  for diagnosing some of the diseases. Nevertheless, much biomedical research, such as cloning genes and analysis of genetics variation, often demands selective amplification of large DNA fragments in the kilo basepairs range. Currently Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is the only method used by researchers to amplify large DNA fragments. Although PCR is able to amplify a target up to 10-20 kb, a relatively high error rate due to the lack of proof-reading activity of Taq polymerase and the requirement of thermo-cycling may limit the use of PCR. The research proposed provides an alternative method to exponentially amplify medium range and long range DMA fragment at a constant temperature. A new isothermal DNA amplification method has been recently developed. This amplification technology, Helicase-Dependent Amplification (HDA), is based on the unwinding activity of a DNA helicase to separate two DNA strands generating single-stranded templates for primer hybridization and subsequent extension by a DNA polymerase. This amplification method is closer to nature's choice for the replication of genomic DNA. Thus, it may be a better way to amplify DNA. During the Phase I research, we demonstrated that, by using highly processive helicase RecBCD, we could amplify 1 kb DNA fragment and that it is feasible to increase the size of amplicon by coordinate activities of helicase and DNA polymerase. Therefore, we propose to further optimize the RecBCD-based HDA system and to improve coordination of HDA reaction by modulating the activity of helicase and DNA polymerase. The proposed product ultimately to be developed will be a RecBCD-based nucleic acid amplification kit capable of doing kilo-base range amplification at one temperature with high fidelity. Thus, amplification of a long DNA fragment could merely involve mixing a DNA sample with the HDA reagent mix and incubation in a water bath for one hour.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ability to directly and uniformly immobilize proteins onto surfaces in robust fashion with full retention of activity is a highly coveted goal in the fields of biodetection and bioengineering. More efficient attachment methods suitable for a wide range of polypeptides will lead to the development of high-value applications, devices and systems that will significantly impact research, drug discovery, diagnostics, biodetection, and biomimetics. The proposed goal of controlling molecular orientation during protein immobilization on inorganic surfaces is essential to emerging applications of biomimetics including biomineralization and nano-architecture. In this project, we achieve our objective through the development of fusion proteins with gold-binding peptides that confer high-affinity gold binding under mild conditions. In phase I we chose Protein A and Streptavidin as fusion partners because they have established commercial value in numerous applications. Compared to conventional procedures to immobilize polypeptides to gold, e.g., adsorption and chemical methods, our affinity tag for gold approach provides greater stability, reduced interference, and high specific activity of fusion partners, all of which contribute to higher sensitivity of biodetection. We achieved proof of concept in phase I and propose to complete the characterization and optimization of gold-binding of our fusion proteins with the goal of developing a high-affinity tag for immobilizing virtually any polypeptide on gold. In addition, we propose to develop prototype surface plasmon resonance biosensors using our fusion proteins for several commercial applications. Also, we propose to produce specific mutant forms of the gold-binding peptide to better understand the structure/activity relationship of gold binding with the goal of designing more efficient affinity tags for specialized applications using unique gold substrates, e.g., nanogold particles. Successful completion of phase II studies will produce high-value reagents and prototype sensor applications with strong commercial potential and significant societal benefits. In the long term, achieving our goals will significantly impact the areas of surface chemistry, biodetection, and biomaterials.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): The long-term goal of this SBIR is to minimize noise interference and improve patient mobility during Electroencephalogram (EEG) procedures with a new lightweight head-worn interface. EEG recordings are routinely used in diagnosing and evaluating many neurological disorders including epilepsy, sleep apnea, and encephalitis. Existing EEG instruments include sophisticated hardware and software, but they are still severely limited by inadequate interfaces between the electrodes on the patient's scalp and the measurement system. This restricts mobility, compromises signal integrity, and compromises connection reliability. BIOMEC proposes to design a miniaturized amplifier/processor circuit mounted on flexible boards in the shape of a light and thin headband worn by the patient. The headband will wirelessly interface with a PC thereby eliminating intermediate computer cards and bulky cabling. The Phase I project designed a 32- channel miniature system, constructed a single channel prototype, and tested the concept on the bench and on five patients with results that met or exceeded expectations. The Phase II project optimized the circuit board layout, designed preliminary headband packaging, developed firmware and software, manufactured prototypes, and tested the complete system on 12 patients. This Phase II Type 2 proposal will reduce the size of the headband even further, enhance the hardware, make the system completely wireless, enhance the firmware and software, finalize the system packaging, create pre-production prototypes, conduct all the safety testing required by the FDA, and submit a FDA 510(k) application.",

Catheter-related infection comprises approximately half of all complications while catheter-induced thrombosis (fibrin sheath formation and mural thrombosis) compound 25% of all failures associated with catheter long-term presence in the vascular system. Blood compatible coatings have been investigated in recent years in order to improve material biocompatibility by reducing thrombogenicity through diminished protein adhesion.  Numerous studies indicate that thrombogenic properties of a foreign surface can be significantly reduced by surface modifications. One of the more promising types of surface biolization technologies is a surfactant polymer coating (SPC) that attempts to mimic nature, in particular the properties of glycocalyx of vascular endothelium cells. It has been demonstrated through in vitro studies that SPC significantly reduces fibrinogen, and platelet adhesion and activation. Additional practical advantages of SPC are its low cost and simplicity of application to the surface of medical device. In Phase I, we determined the stability of the surfactant coating on polyurethane through in vitro shear studies corresponding to the shear rates experienced by a central venous catheter. Further, through series of ex vivo experiments using dog models, we determined that the SPC reduces fibrinogen and platelet adhesion to the coated surfaces. A reduction of over 80% of platelet adhesion to the SPC. was demonstrated in reference to non-coated medical grade polyurethane surfaces. This demonstrated the feasibility of SPCs for central venous catheters. The aim of Phase II research is to validate the biocompatibility of the coatings through in vivo studies in rats for long-term use. We will focus our investigation on two aspects: reduction of the fibrous sleeve on the catheter surface by SPC and reduction of catheter-related infections with SPC. After successful Phase II completion, we will be prepared to start human clinical trials and to finish the commercialization process.",

Inadequate biocompatibility of foreign surfaces contacting the patient's blood contributes to the activation of blood proteolytic systems such as coagulation, complements, fibrinolysis and also activates cellular blood components. This can result in a potentially life threatening systemic inflammatory response. BIOMEC has developed a novel and promising type of surfactant polymer coating (SPC), which can be used to substantially improve the biocompatibility of these devices. As a result of our Phase II SBIR effort, BIOMEC has improved the process of surfactant polymer synthesis, which allows for reproducible production of larger volumes of the material necessary for extensive coating and testing.  In vitro performance of SPC coated blood pumps in human blood was compared to the uncoated pumps (negative control) and to heparin coated pumps (positive control). We demonstrated that SPC prevents surface platelet and neutrophils adsorption with efficacy at least equivalent and generally better than heparin coating. The surfactant coating also significantly lowers the hemolysis rate in comparison to heparin-coated pumps. Preliminary toxicity testing and in vivo studies (pig model) indicate that the coating is biologically safe and does not affect the pump hemodynamic performance. An additional advantage of SPC over heparin coatings is its extreme simplicity of application to existing commercial devices, and hence its low cost.  In this project phase we propose to continue biological safety evaluation of SPC according to FDA requirements. Further, upon approval of an Investigational Device Exemption we will conduct a pilot clinical study to conclusively demonstrate the in vivo safety and effectiveness of SPC coated cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. As the result of these efforts, BIOMEC will have developed an effective yet inexpensive blood compatible coating for blood contacting devices.",

The white-footed mouse is the major natural reservoir of Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiological agent of Lyme disease.  Ixodes scapularis ticks acquire B. burgdorferi from infected mice (and other wildlife reservoirs) and transmit it to uninfected mice.  This cycle maintains the zoonosis in endemic areas.  Breaking the mouse-tick cycle by eliminating B. burgdorferi from its mouse reservoir and/or from the ticks that feed on them would markedly reduce the risk of Lyme disease.  The goal of this proposal is to develop an oral immunization delivery system that can be safely deployed into the wild in endemic areas to vaccinate vertebrates known to be reservoir hosts for B. burgdorferi therefore breaking the enzootic cycle of this pathogen.   In Phase I of this SBIR we proposed to develop an oral wildlife bait vaccine comprised of OspA, and if effective, OspC/OspA, using E. coli as a freeze-dried vehicle for immunogen delivery.  In this Phase II proposal, the vaccine formulation developed in Phase I will be delivered orally to Lyme disease susceptible inbred mice.  First, mice will be immunized by oral gavage inoculation and subsequently challenged by B. burgdorferi infected I.scapularis (nymphs). Second, a bait vaccine will be tested by admixing mouse chow with freeze-dried E. coli expressing the immunogen and challenging the mice as described above. Additionally, we will begin performance testing required for regulatory review. The development of an inexpensive, highly specific, effective, and easily distributable vaccine to decrease the prevalence of B. burgdorferi in tick populations around human communities could significantly reduce the incidence of Lyme disease cases within the several years of its introduction and will lead to the indirect control of human Lyme disease.",

        "abstract": "The benefits of biodiesel are well documented. Problems related to fuel quality, filter plugging, injector failure, material compatibility, and fuel economy persist and must be resolved before wide spread use of biodiesel can be addressed. Most of these problems are due to the presence of double bonds in the fatty acid residues, which impacts its oxidation and storage stability. These inherent problems hinder the use of biodiesel in cold temperatures, negatively affect fuel economy, increase particulate emission, and lead to power loss. We have demonstrated a potentially simple and efficient chemical modification whereby the soy-based oil is cleaved at the double bonds, thus eliminating all unsaturation and reducing the overall molecular weight of the fuel. This one-step process is fast, selective and simple which, is expected to provide an economical route to improve the quality of vegetable-based biodiesel fuels. Our process should increase the cetane number, decrease NOx emission and alleviate filter plugging and gumming. Our modification can also extend the low temperature flow characteristics of current biodiesel and thus eliminate cold flow issues. The replacement of 1% of current on-road diesel fuel with biodiesel would require 300 million gallon biodiesel or 215 million bushels of soybeans.

Label-based assays are time- and labor-intensive, yield limited information, and consume large amounts of expensive biomolecules and chemical libraries. Almost every target requires a different assay; and each new assay can take a year or more to develop. In fact, assay development has become the bottleneck in drug discovery and development, and constitutes a large chunk of the total costs. This SBIR program will develop a label-free, mix-and-measure platform assay, called ?SERS that can be used with any biomolecule target to detect the binding of any small ligand, with little or no assay development. Phase I showed ?SERS is exquisitely sensitive; can detect molecules in the 100-500 Da size range binding to enzymes, lectins, and DMA; can produce information on the binding chemistries involved; and is free from many artifacts that affect other label-free assays. On Phase II, the sensitivity will be improved even further, to enable high-throughput analysis; the assay will be miniaturized, so that only traces of biomolecules and compound libraries are consumed; and demonstrated with a wide range of biomolecules, including DMA, carbohydrates, and diverse proteins. Phase II will also showcase the ability to collect data from complex interactions involving two ligands, monitoring the amount of each ligand that binds, and their impact on each other and on the biomolecule. This platform will have many applications, including cost-effective high-throughput screening for drug lead identification and optimization; rapid in vitro adsorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) and toxicity assays; chemoproteomics (protein interaction profiling with small ligands); and functional glycomics (carbohydrate binding interactions).

In gerontology, meta analyses have led to treatment recommendations or new insights in such areas as memory loss with normal aging; identifying, predicting, and treating Alzheimer's disease and dementia; aspirin and the secondary prevention of stroke; drug therapies for osteoporosis; and Parkinson's Disease, among many others. While every Meta analysis is concerned both with the average treatment effect and with the variation in treatment effects from one study to the next, researchers tend to focus primarily on the former. In fact, though, the variation in the treatment effect from one study to the next may be as important, and sometimes more important, than the average treatment effect. If a treatment reduces the risk of death for younger patients while increasing the risk of death for older patients, then the average effect is, at best, misleading. If we need to choose between two potentially helpful interventions for patients, the question we need to ask is not whether or not each one works at all, but whether it works better than the other. The goal of this project is to develop software for Meta regression, the technique developed to study the variation in treatment effects and address these questions.

Current prostheses are not capable of emulating the biological and physical properties of the normal arterial wall, resulting in high failure rates. In phase I, a nanofibrous biocomposite small-diameter vascular graft comprised of Dacron and Type IV collagen (ESDC) was synthesized, with kinkresistance created within the graft structure. This novel thin-walled graft had minimal water permeation and excellent physical properties. The potent antithrombin agent recombinant hirudin (rHir) and endothelial cellspecific mitogen Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) were then covalently bound to the ESDC surface (ESDC-rHir-VEGF). These surface bound agents were biologically active as determined via specific in vitro assays and showed stability under simulated arterial flow conditions. Lastly, the ESDC graft showed excellent handling characteristics when implanted into a canine femoral artery in a preliminary in vivo evaluation of the graft. The goal of this Phase II proposal is to assess blood permeation and graft patency/healing of the ESDC-rHir-VEGF graft using a canine arterial grafting model. Our hypothesis is that the next generation of prosthetic arterial grafts will have to possess multiple structural and biological properties that mimic some of those processes inherent to native arteries in order to prevent complications such as thrombosis from occurring. The specific objectives of Phase II are to: 1) synthesize ESDC vascular grafts for implantation studies, 2) develop an automated graft synthesis process, 3) evaluate physical and chemical properties of the ESDC graft, 4) covalently immobilize rHir and VEGF to ESDC surface, 5) assess in vivo acute and chronic implantation periods, and 6) examine macroscopically/microscopically explanted grafts. Phase III of this project will continue long-term assessment of this novel ESDC-rHir-VEGF graft in the canine femoral arterial grafting model employed in Phase II. Development of a bioactive small-diameter vascular graft would have a significant impact on small vessel repair and replacement. These grafts could be utilized in peripheral bypass as well as for coronary artery bypass, which have some 500,000 grafts implanted annually in the United States. Potentially, the annual market value for an \"off-the-shelf\" synthetic arterial bypass graft could exceed $1.5 billion.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is to continue development of a novel interstitial cooled laser delivery system for improved thermal therapy.  The system is intended to find applications in the thermal destruction of cancerous tumors.  Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is an ideal method for minimally invasive treatment of localized tumors, but has so far failed to gain widespread clinical acceptance due to limitations of current interstitial applicators.  In Phase I, we designed, built, and tested a novel cooled laser fiber (CLF) delivery apparatus which includes an advanced integrated diffusing tip fiber optic along with an improved means for heat removal from both the fiber optic and tissue in close proximity to the applicator.  We characterized the system in vitro and in vivo and demonstrated that the system was superior to non-cooled applicators for creating larger laser lesions in a safe and reliable manner.   In Phase II we will extend our initial development efforts and refine the CLF device by optimizing materials, expanding size configurations, improving construction methods, and investigating optimal cooling parameters.  In addition, we plan to add features to the device that will allow rotation and translation of the internal fiber optic delivery element for asymmetric lesion production.  Finally we will fully characterize the complete system in primary target tissues by examining lesion sizes resulting from various laser powers, wavelengths, cooling rates, and exposure durations.  A major goal throughout this work will be to acquire sufficient data necessary for completion and submission of a 510(k) application with the FDA.",

Over the past four years, BioTex has developed the Visualase(r) thermal therapy system for treatment of localized cancers by using temperature-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to precisely control the delivery of laser energy and the extent of tissue destruction.   The current primary target applications for this system are small focal secondary or metastatic tumors in the brain and localized cancer in the prostate. Secondary applications include treatment of metastatic lesions in vertebral bodies, and unresectable liver tumors. Approximately 40,900 primary brain tumors and over 100,000 metastatic brain tumors will be diagnosed this year in the U.S. Additionally, 190,000 American men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, and over 30,000 will die from the disease. Of the 1.3 million patients who will be diagnosed with cancer this year (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers), approximately 5-10% will develop problematic secondary metastatic tumors in the spine which will require intervention.   In the first year of the proposed study, we will engage in pre-clinical studies and administrative activities required for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of an investigative device exemption (IDE). In the second and third years, we will conduct a Phase I clinical trial to explore the safety and utility of the Visualase system for treatment of patients will small focal metastatic brain tumors, particularly those which are deep-seated or otherwise inoperable. At the end of this study, we will have explored the clinical feasibility and safety of intracerebral laser therapy for treatment of small focal metastatic lesions, and we will have advanced the Visualase system and components to a feature and production level appropriate for 510(k) pre-market approval. This combination of stereotactic laser thermal therapy with real-time MRI will facilitate an unprecedented integration of the diagnostic and therapeutic environments.",

        "abstract": "75616B  Superconducting radio frequency cavities, used in high energy accelerators, are produced by the sheet metal forming of multiple sections, which are then joined by high-vacuum, electron-beam welding.  The welding procedures are very expensive and produce flaws and contamination that limit cavity performance.  Simpler approaches, based on the shaping of seamless tubes, have been hindered by limited formability and performance-limiting surface roughness.  This project will develop a technique for manufacturing superconducting radio frequency cavities from highly formable, seamless niobium tubes. The seamless tubes will be produced from billets of ultra-fine grained niobium processed by equal channel angular extrusion.  In Phase I a novel billet processing method, equal channel angular extrusion, was used to refine the grain structure of bulk niobium.  Analytical results revealed a significant improvement in this bulk material over the currently used sheet metal.  In Phase II, the process will be scaled-up to process full size billets, produce 150 mm diameter seamless tubes, and produce and test full-scale superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities for the International Linear Collider (ILC).  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The demand for RRR niobium for SRF Cavities is expected to reach 1,000,000 pounds by 2012, at a cost approaching $250M for sheet metal, with another $150M or so for welding.  The technology developed in this program should eliminate welding costs and offer a higher quality product at a substantial cost advantage.  Sales could well approach a hundred million dollars for the International Linear Collider program alone.  Lower cost, higher performance accelerators also would have applications in other fields:  over 10,000 accelerators are now used worldwide for medical diagnostics, advanced materials characterization, communications, military devices, structural biology, pharmacology, and environmental studies.",

Accurate electrocardiographic recognition of arrhythmias facilitates appropriate therapy and avoids complications that could result from either failure to recognize the arrhythmia or failure to employ appropriate management.        The objective is to develop a novel, highly interactive, Internet-based teaching and testing program on arrhythmia recognition of electrocardiograms (ECGs) for medical trainees, utilizing actual patient data and custom animations. Three components-tutorial animations, rapid assessment skills of printouts, and preparation for board exams-will improve medical trainees' ECG interpretation skills, and improve them more quickly than traditional education. In addition, the development of an authoring tool will allow instructors to create new content rapidly from their own ECG collection for teaching and testing. Internet distribution of the program will allow trainees and instructors to use the program without any special hardware or software other than a personal computer and a browser like Internet Explorer or Netscape. For situations where access to the Internet is not practical, a stand-alone version will be available for local networks or for single computers. To measure the program's effectiveness in improving skills, in Phase I the program will be evaluated in a small pilot study of medical trainees at two teaching hospitals, expanding to several other sites in Phase II.        The market for effective ECG training software is large, and includes residency training programs, cardiology fellowships, as well as advanced practice nursing programs. As certification for ECG over-reading privileges becomes established in more health care facilities and networks, the demand for efficient, cost-effective training for graduate physicians will increase for healthcare points of entry: emergency departments, urgent care clinics, and primary care. Large healthcare networks in particular are highly motivated to lower the number of false positive/false negative diagnoses from ECG interpretation.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    There is growing recognition that surgical repair of the heart is most likely to be successful in infancy (when there is dramatic capacity for growth and remodeling). For a subset of patients, the optimal time for intervention is prior to birth. Current prenatal cardiac intervention (PCI) procedures clearly have technical limitations in both fetal visualization and instrumentation, taking up to 220 minutes, and often further surgery for the mother.  Global Hypothesis: Integration of customized, computer-assisted, surgical visualization and navigation techniques into PCI will reduce procedural time and improve accuracy leading to improved fetal outcomes.  The Phase II Specific Aims are:  Specific Aim 1: Optimize software and hardware to exceed accuracy requirements for fetal probe positioning and tracking. Integration of new high-resolution ultrasound and tracking equipment will optimize system accuracy and image quality. The ultrasound probe calibration protocols will be made more robust, accurate, and ergonomic. Repeat phantom experiments will confirm accurate visualization and localization performance acceptable for human fetal application.  Specific Aim 2: Optimize the computer-assisted PCI (CAPCI) user interface to maximally reduce procedure time. In Aim 2 the user interface will be optimized to increase ease of use, speed, accuracy, and image content during simulated PCI, overcoming the limitations of the Phase I prototypes.  Specific Aim 3: Test the increased accuracy and efficiency of CAPCI in small and large animal trials. Following initial validation trials using in vitro phantom heart targets, the success of the CAPCI system will be determined by experiments that position a fetoscope and balloon catheter through the chest wall, left ventricular apex, and then across the aortic valve of an adult rat. Finally, further experiments will determine the success of CAPCI in catheter positioning across the aortic valve in the mid-gestation fetal sheep. These experiments will provide proof of principle to begin clinical trials.  Significance: The development of computer-assisted methods to optimize PCI will increase the accuracy (and reduce the length of maternal anesthesia) of these procedures with a direct impact on procedural success. This technology has broad applicability to other ultrasound-guided procedures in the fetus, child, and adult.",

Their wheelchair is a mobile station, a base from which they work, play and interact. Access from their wheelchair is essential, yet people are constrained by limitations imposed by existing mounts. Accessible mounting technology increases the independence and mobility of people with disabilities, resulting in greater autonomy and improved access across environments.  With existing mounts, assistance is required to move devices to improve access or change activities. Using Accessible Mounting and Positioning Technology, people with minimal strength and dexterity can easily move and access several devices. Low effort controls lock devices in stable, user-specific positions and free it for easy repositioning. The dual arm facilitates quick and flexible positioning to optimize function. Multiple devices, such as inclined book stands and rotating trays, may be attached, increasing access and choices. It may be customized for a user's abilities and changing needs, with universal quick releases, adjustable resistance and bed or table mounts. Safety is enhanced in transfers, with devices stowing close to the chair. In Phase II, the design is refined based on Phase I results and user input. Consumers and professionals provide input through focus groups, interviews, usability testing, and extended testing in a person's own environment. Technical improvements are developed using SolidWorks software to create 3D models of components and assemblies. MotionWorks is used to \"virtually test\" assemblies, simulating kinematic and dynamic behavior. Loads calculated by MotionWorks are used in Finite Element analysis, to optimize the arm design. 3D files are used to produce CNC-machined parts, and prototypes are assembled and tested to technical specifications.  Commercial applications: The core technology is the dual arm with a low effort lock/release mechanism, wheelchair attachment hardware, and universal quick release attachments. Modular components such as trays, AAC mounts, table clamps, bed clamps, floor stands, friction-based arms, and other application specific accessories expand its utility and potential in other markets, including mounts for recliners, office chairs, work stations, labs, machine shops, lighting and photography. Relevance to public health: The aim of the proposed technology is to enhance and maximize a person's capabilities, increasing their access and independence across environments.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II research project will develop energy-aware compiler techniques to reduce power and energy consumption in microprocessors, without affecting performance. A key principle behind this approach is to use speculative information available at compile time to reduce power and energy consumption. The key qualifier is speculative: the information does not have to be provably correct. Speculative information that turns out to be correct will enhance energy reduction; if it is incorrect, the worst that will happen is that a penalty (in terms of energy) will have to be paid. The use of such speculative compile-time information opens up a largely unexplored dimension in compilers and computer architectures, to target energy efficiency.  Over the past few years, energy consumption by computers has emerged as a major area of intellectual and commercial activity. These techniques if successful will permit substantial savings in energy consumption. The outcome of the proposed effort will not merely be a set of products, but also a vastly increased understanding of the means by which compile-time information can be exploited for energy savings. With the increasing prevalence of battery-powered computing devices such as PDAs, mobile telephones, and notebooks, power-aware computing is becoming increasingly important commercially.",

High quality EO film, La-modified PMN-PT (PLMNT), was successfully deposited using a unique metal-organic chemical liquid deposition (MOCLD) technique, a low cost and efficient manufacturing process. A large EO coefficient was achieved from PLMNT films. An innovative metallic/dielectric PBG structure was designed and studied for device applications. An electro-optic filter/modulator was developed. A two-dimensional PBG structure was demonstrated for efficient wavelength tuning through simulation. In Phase II  based on this Phase I work, new generation tunable PBG material and devices, such as filters and modulators with state-of-the-art performance, will be brought to the marketplace. Commercially photonic bandgap materials promise to give similar control of the flow of photons as there is over electrons in a semiconductor material but  with even greater flexibility because there is far more control over the properties of photonic bandgap materials than the electronic properties of semiconductors. Given the impact that semiconductor materials have had on every sectors of society, photonic bandgap materials could play an even greater role in the 21st century, particularly in the optical-communications industry.

The inability to routinely and objectively diagnose lameness, results in ineffective interventions and has become a compelling reason for developing a novel device that automatically detects clinical and subclinical lameness, in real-time. The so-called Lameness Detection System (LDS) measures vertical forces of individual limbs as animals walk freely across it.

Two year trials on five farms will maximize sensitivity and specificity of lameness models between and within farms. Data will be generated to validate LDS predictions and adopt procedures for between farm portability. LDS data and production costs will be modeled to assign real-time costs of lameness associated with changes in milk yield, reproductive function, and involuntary culling.

Annual PET scans (350,000+) are rapidly increasing, but CMS reimbursement for PET scans is decreasing 23% from $1774 in 2004 to $1371 in 2005. Twenty percent of the total cost is the radiopharmaceutical dose of F-18 fluorodeoxy glucose (FDG). Sustaining growth in the use of PET will thus benefit from reducing the cost of producing FDG. The goal of this project is to lower cost per dose by a factor of two through the use of our invention called the thermosyphon target, which can remove twice as much proton beam heat as the one kilowatt limit of present target technology. Removing more heat allows full use of the available proton beam current in the installed base of PET cyclotrons, thus at least doubling the production of O-18(p,n)F-18 for FDG (feasibility established by Phase I prototype target experiments using the 27 MeV proton beam of the positive-ion Duke University PET Facility cyclotron). Two additional thermosyphon targets were designed and built in Phase I as preparation for testing to their thermal limits in Phase II at other accelerators (one with beam power of nine kilowatts). This proposed high power target engineering is breaking new ground, and Phase n research may have to address difficult technical problems not previously encountered. Phase II aim 1 is beam testing to determine the thermal limits of the prototypes built in Phase I for two negative-ion proton cyclotrons with energies of 16 and 30 MeV. Aim 2 is correlating test results with predictive thermohydraulic models to design improvements. Aim 3 is developing material science technology to coat high thermal conductivity target body materials (Cu, Ag) with chemically inert refractory metals (Ta, Nb), in order to accommodate high beam power while maintaining viable labeling chemistry. Aim 4 is developing efficient methods of recovering F-18 fluoride ion from thermosyphon designs. Aim 5 is applying results of the previous aims to build and test additional improved prototypes. Aim 6 is the design and demonstration of a reliable high-performance target system suitable for widespread commercial use. Aim 7 is applying the thermohydraulic models to determine performance envelopes to dictate target system designs for a variety of accelerators. The goal of Phase III is to make this technology available for retrofit to appropriate existing accelerators (currently estimated at 70) and for use by manufacturers of new cyclotrons, thus implementing cost reduction of F-18 FDG by a factor of two or more to reduce total PET scan costs about 10%.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The overall objective of the proposed work is to reduce the cost of accelerator produced F-18 radiopharmaceuticals used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET), a Medicare-reimbursed nuclear medicine metabolic imaging modality used to diagnose, stage, and restage ten cancer indications. Annual PET scans (350,000+) are rapidly increasing, but CMS reimbursement for PET scans is decreasing 23% from $1774 in 2004 to $1371 in 2005. Twenty percent of the total cost is the radiopharmaceutical dose of F-18 fluorodeoxy glucose (FDG). Sustaining growth in the use of PET will thus benefit from reducing the cost of producing FDG. The goal of this project is to lower cost per dose by a factor of 4-10 through use of a novel target invention accomplishing very high beam heat removal rates. Removing more heat allows use of high proton beam currents to produce the nuclear reaction O-18(p,n)F-18 to make F-18 fluoride ion for synthesis of FDG. Two commercial cyclotron manufacturers (Ion Beam Applications and Advanced Cyclotron Systems) use external injection ion sources that permit external beam currents of 300-500 microamps, and thus beam power of 9-15 kilowatts. Current technology F-18 production targets capable of removing only about one kilowatt of heat, cannot take advantage of these high performance accelerators. Phase I experiments at Duke University utilized our patented miniature regenerative turbine pump and novel heat exchanger to achieve rapid recirculation at low target water pressures through a cyclotron target, establishing the feasibility of removing well above three kilowatts of heat if higher pressures are used. A cyclotron which will produce beam power of nine kilowatts has been identified for Phase n testing. Aim 1 is installing the Phase I target system on this accelerator, and operating at higher pressures to determine the thermal limit. Aim 2 is correlating these results with predictive thermohydraulic models for designing improved prototypes. Aim 3 is developing an optimum heat exchanger. Aim 4 is designing an optimized regenerative turbine pump with magnetic drive. Aim 5 is developing effective methods of recovering F-18 by sidestream extraction and/or batch methods. Aim 6 is to apply results from previous aims to design, build and test improved prototypes combining target, regenerative turbine pump, and heat exchanger in one compact assembly. Aim 7 is the design and demonstration of a reliable high-performance system suitable for widespread use. Aim 7 is thermohydraulic modeling to determine performance envelopes. The goal of Phase 3 is to make this technology available to appropriate commercial accelerators, thus implementing the overall goal of lowering the cost of PET scans by up to 15% by sienificantlv reducing the cost of oroducine FDG and other F-18 labeled radiopharmaceuticals.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will conduct research leading to the development of working prototypes of new low cost and compact Tactile Graphic Displays and Braille Displays.  The dominant technology today, displays driven by piezo-electric actuators, has two major deficiencies.  It is very expensive, about $12 to $16 per tactile dot, and the actuator shape, a 50 to 70 mm long reed, significantly increases the volume of feasible displays, essentially limiting their use to single line Braille displays for desktop or portable devices.  During the Phase I of the project, C.A.Technology performed extensive research on the design of a new Shape Memory Alloy single dot actuator and has demonstrated the feasibility of tactile displays based on this technology. This actuator uses a short and very thin Titanium-Nickel alloy wire, which will bring the cost per dot down to about $3 to $4, and will considerably reduce the display volume, allowing its use in hand-held devices.  The Phase II effort will include the following: 1) detailed design, construction and user testing of the new tactile arrays; 2) development of software to interface these displays with various portable and hand-held devices, such as C.A.Technology's own Portable Print Reading Device; and 3) preliminary design of manufacturing tools and facilities.  In the mid-seventies, the appearance of the first electronic Braille displays changed the lives of blind individuals.  Today, many have immediate and selective tactile access to textual information through refreshable electronic Braille displays.  However, the high cost of these devices still severely limits their diffusion.  By reducing their cost, their size and their weight, this new technology will increase the market penetration of Braille displays, making them accessible to many more blind and deaf-blind individuals and significantly improve their employment opportunities.  Access to graphic symbols widely used for example in mathematics, chemistry and access to plain graphics is still only possible through slow, bulky and very costly graphic embossers.  If a picture is \"worth a thousand words\", then a compact, low cost refreshable graphic tactile display proffers a significant new opportunity for the lives of blind students, blind engineers, blind physicists and blind people involved in almost any intellectual activity. In addition, it will also be important to those with low vision.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a highly sensitive PCR-based diagnostic kit for the detection of pathogens in crop seeds.  Seed health testing is important in order to identify infected lots that should be excluded from seed sales. Because only a few seeds in a seed lot are usually infected, highly sensitive test methods  are needed. The standard method consists of extracting the pathogen into a buffer followed by plating on selective media to isolate the pathogen or identification by PCR.  A major limitation of this method is that only a small sample (0.1 ml) can be tested on an agar plate, which gives a maximum sensitivity of only 10 cells per ml.  In this project, a novel device called Ampli-disk, has been developed,  that allows testing of a 4 ml sample. Further, this  Ampli-disk can be stored and used, as needed, unlike agar plates that require fresh preparation for each use. Prior Phase I research has shown that pathogens from seed extracts can be successfully detected and quantified by using Ampli-disk coupled with real-time PCR.  In the Phase II project, the objective is to develop Ampli-disks and real-time PCR primers and probes into diagnostic kits for ten most important bacterial pathogens of vegetable crops. The commercial application of this project will be in agriculture. The proposed technology will be useful to the seed industry and in other bacterial disease diagnostics.",

Poorly performing cathodes adversely impact all RF vacuum electron devices, including those used for accelerators, radar, communications, medical applications, and industrial heating.  This project will determe the specific causes of poor cathode performance and developing cost effective solutions.  In particular, controlled porosity cathodes will be developed to address problems with uniform work function of the emitter surface.  Improved mechanical and thermal designs will provide uniform emitter temperatures and lower the cost of cathode assemblies.  Phase I identified specific causes of temperature variation in magnetron injection guns and established a preliminary thermal model to analyze the problems and develop practical solutions.  A concept for manufacturing controlled-porosity cathodes was developed and experimentally verified.  Phase II will complete the development of controlled-porosity cathodes by defining specific processes for determining pore size and density.  The results will be correlated with the barium diffusion rate to allow an optimal design, based on current density and lifetime requirements.  Techniques for improved thermal performance will be developed and experimentally tested.  The mechanical design of cathode heater assemblies will be improved to simplify the construction process.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the applicant:  The results of this project should reduce the cost and risk in the manufacture of cathodes for all vacuum electron devices.  The concepts will be applied to magnetron injection guns for gyrotrons, which represents the greatest challenge.  Successful completion should reduce the risk and improve the performance of gyrotrons for fusion, accelerators, defense, and industrial applications, with subsequent reductions in cost.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this Phase II project is to develop a more effective tool for assessing the development potential of human oocytes and to reduce the emotional, health, and financial costs of low IVF success rates, presently approximately 25% per cycle. To compensate for these low rates, as many as three or more embryos are transferred to the mother-this practice is a leading cause of multiple and often premature births. Low success rates also lead to multiple, emotionally draining and expensive interventions. An ability to select high quality oocytes is critical to achieving successful outcomes. The main premise of this application is that reliable quantitative analysis of oocyte structures can improve IVF techniques, and proposes to apply to this task a new type of microscope that measures birefringence, an optical property exhibited in many cellular structural elements. Compared to images provided by traditional Hoffman or DIG optics presently used for oocyte assessment, non-invasive birefringence imaging using CRI's unique liquid crystal polarized light microscope dramatically and quantitatively highlights the meiotic spindle and other cellular structures by measuring birefringence retardation at each image point in the field of view. Phase I demonstrated that birefringence imaging of oocyte structures provides information that correlates significantly with embryo development and, ultimately, clinical outcome. Spindle visualization was also shown to be useful in assessing viability of cryopreserved oocytes, another critical and otherwise unsolved problem. Phase II specific aims include extending functionality to allow quantitative measurement of birefringence in three dimensions, adding features to make operation more suitable to the clinical IVF setting, developing an appropriately sized and treated glass-bottom dish, developing software tools and algorithms that extract additional quantitative information about viability and condition, and working with three beta-sites to test systems and provide vital feedback on effectiveness and operation.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     We propose to extend our successful development of an agile spectral light source for light microscopy, funded through the NCI-IMAT initiative, into FDA trials. The SpectraLamp(tm) device enables the automated and quantitative analysis of double-immunostained samples in brightfield (non-fluorescence-based) microscopy, with particular utility for hematopathology applications. A clinically compelling area is the enumeration of malignant blasts in bone marrow biopsy specimens of patients with acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myleloproliferative diseases for the purpose of staging and evaluating therapeutic responses. Current methods are inadequate due to poor sampling (typical of bone marrow aspirates) or difficulty in identifying true blasts (bone marrow biopsies and single-color immunohistochemical phenotyping). Double-immunophenotyping permits largely unambiguous detection, but such labeling strategies are not supported by standard (non-multispectral) color imaging systems. To overcome this limitation, we will combine our multispectral imaging system with a high-speed slide-scanning platform that can scan an entire bone-marrow biopsy at high resolution in under 3 minutes. Machine-learning software tools and spectral imaging will identify blasts, combining morphology parameters and double or even triple immunophenotyping to ensure accuracy and precision. After blasts are identified, flow-cytometrylike software will present the data in histograms and other modalities, allowing the user to \"gate\" on particular cellular populations and pull up panels of cell images for confirmation.        Time-line: Final equipment-related tasks will be accomplished in the first year and preliminary testing of the instrumentation and software features will occur in the second year, as will development of qualified panels of immunoreagents and staining protocols (by DAKOCytomation).

Thousands of patients' lives have been saved each year. Unfortunately, similar devices are not yet available in the US for pediatric heart patients. Development of such devices has been impeded by the fact that the pediatric market size is too small to attract interest from medical device companies. This Phase II study is a part of a National Institutes of Health effort of encouraging industry to develop such devices for an underserved but high-benefit population - pediatric heart patients. The goal of this project is to further develop a pediatric percutaneous ventricular assist device (pVAD) based on the existing adult TandemHeart(tm) pVAD System developed and currently marketed by our company, CardiacAssist, Inc. In the Phase I study, feasibility of such a device for pediatric application was successfully demonstrated on the bench top. Phase II study will focus on development of complete clinical prototypes and animal testing. Specifically, a spectrum of different sized cannulae will be developed to serve pediatric patients of all ages, from neonates (> 2 kg) to young adults. State of the art computational fluid dynamic and fluid visualization techniques will be used to design a safer and more effective blood pump for this pediatric application to reduce the levels of hemolysis. Safety and functionality of the developed system will be demonstrated in animal models. Upon successful completion of Phase II, CardiacAssist will undertake the final design and commercialization phase to introduce this device into the market.  The proposed pediatric pVAD system is the only one in the field that can be placed percutaneously and serve pediatric patients of all sizes. Because it is inserted percutaneously, cardiac assistance can be provided quickly and less invasively, minimizing potential complications and promoting quicker patient recovery. Successful commercialization of this device will bring a unique tool to pediatric cardiologists and surgeons for their use in saving children's lives.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Transplantation of islets of Langerhans for the clinical treatment of Type I diabetes has had a resurgence of interest due to results obtained using the \"Edmonton protocol\". However, at this time, procurement of donor pancreases for islet isolation and transplantation is in its infancy. Most pancreases at more remote donor sites are not procured due to justified concerns about post-mortem ischemia during transport to the islet isolation and transplant center. Perfusion/preservation technology has been shown to have a major impact in circumventing ischemic injury in kidney transplantation. This proposal seeks to apply this approach to the preservation and procurement of viable islets for transplantation. The primary objective of this proposal is to use state-of-the-art perfusion technology and new preservation solutions to test the hypothesis that machine perfusion can improve the yield and viability of islets prepared from ischemic pancreases. To this end, a prototype pancreas transporter (PTR) was designed and constructed in the Phase I study. The feasibility of 24h perfusion preservation at 2-7xC was demonstrated using a porcine model that exceeds the 16h documented to be the present clinical limits of safe, static cold storage of donor pancreatic. Islet yield and function was demonstrated to be equivalent to that obtained from fresh control pancreases. The safety and efficacy of this new technology will be further investigated during this Phase II study with three specific aims. The first step will be to implement design modifications to the PTR ensuing from the Phase I feasibility study. The second step will entail a comparison of the yield and function indices for islets isolated from pancreata perfused for 24h on the PTR with indices obtained from control, 24h conventionally stored pancreata. Then the interaction between cold perfusion time (24 and 48h) and warm ischemia time (up to 60 min) on porcine islet isolation parameters will be evaluated for the definition of the potential clinical scope and technology limits. Finally, human pancreases that are unsuitable for transplantation will be employed for pre-clinical validation of this technology. It is anticipated that the availability of a pancreas transporter and pancreas perfusion protocols will permit utilization of most, if not all, pancreases suitable for transplantation in the U.S. Furthermore, the PTR may permit islet isolation banking for long-term storage. Banking would allow time for better HLA matching of donors to recipients, off-the-shelf availability, and enable quality assurance/control procedures to be conducted prior to transplantation. This research program is supported by collaboration with three major clinical centers interested in validation of this perfusion technology for their future use.",

This method would contribute to the development of a new generation of drugs tailored to inhibit specific protein kinases with roles in cancer by identifying new phosphorylation sites that could become targets for cancer diagnosis and treatment. During our IMAT-funded Phase I, we established the feasibility of using an immunoaffinity method to isolate phosphopeptides from complex mixtures, which were then identified by tandem mass spectrometry. In this Phase II application, we will optimize the immunoaffinity method so it can be used to analyze low-level samples, using cell numbers that are comparable to what would be available from patient samples. Once we have optimized the method and established the repertory of antibodies that can be used productively in the method, we will demonstrate the method's utility by applying it to a variety of cancer cell lines, to show the method can probe the major signal transduction networks involved in cancer and can identify oncogenic lesions. We will bring a quantitative dimension to the method by merging it with mass spectrometry methods such as SILAC and Aqua, which are needed for later biomarker discovery and biomarker assay efforts.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Contrast agent harmonic imaging has become a very important tool for studying blood perfusion. Due to the extensive amount of angiogenesis that occurs around malignant tumors, the use of ultrasound contrast agents has the potential to improve cancer diagnosis and to direct therapies. However, existing transducers are limited in their ability to form images from contrast agent harmonics because they lack sufficient bandwidth. This is especially true if both second and sub-harmonics are to be used to construct an image. In the Phase I program TRS Technologies, Blatek, Inc., J&W Medical, LLC, and Thomas Jefferson University Hospital demonstrated a solution to this problem by constructing a very broad band transducer using single crystal ferroelectric. This material (PbCMgi/sNb^CVPbTiOs - PMN-PT) has a very high electromechanical coupling coefficient (kss > 90%) so that ultrasound transducers constructed from it have an inherently broad bandwidth. In the Phase I program a single element, focused transducer was constructed from a crystal/epoxy 1-3 composite. The transducer had a bandwidth of 130% with excellent receive sensitivity at 9 and 2.25 MHz, the second and subharmonics, respectively, of the 4.5 MHz transmit frequency. Feasibility for contrast agent detection was demonstrated by using the transducer to measure the strength of 2nd harmonic signals generated by Sonazoid microbubbles in water. For the Phase II program, TRS proposes to build on these results by constructing a broad band single crystal linear array and using it for contrast agent enhanced imaging VX2 liver tumors in rabbits.",

To wit: (1) pancreatic cancer patients have a 5-year survival rate of less than 5% and the 32,000 new cases per year in the U.S. is close to the number of annual deaths; and, (2) ovarian cancer represents about 25% of gynecologic malignancies but accounts for over 50% of gynecologic cancer deaths, an estimated 14,000 per annum in the U.S. The overall goal of this SBIR phase II proposal is to continue development of our Listeria monocytogenes (Lm)-based immunotherapy to target Mesothelin and codon 12-mutated activated K-ras antigens in patients with pancreatic and ovarian cancers. Two significant developments have occurred since the SBIR Phase I grant was submitted: (1) We generated (and documented) a live-attenuated Lm vaccine platform strain deleted of ActA and InIB virulence determinants that is greater that 1000-fold attenuated, yet retains immunogenicity that is indistinguishable from wild-type Lm; and, (2) Mesothelin-targeted T-cells from pancreatic cancer patients have been shown by our collaborator, Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee, to target and destroy pancreatic tumor cells, and patient T-cell responses correlate with long-term disease-free survival. Under Phase I funding and continued work, we developed proprietary and unique means for expression and secretion of tumor antigens. By utilizing both codon optimization and signal peptides from distinct Gram+ bacteria, we constructed Lm vaccines that efficiently synthesize and secrete Mesothelin. Overlapping peptide libraries were used to map human Mesothelin- and Lm (LLO)-specific cellular responses in mice immunized with prototype vaccines. We extended the use of the LLO peptide library to measure Lm cellular immunity in humans.  Additionally, we demonstrated that Lm vaccines efficiently deliver tumor antigens into human dendritic cells for MHC class I presentation in vitro-a critical proof of concept for studies proposed in Phase II. With this application, we propose to: (1) select the Lm-Mesothelin/ras vaccine strain for clinical trials based on immunogenicity in syngeneic and HLA-A2 transgenic mice, and activation of established HLA-A2-, A3-, and A24-restricted human Mesothelin specific Tcell lines; (2) establish clinical monitoring methods to evaluate Mesothelin- and K-ras-specific T-cell responses in vaccinated patients; (3) establish manufacturing and process methods for the selected Lm Mesothelin/ras vaccine; and, (4) perform IND-enabling murine toxicology studies. Each of these activities is on the critical path to enabling a Phase I clinical trial. To accomplish these goals, we have assembled a team with a history of productive collaboration consisting of scientists and external consultants with documented expertise in Gram-positive bacterial genetics, murine and human immunology, novel cancer vaccine platform development, and translational medicine.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Ion channels comprise 10-20 percent of known drug targets for diseases including cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, hypertension, heart failure, asthma, cystic fibrosis, epilepsy, migraine, mental disorders, muscular dystrophy, and cancer. While ion channels provide important therapeutic targets, they are often the focal point of unwanted drug interactions leading to potentially serious side effects. The cardiac potassium channel hERG is the most common target of undesired drug interactions; block of hERG can predispose individuals to cardiac arrhythmias, long QT syndrome, and sudden cardiac death. The FDA recommends that all drugs being considered for investigational new drug applications (IND) be tested for their effects on the hERG potassium channel in preclinical studies. Due to the increasing costs of drug development, it is crucial that pharmaceutical companies test their compounds for hERG liability at early stages in the process. Recent evidence indicates that drug-induced hERG liability can arise not just from direct block of the channel, but by inhibiting the movement of the hERG channel from its intracellular site of synthesis to the cell surface. This trafficking inhibition results in fewer functional channels at the cell surface. Arsenic trioxide and pentamidine, both of which are in clinical use today, act in this fashion and have been linked to long QT syndrome. None of the current methods for determining hERG liability are able to detect trafficking inhibitors. ChanXpress, Inc. has developed a novel safety screen for hERG liability that is the most comprehensive available. It detects both channel blockers and trafficking inhibitors using a proprietary technology that monitors surface expression of hERG channels using an antibody-based, chemiluminescent assay. In Phase II, we will compile a hERG liability database of 880 compounds that includes results from hERG-Lite screening along with patch clamp and Western blot data. We will automate the HERG-Lite assay at ChanXpress so that it can be offered to more clients with a higher throughput than is currently available. Finally, ChanXpress will develop a HERG-Lite kit that includes cell line, reagent, and instrumentation options so that clients are able to perform that assay at their own facility. The combination of speed, low cost, high throughput, and comprehensive hERG liability predictions position HERG-Lite as the premier assay for hERG liability screening early in the drug development process.",

        "abstract": "75772B  Most coal-based power plants use pulverized coal boilers to generate superheated steam for turbine applications, accounting for over 50 percent of U.S. electricity generation.  The flue gas stream from these plants contains CO2, along with N2 and other minor components such as SO2 and NOx.  Although some commercial technologies are available to separate or capture the CO2 from the flue gas, in order to reduce the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, these processes are both capital intensive and high in operating costs.  This project will develop a membrane-based hybrid process for capturing and enriching the CO2 from the warm flue gas streams emitted from pulverized-coal-fired power plants.  When retrofitted on conventional air-based, fossil-fuel-fired power plants or integrated into new power-generation facilities, the process will capture more than 90% of the CO2, and compressed CO2 with greater than 99 vol% purity will be obtained.  In Phase I, the membrane-based hybrid system was developed and tested on a simulated flue gas containing 10 to 15% CO2.  A product stream containing 99.3-99.6 vol% CO2 was produced with a recovery effeciency of >90%.  Parametric optimization and techno-economic analysis were performed over a range of temperatures, CO2 partial pressures, and SO2 contents in the flue gas.  In Phase II, the membrane hybrid sytem will be further optimized to provide higher CO2 capture efficiency and higher CO2 purity.  Long-term experiments will be performed to test the operational stability of the membrane system when used to treat simulated flue gas containing both SOx and NOx.  Finally, a prototype system will be tested in a pilot plant. Commercial Applications And Other Benefits as described by the applicant.  The membrane-based hybrid process should provide superior performance compared to the conventional processes for CO2 separation/capture (i.e., amine-based absorption/desorption, membrane gas absorption, and conventional membrane gas permeation processes).  The cost of capturing (separating, compressing, and liquifying) 90% CO2 from a flue gas stream containing 15% CO2 would be 1.275 - 1.80 cent/kWh (or 13.5 \u00bf 20 dollars/ton CO2 avoided).",

A photo-degradation product of nifedipine, nitrosipine, has been found to selectively enhance the uptake of Ga67 by tumor cells. A specific derivative of nitrosipine has an even better selective uptake of the radioactive imaging agent. This project will synthesize and test other nitrosipine derivatives and determine the efficacy of Ga67 uptake in animal models using these complexing agents. The commercial application of this technology is in the area of diagnostic imaging. The use of Ga67 in tumor imaging is currently very limited due to poor selectivity of the agent for tumor cells. Enhanced uptake in tumor cells relative to normal cells would expand the types of tumors that could be effectively imaged and possibly replace the more costly and complex PET scan imaging using radioactive fluorinated sugars.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a new class of in-fiber chiral polarizers based upon chiral fiber gratings. A double helix variation of the effective refractive index will be formed by twisting fibers with a noncircular core as they pass through a miniature oven. These chiral fiber polarizers will be created from specially prepared glass performs in a low-cost, versatile, continuous process, which will not require coherent irradiation of photosensitive glass commonly used to produce fiber Bragg gratings. Chiral polarizers are true fiber devices and do not require any substrates, bulk components, or rigid package. Their pitch profile will be engineered to minimize insertion loss for the passing polarization and maximize the extinction of the orthogonal polarization over a broad spectral range. The design will implement a multi-core optical fiber to match the low numerical aperture of standard fiber with the numerical aperture of the chiral polarizer at its input and output while maintaining a high numerical aperture in the polarizing zone. Chiral polarizers will have broad application in single polarization transmission, polarization mode dispersion compensation, and test and measurement instrumentation. Polarizers are also key elements in sensors relying on optical interference such as gyroscopes and current sensors.  Polarization and frequency selective chiral fibers have applications ranging from telecommunications to sensing. The use of external modulators for high bandwidth fiber telecommunication requires that the incident wave be linearly polarized. This necessitates use of a polarizer since laser sources used in telecommunications generally have random polarization. Further, any use of polarization maintaining fiber requires that polarized light be launched into the fiber. Polarizers are also key components in polarization mode dispersion compensation systems. Since chiral polarizers may be fabricated from refractory or radiation resistive glasses and involve only mechanical deformation of glass they may function in harsh environments with high levels of radiation, high temperature, or corrosive chemicals. The fabrication techniques developed for chiral fiber polarizers will spur the development of other devices based on chiral fiber gratings. These devices, ranging from sensors and filters to in-fiber lasers will become building blocks for a new platform for passive and active in-fiber devices. The understanding of glass behavior under extreme shear stress will push the frontier of glass forming technology and stimulate new applications. Understanding polarization-selective light scattering within the nonresonant band will open the way for new devices based upon microstructured fibers.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Diseases caused by single gene defects such as Mucolipidosis Type IV (MLIV) present a significant challenge for effective therapy. MLIV, an autosomal recessive neurological disease, is due to defects in the mucolipin gene (MCOLN1) that result in functional loss of the encoded channel pore protein. Because replacement strategies such as gene therapy or recombinant protein delivery are not viable strategies, alternatives are needed. A promising approach is to determine which other genes exhibit altered expression as a result of mucolipin deficiency in order to select druggable targets for therapeutic development. Methods for gene expression profiling have typically involved measurements of accumulated RNA, i.e., RNA profiling that may involve high volume microarrays or smaller numbers of genes by reverse transcriptase PCR. While useful, RNA assays cannot distinguish between transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation, and exhibit high levels of variability. During Phase I of this project, a novel method called TranscriptionPath was developed to directly measure transcriptional activities of genes by identifying and quantifying complexes containing genomic DNA and transcription-associated proteins. In the proposed Phase II studies, TranscriptionPath will be applied to 3 model systems reproducing key aspects of the MLIV disease: (1) siRNA inhibition of mucolipin gene expression in vitro, including in neuronal cell lines, (2) recreation of MLIV defects by modulating intracellular Ca2+ levels, and (3) testing of MCOLN1 knock-out mice. The combined approach will generate a list of candidate genes that can be further developed into therapeutic targets and/or diagnostic biomarkers. The proposed methods will also be applicable to other genetic neurological disorders for which in vitro or animal models exist. Relevance: There are more than 600 neurological disorders, many of which have a genetic component. Even though many of these disorders are orphan or rare diseases, together they represent an important and significant health issue. Methods are proposed that make use of a common characteristic of such disorders, i.e., altered gene expression, to work toward therapies for many of these diseases.",

During our prior work, we have developed and tested a compact telemetry EEG system that allows the patient to be untethered and moved about freely while still being monitored by a remote PC. We have conducted real time EEG monitoring in the Emergency Department (ED) at Beaumont Hospitals (Troy, Michigan) on twenty patients with altered mental status. The results show that the device is very practical and easy to use in that environment and does not impede conventional standard of care in the ED. As importantly, the results show that 7 of 20 patients had Non-Convulsive Seizures (NCS); abnormal brain activity that could have been totally missed using traditional procedures. Conflicting symptoms in two more patients were also resolved using our technology. In this proposal, we will finalize development and commercialization of the technology to produce the first wireless EEG device that is dedicated to the emergency room. We will upgrade the device with a new wireless transmitter (to meet recently issued FCC guidelines), repackage the review module to make it more rugged and reliable, and investigate faster hookup time by reducing the number of EEG electrodes. An extensive clinical trial will be conducted at Beaumont hospital emergency department in Troy, Michigan. The proposed device is needed in the market place and we hope will pioneer the wide-use of EEG in emergency rooms and in prehospital settings. Once recorded in the PC, real time EEG from the ED can be transferred via LAN and internet connections to a neurologist anywhere inside or outside the hospital. The device will also have an embedded seizure detection algorithm to facilitate neurological reading. Finally, while we recognize the potential resistance to changes in standard protocols, we believe that by commercializing this technology and with successful adoption even by few emergency centers will constitute a much needed step to convince the emergency doctors and hospital administrators nationwide of the importance of EEG as a critical complement to existing ED protocols.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability in the US with an incidence rate of 1.5 million at cost of $56.3 billion annually. There is no treatment for TBI, and the lack of therapeutic intervention for a public health issue of this magnitude constitutes a healthcare crisis. We have developed COG133, a peptide that is neuroprotective when administered 30 minutes following TBI in mice, and demonstrated that conjugation of COG133 to a variety of protein transduction domains (PTD- short basic peptides that promote the intracellular delivery of cargo) expanded the therapeutic window (TW, i.e., the injury-treatment interval capable of exhibiting neuroprotection) for the treatment of TBI four-fold, from 30 min to 120 min.  Specific Aim 1: Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of antpCOG133 and synB3COG133 in intact mice; Specific Aim 2: Determine the effect of dose and length of the therapeutic window (120, 180, 240, and 300 minutes) on the efficacy of antpCOG133 and synB3COG133 for the treatment of TBI in mice; Specific Aim 3: Determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters of antpCOG133 and synB3COG133 in the blood and brain of uninjured mice via liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry (LC/MS) at multiple time points following intravenous administration; Specific Aim 4: The patho-physiological features and sequelae of TBI impact drug delivery to the brain due to changes in cerebral blood flow, metabolism, edema, and changes in proteolytic and degradative enzyme activity. Therefore, the impact of TBI on the blood and brain PK/PD of antpCOG133 and synB3COG133 will be investigated as a function of time elapsed since injury.  A comprehensive assessment of the PK/PD of PTD-cargo in a clinically relevant in vivo model of neurological disease is lacking in the literature and will advance the general state of knowledge regarding the clinical/therapeutic utility of harnessing the transduction potential of PTDs for the treatment of numerous neurological disorders. The lack of an effective therapeutic intervention for the 1.5 million patients affected by TBI annually justifies this development effort to translate the therapeutic potential of PTDs to the clinic and to the market.",

The proposed Transactional Applications Delivery System (TADS) will allow service providers to define new revenue generating applications and corporate IT departments and third-party IT solution providers to develop vertically integrated, productivity enhancing data-voice applications.  The proposed system will also provide a cost-effective means for service providers to move high-end VoIP terminals into the home consumer market, through, for example, multi-year service contracts in exchange for subsidized phones (the new revenue generating opportunities will allow service providers to do this).  By addressing these needs, TADS will allow tighter integration between telephony features and IT based systems, taking better advantage of unified messaging (voice mail, e-mail, video mail, instant messaging, etc), collaboration, conferencing, presence, etc.  It will also allow end-users access to ubiquitous features across different networks and different locations.  This project will define, develop, and deploy a complex software platform that will significantly accelerate the time to market of revenue generating and productivity enhancing advanced VoIP applications and services. In addition, the development of the proposed TADS technology will lead to new knowledge in the areas of human computer interaction, data mining, IP information appliances, and networking. The results to be obtained from this project will have a significant impact on the structure of the VoIP consumer market and the way converged voice-data applications are developed and deployed in the enterprise market.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal is a software Speech Perception Assessment and Training System (SPATS) for the aural rehabilitation of adult hearing aid and cochlear-implant users. The system will assess the user's ability to identify the constituents of English syllables; that is, syllable onsets, nuclei, and codas in quiet and in background noise, and it will provide individualized recognition training to improve these abilities. An administrative component of the system will keep and report records and simplify navigation of the system by clinicians and clients. Three parts of the project are: 1) the development of the assessment components of the system, 2) the development of the training components of the system, and 3) their clinical validation.  Assessments will provide an inventory of a client's abilities to identify the constituents of English syllables. Including variation in talkers, phonetic contexts, and noise levels assures that the assessments are valid and objective evaluations of a listener's bottom-up, or analytic, speech-perception abilities. The training algorithm adaptively selects items and noise levels so that practice is concentrated on items of moderate difficulty weighted by their importance for speech understanding. Item importance is estimated from frequency of occurrence data. Further, learning is enhanced by providing many practice trials, immediate feedback, and, following errors, rapid comparisons of intended sounds with their confusors and by including both relatively easy, low-uncertainty and more difficult, high-uncertainty conditions. To better motivate the user and to encourage transfer to real-world speech, briefer periods of training on words and phrases will be regularly interspersed with the training on syllable constituents. Validation studies will measure how well the assessment system predicts success in identifying words and sentences, and general success in speech communication. Correlations with subjective estimates of benefit from, satisfaction with, and use of hearing aids and cochlear implants in relation to the proposed assessment tools will also be measured. Assessment components of the system will be suitable for patient evaluation and for the evaluation of the performance of hearing-aids and their fittings as well as for the evaluation of the performance of cochlear implants, maps, programs, and processing schemes. The effectiveness of the training system for improving the validation measures and, thus, the clients' overall ability to understand speech, will be measured. The training components of the system can be used in aural rehabilitation programs in clinical settings and in the home.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): By instituting a number of precautions (e.g. personal monitoring, enhanced ventilation) dentists have been able to reduce the risk of mercury escaping into the environment. While these precautions are significant there are still numerous instances of mercury emissions above approved regulations. These Hg emissions compromise health of dental personnel. In Phase I Compact Membrane Systems (CMS) demonstrated the feasibility of a small, safe, low cost system that can be placed within the dental office or within the air duct system to actively remove elemental mercury and convert it to mercury sulfide (HgS). (Removal of metallic mercury is actually more difficult than ionic mercury). CMS has identified low cost commercial routes to collect the HgS and by sending in bulk to Hg retorters the Hg can be recovered. The overall business model provides an annual service to the dentist for less than $500 and minimizes the dentist's exposure or liability. Phase I demonstrated that the CMS system could both easily remove the spiked levels of mercury that was in the air and that this could be done when using the proper system with minimal concern for system fouling. By using proper chemical systems we were able to successfully remove elemental Hg under poor mixing conditions with no fouling seen over a 14-day test period. This strongly suggests that in Phase II using enhanced/optimized liquid side mixing that long term fouling should not be an issue. Phase II will optimize/enhance the core technology and build prototype for field demonstration. Numerous local dental offices have committed to participate in field evaluation and leaders in the dental mercury emissions field at a national university have agreed to participate in both field testing and program activity. System optimization will include enhancing long term stability, minimizing fouling potential, basic data for low cost service while maintaining high mercury vapor removal capability. Systems will be designed for upwards of 30 grams of mercury removal per year. Compact Membrane Systems (CMS) has established strong industrial partnerships. These partnerships will enhance CMS's capability to successfully complete the Phase II and subsequent commercialization.",

The lack of cost-effective, radiation-resistant insulation systems is compromising the design and operation of these devices.  Therefore, this project will develop and formulate low-cost organic resins for use in the production of fusion magnet insulation by vacuum pressure impregnation (VPI).  The new materials promise to be much less expensive than current insulation materials, while providing the necessary mechanical, electrical, and thermal performance.  In Phase I, new low-cost organic resin formulations were developed and the materials were used to fabricate fiber-reinforced insulation materials.  The materials displayed excellent high-temperature strength and withstood thermal cycling from 76 K to 373 K with minimal change in mechanical or electrical performance.  Phase II will optimize the resin formulation, scale up the synthesis process, fabricate and characterize fiber-reinforced insulation materials, and determine the radiation resistance of these new resin materials.  In addition, a subscale magnet assembly will be fabricated and tested to demonstrate the use of these new insulation materials in a representative, application-specific configuration.  Commercial Applications And Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  New, low cost, VPI-compatible insulation systems, capable of withstanding exposure to high temperatures and having improved radiation resistance and mechanical and electrical properties, should directly affect the viability and operation of new fusion magnet designs.  Lower cost insulation systems, with equal to or greater properties than current systems, should significantly reduce the material and fabrication costs of magnet systems and extend the useful lifetime of these devices.",

The SMT is based on the reflex-like reduction in sniffing that is observed when an odor stimulus is encountered. This response appears to be part of a fast-acting olfactomotor circuit, and therefore does not rely on higher-order cognitive abilities required to complete odor identification tests. Owing to its simplicity, the SMT provides a rapid, reliable and valid test of olfactory function that can be used for the evaluation of patients of diverse ages, cultural backgrounds, linguistic ability and cognitive status. The SMT has potential for use with patients concerned with smell loss, and may be of value in the diagnosis of several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. A strategic partnership has been arranged for the manufacturing and marketing of the SMT but FDA approval must be obtained before this effort can move forward. The proposed projects are clinical trials that would involve testing several patient populations known to suffer from olfactory deficits with the goal of demonstrating that the SMT can be used safely and effectively in these groups. These data would then be used as the foundation for a 510(k) application for FDA approval of the SMT. This application is being made under the newly revised NIH policy that provides for SBIR Phase II extension funding when FDA approval is a necessary step toward commercialization.",

Accurate and reliable measurement of critical flow systems will ensure piping thermal stresses remain below design limits, for safe continued generation of electric power.  The broader impact of the proposed flow sensor should significantly enhance nuclear power plant system safety by providing a robust, self-contained, zero-maintenance, zero-power instrument for monitoring in-plant piping systems.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    One million herniorrhaphies are performed annually in the US, most incorporating mesh reinforcement particularly for incisional and inguinal hernia. Yet this procedure usually results in prolonged and painful convalescence with recurrent complications such as inflammation and adhesion formation. In fact, adhesions represent a significant source of morbidity and mortality and are a common cause of small bowel obstruction in previously operated patients. Laparoscopic approaches have been developed to eliminate some of these problems but clinical acceptance has been hampered by the complex nature of the surgery requiring a high level of surgeon skill. Laser-assisted tissue welding using a derivatized collagen solder may avoid compression or tissue injury that frequently occurs with mechanical mesh fixation, inhibit adhesion formation, beneficial in minimizing postoperative pain due to tissue ischemia and nerve entrapment syndromes and is inherently compliant with laparoscopic formats. Phase I studies were conducted to evaluate a variety of solder and mesh configurations, tissue bonding strategies, comparison of acute tensile strength of bonded peritoneum and the assessment of mesh stability, tissue damage and the presence/type of adhesions in a six week chronic study. Secure mesh fixation was achieved with mesh/solder overlay but the embedded mesh configuration provided a simple means of anchoring mesh to tissue. The resultant mesh composites displayed a typical biological response with minimal adhesion formation and highlight the potential for use in laparoscopic herniorrhaphy, peritoneal closure, and reinforcement of anastomoses. Specific aims for Phase  II are to develop and implement appropriate animal models for the optimization of laparoscopic  herniorrhaphy. Task descriptions include preparation of sterile solder under stringent process controls, design and assembly of a compact preclinical laser system, optimization of a laser laparoscopic hand piece and solder introducer tool and conduct chronic animal studies using lapine and porcine subjects.",

While the timing is ripe to push photovoltaics as a reliable renewable energy source, further expansion must overcome this materials-availability issue.  This project will develop low-cost technology for SoG silicon production by upgrading metallurgical-grade silicon, which is commercially produced in large quantities worldwide.

Direct real-time measurements of force and moment at the base of the posthetic socket will be input for a newly developed algorithm in the Computerized Prosthetic Alignment System (ComPAS). It will assist prosthetists in the critical task of proper alignment.      Previous investigators have clearly indicated a need for such a system, while noting the theoretical feasibility of using instrumentation to help a prosthetist improve prosthetic alignment. Previous efforts have not produced a successful system. Based on preliminary work we believe our new approach can successfully be developed into a clinically relevant, commercially viable system for lower limb prosthetic alignment.      ComPAS will be an integrated system that is easy to use and intuitive to the prosthetist. It will be reasonably priced and we will seek a reimbursement code for its use so the system can 'pay for itself.' It will have near universal application in lower limb prostheses without special accommodation by the prosthetist and be used in both static and dynamic situations. The patient will be untethered and the system will be used in a normal office or clinic environment. Automated measurement and interpretation of gait parameters will be translated into user-friendly indicators that indicate to the prosthetist how to improve the alignment of the prosthesis.      Phase I work will focus on building prototype hardware and software and demonstrating the efficacy of our approach. Phase II will refine the physical packaging and clinical capabilities, and will undertake more extensive scientific validation of the system.   Phase I work will be comprised of the following four Specific Aims:   1. Design and Build Prototype ComPAS, 2. Refine Alignment Detection Algorithm, 3. Prosthetic Alignment Testing Using Proof of Concept ComPAS Prototype, 4. Clinical Review.

Such data are common in biomedical research, especially in areas such as genetics, ophthalmology, and developmental toxicology. In this Phase II effort, we will develop correlated data analogues for most of the existing small sample procedures for independent data currently provided in the StatXact software. Specifically the resulting module will implement correlated data extensions of: 1) Exact tests of independence in unordered and ordered R x C contingency table. 2) Tests for differences in the distributions of 2 ordered multinomial populations. 3) Exact Mantel-Haenszel-type tests for assessing homogeneity of relative odds for stratified 2x2 tables, 4) Exact correlated data methods for situations in which independent factors vary across observations within a cluster. This extension will expand the applicability of such methods to a wider range of longitudinal and multiple outcome settings. Because implementing the above procedures can be computationally complex, a final goal of the proposal is the development of new algorithms to make these tools practical for general use. These include new efficient network-based algorithms and Monte Carlo simulation strategies for model fitting. The final product of this effort will be a toolbox of exact procedures will enable users to avoid relying on potentially poor large sample approximations when analyzing small sample correlated categorical data. This advantage will ultimately lead to more reliable analyses of such data. There is currently no software for such methods other than a limited prototype developed in Phase I of this proposal.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is considerable evidence for the application of transplantation of Hematopoietic and Mesenchymal Stem Cells in the treatment of a wide range of cancers including lymphoma, neuroblastoma, and multiple myeloma. In addition, HSC/MSC therapies can be applied to reconstitute the immune system, regenerate damaged tissues, and deliver genes to repair damaged cells for many auto-immune diseases such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosis. One of the major roadblocks in the successful application of transplant treatments is the difficulty in rapidly obtaining a pure sample of stem cells in the harvested sample.    This ultimate objective of our research is the development of an ultra-high throughput high-purity cell sorter, Gigasort, for stem cell harvesting. The cell sorter consists of several parallel microfluidic channels that combine to produce throughput that is expected to be at least 10x that of current generation cell sorters in practice, without compromising sample purity. The current proposal is aimed at developing a multichannel sorter test bed that is extendable in the number of parallel channels used. We will build the test bed and experimentally measure the sorting performance for fluorescent beads and cells, including cells harvested from blood.",

        "abstract": "This NIH SBIR Phase II project will enable Dakota Technologies, Inc. (DTI) to complete development of a hollow-fiber membrane (HFM) sampling system that provides analytical quality data on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater. The system is versatile and comprehensive; it incorporates methods and hardware for implanting the HFM samplers, methods and hardware for efficiently collecting vapors that permeate from the groundwater through the membrane, and the end step of gas chromatographic sample analysis. The basis of the measurement is VOC pervaporation from the groundwater formation into the lumen of the hollow fiber. The headspace developed in the lumen is returned to the surface via a carrier gas. Limits of detection can be adjusted over a wide range by controlling the time of trapping. Proof of concept was established through laboratory studies and a selected set of field studies. The response from one HFM sampler to another varied less than 10%. Environmentally significant contaminants such as MTBE, benzene, toluene, trichloroethylene, and perchloroethylene can be accurately measured at concentrations below 5 micrograms per liter. The Phase II activities include comprehensive laboratory studies of the permeation thermodynamics and kinetics, evaluation of alternative membrane materials and geometries, refinement of the deployment and sampling hardware, and extensive field studies. The proposed system will provide environmental consultants, regulators, and site owners vastly improved capability to fully characterize the lateral and vertical extent of VOC contamination, leading to faster and more effective remedial efforts. The ultimate beneficiaries of the research will be the citizens who rely on a supply of clean, healthy drinking water.",

The curriculum consists of an interactive CD-ROM, Teacher's Guide, Counselor's Guide, and posters; the four main content modules feature the most common types of mental illness in adolescence: Mood Disorders, Anxiety Disorders, Eating Disorders, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. The goals of the curriculum are to: 1) Present comprehensive, research-based information to increase the knowledge of students about the causes, effects, and treatments of mental illnesses; 2) Reduce stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors; 3) Empower educators to successfully introduce these topics to their students; and 4) Promote collaboration among educators and school counselors to create a supportive school environment related to child mental health. During Phase I, Danya developed the Teacher's guide content and lessons, created a design template for the Teacher's Guide, developed content for the CD-ROM activities, programmed the CD-ROM activities for the Mood Disorders module, drafted content for the Counselor's Guide, designed prototypes of the posters, and evaluated the feasibility of the Mood Disorders module. During Phase II, Danya proposes to finalize the Phase I products, including producing the Teacher's Guide, Counselor's Guide, posters, and CD-ROM, amplify the CD-ROM to include an interactive educational game, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the curriculum.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): Schizophrenia affects roughly 1% of the world's population, with more than two million Americans afflicted in any given year, and an estimated 30-50 million people worldwide. Treatment with available antipsychotic medications often effectively attenuates the positive symptoms of schizophrenia without improvement in the negative symptoms or cognitive deficits. Fewer than 10% of schizophrenic patients are ever able to live independently or hold a regular job even with antipsychotic treatment. The social impact of this fact is that approximately 60% live in poverty and 1 in 20 end up homeless. Dopamine D1 agonists have been identified by most experts in the field as the most promising therapeutic target for improving the cognitive deficits and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. This conclusion has been further supported by a recent consensus panel conducted under the auspices of the NIMH-sponsored MATRICS program, which assigned the highest priority to dopamine D1 agonists as a novel therapy for treating cognitive deficits (working memory) in schizophrenia. DarPharma has developed DAR 0200A, a high affinity dopamine D1 full agonist with full intrinsic activity. DAR-0200A is an extremely promising drug candidate that already has extensive preclinical pharmacological and toxicological data. The overall goals of this SBIR application are to: 1. Complete preclinical development work to support a US Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for the subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of DAR-0200A (subcutaneous formulation, stability assessment, safety pharmacology studies, and additional toxicology studies); 2. Submit and receive approval for a US IND, followed by the initiation and completion of Phase I clinical studies to assess the tolerability and pharmacokinetics of DAR-0200A administered s.c. in humans over a wide dose range; 3. Initiate and complete a Phase II clinical investigation to study the effect of s.c. DAR-0200A on working memory in schizophrenia patients currently treated with antipsychotics.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build a scalable and reliable storage system for network storage environments. This outcome of this project is a revolutionary system that employs a combination of unique ideas to address the main challenges encountered in today's demanding storage environments namely scalability, availability, performance, and manageability. The ideas of this proposed solution are applied as a disk-based solution for the time-consuming network backup/restore problem. With the rapid growth of data-driven network services, traditional storage solutions are not able to keep pace with the rapidly expanding storage requirements. Unlike traditional solutions the proposed solution employs a new architecture that allows for independent and practically unlimited scalability of capacity, file access performance, and namespace access performance. The proposed product utilizes a unique, very fast coding technique called PND to ensure fast, reliable, and highly available access to data. It offers the opportunity of applying a more effective block-level edge caching technique, which enhances the performance and achieves better utilization of the valuable cache memory. It takes advantage of Data Reliability, Inc.'s innovative RAISTM storage engine to cost-effectively aggregate distributed islands of independent storage resources into a single virtual shared pool of storage. Project Phase I has clearly demonstrated the above advantages. Many applications will exploit the competitive advantages of the proposed product including Web server farms; multimedia network services, content management, document storage and delivery, digital imaging, and file transfer services. In addition, the expected solution's ideas can be expanded to build general-purpose file servers that are not subject to performance bottlenecks and capacity limitations. Therefore, these ideas will have an important impact on building next generation NAS devices. The PND technique, pioneered by this project, provides a new class of codes that are expected to result in scientific advances in coding theory. In addition, the PND technique will contribute to enhanced performance and architectures of disk arrays. Applications of PND coding in areas other than data storage include mobile communications, reliable multicasting, audio/video streaming, and digital fountain systems. The company is partnering with Jackson State University (JSU) and will offer JSU students a tremendous educational experience. Since Jackson State University is an HBCU (Historically Black College and University) in the underrepresented state of Mississippi, the project will foster continuous collaboration and will increase the participation of underrepresented and minority groups in science and technology.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Socio-economic factors can be barriers to effective asthma care for vulnerable populations living in urban areas. We hypothesize that a patient care approach called Relationship Centered Care has the potential to reduce the impact of those barriers. Relationship Centered Care encourages providers to develop meaningful and reciprocal interactions with patients, colleagues and the community at large. Phase I funding for this project supported the collection of qualitative data collected from community based health professionals and patients with asthma living in East Harlem, NY, an area with perhaps the highest asthma rates in the country. Phase I also saw the production of a sample version of Bridging the Gap: A Relationship Approach to Asthma Care (video and user's workbook) which was evaluated by community health providers and experts in Relationship Centered Care. The outcome of those efforts was a strong endorsement for the program by health professionals, patients and experts. This Phase II application proposes the production of a four-part educational video based program that will describe and demonstrate the application of Relationship Centered Care for community health professionals who serve people with asthma in socially disadvantaged urban areas. The target audience of health professionals includes physicians, nurses, medical assistants, social workers and other clinic staff members who interact with patients such as receptionists, admitting clerks, and appointment schedulers. Health care research has shown that relationships based on good communication can enhance patient levels of trust, satisfaction, adherence to treatment and health status. But few studies have assessed the effects of communication training on health professionals. Even fewer have assessed the effects of communication training on non-physician health professionals. This program will teach skills that enhance communications and promote relationship building among all the staff members who interact with asthma patients in community clinics. Considering that the burden of asthma is highest among disadvantaged minority populations, the ability to build relationships and communicate in a culturally competent ways is critical. The effectiveness of the Bridging the Gap program will be empirically tested in Phase II. If this intervention is shown to facilitate health professionals' relationships with patients, colleagues and the community, then the potential exists for increasing patient satisfaction and self-management skills, reducing the frequency of acute episodes of asthma and the associated consumption of health care resources.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 4,4'-Dihydroxybenzophenone-2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (A-007) was originally developed as an immune modulator of immune deficiency associated cancerous growths. In a recent study, A-007 was administered as a topical gel to treat anogenital cancers associated with the human papillomavirus (HPV).  There were no local or systemic toxicities and excellent responses were seen -76% CR. All patients with cervical or vaginal neoplasia either had complete elimination of HPV infections or the viral types reduced from high risk to low risk groups. Immunohistochemical (IHC) and computer modeling studies support animal data and the hypothesis that A-007 interacts with the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) T-cell membrane receptor CD45 up-regulating T-cells and improving local immunity. The latter changes override the local neoplastic CIN transformations. Support is provided in the present application to evaluate A-007 as therapy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) associated with HPV. Literature indicates that up to 70% of the CIN I disease can spontaneously disappear. Thus, the present studies have been designed to randomize CIN I to a placebo vs. A-007. The placebo arm will allow for any immune stimulation that follows biopsies and local physical stimulation associated with manipulations of the cervix. The advanced stages of the disease - CIN II/Ill - will be treated only with A-007; since there are no other medical treatments for this stage of disease and surgery would be the next treatment of choice. The CIN I patients treated with placebos will be given the option to receive A-007 after one course, if disease remains.  The specific objectives of this Phase II study will be to topically treat 250 with various stages of CIN infected with HPV and evaluate A-007's ability to reverse CIN changes and eliminate HPV. Local immune modulation will be closely monitored, and standard histopathology and viral assessments will be performed.  The study will be performed at three qualified clinical centers.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose the development of a completely wireless, \"smart\" surface electromyographic (EMG) system. The multi-channel digital system will provide reliable, accurate, and noninvasive monitoring of the neuromuscular system without encumbering the user with wires or body-worn hardware. The innovation is a significant departure from current state-of-the-art systems. Current technology severely constrains the usability and freedom of movement of recording EMG signals, particularly in children and in the many applications where it is not uncommon to record 8 or even 16 channels of such information.    The Phase I prototype sensor will be completely re-designed to reduce its size and power requirements through the use of current state-of-the-art components. The sensor will function within a network of 8 units for extended monitoring periods. They will be encapsulated to withstand the demands of vigorous monitoring activities through implementation of innovations in detection surface geometry and sensor/skin interface. Programming of the sensor will enhance the \"smart\" features of the Phase I sensor and provide full-bandwidth raw EMG signals, processed amplitude parameters of the EMG signal, \"on-off' EMG signal states, and onboard storage of calculated parameters for long term monitoring. The base station from Phase I will be enhanced to control the sensor network, receive the processed EMG signals from the sensors, make them available to a PC, and will support up to 8 sensors in a network that continuously acquires and transmits data. Sensor control will include such features as \"start-stop\" functions, configuration options, and power management. A graphical user interface will be provided to enable the researcher to operate the acquisition system, view the signals in real-time, and provide a conduit for analyzing data using existing software developed by the research team. The system will be evaluated among target populations of children and adults, including patients, during simulated and real-world applications in physical rehabilitation, ergonomics, and sports/exercise.    Upon achieving the objectives of Phase II, the innovation will be at a stage of development that will prepare it for commercialization. The commercial possibilities for this system extend well beyond Nl/-I's immediate interests in rehabilitation, biomechanics, motor control, ergonomics, sports medicine, and sleep studies, to fields of space countermeasures (NASA), and monitoring of land warriors (DOD)",

The Phase I prototype DSS-YWB is based on the concept of a feedback loop with four components, each of which is related to user decisions. These system components- Plan, Implement, Measure, and Compare - serve as an organizing framework for presenting tools that enable users to make, document, and defend decisions critical to incorporating efficacious practices in educational and other service settings. The goal for Phase II is to modify and expand these components to produce a commercial version of the program. Existing evaluations of the Phase I prototype, research on factors related to positive outcomes for youth, and analyses of barriers to the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of effective practices will be used to drive system modification activities. Initial evaluation will involve focus group and in-house testing of an Alpha revision of the program. The results of Alpha testing, coupled with reviews of the program by project consultants, will lead to the development of a Beta version, which will be evaluated using three concurrent replications of a four-group multiple-baseline design across human service decision-making groups in 12 Oregon counties. In each replication, the Beta version will be introduced to one group at a time and its impact will be compared to those groups not yet exposed to the program. We will compare assessments of the methods employed to (a) identify target behaviors, (b) select relevant interventions, (c) set goals for change, and (d) measure the effect of interventions. The resulting system, which integrates all of the tools required to assist decision makers in adopting, implementing, maintaining, and monitoring effective interventions, should prove to be highly useful to those charged with expending public resources to increase youth well-being.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is the leading preventable cause of developmental disabilities in the Western world, but some 20 percent of American women and 40 percent of the heavy drinkers among them continue to consume alcohol during pregnancy. Efforts thus far at prevention have employed \"universal\" methods such as warning labels on alcoholic beverage containers and information or screening in prenatal health care settings. However, high-risk drinkers tend to seek prenatal care late in pregnancy and are often unpersuaded by perfunctory warning labels, failing to recognize or fully appreciate the serious and unpredictable risks of prenatal alcohol exposure. A venue frequently visited by this high-risk population is the public drinking establishment. A high percent of this population have favorite bars they visit regularly, positioning their familiar bartenders and servers to function as credible and potentially effective prevention and early intervention agents by distributing verbal and written information and friendly encouragement to their customers. On occasion a visibly pregnant woman orders alcohol, an event disturbing to servers and one with which they are usually unprepared to deal diplomatically. Previous NIAAA-supported projects have identified a high level of interest and receptivity to this training within the alcohol service industry.      This Phase II program will improve and expand our Phase I prototype for comprehensive FASD prevention training for alcohol servers and managers, which has been well received by test subjects and has produced significant increases in knowledge and confidence. Live trainings of alcohol servers and managers incorporating this same content in a NIAAA-supported project have produced large effect sizes in subsequent \"pseudopatron\" tests. Phase II will include an enlarged sample of video models in a range of alcohol-serving environments with diverse customers and customer responses, as requested by many test subjects, and will develop a companion website providing the more detailed medical and legal information in which many of our test subjects also expressed interest. The Web site will be regularly updated with new medical findings or changes in legislation and case law, and will provide local treatment resources for alcohol treatment referrals. The program will be evaluated in 60 bars in two states, employing a quasi-experimental, pre-post design with controls, using survey measures of knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and reported and anticipated behavior, and observed behavior in response to pregnant-appearing pseudopatrons.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project makes mathematical expressions in common electronic formats seamlessly accessible to people with print disabilities.  Print disabilities include blindness, low vision, dyslexia and other learning disabilities.  While others have explored aspects of accessibility in stand-alone applications, none have integrated access to mathematical content for those with print disabilities into users' existing screen readers or other assistive technology.  The advantage of this project's approach to math accessibility is that it allows documents containing math to be read with standard browsers and document viewers.  The electronic formats supported by this project are web pages that encode math using MathML, Microsoft Word documents, and PDF.  Accessibility is achieved by providing software add-ons to Internet Explorer, Word, and Adobe Reader, and modifications to the industry leading authoring and publishing workflow tools to embed MathML into these formats.  The project brings together work on various aspects of making mathematical content accessible.  It pushes forward the state-of-the-art in audio rendering of mathematical expressions, navigation of mathematical expressions with audio feedback, and audio rendering synchronized with highlighting of the sub expression being spoken.  The project provides a platform that allows other NSF-funded research projects to convert MathML to Braille math codes and other formats.  Accessibility of electronic content is a requirement of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998, Section 508.  Many states have adopted similar requirements for state-funded entities.  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) mandates accessibility of school materials.  Accessibility laws apply to all forms of content, not just textual content.  Current solutions for math accessibility are so costly and time consuming that access to materials in a timely manner is not always provided to those that need the access despite legal mandates.  The results of this project will present a fast and inexpensive route for publishers of textbooks with mathematical content to satisfy these laws.  It will also provide a simple and painless way for people who author documents with math in them to make the document accessible to people with print disabilities.  The availability of books and other material coupled with accessible authoring of mathematical content has the potential to dramatically enhance the way students with print disabilities are taught and learn mathematics, science, engineering and other technical fields.",

During Phase I, we successfully developed and commercialized rat drug-metabolizing enzyme antibody microarrays containing 76 antibodies for cytochromes P450 and co-enzymes, phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes, apoptosis-related proteins, house-keeping proteins and Flag internal control protein.      During Phase II, we will (1) further improve rat polyacrylamide-based hydrogel arrays, (2) improve and develop additional arrays with chips coated with various surface materials, (3) develop and explore signal enhancing methods, (4) develop mouse drug-metabolizing enzyme antibody microarrays, (5) develop human drug-metabolizing enzyme antibody microarrays and (6) explore utility of antibody arrays and discover markers for 5 classes of toxicants.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the US more than 80,000 lower extremity amputations are performed in diabetic patients per year. Foot ulcers are much more common and the path to most amputations starts with an ulcer. The health care cost of these problems has been estimated to be almost $11 billion per year. The longer an ulcer stays open, the more likely it is to get infected and lead to an amputation. \"Usual care\" heals typically only about 30% of ulcers in 20 weeks, yet a total contact cast (TCC) can heal > 90% of ulcers in an average of 8 weeks. The main advantage of the TCC over other approaches is that it mechanically off-loads the wound and, since it cannot be removed by the patient, does so without need for patient compliance. Despite its significant superiority over \"usual care\" in terms of efficacy, acceptance of the TCC by providers is poor and thus efficacious alternatives must be found. Under the completed phase I SBIR we have demonstrated feasibility of a prototype Load Relieving Dressing (LRD) that also does not demand complete patient compliance. We have developed second generation prototypes which show off-loading equivalent to that of a TCC and we have begun testing in actual patients. We are also negotiating an agreement with a major dressing manufacturer which could lead to licensing of the final product. Under this phase II proposal we will refine the design of the LRD to facilitate its application to the wound site while maintaining optimal off-loading and ensuring patient compliance. In addition we will perform a randomized controlled trial of the LRD testing the hypothesis that the LRD will be equivalent in terms of clinical outcomes to the TCC in the treatment of patients with neuropathic foot ulcers. This product not only has commercial potential, but also offers the possibility of putting a tool into the hands of providers which could heal many ulcers faster than is usual at present and could therefore prevent many lower extremity amputations.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The design and manufacture of custom insoles using CAD/CAM has the potential to revolutionize the care of diabetic patients at risk for foot ulceration, thereby preventing amputations. Using this approach, individualization of orthotics could become much more precise, consistent & less expensive than utilizing the still usual handcrafting. Several companies have developed such systems & for each the accurate measurement of foot shape is critical. Existing approaches use sophisticated digitizing machines to capture foot geometry and CAD/CAM to create insoles. These systems are very costly, & a significant portion of this cost is due to the foot digitizing devices. The objective of this revised proposal is to develop and bring to market an inexpensive device, the Haptic Lens, to capture the three-dimensional shape of the plantar surface of the foot. The major strengths of the proposed design are high resolution, low cost, & simplicity, which will make it accessible for use in small clinics & offices. In phase I of this study we have developed a second generation prototype of the Haptic Lens, written software to acquire and process the data, and used optimization methods to show promising results for the accuracy and repeatability. In this proposed phase II we will refine this prototype and accompanying software, reduce its cost, and prepare it for market. Specifically, we will optimize membrane safety and stiffness, add internal calibration, robust packaging, subject stabilization devices, and applied load measurement. The software will be refined to add automatic calibration, operator preview, faster execution, automatic image processing, and output that can easily be integrated into the CAD-CAM footwear algorithms. Performance will be defined through accuracy tests on objects of known geometry & on human feet. We will also develop operator training protocols and web-based instructions. This project is a critical part of an overall effort at DIApedia to design an orthotic system for at-risk diabetic patients that is based on clear scientifically supported design algorithms.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Transcription factors (TF) are key regulators of gene expression. Most TFs reside in the cytosol and when activated translocate to the nucleus to stimulate gene activity. A therapeutically important TF is NFkB which stimulates genes involved in cell cycling, proliferation and inflammatory responses and is an important molecular target for the development of anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory drugs. Since nuclear translocation is a critical event in NFkB's ability to regulate gene expression, technologies that measure NFkB translocation could be used to screen for novel anti-neoplastic and anti-inflammatory agents that block the translocation process. However, there are few technologies to measure the movement of TFs from the cytosol to the nucleus and none that is amenable for high throughput drug discovery. DiscoveRx has developed an enzyme fragment complementation (EFC) technology that could be used to detect the translocation of TFs using an extremely sensitive beta-galactosidase (B-gal) complementation assay.   This method utilizes two genetically-engineered fragments of E. coli Beta-gal. The larger fragment, termed Enzyme Acceptor (EA), contains a deletion near the amino terminus, while the smaller fragment, termed Enzyme Donor (ED), contains the amino-terminal sequence missing from EA. Alone, EA is inactive.   However, it can recombine with ED to form an active enzyme that can catalyze the formation of a fluorescent product detected photometrically as a visually amplified response. We propose to develop a direct assay for NFkB translocation using EFC technology. We will engineer ED into NFkB and target EA to the nucleus. When ED-NFkB translocates to the nucleus it will be able to recombine with EA to generate an active Beta-gal that can catalyze the formation of fluorescent products. As a complementary approach to measure NFkB translocation, we will develop a novel NFkB reporter gene assay using our EFC technology in which an NFkB response element drives the production of a GST-ED fusion protein whose expression will be detected with EA in a simplified cell based fluorescent assay. These studies will develop the first NFkB translocation for drug discovery. In the future, we will adapt this assay as a general technology for drug discovery against any TF to open up an entirely new field of transcription factor Pharmacology and therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hemophilia A is a bleeding disorder caused by the absence of clotting factor VIII (FVIII). This disease is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. There are 15,000 affected individuals in the U.S. Treatment of Hemophilia A is based on frequent delivery of recombinant FVIII (recombinate). However, the high expense of this treatment (as much as $100,000 per year in severe cases) and variable levels of FVIII maintained in the circulation compromise the effectiveness of this therapy. FVIII gene therapy represents a more efficacious and cost-effective treatment of the disease. We propose continued development of the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system in a Phase II study of non-viral FVIII-gene transfer and expression in the liver as a therapeutic approach for hemophilia A. This approach is based on results from our Phase I studies of long-term, SB transposon-mediated FVIII gene expression in livers of FVIII-deficient mice. We hypothesize that the FVIII gene can similarly be delivered and expressed in the livers of larger animals (ultimately, humans), providing long-term and curative expression of FVIII. These goals are addressed in four Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will test for SB-mediated long-term expression of reporter genes and the FVIII gene in the livers of mice after delivery of transposon and transposase components directly to the hepatic circulation via retroductal delivery. In Aim 2 we will determine the efficacy of using DNA, DNA-polycation complexes or other DNA complexes for delivery of transposons to liver. These conditions will then be used in Aim 3 to test for SB-mediated long-term expression of reporter genes in the livers of dogs as a large animal model for in vivo gene transfer. In Aim 4, results from the experiments in normal dogs will be used to evaluate the SB system for transposition and long-term expression of the canine FVIII gene in a dog model of hemophilia A, testing for improved clotting and correction of the bleeding disorder. At every stage we will examine animal tissues for histopathological indications of adverse events. Results from these preclinical studies will position DGI for submission of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) to the FDA, with subsequent initiation of a clinical trial testing the effectiveness of the SB system FVIII gene therapy in human subjects. Technological Innovation: Sleeping Beauty is a novel gene transfer system with potential application in gene therapy. The market size for the inherited-diseases market niche, to which this technology applies is about $5.8 billion.",

This instrument will be capable of scanning a microscope slide in a single sweep at a numerical aperture of NA = 0.65, covering the entire width and length of a slide with 0.47- um sampling. The fundamental innovation consists in the use of an array of 100 miniaturized objectives, each measuring approximately 2 mm in diameter and 9 mm in length, slightly staggered in the array, to produce a single, seamless sweep of the slide. This innovation allows a very rapid full-color scan requiring less than 60 seconds for a full microscope slide of 20 mm by 50 mu m, at diffraction-limited sampling. This scanning speed is a factor of 10-20 faster than any single-objective system's.   The Phase I application laid out the scientific innovation and merit of the array microscope scanning technology. It is the overall goal of Phase II to build on the accomplishments of Phase I and produce an economical, high-throughput digital slide scanner that can be either a stand-alone solution or integrated with existing image-management and analysis solutions. We will achieve this goal through a combination of developments in manufacturing (result: economical scanner) and software (result: tools to seamlessly connect our instrument to third-party laboratory-information-system or quantitative-analysis software).

In Phase I, we completed successfully a preliminary design of a state-of-the-art CMOS image sensor. We were able to establish the feasibility of all specifications laid out in Phase I and found no technical barriers to the fabrication of such an imaging device. Furthermore, we successfully developed an analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) electronics board, designed specifically to interface with the proposed image sensor. All success criteria of Phase I were either met or exceeded.   In this Phase II application, we propose to complete the development of a 480 MB/sec image-acquisition system for an array-microscope slide scanner to generate virtual slides in histopathology and cytology. The first Aim is to complete the design and fabrication of the CMOS image sensor. The most distinguishing features of this image sensor are its 1.65-mu m pixels, its large 27-mm-widm format, and its combined output data rate of 480 MB/sec. The impact of the new image sensor on our technology will be profound: a quadrupling of slide scanning speed and a doubling of spatial resolution to reach equivalence with 40X conventional microscope optics. The second Aim is to develop prototype image capture & processing electronics that will achieve real-time JPEG2000 image compression and have the potential for enabling real-time image analysis carried out on sixteen PowerPC processors.   DMetrix has extensive experience will all facets of the required effort in Phase II. This experience was gained during the development of our current product, a first-of-its-kind array-microscope scanner.   The proposed image-acquisition system will lead to a virtual-slide scanner with applications in histopathology, cytology, telepathology, pathology education, pharmaceutical research, and industrial inspection. To our best knowledge, the resulting virtual-slide scanner will have a minimum 20-fold speed competitive advantage relative to our closest competitor and will double the spatial resolution of our current product to 0.235 mu m sampling.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human genome encodes  approximately 30,000 genes, and alternative splicing results in approximately 100,000 different RNAs in the cell. Genomic discoveries for disease susceptibility require thermodynamic knowledge in RNA-DNA interactions to create optimal assays using primers and probes. The overall, long-term mission of DNA Software Inc. is to facilitate genomic investigations with software that incorporates state-of-the-art knowledge of thermodynamics and kinetics of nucleic acid folding and hybridization. To enhance our existing Oligonucleotide Modeling Platform (OMP) platform, we propose to measure a complete thermodynamic i parameter database for RNA-DNA hybridization to facilitate the next step in the Human Genome Project, RNA expression assays. Most of the needed RNA-DNA nearest-neighbor parameters have never been measured. This proposal will address this gap in knowledge by performing a systematic series of measurements, appropriate data analysis and theoretical modeling. The parameters will be incorporated into OMP's database to improve the accuracy of RNA-DNA hybridization predictions. Completion of an RNA-DNA thermodynamic database will require approximately 320 new UV thermal denaturation measurements in addition to those already in the literature; thus, we are pursuing a fast-track proposal. In Phase I, we will determine the thermodynamics of 84 sequences to improve the existing match RNA-DNA parameters under various salt conditions, and perform thermal denaturation measurements on a sampling of other motifs in RNA-DNA heteroduplexes including internal single mismatches, terminal mismatches and dangling ends. These initial results will provide guidelines for the design of over 250 measurements in phase II, which will provide a complete database for mismatches, terminal mismatches, dangling ends, as well as bulges, internal loops and Mg2+ concentration dependence. Also in phase II, we will incorporate all of these parameters into our algorithms, create GUIs to extend OMP's capabilities and perform experimental validations. These accurate probe/primer designs will facilitate a variety of biotechnologies, such as gene-specific reverse-transcription PCR, cRNA expression profiling, RNA antisense technology, in situ hybridization of mRNA, Northern blot analysis, and other RNA detection methods.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available methods for biological molecular structure determination, based primarily on x-ray crystallography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) solution methods, have limitations. While the x-ray methods are several orders of magnitude faster, NMR techniques are required to obtain dynamical information, or information on biological molecules in their native environments, both of which are essential for function elucidation. One of the more promising recent additions to the arsenal of NMR tools has been the use of long-range constraints from residual dipolar couplings in partially aligned solutions. Partial macromolecule alignment has been obtained by using dilute liquid crystal solutions of disc-shaped particles called bicelles, but this does not permit the needed dynamical control over the alignment. Very recent analyses and experiments by several foremost NMR research groups indicate novel Switched Angle Spinning (SAS) techniques should provide the needed dynamic control over the bicelle (hence, the protein) alignment. When a sample containing discoidal bicelles of negative magnetic anisotropy is spun at 54.7x with respect to B0 in Magic Angle Spinning (MAS), their interaction with B0 vanishes and their orientation becomes random. For sample spinning at angles less than 54.7x, they align with their normals perpendicular to the spinning axis, while spinning at greater angles causes their normals to align with the spinning axis. Dynamic control over the spinning axis is expected to provide the protein alignment control needed for more effective utilization of the bond angle information inherent in the residual dipolar coupling. This instrument will also facilitate NMR techniques needed for the study of insoluble proteins, and a closely related variant, an H/X/Y HR MAS with a high-performance Magic Angle Gradient, will enable Frydman's ultra-fast multidimensional NMR techniques in inhomogeneous systems.  The instrumental requirements of SAS NMR suitable for protein structure determination are extremely challenging. The NMR probe must be capable of multinuclear triple-resonance MAS with highly sensitive indirect (1H) detection with high resolution (0.005 ppm) at fields up to 19 T. In addition, rapid (25 ms) reorientation of the spinning axis is required without adversely affecting spinning stability or rf tuning; and there are a number of additional requirements, including pulsed field gradients, stable temperature control, low 1H background signals, and compatibility with narrow-bore (NB) high-field magnets. The Phase I project demonstrated feasibility of a high-performance 1H/X/Y PFG-HR-SAS probe suitable for a NB magnet at 600 MHz, though a number of optimization and product refinement issues remain. The Phase II will complete these developments necessary for commercial products compatible with Bruker, JEOL, and Varian NB spectrometers at fields up to 800 MHz. The Phase II will include testing of the instruments by Dr. Ad Bax, chief scientist at NIH-NIDDK.",

Some warts may convert to cancers, and the wart virus, human papillomavirus, is the cause of cervical cancer accounting for more than 250,000 deaths annually of women worldwide. The objectives of this proposal are to develop marketable, topical formulations of tetraethylammonium chloride (TEAC) for the treatment of human papillomavirus-induced common warts. This work is directly related to the current support of FDA regulatory submissions for this indication. The proposal describes the manufacturing process, pharmacology, and toxicology studies (to establish safety and antiviral activity of the formulations), required to proceed forward with the series of FDA Phase l/ll clinical trials needed to establish therapeutic efficacy and safety in man. The initial formulation identification, optimization, and selection procedures (that include evaluation of the antiviral activity of promising formulations), were accomplished in the Phase I SBIR grant. This Phase II proposal includes: 1) Development of analytical methods for monitoring TEAC and its degradants; 2) Manufacture of formulations under Good Manufacturing Procedures for use in toxicology and clinical studies, as well as formulation stability studies; 3) Evaluation of the safety of TEAC formulations in animal models for primary skin and eye irritation; 4) Evaluation of TEAC formulation toxicity in a topical repeat-dose study in minipigs; 5) Clinical demonstration in a 21-day cumulative irritation study that the lead TEAC formulation is a non-irritant; and 6) Clinical demonstration of safety and efficacy of the lead TEAC formulation in a proof-of principle study in patients with common warts. TEAC, a compound with known antiviral activity, has a very promising safety profile in humans and affords a significant opportunity to become the first FDA-approved topical product for the treatment of common warts.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The aim of this program is to develop and bring to commercialization a new ultrasound Doppler device to be used to monitor the flow in dialysis access grafts. By detecting falling flow before the graft thromboses, this instrument can significantly reduce the $1 billion and thousands of days of hospitalization now caused by these graft failures. In a small group of dialysis patients, a research version of this device has been shown to be accurate while quickly measuring graft flow, and, because of its unique automatic operation, has been used by non-specialists. Because of its low cost, ease-of-use, and speed, weekly measurements of graft flow are practical, rather than the monthly intervals that other systems have required. Additionally, because the ultrasound Doppler instrument is used before the patient is connected to the dialysis machine, it is not affected by the hemodynamic changes caused by hemodialysis, nor does it interrupt the dialysis procedure, unlike other systems that have been used up to now. In this Fast Track Proposal, Phase I will validate the instrument's sensitivity and specificity in a statistically significant sized group, and test the operator-independence of the measurement. If the instrument meets the goals set in Phase I, Phase II will establish a randomized, controlled clinical trial, comparing a control group having usual care with a matched experimental group being monitored weekly with the new device. Total medical costs and hospitalization associated with the two groups will be captured and compared, with the hypothesis being tested that the monitored group will show significantly reduced access-related costs and improved quality of life, as measured by hospitalization. During Phase I and II, the research instrument will be redesigned as a small, portable unit with a PDA as the interface to the user. Production prototypes will be ready by the end of Phase II so that commercialization will be able to proceed quickly.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The development of low polarization electrode coatings for cardiac pacing, sensing and defibrillation is proposed. These coatings address the needs of the cardiac rhythm management (CRM) industry in the development of low-polarization pacing, low impedance defibrillation, and post-stimulus sensing methodologies. The coatings are based on films of sputtered iridium oxide (SIROFs) and IrTi-oxide with tailored surface morphologies that maximizes low-polarization charge-injection. The addition of titanium to form a mixed, IrTi-oxide significantly enhances the chemical and physical stability of the coatings without compromising pacing and sensing performance. The development of IrTi-oxide in Phase I is considered significant, since it provides a means through siloxane chemistry to covalently attach a broad range of functional organic species to the surface of the electrode to enhance biocompatibility and moderate inflammatory responses. The Phase II Aims are 1) To develop robust, low-cost coatings for cardiac electrodes that reduce pacing thresholds and permit reliable sensing of cardiac electrical activity; 2) To develop organically functionalized coatings for cardiac electrodes that reduce fibrotic tissue encapsulation and lower pacing thresholds relative to non-functionalized electrodes, and 3) To develop low-impedance coatings that reduce defibrillation thresholds (DFTs) of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) electrodes. Reduced thresholds and improved sensing will benefit the patient by enhancing the efficacy of the implant and by increasing the time between surgical procedures necessary to replace batteries. The SIROF and IrTi-oxide will be lower cost than competing coating materials (e.g. TiN), making them attractive commercially. In Phase II, in vitro assessments of the anti-inflammatory properties of covalently functionalized organic surface coatings will be made and these coatings evaluated for long-term stability by accelerated in vitro testing. The performance of SIROF, IrTi-oxide and functionalized IrTi-oxide for pacing and defibrillation will be assessed experimentally. As a step towards clinical implementation, the more optimum coatings will be evaluated for chronic pacing in a sheep model and for reduced DFTs in an acute pig model. The in vivo studies will be done with collaborators at the University of Alabama.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): Electroencephalography (EEG) is a safe, noninvasive technique for monitoring neonatal brain function. Acute and long-term EEG monitoring of infants has clinical utility for evaluating the effects of hypoxic ischemic insults and detecting the presence of epileptic activity. Medical intervention may be effective for several neonatal brain pathologies if these are detected early. In Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), for example, disorders in the neurophysiology of sleep regulation may be potentially life-threatening for many infants, and may be amenable to treatment, but we have a limited understanding of both the normal neonatal sleep neurophysiology and its disregulation. The information available in neonatal EEG can be greatly enhanced by using an adequate number of electrodes to accurately map the spatial distribution of the EEG without spatial aliasing. The Geodesic EEG Neonatal Brain Monitor will be designed from experimental studies and theoretical simulations of the required sampling density for scalp potentials on the infant head. Dense Array EEG methods will be developed that incorporate the unique features of infant skull anatomy to estimate the potentials in the brain of the infant. The Geodesic EEG Neonatal Brain Monitor will be adapted for a variety of clinical uses, initially focusing on monitoring brain function in sleep in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). A low-cost product line would result from the Phase II work, ranging from simple 4- channel EEG with vital signs monitors to a 256-channel dense array system. These products will bring major advances to monitoring both normal and pathological brain states of the neonate, providing information on the maturation of arousal control and sleep in preterm and full term infants that may be important in understanding a variety of clinical disorders.",

However, EEG evaluations in demanding clinical settings often require long-term monitoring, and the current sponge-saline electrode technology provides usable EEG for only 2-3 hours before re-hydration is required.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Occupational exposures to hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI), occur during the production and use of stainless steel, chromate chemicals, and chromate pigments and operations such as chrome plating and coating processes. NIOSH considers all Cr(VI) compounds to be potential occupational carcinogens, and an increased risk of lung cancer has been demonstrated in exposed workers. Compliance with occupational exposure protection requirements for toxic metals is currently very difficult for industrial and government facilities to achieve. The purpose of this program is to create an automated, low-cost method for rapidly quantifying potential exposures to chromium via respiratory pathways. This will be accomplished by developing and field-testing analytical instrumentation and methodology to assist facilities in reducing the potential for occupational exposures to airborne chromium. The ultimate goal of the program is the creation of approved NIOSH and ASTM methods for automated airborne chromium analysis using ultrasonic extraction and adsorptive stripping voltammetry. This research plan is expected to firmly establish the technical basis for the new method, and will provide a capability in this field that does not currently exist. The potential for commercial application of this technology is extremely high due to its excellent sensitivity, rapid sample turnaround time, and low cost. All instrument functions are performed automatically, which differentiates the approach from any other method, and projects to a much more user-friendly design for use by industrial and government facilities. This program will also be instrumental in supporting the broader objective of developing a series of approved methods for automated monitoring and rapid analysis of other metals that pose health risks in occupational environments. A series of analyzers and methods based on ultrasonic extraction/electrochemical detection techniques is envisioned, which broadens the impact beyond chromium and supports the goal of effective, low-cost methods for the entire range of toxic respirable metals.",

Mild steel is the desired material for constructing these pipelines; however, mild steel corrodes very quickly compared to more expensive alloys.  A new low-cost coating method is needed to deposit a corrosion resistant coating on the interior surface of mild steel pipes.  This project will develop a low cost chemical vapor deposition method to deposit functionally graded aluminum-nitride/aluminum-oxide coatings onto the surface of mild steel.  Aluminum nitride provides a strong chemical bond to the steel surface and aluminum oxide provides a high-temperature corrosion and oxidation-resistant surface.  In Phase I, aluminum chloride molten salt and ammonia complexes were prepared.  The aluminum chloride ammonia complex was then used to deposit aluminum nitride on the surface of mild steel using chemical vapor deposition techniques.  By controlling deposition conditions, a functionally-graded aluminum- nitride/aluminum-oxide layer was shown to adhere well to mild steel substrates.  In Phase II, deposition conditions will be optimized for controlling the density, composition, and thickness of functionally graded corrosion resistant coatings.  Coated steel samples will be tested for corrosion/oxidation resistance and mechanical strength.  Finally, the low-cost deposition process will be scaled-up to demonstrate commercial potential.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new coating technology should be applicable to the prevention of corrosion in high temperature pipelines, which are utilized in such key industries as power plants, petrochemical plants, and paper mills.

New membrane materials will be developed by systematically alloying various elements in order to improve the membrane resistance to fracture.  Substituents will be introduced into the membrane lattice to manipulate hydrogen solubility, scavenge interstitial impurities, and control alloy grain size.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to accurately measure in vivo tendon forces would have a broad impact on studying tissue properties, advancing assistive technologies, and furthering our scientific understanding of the human neuromuscular control system. Myoelectric prosthetics and functional electrical stimulation devices could utilize closed-loop control strategies, resulting in restored motor function in disabled populations. Furthermore, researchers could accurately study soft tissue properties, neuromuscular function, and motor performance directly, rather than having to rely on inaccurate, numerical approximations of these systems. It may also be possible for miniature in vivo sensors to provide feedback during surgical procedures such as limb re-attachment and cardiac treatments. During Phase I of this project, a novel optically based sensor was developed that has shown great promise in achieving this goal. Our device, which can be miniaturized to less than 500 microns in diameter, is based on a modified fiber Bragg grating (MFBG) optical strain sensor. Through a series of experiments that included testing synthetic, animal, and human tendons, the MFBG sensor has demonstrated the ability to accurately measure tendon forces with a number of important advantages over other techniques. These include, (1) the ability to measure tendon forces without being influenced by skin artifacts that have plagued optically based approaches in the past, (2) the ability to measure very localized forces, (3) automatic compensation of temperature variations and (4) the ability to control the size and sensitivity of the sensor depending on the application. We are confident that this new sensor will result in fundamental and scientific advances in both research and commercial settings. The general aim of this Phase II project is to construct and test a robust commercially viable measurement system based on the new optical force sensor developed during Phase I.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project integrates the imaging system developed in Phase I with a smart-sensor injection system that can inject or sample from the cavity underlying the early chicken embryo with high levels of accuracy accompanied with improved hatch when compared to manual methods.  The Phase I work showed that it was possible to image and detect the blastoderm in the presence of a biological membrane with high levels of accuracy (94%). The Phase II project will focus on the technology required to build an injection system using smart sensors that can detect and then move to the fluid cavity to inject (or to sample).  The system will thus provide a totally automated solution to early embryo detection and manipulation, with movement in all three dimensions, while still sustaining  hatchability of the developing chicken. This research would advance the state of the art for the production of chimeric chickens with superior traits or for producing transgenic chickens for the avian pharmaceutical industry.  The commercial application of this technology is in two large, important industries. In the commercial poultry industry, chimeric chickens could be created in a high-throughput system that possess desired traits like disease resistance (for example, to diseases such as Marek's, Newcastle and Coccidiosis), increased tolerance to stress, and the ability to digest certain feed compounds such as phosphates.  Secondly, in the avian pharmaceutical industry, therapeutic proteins used for manufacturing drugs could be created much more cheaply by using a transgenic chicken that can produce transgenic proteins in its eggs.  Many therapeutics for diseases like cancer and leukemia are manufactured in mammalian or bacterial systems that face bottlenecks in supply and are extremely expensive to produce. The proposed device advances the state-of-the-art in early embryo  injection beyond the limits of the manual method so as to allow a faster, more accurate way of producing transgenic chickens and proteins.",

        "abstract": "Biodiesel is a type of diesel fuel that is made from vegetable oil instead of petroleum. Obstacles to wide scale use in the US are the higher cost of biodiesel and the dearth of local processing facilities. In Washington State, canola is a high oil seed crop that can be used to make biodiesel. The canola meal that is left after oil extraction is an excellent food for cattle. However, high production costs in combination with fluctuating wholesale prices have made canola an unsure prospect for farmers. Finally, biosolids are the nutrient rich by-product of wastewater treatment. Although biosolids are used by farmers there are some concerns in the general public about their suitability as a fertilizer for food chain crops. We will create a closed loop facility to produce biodiesel in a cost effective manner. The key to our operation is to involve biodiesel users in the production process itself. Emerald Ranches currently contracts with 15 municipalities to distribute their biosolids. We will integrate an oil extraction and diesel processing facility into our existing biosolids application operation. The farmers will have a guaranteed market for canola, municipalities will have a home for their biosolids, diary farmers will have a local source of meal, and all participants will have a local source for their diesel fuel. In addition, the extraction and diesel production facility will create new jobs in our county.",

        "abstract": "Experimental studies conducted under an SBIR Phase I (SBIR I) Grant, 1 R43 AG023510, have identified a compound that is a potential treatment for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Encore Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (EncorePharma ) holds a composition of matter patent for the compound. The compound's mode of action in in vitro testing and its activity in preliminary studies in the G93A-SOD1 mouse model of ALS, suggest it may be the first drug candidate to have an overall impact on ALS disease progression. This SBIR Phase II Application (SBIR II) seeks support to further preclinical development of the compound in preparation for submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application to the FDA, allowing initiation of clinical trials with the compound. The important preclinical development work defined in this SBIR II is the first step in commercialization of a potentially important new pharmaceutical agent. The successful scientific/business collaborations with the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF) in SBIR I will be further cultivated in SBIR II. The SBIR II Specific Aims are: to optimize the dose level and route of administration in concert with selecting the active enantiomer using well-defined rodent models of ALS; to conduct chemical process development and small to intermediate scale manufacture of compound (drug substance) according to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP); to conduct appropriate supporting toxicology and pharmacology studies (including gene toxicity and metabolism) according to Good Laboratory Practices; to evaluate in ALS rodent models the utility of C-tau and other molecules as appropriate, as a biomarker for translation into the clinical setting. With a positive preclinical safety and efficacy profile, an IND will be prepared, filed with FDA and Orphan Drug Designation sought. As the compound may exert an effect against the neuroinflammatory component of ALS and many neurological diseases such as Huntington's, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, EncorePharma will support, as appropriate, experimental studies with the compound and/or other related compounds in models and systems relevant to these diseases. The need to move this potential therapeutic forward for a disease that has very few treatment alternatives cannot be understated. A total of 60,000 to 100,000 individuals are estimated to be affected with ALS worldwide at any given time, and the incidence of the disease is approximately five to nine persons per 100,000. The market potential for a therapeutic hi ALS alone is $100-300 million.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput screening approaches are ubiquitious in the pharmaceutical industry as part of the drug discovery process. A variety of sensors are used in these screens, the most common of which are spectroscopic. Such absorbance or fluorescence based high-throughput screens inevitably require the use of extrinsic probes to provide a signal, and often require labeling of the target receptor or the test ligand. Binding reactions are then monitored indirectly, grom changes in the optical properties of the extrinsic label. We propose the design and production of a high-throughput differential scanning calorimeter (HT-DSC) for use in drug discovery. Calorimetry offers a significant advantage over spectroscopic approaches in that it directly monitors heat changes for binding reactions without the need for receptor modification or labeling. Heat is a \"universal signal\" that can not only detect binding reactions qualitatively but can also be used to dgorously quantify binding reactions by providing detailed thermodynamic information. In this Phase I project period, we will complete the detailed design plans for a 100 cell array differential scanning calorimeter with sensitivity and sample sizes comparable to existing single-cell biocalorimeters that are commercially available. We will complete demonstration experiments using DNA and protein binding reactions to illustrate the advantages of array calorimetry, using existing prototype 16-cell and 100-cell HTDSC instruments. Finally we will begin development of assay protocols for specific DNA and protein reactions for use in Phase II of this project when production prototype HT-DSC instruments will be produced and tested.",

This number is growing. Despite a vast drug pharmacopoeia, and sophisticated medication distribution systems, the availability of liquid medications is limited. Less than 28% of oral drugs available in the United States are commercially available as liquids, and there are significant gaps in several important therapeutic categories. Increasing penetration of point-of-care automated dispensing in institutional healthcare much more readily supports solid drug distribution, putting additional logistical pressure on liquid drug distribution.  Thus institutional caregivers still must \"liquefy\" capsules and tablets at the bedside for over 55% of the liquid medication needs of their patients - millions of doses - by \"bash and smash\" techniques. This extemporaneous compounding of liquid medications has significant problems impacting caregiver efficiency, enteral tube failure, and safe and effective administration of [liquid] medications; problems unremedied by pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmacy intervention, or legacy drug-crushing devices. We have devised an innovative device and process capable of rapidly liquefying a majority of the solid drugs for enteral administration. The tabletop appliance would allow a caregiver close to the bedside to rapidly liquefy solid medications just prior to administration. Phase I has demonstrated feasibility of the method and apparatus.  Phase II will continue engineering development of a prototype device, and assuring the chemical and pharmaceutical stability of liquefied drug products.",

Electromagnetic valve actuators are rapidly emerging as the technical solution for improved emissions, fuel consumption and greater engine performance. Dramatic improvement in engine performance and reduction in environmental impact is possible with this technology.  A fully electronically controlled inlet/exhaust valve actuating system eliminates camshafts and other mechanical components completely, thus (1) allowing optimization of the gas-exchange process across the whole engine speed and load range, and (2) eliminating the packaging restrictions placed upon an engine by conventional camshaft profiling. The primary application of the actuator is automotive internal combustion engine valves. The ability to alter the lift and timing (opening and closing) of automotive engine valves will create more powerful engines that require less fuel and create fewer emissions. In fuel savings alone, an estimated 15% savings can be achieved, which equates to saving approximately 475 million barrels of oil per year for US consumption worth approximately $21 billion per year. Improving fuel economy is a worthy national goal: it will reduce America's dependence on imported oil, cut the carbon emissions that contribute to global warming, and increase automotive competitiveness.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Hemodialysis is currently required by more than 200,000 Americans with this number expected to climb significantly in the next decade. During each dialysis session, only a portion of the waste products normally eliminated by the kidneys is actually removed. The subject device of this research proposal is designed to be more efficient than current dialyzer units and at the same time present smaller foreign surface area to minimize deleterious blood-biomaterial interactions.  The long-term object of this research is to complete the development of a highly efficient hemodialyzer, Renal Flow. This device achieves its high efficiency through the use of active mixing whereby the dialyzer element is rotated within the blood environment to minimize fluid phase resistance resulting in increased mass transfer efficiency. This rotational motion also imparts energy to the blood which could obviate the need for a separate blood pump as currently required by dialysis machines. Increased efficiency and elimination of unnecessary components should allow for more complete removal of waste products while minimizing the amount of blood contacting surface area.  In Phase II, we propose to increase our fabrication efficiency and yield by injection molding components, developing new methods of fiber array production, utilizing clean room production, and automating device fabrication. In addition, we propose to integrate the RenalFlow controller into a clinically available dialysis console.  Multiple prototypes using various fiber types, fiber densities, and surface areas will be constructed in Year 1 and evaluated. The most promising design will then be optimized and fully characterized in Year 02.  Comprehensive in vitro and ex vivo evaluations are an integral part of this program. We propose to use bovine blood in vitro for mass transfer calculations and calves with chronic hemodialysis shunts for multiple RenalFlow biocompatibility evaluations. Dialyzer cartridges will be reprocessed per current clinical practice to mimic actual use.",

        "abstract": "75857S  Mitigation of high voltage breakdowns is a major concern in the development of higher-field radio frequency (RF) cavities for next generation accelerators.  It is widely believed that the local surface condition of high-voltage electrodes, at atomic-scales, is the critical factor that determines the maximum electrical field strength that can be maintained without breakdown.  However, all existing techniques for electrode surface preparation and conditioning fail to provide adequate correction and passivation of atomic scale defects and asperities.  As a result, RF cavities invariably must be operated at much lower potentials than would otherwise be possible.  This project will apply an established surface processing technique, Gas Cluster Ion Beam (GCIB) smoothing, to produce surface smoothing to atomic levels on RF cavity surfaces.  It is anticipated that use of GCIB smoothing will dramatically increase breakdown strengths and result in a major improvement of operating stabilities.  In Phase I, samples of electrode materials with typical surface finish were treated with various GCIB processes.  It was found that large asperities could be removed, and that smoothing effects could be extended up to 2\u00bfm.  A new theory of the role of nanoscale roughness in RF breakdown was developed, and a useful model of cluster smoothing of large asperities was demonstrated.  In Phase II, the GCIB chemical removal of the grain structure from Nb electrode material will be further investigated.  Studies of the RF breakdown of GCIB-treated electrodes will be conducted, and an apparatus for in situ GCIB treatment of RF cavities will be designed and built.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Gas Cluster Ion Beam processing of RF cavities would significantly reduce the size and cost of high-energy particle accelerators by allowing reliable operation at higher acceleration gradients.  The processing also should increase the service lifetime of RF components by reducing damage caused by RF breakdown, and it may decrease the time and expense of conditioning RF cavities by eliminating steps used to prepare them for high-vacuum, high-voltage operation.  In addition, electrode smoothing could benefit any application where achieving the maximum surface field strength is critical.",

Current kinase profiling technologies such as Western blotting of flow cytometry are low throughput, not quantitative and difficult to multiplex and standardize. This novel technology (Proteome Epitope Tag or PET) creates antibodies with pre-defined specificity that can be multiplexed using standardized assays on antibody microarrays for measuring protein phosphorylation. The PET approach will be further developed to construct highly multiplexed antibody arrays for simultaneous measurement of a large number of kinase protein activities from multiple pathways. The ability to measure all signaling proteins from interconnected pathways will provide an unprecedented opportunity to decipher the complexity of cell signaling. The commercial applications of this technology will be in  large scale protein analysis relevant to basic biological research, drug discovery, and clinical medicine. Protein biochips hold great promise for biomarker discovery which is important in all these areas. Large-scale protein biochips capable of standardized and high-throughput protein measurement on differentially perturbed biological systems do not exist today. This is due primarily to the lack of highly specific antibodies for all human proteins predicted by gene sequences. The PET technology addresses this urgent, unmet need by generating antibodies for highly specific peptide tags of defined sequences in a proteome, representing a universal method for producing antibodies and standardized chip-based assays for any protein of interest. PET chips for profiling kinase signaling networks will have enormous utility for drug discovery by better characterizing drug efficacy, side effects and potential toxicity.",

        "abstract": "Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in the United States and accounts for 15% of blindness worldwide. The Vision Research Plan for the National Eye Institute establishes identifying the biological mechanisms responsible for glaucoma as a national priority. Recent research indicates that many forms of glaucoma have a genetic component. Development of a non-invasive, accurate, and reliable method to measure IOP in rodents will greatly facilitate the identification of genes involved in IOP regulation and the susceptibility of the retina and the optic nerve to glaucomatous damage. A non-invasive technique for measuring IOP in mice will enable repeated measurements on a single eye and be more useful for investigating the effect of age, drugs, and other factors on IOP over time. Luna Innovations, along with Dr. Simon John at the Jackson Laboratory, Dr. John Morrison at the Casey Eye Institute, and Dr. Jay McLaren at the Mayo Clinic, is developing a system for non-invasive intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement with contact area feedback in rodents. During the Phase I program, the Luna Innovations team demonstrated the ability of a prototype device to measure IOP and confirm applanated area in testing with rats. The focus of this resubmitted Phase II proposal is to optimize system performance and completely calibrate and validate performance in rodent studies.",

The new capability is derived from Luna's patented ultrasonic phase-locked-loop research that will be scaled to operate at seismic frequencies appropriate for groundwater monitoring. The instrument will operate from small well bores to assess the dynamic and directional flow of water by using the properties of the water/soil itself under existing hydraulic loads. Changes in the flow dynamics will be measured over time to assess if natural or human interventions are altering the historic flow parameters. The instrument has the potential to become the standard for future measurements and fill a critical need to assess groundwater transport models.

Luna has identified a commercialization path and a partner (Varian) who has voiced product support if we are successful in the Phase II. This breakthrough technology can result in the ability to image the three dimensional thermal dose absorbed in the tissue phantom, a critical pre-treatment parameter that could alter medical protocols. The product from this technology has an important role for both economics and health care.  COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: There are two major products that will come from this research breakthrough. The first is calibration device that can become a secondary standard in place at all 1800 treatment facilities in the US. A second device will be launched as a research instrument for radiotherapy research centers that will permit the characterization of thermal distribution in 3-D in a tissue phantom for beam profile absorbed dose assessment.

This project will develop high-temperature, radiation-hardened fiber optic pressure and temperature sensors for existing and emerging nuclear reactor plants.  During Phase I, a pressure sensor design, previously demonstrated at 800 \u00bfC, was optimized for reactor environments by adding same-point temperature measurement and by reducing thermal induced errors in the pressure measurement.  Three prototypes were calibrated from 0-400 psi and from 0-172 \u00bfC, and then subjected to 16 hours of radiation testing.  Less that 1% drift was demonstrated in the sensor during the radiation testing.  A breadboard instrument was assembled, and software was developed, to measure both temperature and pressure in a single sensor at the same location on a single fiber.  During Phase II, the sensor design will be optimized with respect to yield, cost, and ease of construction.  Prototype sensor performance and endurance will be characterized at temperatures up to 1000\u00bfC.  Long term endurance testing (400 hours) will be conducted in a high radiation environment with elevated temperature excursions.

The most promising of these compounds have been evaluated in a series of carefully integrated in-vitro experiments using informative cell lines and in-vivo studies in lean and diet induced- obese (DIO) mice, with special emphasis placed on whole animal calorimetry. Distinct targets and mechanisms by which these compounds produce weight loss have been defined: 1) FAS1183 and 1057 inhibit FAS located in the specialized nuclei in the brain stem that control feeding behavior causing levels of AMPK to fall, the expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) to decline and food intake to be restricted, leading to weight loss; 2) FAS2089B stimulates the activity of CPT-1 in peripheral tissues, especially adipose tissue, leading to an increased rate of FAO and the selective reduction in body fat; 3) FAS3169 and 3115 at by both mechanisms 1 and 2. We have recently found that C75 inhibits mitochondrial glycerol-3-acyltransferase (GPAT) which may lead to decreased fat storage and increased FAO as well. As a result of the work detailed in the progress report, 5 lead-candidates have been selected for final evaluation with a view toward identifying and formulating an experimental drug to be tested in Phase l-ll clinical trials supported by Phase II SBIR-AT funding. FASgen believes that it has demonstrated the feasibility of its approach to a small molecule based pharmacotherapy for obesity and thereby, satisfied the performance milestones set in Phase I of its SBIR-AT research grant. This SBIR Phase II proposal is designed to identify a developmental lead compound from amongst the five best candidates available at the initiation of the SBIR Phase II funding period, to collect the data required to file an IND and to initiate Phase l-ll safety and efficacy trials in humans. Amongst the final candidates will be at least one from each mechanistic category: e g CMS active (feeding suppressant), FAO stimulants and molecules with both activities. However, one should bear in mind that therapeutics based on each of the mechanisms may have a worthy use for the prescribing physician. For instance a dual acting compound may be the therapeutic of choice to treat a severely obese individual. Whereas a CMS active appetite suppressant may be the therapeutic of choice to maintain a more healthy weight once an individual has lost significant amounts of adipose tissue.",

This project will develop a distributed lighting system that can run eight points of light from one high efficiency metal halide lamp and ballast.  The improved system will use 80% less energy, have instant light capability, and be cost competitive with halogen systems by splitting the cost of lamp and ballast over eight points.

The lamp parameters tested included electrode design, fill-gas type, and fill-gas pressure.  The ballast parameters included starting pulse voltage, pulse width, pulse repetition, and minimum warm up drive current.  Feasibility was demonstrated in operable samples that warmed up to 20% of final light output in as little as one second.   In Phase II, final lamp parameters will be determined through structured engineering tests on lamp body size, wall thickness, and inner wall shape.  The gas and electrodes will be optimized for manufacturability, and the ballast concept will be developed into a manufacturable design.

Major improvements in these methods have been made in recent years, largely as a result of a marked increase in our understanding of how these enzymes and accessory proteins function. There is, however, an untapped potential in the use of genetically modified DNA polymerases, reverse transcriptases, ligases, restriction enzymes and DNA binding proteins, which may provide significant advantages over their natural counterparts used today. The goal of the proposed project is to develop such modified enzymes and proteins that would have an immediate impact on improving efficiency and accuracy of DNA amplification applications. The work will focus primarily on the optimization of hybrid DNA polymerases, which are by far the leading enzymes in the research reagent and DNA diagnostics markets. A distinguishing feature of the strategy we are pursuing is the incorporation into target enzymes of protein domains that are not naturally associated with their targets, instead of simple domain swapping of homologous proteins or random mutagenesis. Fidelity Systems has successfully pursued this strategy by recognizing the role of helixhairpin- helix (HhH) protein domains in sequence non-specific interactions with DNA. Under Phase I, a number of expression vectors were constructed that permitted the fusing of multiple HhH domains of the unique DNA topoisomerase V (isolated from Methanopyrus kandleri) with different DNA polymerases. Critical functional features (processivity, inhibitor resistance, specificity, thermostability) of the expressed chimeras have already been validated in DNA sequencing and PCR. Under Phase II funding, we propose to implement our hybrid strategy more broadly, characterize and prioritize not only the thermophilic DNA processing enzymes but important mesophilic targets as well, and prove the universal applicability of our strategy. The crystal structure of Topo V with HhH domains that has been solved in Phase I provides a rock solid platform for further optimization of chimeras' feature-rich phenotypes for specific DNA applications. The proposed Phase II work will complement and enhance the value of internally funded discovery and characterization of new proteins at Fidelity Systems, and will help promote the transfer of our technology to non-DNA processing enzymes.",

Genetic dissection of complex disease and variations of drug response has become one of the most important genetic research topics in recent years. Although genome-wide association studies are thought to hold the promise to identify susceptibility genes responsible to complex diseases, methodologies to take full advantage of the genotyping data are still lacking. Standard approaches typically only consider a limited number of hypotheses, most of which are on the effect of a single locus or a relative few loci, therefore do not accommodate the full range of genetic mechanisms that may contribute to the disease phenotype and variations of drug response. First Genetic Trust Inc. (FGT) has developed an innovative pattern discovery-based method to identify multi-locus genetic associations (enGENIOUS). Upon successful demonstration of the utilities and power of enGENIOUS in a SBIR phase I grant awarded by NCI in 2003, FGT intends to use this SBIR phase II proposal to further develop its proprietary genetic analysis methodology as well as to develop a software platform to commercialize the novel methodology along with others as a general tool box. In phase II of the project, FGT will extend enGENIOUS on a genome-wide scale, and will demonstrate the utility of combining enGENIOUS and selected conventional methodologies in whole genome association analysis by using whole-genome datasets from a FGT collaborator. Additionally, FGT will develop a comprehensive software package including an object data model for the representation of concepts (like data, analyses, results, etc.) in genetic analysis, an extensible Java software development toolkit for genetics (enGENUITYsdk) that implement the object model, an object-relational database for storing phenotypic and genotypic data, and a genetic analysis workbench (enGENUITY Workbench) that is either tightly integrated with FGT's enTRUST Genetic Banking System or as a stand-alone application. The proposed software package will significantly enhance the competitive advantage of FGT, result in the generation of an important new source of revenue, and significantly contribute to the discovery of susceptibility genes in complex diseases and variation of drug response.",

The critical need to test large numbers of people for exposure to a biothreat agent may overwhelm the capacity of the clinical and public health infrastructure. The approximately 25,000 sentinel laboratories in the Laboratory Response Network, which coordinates preparedness and response, need diagnostic tools to enable accurate decentralized testing. The goal of the proposed project is to develop a surge-testing platform for this network. The 2001 anthrax attacks showed that administering aggressive therapy to victims who have early diagnostic evidence of blood infections saves lives. Specifically, we will address the need for identifying patients that require aggressive life-saving therapy by developing a blood test for B. anthracis infection that tests for multiple-toxin and cellular antigens using the MultiPath(tm) testing system which we demonstrated in Phase I. The MultiPath system is an ideal surge-testing platform, being ultra-sensitive, quantitative, accurate, cost-effective, user-friendly, portable, and automated. The test rapidly detects multiple targets with sensitivities approaching nucleic acid amplification tests but with the cost-effectiveness and user-friendliness of over-the-counter immunoassay \"strip\" tests. In Phase I we showed that the MultiPath test detects protein, bacterial, and viral targets at levels up to thousands of times lower than commercial strip tests. This sensitivity comes from using a proprietary imaging approach which detects individual microparticles rather than the millions of particles required to detect a signal in standard strip tests. The system will comprise kits that acquire and automatically test blood samples rapidly (target assay time = 5 min) for sub-picogram levels of multiple B. anthracis antigens (to minimize false positives); an identification system to link patients to the test results; and a portable standalone near-patient test analyzer that will automatically process batch-loaded samples (",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Existing detectors used by the pharmaceutical industry to conduct High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) measurement during drug discovery and development exhibit a number of limitations. This project will focus on developing a next-generation detector, a Condensation Nucleation Light Scattering Detector (CNLSD), to overcome these limitations. In addition to its uses in the pharmaceutical industry, CNLSD technology will advance the pace of innovation in multiple industrial, government and academic settings by substantially reducing the cost of extremely high-performance chemical composition measurement.  UV detectors are the HPLC detector of choice in the pharmaceutical industry today because they are inexpensive, have excellent low-level detection and a linear response. However, on the frequent occasions when chromophores are missing from the compound of interest, alternative HPLC detectors must be used. These detectors are primarily Evaporative Light Scattering Detectors (ELSD) or Mass Spectrometry (MS). ELSD technology is limited however, having inadequate sensitivity, poor linearity and poor universality when compared with UV detectors. MS does not exhibit these limitations, but is expensive and difficult to use. CNLSD will be the much-needed, low cost yet high performance, improved HPLC detector, providing lower detection levels, better linearity and better universality than existing detectors at a relatively low cost. A prototype CNLSD, developed and evaluated with SBIR funding in Phase 1, showed excellent test results for metal ions, biogenic amines, carbohydrates, and lipids, including good low level detection and linearity over several orders of magnitude. These results were presented to analytical chemists in site visits to three major pharmaceutical companies. All were excited by the promise shown by this new technology and, dependent upon successful Phase 2 commercialization, all three companies have included CNLSD in their 2005/2006 capital equipment budgets.  Under Phase 2 funding, a second prototype CNLSD will be built. The Phase 2 prototype will incorporate an innovative, water-based CPC (WCPC), only recently made commercially available. Theoretical research shows that the WCPC should improve the sensitivity of CNLSD beyond that of the Phase 1 prototype built using an alcohol-based CPC. In Phase 2, using Phase 1 test protocols, the improved CNLSD will be evaluated to ensure that the use of the WCPC has improved the sensitivity as predicted. After evaluation, the Phase 2 prototype will be further refined and Phase 2 funding will be used to build five beta CNLSD units rugged enough to be evaluated in situ by partners in the pharmaceutical industry. Finally, in Phase 3, a commercially viable, rugged CNLSD will be manufactured for sale.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Iron overload syndromes (attributable to transfusions / dietary uptake) are a significant cause of the morbidity and mortality associated with hemochromatosis, thalasemia, and sickle cell anemia. In the developed world, 2/3 of absorbed iron is derived from heme (organic iron) rather than inorganic iron. While the mechanism by which inorganic iron is absorbed is partially understood, the mechanism by which heme iron is absorbed is not understood. Present treatments for iron overload syndromes include phlebotomy (in non-anemic cases) and subcutaneous continuous infusions of deferoxamine. The latter treatment would be rendered more effective or unnecessary if intestinal iron absorption could be halted. We have developed, in a Phase I SBIR study, an inhibitor of heme-iron uptake that is effective in tissue culture cells and in the rat duodenal loop model. These models provide a good approximation of the human physiology. The inhibitor is a soluble metalloporphyrin (Cr-TMP) that inhibits the uptake of iron from heme at about 4 mu/M in tissue cultured cells and appears non-toxic to tissue culture cells. It is active in vivo at less than 200 nanomole/kg and is poorly absorbed by the intestinal mucosa. In Phase II, (A) we will develop a synthesis capable of producing large amounts of the compound, institute quality control and GMP protocols, and stabilize and appropriately formulate the drug for delivery. (B) We will further assess toxicity in tissue culture cells. (C) We will discover the optimal concentration required to inhibit the uptake of heme iron in the rat duodenum, explore the effects of food and other potential interactions on the drug's action, and conduct long-term toxicity studies in rats. (D) SRI will assess genetic and other toxicity. (E) We will explore the drug's mechanism of action. (F) We will induce iron deficiency anemia in dogs by use of the inhibitor. These studies should provide a basis for a partnership with biotechnology companies for a Phase III pursuit of an IND and appropriate studies in humans. A business plan to accomplish these goals appears in the Phase II application.",

Non-specialists need improved software tools in order to apply these advanced optics computer programs to a growing range of accelerator applications.  This project addresses the challenge by creating an Open Architecture Software Integration System that will allow both specialists and non-specialists to create easy-to-use graphic interfaces for any optics program.

Previously, a novel mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) L2G7 was generated that inhibits the ability of HGF to bind to its receptor Met, to induce proliferation of normal and cancer cells, and to induce angiogenesis. Moreover, L2G7 almost completes inhibits growth of two glioma tumor cell lines in mouse xenograft models. The current goal is to develop a humanized form of L2G7, while conducting additional in vivo studies of the mAb in mouse models to justify clinical trials and to identify the most promising types of cancer to treat.   The first specific aim is to investigate the effect of treatment with mAb L2G7 on the in vivo growth of a variety of human tumor cells, including breast and colon, by using established mouse xenograft models. Tumor cells that both secrete HGF and express Met (HGF+/Met+), which therefore utilize HGF in an autocrine manner, will be tested directly. Tumor cells that do not secrete HGF (HGF-/Met+), which are stimulated by HGF in a paracrine manner, will be tested by co-injecting them into mice with human MRC5 fibroblast cells to serve as a surrogate for stromal cells and provide a source of human HGF. The second aim is to more thoroughly investigate the effect of L2G7 treatment on gliomas, a deadly type of brain tumor that usually expresses both HGF and Met. In addition to determining the effect of L2G7 on a larger number of glioma cell lines in standard xenograft models, the ability of L2G7 to inhibit growth of glioma tumor cells that are inoculated directly into the brains of mice will be tested. This is necessary to verify that L2G7 can pass through the leaky blood-brain barrier in brain tumors, as has been suggested by previous studies with other mAbs. The third aim is to investigate the mechanism of anti-tumor action of L2G7, in particular its ability to induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) of tumor cells and to inhibit angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation) in tumors, by analyzing tumor specimens from mice that have been treated with L2G7. The fourth aim, which will be carried out concurrently with the other aims, is to develop a humanized form of L2G7 by using established methods of molecular modeling and genetic engineering. The humanized L2G7 mAb is expected to be essentially non-immunogenic in human patients and thus suitable for repeat dosing.   Relevance. Despite recent scientific advances, cancer remains a major medical problem, and brain tumors are a particularly deadly form of cancer. The objective of the planned program is to research and develop a humanized monoclonal antibody suitable for testing in human patients, which will have the potential to be an effective drug for the treatment of brain tumors and possibly other types of cancer.",

These properties are generally predictable in the earlier, cheaper stages of drug discovery. The goal of this work is to predict metabolism and toxicity using a computational suite called MetaDrug. This integrates human endogenous and xenobiotic metabolic as well as signalling pathways and can also incorporate gene expression, and experimental data. Under phase I, novel algorithms for predicting major CYP-mediated pathways were generated and successfully validated along with rules for predicting metabolites and reactive metabolites formed which are likely to be toxic. This algorithm development enabled the prediction of substrates and metabolites, the affinity and the rate of metabolism as well as interactions with other endogenous, metabolic and signalling pathways. With phase II funding we will develop large comprehensive datasets (>1000 molecules) for in vitro drug-drug interactions with the major CYPs, and use these for generating machine learning algorithms for these human drug metabolizing enzymes. We will also annotate rat and mouse data for drug metabolism and the transcriptional regulation of these enzymes, capturing the kinetic data which can also be used for predictive model building. We will also generate a novel algorithm for the accurate prediction of metabolites using the metabolite rules from phase I to produce a molecular fingerprint for known drugs. The database of molecules with known human metabolites will then be used as an input for a machine learning algorithm. We will combine the predictions from our various QSAR models for enzyme affinity and rate of metabolism, the relative contributions of these enzymes and their tissue distribution, to ultimately predict the clearance of a drug. The proposed work will enable GeneGo to develop a unique tool that will improve the prediction of metabolism and toxicity.

When delivered to the eye via an adenovirus vector, PEDF can block growth of new blood vessels and trigger the regression of established abnormal vessels in animal models for AMD and diabetic retinopathy. GenVec has recently demonstrated safety of an adenovector that expresses PEDF (AdPEDF. 11) in patients with AMD. However, two important risks to the commercialization of AdPEDF. 11 are transient PEDF expression that may require repeat administration and the potential for vector-induced inflammation at high doses, both of which have been observed in animal models. In this Phase II SBIR we propose to address these risks using high capacity (HC) adenovectors based on adenovirus type 5.    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II proposal aims take the next steps toward clinical testing of HC vectors. Building on successes in the Phase I effort the proposed research will provide breakthroughs needed to advance this promising vector system. The Specific Aims are: 1) To determine the full duration of increased PEDF expression in the eye following intravitreous delivery of HC.PEDF; 2) To test the hypothesis that long-term PEDF expression results in long-term ocular efficacy; 3) To build a system for the production of high quality HC vectors that is scalable, and applicable for GMP manufacturing. The results of these studies will provide critical elements of an IND submission.    This SBIR proposal will allow direct application of HC technology to a rapidly advancing therapeutic product program. The long-term goal of this proposal is the clinical testing and commercialization of PEDF expressing HC vector for the treatment of AMD and other ocular neovascular diseases.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project deals with the problems of reconstructing complex free-form shapes from measured data.  Raindrop Magic's primary interest is to produce well-structured, high-quality CAD models.  Several techniques exist to reach this goal; unfortunately, automatic surfacing systems provide only rough approximations and do not capture the original design intent, while manual segmentation methods are not very stable and require tedious work.  Using functional decomposition, objects are built up as a collection of large, independent primary surfaces being connected by smaller, dependent feature surfaces, such as fillets or swept surfaces.  In Phase I, semi-automatic methods were elaborated to create good segmenting curve nets.  Exploiting the specific properties of different feature types, the research team proposed algorithms to compute optimal surface representations for each.  In Phase II, the team envisions transforming and extending their theoretical results into robust and efficient computational algorithms.  Five subsystems are proposed:  Surface-Indicators, Constrained-Fitting, Curve-Tracing, Fairing, and Feature-Fitting.  New core technologies are developed for creating different geometric entities, which are eventually integrated to obtain high-quality surface models.  This technology should significantly shorten lead-time in related industrial design and manufacturing processes and produce aesthetic objects, having a positive impact on the whole society.  The proffered technology has broader impacts in two key market sectors:  reverse engineering and advanced surfacing.  At the research front, the proposed project deepens the understanding of computer-aided geometric modeling working with scan data, a field that has not received much attention from the large CAD companies, but is an active area of research.  It combines the knowledge of both discrete and continuous mathematics and takes advantage of the strength of both approaches. On the technology front, it introduces a new paradigm that will significantly improve the current commercial systems of reverse engineering with better engineering features and advanced surfacing through simpler operations.  The main applications will be product design, including automotive, aerospace, consumer products, and medical devices.  The improved product will help the US manufacturing industry to be more competitive in the world market, providing a way to introduce design on demand and engineering on demand services.  The proposed project will help US companies to increase customer-focused production and reduce the time between product iterations.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will investigate applications of Combinatorial Morse Theory in Reverse Engineering, a field that focuses on converting physical objects into a digital representation suitable for CAD, CAM, and CAE. The biggest challenge in this field is to automate the conversion process while producing a model that meets all the requirements of downstream applications.  These requirements include both an accurate representation of features and a high degree of smoothness. Combinatorial Morse Theory relies on a single mathematical approach: the definition of a continuous function on a polygonal model and the decomposition of the surface based on the gradient flow of that function. One advantage of this over earlier approaches to the conversion problem is its flexibility obtained by adapting to and combining different analysis criteria. Morse theory is the key to computing patch layouts that naturally adapt to and follow the shape of the surface, a property that is difficult to achieve but necessary to automatically construct high-quality NURBS surfaces of scanned or triangulated CAD models.  The proposed algorithms will allow users to easily create accurate representations of scanned physical parts, thereby providing an efficient closed-loop between physical and digital at any phase of a product life cycle. This project will make strong research contributions in computer science and mechanical engineering by dealing with the practical applications of Morse Theory, automatic feature detection and patch layout. It will also make strong advances in the amount of information that can be extracted from a polygonal model. Commercial applications include design and analysis of complex shapes such as turbine blades, transmission housings, and engine blocks, creating digital inventory of legacy parts, historical preservation, mass customization and biometric shape reconstruction. These applications will allow manufacturing companies to be more competitive globally because it enables product differentiations and existing processes to be carried out efficiently, cost-effectively, and automatically.  The societal impact of this technology includes the improvement of work environments due to reduction of dust, noise, and work-related injuries associated with traditional processes, prevention of loss of lives and equipment by enabling sampling based inspections as well as improvement of the quality life through customized medical devices, and apparel that conform perfectly to the wearer.",

However, commercially available water electrolysis technologies are capital-cost intensive, leading to a high hydrogen costs.  This project will develop a Solid Membrane Alkaline Electrolyzer system, based on a unique solid alkaline membrane, which is expected to provide high-current-density, high-differential-pressure electrolyzer operation.  Phase I demonstrated the concept of the solid alkaline membrane electrolyzer.  Cells were operated at high current density and differential pressure, producing hydrogen at greater than 85% voltage efficiency.  A preliminary system design was generated.  Phase II will identify corrosion resistant components, scale-up both the active area and the number of cells, and fabricate a full-size stack.  A complete system design will be prepared, and an economic analysis will be conducted.  The program will culminate in the operation of the full-size stack from a solar power source.

The compounds, 7-substituted-N2-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)guanines \"DCBGs\", are potent enzyme inhibitors, and selected derivatives have potent and broad activity against clinically relevant Gram+ bacteria. We have identified the first active site directed inhibitors of the related DNA polymerase HIE from Gram- bacteria, i.e. E. coli. In addition, we have established a collaboration to crystallize and solve the structure of a complex between E. fecalis pol IIIE, DNA and one of our inhibitors.    Based on the results of phase I, we will pursue designation of a lead antibiotic compound by in vivo testing in systemic and toplical bacterial infection models. We will use both QSAR analysis and structure-based drug design to discover new platform inhibitors of the pol HIE target. The following specific aims will be pursued:    1. scale-up synthesis of lead compound candidates and formulations for evaluation in animal models of bacterial infection; synthesis of 7-substituted analogs with enhanced pol HIE inhibitory and antibacterial activity in vitro.    2. solve the structure of E. fecalis pol IIIE:DNA:inhibitor complexes, and use the coordinates for understanding the basis of inhibition of the enzyme and for further rational, computer-based drug design (collaboration with Dr. Mark Jedrzejas, Children's Hospital of Oakland Research Institute).    3. continue assays of compounds for enzyme inhibition (pol IIIC, pol HIE), antibacterial activity, selectivity, cytotoxicity; incidence of resistance and mechanism(s) of resistance, by cloning and sequencing of targets (by subcontract to Microbiotix Inc.); test candidate drugs against clinical isolates of Gram+ and Gram- bacteria, bactericidal assays, combination studies with marketed antibiotics (by subcontract to UMass Medical School).    4. develop analytical methods for analysis of candidates in animal plasma, drug uptake and distribution by various routes in mice, acute toxicity, in vitro metabolism and stability studies.    5. evaluate candidate drugs for activity in animal models of Gram+ and Gram- infections (if warranted), emphasizing systemic antibiotic-resistant S. aureus, E. fecalis and S. pneumoniae in mice and topical S. aureus infections in guinea pigs..     Potent inhibition of Gram+ pol HIE and pol IIIC may lead to antibiotics with reduced incidence of resistance.",

However, as actual yields vary widely for individual proteins, GlycoFi is focusing on the improvement of protein yields in P. pastoris as part of the company's long term mission to develop yeast-based protein production technology for manufacturing therapeutic proteins with human glycosylation structures. In Phase I of this project a strategy was developed and tested using the model protein alpha 1-antitrypsin for overcoming bottlenecks in yeast secretion that result in less than optimal yields. A combinatorial library/high throughput screening methodology was designed to optimize translocation of the nascent peptide into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and protein folding within the ER.  In Phase II, yield optimization studies will include IgG as well as alpha 1-antitrypsin with specific experiments targeting expression and secretion of the IgG H and L chains. The toolkit created in Phase I will be expanded through the implementation of several new high throughput approaches toward yield improvement including mutagenesis and cDNA library screening and deletion of protease genes as well as traditional fermentation and purification process development. Proposed Commercial Application:  GlycoFi's Humanized Yeast(tm) enables the study of glycosylation structure-function relationships and creates the ability not only to pinpoint the specific glycoforms that optimize the bioactivity, pharmacokinetics and overall efficacy of a therapeutic protein, but also to manufacture them at low cost with a high degree of uniformity.

The commercial application of this technology is in cancer chemotherapy. Increased solubility and bioavailability should reduce the quantity and side effects of the expensive drugs that are currently used.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite many applicable developments in the field of ergonomically improved manual drive wheelchairs, the standard fixed pushrim remains the most prevalent method of propulsion. These ubiquitous fixed pushrim drives, while inexpensive and intuitively simple to operate, contribute to several common repetitive motion injuries. Among manual wheelchair users surveyed, prevalence of shoulder pain is seen to be between 31% and 73%, and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) to be between 49% and 73%. The prevalence of these injuries is associated with the large wrist flexion under load, the downward pressure on the pushrim, the muscle imbalance from the uni-directional stresses of continuous push motions applied to the pushrim, and the large number of repetitions of the the push motion. When pain reaches a certain level of discomfort, the wheelchair dependent individual generally starts using a powered chair, thus losing a valuable cardiovascular exercise.   Responding to the needs of this large user population, 1.5 million in the US alone, it is our long term objective to provide a wheelchair propulsion system utilizing a pushrim of improved kinematics. The improved kinematic design will allow up to a 50% reduction of push strokes for a given distance traveled. Additionally, it will allow the user the option of achieving and retaining a preferred handgrip on the pushrim, while retaining traditional pushrim operation for fine control. The concept has the potential to allow embodiment as fully self-contained wheel assemblies that would be field retrofittable to a large number of existing wheelchairs.

Reducing the cost of solar silicon wafers is the key to lowering the price of crystalline silicon solar cells.  This project will develop a single-step wafer fabrication process in which metallurgical grade silicon (MGSi) is purified by dissolving it in a tin (Sn) melt.  The solar silicon wafers then can be drawn directly from the Sn-dissolved MGSi melt by edge-defined film growth (EFG) or ribbon growth methods.  In Phase I, test runs were carried out with a broad range of tin concentrations.  A significant amount of impurity reduction was observed when compared to the starting MGSi.  It was also observed that the amount of tin incorporated into the growing wafer decreased along with the reduction in the solvent (tin) concentration, while the impurity reduction level remained more or less the same.  Phase II will optimize the solution composition and processing conditions, construct a prototype system for solar wafer fabrication, characterize of the produced silicon materials, and evaluate of the photovoltaic properties of the fabricated wafers.

Human albumin is isolated from donated human plasma, but shifts in the plasma fractionation industry, concerns about cost and anxiety about blood safety have motivated efforts to produce recombinant human albumin as an alternative source for human therapeutic applications. GTC Biotherapeutics Inc. (GTC-Bio) has expressed rhA in transgenic cows at levels of 2 g/L, which is adequate for the pharmaceutical excipient market but not the 400,000 kg annual worldwide therapeutic market. We have developed a strategy for selectively boosting rhA production to 10 g/L, a level that would make this production platform commercially feasible for the therapeutic human albumin market. Preliminary work suggests that hypermethylation of CpG motifs in the coding sequence may limit rhA expression in transgenic animals, and that removing CpG sites without altering the albumin amino acid sequence may significantly increase rhA expression. In this Fast-Track Phase I project, we propose to establish proof of principle for high-level production of rhA by: 1) remodeling the rhA gene to remove CpG sites; 2) evaluating the remodeled construct in transgenic mice, our standard test system; 3) optimizing a novel high-throughput screening method that will substantially reduce the effort and cost of recovering transgenic cell lines for use in generating transgenic animals by somatic cell nuclear transfer; and 4) optimizing an alternative selection scheme to preferentially recover transfected cell lines with high transgene copy numbers. Successful completion of this project will lead to a Fast-Track Phase II project to produce and characterize transgenic calves producing high levels of rhA in their milk. If this program is successful, it will be the first production of rhA at a commercial scale that is cost-effective for therapeutic applications.",

The asymmetry was created using GVD's unique initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) technology. In Phase II, GVD will demonstrate large area production at a competitive cost by designing, building, and operating an iCVD roll-to-roll coater, the first of its kind in the world.  The improved economics of roll-to-roll manufacturing will permit entry of a new family of PTFE membranes into a variety of markets where improvements in product quality and efficacy can be enabled by advanced filtration. These membranes can also address the separations needs of emerging industries such as nanotechnology, where unit operations at the nanometer scale still remain a challenge. More broadly, iCVD technology can produce composite membranes which marry the beneficial surface properties of PTFE with the improved mechanical strength and performance of a less costly base membrane.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The miniaturization of neuroprosthetic technology has led to an urgent need for thin (10 mu m or less) insulating coatings that retain their biocompatibility and stability over long periods. Initiated Chemical Vapor Deposition (iCVD) is an alternative to applying polymers using solvent-based techniques or a powder spraying methods. Under the Phase I funding, an iterative process was used to identify a window of iCVD processing conditions that successfully provided electrical insulation to 25 mu m diameter gold lead wires. The coating was tested after physical stressing and exposure to a simulated biological environment and the integrity, adhesion, and insulating abilities of GVD's PTFE coating were proven in short-term testing. A key study in the Phase I project was the comparison between GVD's PTFE coated wires and other leading commercial coatings including Parylene-C, silicone, and commercially available Teflon(r) coatings. Our study showed that GVD's PTFE coating out-performed all other coatings by providing enhanced electrical insulation while reducing the overall wire diameter. The goal of the Phase II project is to expand the use of thin iCVD PTFE coatings for insulating and protecting neural probe assemblies. This will be accomplished by designing equipment capable of coating sufficient numbers of prototypes for testing, optimizing the process for coating 3D substrates, further research into adhesion promotion strategies for the substrates of interest and long term testing of the coating's biocompatibility. The new equipment will allow us to coat wires of different materials and several types of neural prosthetic prototypes for evaluation and long-term testing. The ultimate goal is to achieve single step encapsulation of three-dimensional neural probe arrays and of neural prosthetic assemblies. At the end of this Phase II work, GVD will be able to offer to researchers and manufacturers a proven, effective solution to the problems of insulation and encapsulation of neuroprosthetic devices. This will enable greater flexibility in the design of these devices, the choice of materials used, and the minimum dimensions which can be achieved. The therapeutic benefit will be to de-bottleneck the development of these devices and accelerate their proliferation as treatments for neurological disorders.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mechanisms that govern blood coagulation and fibrinolysis have been studied extensively by employing a variety of experimental techniques and in-vivo model systems. Recently gene targeting (knockout mice) and transgenic techniques have been employed to create strains of mice whose phenotypes represent human thrombotic disorders and disease states. In conjunction with this, murine coagulation models are routinely used in the process of new drug development. During the course of developing new pro-coagulant, anti-coagulant and clot dissolving drugs, basic R&D studies as well as safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic studies are required. Because both normal and genetically altered mice are available, the murine models are ideal for this application. Based on the fact that murine models are in prevalent use and there exist a limited number of reagents available to assist the researcher, it is imperative to develop a commercial group of reagents for use in this field of study. This project was designed to enhance the utility of mouse coagulation models by generating a battery of reagents and analytical tools comparable to what is available for application to the human system. The long-term objective is the production of a marketable line of murine derived reagents that include: a) purified murine coagulation factors for plasma reconstitution experiments and assay standardization; b) antibodies to murine coagulation factors for Western blot, immunohistochemistry, immunoprecipitation, flow cytometry and ELISA applications; and, c) ELISA assays for the zymogens, enzymes, cofactors, inhibitors, activation peptides and enzyme/inhibitor complexes of coagulation. During phase I support we purified and characterized a group of nine mouse plasma proteins including the enzymatic forms of both prothrombin and factor X. A total of seven new polyclonal antibodies to murine antigens were generated. We also demonstrated the feasibility of two competitive based ELISA's to ultimately measure murine plasma concentrations of both factor X and plasminogen. These reagents are currently being marketed by HTI and are available for purchase. We are attempting to secure phase II funding to further the advances made in phase I by adding to our growing list of available murine products. We plan to purify additional hemostatic proteins, generate additional polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, and identify and develop clinically important immunoassays with these reagents.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Factor VIIa and tissue factor (TF) are essential proteins for the initiation of blood coagulation. Blood coagulation is initiated when cryptic TF becomes exposed on the surface of vascular cells where it can bind circulating factor VIla. The factor Vlla/TF complex catalyzes the activation of certain blood zymogens that propagate the coagulation event. The amount of circulating factor VIla has been shown to be a good indicator of hemostatic potential, and for this reason is a potential risk factor indicator for the development of cardiovascular disease. In addition, over the past decade recombinant factor VIla has become the drug of choice for treating hemophilia A and B patients who have developed inhibitors to factors VIII and IX respectively. Formation of the factor Vlla/TF complex is also the basis of specific coagulation assays. The prothrombin time (PT assay) utilizes either natural or synthetic thromboplastin reagents to initiate coagulation in-vitro. Thus in addition to its in-vivo role, TF also has in-vitro applications. Furthermore, TF is not only present in the vasculature, but also in numerous other tissues and cells including brain, lung, placenta, monocytes and tumor cells. In addition to its \"normal\" role in hemostasis, it is also known to be involved in the metastasis of tumor cells. The fact that factor VIla and TF play such important roles both in vivo and in vitro, indicates that rapid and direct assays for these proteins could be of great utility. At the present time, reliable assays for factor VIla and TF that can be applied to simple and well as complex biological samples do not exist. During the Phase-l project period we demonstrated the feasibility of developing sensitive fluorogenic assays that can directly measure functional factor VIla and TF in simple and complex biological systems. Phase-ll funding will be used to support the further development, refinement, optimization, validation and field-testing of these assays. It is anticipated that by the end of the Phase-ll project period these assays will be ready to market for research and pre-clinical applications.",

These klystrons generally require pulsed vacuum tube drivers to supply input power levels up to several hundred watts.  However, for applications in which a 20 dB klystron gain would be sufficient, these relatively complex vacuum-tube driver systems could be replaced by small, low power, solid state sources, resulting in considerable simplification and cost savings.  This project will develop technology leading to stable, high gain (>70 dB), high efficiency (>50 percent) klystron performance.  During Phase I, phase orbit characteristics were analyzed and microwave parameters were established for an asynchronously operated, tapered phase velocity, traveling wave output structure designed for a 17 gigahertz relativistic klystron.  To prevent parasitic oscillations, special suppression circuits were designed and configured for contiguous assembly with the high-gain-klystron, dual-feed-racetrack, output coupler.  Phase II will be directed at engineering and fabricating the traveling wave tapered phase velocity, high gain dual feed output structure, parasitic oscillation suppression circuits, and the associated evacuated rectangular waveguide components.  In addition, the new high-gain-klystron and waveguide components will be assembled; and the system will be tested to evaluate the stability, efficiency and gain of the high power 17 gigahertz klystron.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The availability of stable, high gain klystron amplifiers should enable existing complex driver systems and associated pulsed helix and filament power supplies to be replaced by low power, simple solid state amplifiers.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project is aimed at building the first prototype of an automated ballast water exchange (BWE) monitoring and reporting system. The system will use acoustic modems that use ultrasonic acoustic energy through metal structures as the means of communication. Wireless networking based on radio frequencies (RF) is not very effective within enclosed metal structures such as the hulls of ships. The acoustic modems can be used to overcome such limitations and can establish a local wireless network for data transfer among sensors located in various parts of the vessels. The through-the-hull communications technology is at a nascent but proven state. Existing modems transfer data at 20 bits per second. The Phase-I research showed that a data rate of 500 bits per second (or higher) would exceed the data throughput requirement for BWE monitoring.  Ballast water management is a global issue. The foreign micro-organisms not only destroy the bio-diversity in the native coastal eco systems but create problems for regional economies as well. The impact from the introduction of  Zebra mussels in great lakes is estimated at over four billion dollars. Therefore developing an effective and inexpensive technology for monitoring the ballast water has a broader impact on the society. It has the potential to save economies that depend on coastal resources and ensure the preservation of the local eco-systems for future generations without placing excessive restrictions on international maritime trade.",

The health and safety of individuals and their ability to communicate in high noise environments is increased with Insert Passive Noise Reduction communication devices that reduce high ambient noise while delivering the desired sound. The hearing-in-noise devices are based on in-the-ear miniature speaker systems that send desired sound through a lumen in a passive noise reducing viscoelastic foam tip that resides in the ear canal providing insertion gain. The result is a significant increase in signal-to-noise ratio.

The approach would build on our manufacturing process expertise for the high volume production of foam Comply(tm) Snap Tips.  Phase I has shown the feasibility of achieving a greater than 3 dB improvement in attenuation, thus more than doubling the effectiveness of the best available commercial sound attenuation earpiece, i.e., viscoelastic polyurethane foam, in a convincing and reproducible manner.

Despite significant societal need and market demand, US hospitals remain islands of mutually inaccessible data even as patients move between them. Even the most vulnerable patients remain burdened with carrying their own data from place to place. Radiologist interpretations are impaired without the benefit of historical images for side-by-side comparisons. Other physicians are faced with incomplete information to guide clinical decisions. The problem is only magnified for cancer patients who frequently seek care among multiple providers, inadvertently scattering their records across sites. Any one of such a patient's physicians can access only the subset of imaging data available from his/her island, blunting the impact of imaging on screening, diagnosis and management. In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of a novel approach to clinical connectivity - a peer-to-peer network linking commercial imaging information systems from different vendors across three hospitals in a demanding clinical environment. Efforts to exchange data between hospitals over the last two decades have failed primarily due to their reliance on a central shared data repository. In contrast, our peer-to-peer approach satisfies the privacy, security, data stewardship, trust and independence requirements that competing health systems require to exchange digital clinical data with one another. In Phase II, we will launch the first-of-its-kind local healthcare information infrastructure (LHII), enabling five hospitals among three unaffiliated health systems to directly and securely access each other's digital imaging data. We will focus on the application of this technology to cancer screening, diagnosis and management in particular, and we will develop the additional components required to launch the first such non-proprietary clinical information service built on the basis of open standards.

The UHRSM will be optimized for imaging of the magnetic fields produced by action currents, injury and developmental currents, remnant magnetization, and magnetic susceptibility in isolated living tissue and small experimental animal preparations. As a collaborative effort between HYPRES and several research institutions, including Living State Physics of Vanderbilt University, analog SQUID magnetometers are being developed for imaging applications. In order to utilize SQUIDs for these applications, their voltages are amplified by a step-up transformer so it could be instrumented with room temperature electronics. The use of a step-up transformer requires extensive peripheral electronics for linearization, thus limiting the number of SQUID magnetometer channels in a practical system. We are proposing to develop a novel SQUID with APF that eliminates the need for the transformer, and as a result simplifies the peripheral electronics significantly. The proposed APF SQUID integrates an on-chip feedback coil with the SQUID. This can increase the gain of the device substantially, and as a result no step-up transformer is required for read out. The proposed research involves the staged development and implementation of a SQUID design to enhance the spatial resolution and maximize the field sensitivity for specific applications. The existing expertise will be exploited further to develop and improve SQUID sensors for general and custom biomagnetic applications which require higher-sensitivity SQUID magnetometers and gradiometers but lower spatial resolution.

Astronomers are increasing their reliance on digital auto-correlators for receiving sub-millimeter-wavelength signals buried in noise. For larger red-shift sources, bandwidths of tens of GHz are required. Digital spectrometers are also required to manage communications spectrum for wideband wireless software-defined radio systems. These systems under development are based on a radically new wireless-communications paradigm: the analog wireless signal is converted directly to the digital domain at RF frequencies. Wideband superconducting digital-RF hardware will result in extremely robust systems, with revolutionary new opportunities for handling complex waveforms (e.g. the Wideband Networking Waveform).  Astronomers need compact spectrometers to study sources such as planetary atmospheres, molecular clouds, and extragalactic objects. Distant sources have very small signals that are red-shifted by as much as tens of GHz. Therefore, spectrometer bandwidth and sensitivity must be better than present instruments offer. Applying these technology elements to communications enables software-defined all-digital radio systems. Improvements in wireless communications are helping the U.S. to become more productive and socially active. Power efficiency and sensitivity will be orders of magnitude greater than conventional systems, while enabling software functionality and upgrades, at a fraction of the cost.",

        "abstract": "75333S Nanoindentation is the primary technique for assessing the nanomechanical behavior of small volumes of materials.  With this technique, the force required to produce a given displacement into a sample by a sharp diamond tip is measured, and the hardness of the material being tested is determined analyzing the force-displacement curve.  However, the microstructural origins of the measured mechanical response often are not readily understood.  This project will develop a quantitative nanoidentation instrument capable of operating inside a transmission electron microscope.  This capability would enable the real-time correlation between the evolving force-displacement curve and images of the evolving microstructure.  Insights gained from such experiments would substantially improve the ability to engineer the mechanical behavior of materials.  In Phase I, the following three components were developed and assembled into a working quantitative nanoindetation system:  a miniature transducer capable of electrostatic actuation and capacitive displacement sensing, an in situ transmission-electron-microscopy holder equipped with a three-axis piezoelectric positioner and a three-axis course positioner, and a force-feedback controller.  Tests in a transmission electron microscope showed the feasibility of the concept.  Phase II will:  (1) develop a prototype, ready-to-commercialize, quantitative nanoindentation instrument that is compatible with the transmission electron microscope; and (2) conduct applications research having industrial relevance using the quantitative nanoindentation system.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The ability to apply quantitative nanoindentation in transmission electron microscopes should provide a crucial understanding of structure-mechanical property correlations at nanoscale, leading to improvements in surface engineering and thin-film technology, and facilitating the design of useful shape-memory alloys and other smart materials.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop and test the feasibility of a series of online educational modules that provide practical information on home modifications for older adults with sensory, mobility, physical and cognitive impairments. Modifying a home through remodeling, adding adaptive hardware, or changing the arrangement of objects is an important intervention strategy to manage chronic health care conditions, maintain or improve functioning, increase independence, ensure safety of frail older adults who experience functional limitations, and minimize the cost of personal care services. A major reason for the limited implementation of home modifications throughout the U.S. is not a lack of carpenters or construction people to implement the modifications, but rather the lack of individuals in social service agencies, particularly in non-urban areas, who have the knowledge to prescribe the appropriate modifications. Distance learning is an effective way to educate service providers to enable them to prescribe home modifications as part of a comprehensive, multi-dimensional strategy tailored to the specific needs of older adults. In Phase I a course on home modifications to compensate for cognitive impairments, such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias was successfully developed and tested in a self-study and an interactive format. Test of knowledge tests showed some significant learning, and both formats were highly rated by students. In Phase II, we will develop and assess an additional 4 courses: Home modifications for people with sensory loss; home modifications for wheelchair users; home modifications for people with gait and upper body limitations; and home modifications to reduce falls risk. Course evaluation will be expanded to include a 2 month follow-up with students on their use of material learned in the courses. Phase III will include an aggressive marketing plan to make the courses readily available to a broad range of social service agency personnel, contractors, and others engaged in home modifications.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project describes software that combines speech recognition, digital video, and personal computer technologies to allow PC users to have \"face-to-face\" dialogues with video characters that are real people. This software, called Conversim (Registered Trademark), incorporates an independent speaker recognition engine so that any English-speaking user can spontaneously say the words and phrases known to the system and be understood.  All Conversim (RT) programs include a non-directive, intelligent prompting algorithm.  Each time the virtual character responds to the user, the system dynamically selects statements and questions that are specifically relevant to the character's last response and then displays three choices in a rhythmic scroll.  Between questions, the character's active image remains on the monitor as if waiting for the next question.  The Conversim (RT) dialogue model is unique since it enables the user to have a virtual conversation with a real person whose intellect, personality, and personae are intact and available.  This very personal model opens the door to numerous innovative applications in education.  Scientific research has shown that most users enjoy the virtual dialogue experience; many have significant, often accelerated, learning gains; and almost all feel as though they have met the person with whom they have been \"talking.\"  These findings strongly indicate the method merits further research in conventional educational settings.  This model represents a new paradigm in education, one that allows the student to learn through a one-on-one interview of the master teacher.  The paradigm involves non-directive, independent learning by conducting face-to-face dialogues with master teachers in cyberspace, who are always present, always available, and always willing to converse with people who wish to engage them.  Multimedia presentations can be used in concert with the dialogue to clarify concepts and complex topics.  Also, the power of the computer for tracking and innovative, dynamic evaluation strategies are inherent in this model.  The broad objective is to make this model and this new paradigm available in all educational institutions that would benefit from its use.  It has potential to provide a means for students everywhere to gain access to and learn by engaging in dialogue with some of the best minds in the country; to be used to educate a broad range of students, from high school to the post-graduate level; to help students whose education is restricted by geographic location or economics; to enhance learning for all students by making them active participants in the learning process; and to provide high-quality education while significantly reducing per student costs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This proposal aims to increase the information content and decrease the cost of the Illumina random array platform. Random arrays are assembled by attaching DMA probes to silica beads and loading the beads onto an etched substrate. The bead identities are determined through a sequential hybridization based decode process. Once the arrays are decoded, they can be used in applications such as SNP genotyping and gene expression profiling.  The cost of decoding is proportional to the number of sequential hybridizations. The number of probes that can be decoded on the array is a function of the number of hybridizations and the number of distinguishable labels (decode states) used in the process. An increase in the number of probes requires either an increase in the number of stages hybridizations or an increase in the number of states. Prior to the completion of Phase I, arrays containing 1,500 probes were decoded with 8 hybridizations and 3 states. The completion of Phase I has demonstrated the feasibility of 7-state decoding. The increase in states dramatically increases decoding capabilities, allowing the decoding of 24,000 probes in 6 stages. The first goal of Phase II is to implement the 7-state decode system in manufacturing. The next goal is to improve and extend the decode system through the addition of intermediate intensity states and the reduction of process variability. The ability to efficiently decode tens of thousand of probes presents an opportunity to increase the density of the random arrays. Arrays with a range of feature sizes will be manufactured and the optimal density will be determined. The efficient decoding combined with the higher density of features will lead to microarrays with high information content, low cost per data point, and low sample consumption.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anomalies of the genome, such as congenital chromosomal imbalances, can be present from birth or can  arise during cell division and lead to formation of cancer. Progression of cancer can be followed by monitoring changes in the genome. For instance, allelic deletions of tumor suppressor genes and amplifications of oncogenes are well known events in carcinogenesis. The primary goal of this project is to develop a high resolution array-based approach to detecting and monitoring changes in tumor samples. A secondary goal is to detect microdeletions and amplifications in congenital chromosomal disorders. The proposed work will focus on developing DNA copy and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) measurements using our novel whole genome genotyping (WGG) platform. The WGG technology was developed, in part, through phase I funding. Under phase I, we developed a whole genome amplification protocol and an arraybased primer extension assay that enabled direct readout of the genome - both copy number and genotypes. This development obviates the need for the original proposed complexity reduction step (reduced representation). The number of genotypes that can be read out from a single sample is limited only by the number of probes on the array. The proposed work will use a WGG array that is currently under development to perform genotyping and copy number analysis at the same time, at an average resolution of approximately  30 kb across the genome. This revolutionary assay system will allow regions of genomic alteration to be precisely defined accurately and robustly, and has the potential to be used directly in clinical applications. Once fully developed, the assay will be employed to characterize biological tumor/normal sample pairs as well as congenital chromosomal imbalances.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop prototype architecture of an engineering advisory system and validate its application. Although the cost of product design could be only about 5% of the total product cost, decisions made during the design stage can contribute as much as 70-80% to the final product cost. Inappropriate design decisions made without sufficient manufacturing knowledge, or information, increases iterations in the product development lifecycle, causing significant costs to both the original equipment manufactures (OEMs) and the lower tier manufacturers. A survey by Purdue University indicated that 90% of the engineers/designers had very little process knowledge, thus indicating that there is a serious design-manufacturing knowledge gap. The aims and responsibilities of the Phase II project are to bridge the design-manufacturing knowledge gap through the development of an engineering advisory system to be used in early design. The system would be analogous to a spell-checking tool, advising engineers/designers on manufacturability and cost. The system will perform Dynamic Design for Manufacturability (DFM) analysis, evaluate part geometry in order to provide advice on the manufacturing aspects of the part, especially tooling and process related parameters in part design, help in estimating relative manufacturing costs for a part by mapping the geometric and non-geometric parameters of the part to a cost-based manufacturing process model, integrate 3D Shape Search Engine (licensed from Purdue University) with Part/Tooling/Cost Advisor & Knowledge Reuse Agent, seamlessly integrate with commercial Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) system using sophisticated geometric reasoning algorithms and a hybrid B-rep-voxel approach, and extract manufacturing feature-based geometric information.  If successful this product will enable engineers/designers make informed decisions early in product design about processes and part/tooling for manufacturability while serving as an on-demand manufacturing \"what-if\" educational tool for engineers/designers. It will reduce non-value added design features so optimal and economical processes can be considered, thus lowering tooling costs while minimizing the risk in the quotation process for both OEMs and tooling firms. The outcome of this research also have an educational impact in engineering schools by introducing students to manufacturing processes and design for manufacturability concepts. The company will provide the engineering advisory system to universities to use in their engineering curriculum. The outcome of the proposed research can improve product design, lower cost and positively impact the local economy by linking local suppliers in early design directly through an engineering advisory system.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hip fracture is the most serious consequence of osteoporosis. In 2002, the cost of treating hip fractures consumed 63% of the national direct expenditure for OP, or more than $10 billion. By 2050, due to a rapidly aging population, the annual cost of treating hip fractures is projected to increase 6 fold to more than $60 billion. The ability to accurately estimate an individual's risk of osteoporotic hip fracture is key in preventing the expected increase of hip fractures because it would identify those individuals needing the most potent available fracture reduction therapy. Bone Mineral Density (BMD) measurement is currently used for diagnosis of osteoporosis. However, it has only limited utility in predicting hip fracture. This is because Individual fracture risk is also strongly influenced by local bone architecture and structure, bone turnover, cortical thickness, and, fall biomechanics. We recently developed (SBIR Phase 1) non-invasive automated imaging technology using ordinary radiographs that can measure cortical and trabecular parameters that are comparable to those measured by 3D uCT. In general it involves x-ray digitization, identification of regions of interest, trabecular extraction, background subtraction to obtain an image of trabecular structures and binerization plus skeletonization of those structures. Parameters of trabecular structure are measured using algorithms. 2D measurements of trabecular structure in ordinary radiographs of cores of proximal cadaveric femora correlated well with 3D mu/CT measurements. Those 2D measurements also correlated with biomechanical failure loads applied to those cores as well to whole cadaver proximal femora(J Bone Min Res 2003 ;18 Suppl 2, Abst # 1218, J Bone Min Res; 18 Suppl 2 Abst # 107 2003.). Our hypotheses in this proposal are: targeted, focal assessment of bone structure in hip x-ravs yields vastly improved ability to predict osteoporotic fracture as compared with BMD measurements. To assess the validity of this hypothesis, we will determine if the technology developed in Phase I of this project has the ability to discriminate between healthy postmenopausal women and postmenopausal women who have retrospectively experienced osteoporotic fractures. We will also test the short term reproducibility in vivo of our x-ray based measurements of bone microstructure and bone geometry by measuring them twice in those same groups no more than two weeks apart as the root mean square of the individual reproducibility errors.",

In addition, recent pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that ultrasound-mediated cavitation of microbubbles has utility in lysing platelet thrombi (clots).

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project aims to produce a working prototype sensor array monitoring system that detects, identifies, and localizes the infrasound generated by snow avalanches. The goal of the project is to bring to commercial form automated monitoring systems that improve the safety and welfare of those impacted by avalanche activity. Avalanche-generated infrasound signals can propagate miles from their origin, and provide a basis for automated monitoring and warning systems. Previously developed single sensor infrasound monitoring systems can detect and identify avalanche-generated infrasound in an automated near real-time manner, but performance suffers when avalanche signal amplitudes are small and/or during high wind noise periods. By advancing and refining array-based signal processing algorithms, sensor array monitoring can provide spatial information that greatly improves avalanche signal identification in varying signal and noise conditions while also providing the geographic location of the avalanche signal origin.  Identification of avalanche occurrences will improve safety in avalanche prone terrain and minimize direct and indirect costs associated with avalanche activity. Automated notification of unexpected avalanche activity will provide a prompt for early response activities. Knowledge garnered through this project will advance the field of applied infrasonic sensor array monitoring, an infant science. Innovative hardware and software components that are designed and proven will be available for other infrasound monitoring applications such as tornadoes, volcanoes, flash floods, ocean storms, calving glaciers, aura borealis, ridgeline winds, explosions, and aircraft.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tumors of the thoracic and lumbar spine commonly extend into the vertebral canal and impinge on the dura, often infiltrating its superficial layers.  This infiltration of sarcoma cells into the dura surface is a major cause of failure of aggressive surgery to obtain cure of these patients.  With external beam radiation therapy, the majority of the tumor bed can be treated to effective dose levels.  However, because of the close proximity of the cord, the dose to the dura must be limited to well below the desired treatment range.  Therefore, to increase the dose to the dural surface without over-irradiating the cord, it is proposed to intraoperatively deliver a supplemental dose using a specially made beta-emitting radioactive device.  The additional dose delivered will, at very small risk and potentially great advantage to the patient, markedly increase the probability of tumor control.   During Phase I of this program, a \"proof of principle\" device was developed.  On the basis of the successful results of the Phase I program, physicians at the Massachusetts General Hospital have clinically employed the \"proof of principle\" device to successfully treat seven appropriate patients with vertebral or paravertebral tumors, and assess patient tolerance and outcome under an IRB approved protocol.  Radiation oncologists who have employed the existing plaque design have identified a number of features that would result in improved dose delivery.  The specific aim of this program is to further develop this brachytherapy device beyond the \"proof of principle\" developed during the Phase I program.  A customizable geometry plaque will be developed to improve the conformity of the dose distribution to the treatment target.  This will include differential loading to improve dose drop-off, an improved method of incorporating anatomical features into the plaque configuration, and methods for manufacturing completed plaques before activation to facilitate achieving more complex geometries and reducing the radiation hazard. The resultant plaque and its dosimetry will be evaluated for clinical utility through a human trial.  The results of this evaluation will lead to an optimum design of this device, in preparation for clinical use.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to provide a tool to improve bioinformatics education.  This tool, VIBE-Ed, is a software product designed to augment bioinformatics at the college and university level by creating an interactive, integrated, and comprehensive approach to bioinformatics education using visual programming.  During the Phase I project, INCOGEN demonstrated that its existing research tool, VIBE, provides an excellent foundation for an educational tool given its inherent technological attributes.  VIBE employs visual programming for bioinformatics, and in this respect, VIBE-Ed will provide a novel approach to bioinformatics classroom instruction.  The Phase I work demonstrated the effectiveness of visual programming in the learning process.  In addition to visual programming, the architecture of VIBE supports the inclusion of extensive information about the bioinformatics tools contained therein, making VIBE-Ed well suited to host the large and complex amount of resources and documentation required by an educational tool.  Finally, VIBE was created to be extensible, allowing it to be naturally extended into VIBE-Ed.  As the bioinformatics community discovers and validates new analysis tools, these can easily be incorporated into VIBE-Ed, along with the educational features to support them.  Bioinformatics education is a growing field, driven by the great need for trained bioinformaticists in biological and biomedical research.  Recent years have witnessed notable increases in the number of bioinformatics courses and degree programs at colleges and universities worldwide.  Textbooks and lectures alone do not expose bioinformatics students to hands-on data analysis and, by themselves, they are insufficient for bioinformatics education.  Despite the growing trend in bioinformatics education and the need for educationally focused tools, there is a significant lack of commercially available software tools specifically designed for bioinformatics education.  Currently, bioinformatics instructors fill this gap by using either complicated and expensive research tools or collections of web-based tools.  Bioinformatics research software is often cost prohibitive for an educational application, and the software itself is geared toward experts in the field rather than toward students.  Web-based tools are often free of charge, but they are also frequently dispersed throughout the web, requiring excessive time and sometimes also requiring programming skill to combine the use of several tools.  Many of the tools are not accompanied by instruction or related conceptual information, making them less suitable for education.  VIBE-Ed successfully addresses these concerns and promises to have immediate impact on bioinformatics education and, ultimately, in knowledge discovery on life science research.",

The program will connect foster and group home residents (youths), foster and group home parents, other caregivers, and youth serving professionals with information and resources to make post secondary educational opportunities for foster youths more attainable. Early access to information and resources will serve to raise expectations among foster youths and adults surrounding them that some form of post-secondary education (education after high school) is an achievable goal. We will organize content in two major areas, national and state specific, and seven basic topic areas. Youths and adults will receive information by using an On Your Way CD-Rom, DVD and Guidebook, and comprehensive informational databases through the On Your Way.org website.  In Phase I, we developed the On Your Way CD-Rom, two introductory videos, and framework design for the DVD and Guidebook, and On Your Way.org website. The On Your Way program prototype was built on a CD-Rom (version 1.0). Participants in the feasibility and evaluation studies showed that foster care youths from 13-23 were very interested and excited about the design and concept for the completed program. We were also able to determine significant rates of access and use of Internet technologies among participants in the study.  In Phase II, we will fully develop the On Your Way CD-Rom, DVD and Guide, and website. The evaluation study will focus on all three aspects of the multimedia package. Several objectives have been developed to guide our research activities:  1. Raise awareness among foster care youths and their caregivers/parents regarding the accessibility and affordability of education after high school;  2. Disseminate currently fragmented information regarding types of schools, admissions, housing, school supports, scholarship and loan information (financial aid), available to foster youths;  3. Develop and evaluate effectiveness of multimedia programming in reaching foster care youths and their caregivers/parents in both rural and urban and family and group settings;  4. Gather data over time to determine the educational value of the materials and motivation of users to develop or extend post secondary education plans.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   An acute intracranial mass lesion secondary to hemorrhage or edema can lead to profound brain damage or death. Assessment of these patients in the critical care setting is typically done by clinical exam, periodic imaging, and in some cases by intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. However, ICP monitoring is invasive and it is not always elevated in patients with ongoing secondary neuronal injury. Perhaps most importantly, it does not provide for direct functional assessment of the brain's status.  We propose to fulfill this need by developing technology for real-time objective assessment of brain function at the bedside, using somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP). We have applied traditional amplitude and latency analysis as well as a frequency domain measure, ESPRIT, and demonstrated strong correlation with cerebral perfusion pressure (derived from ICP) in a rat model of acute mass lesions.  We now propose a Phase II effort which includes 1) integration of ESPRIT into a real-time clinical monitoring platform; 2) application of a noise-immune, adaptive strategy to interpret trends in the SEP signal; and 3) evaluation of the technology in a pilot study in the neurocritical care unit.  It is our long-term goal to develop a useful tool to assist the neurointensivist in evaluating patients who present with an acute intracranial mass.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes development of the Comprehensive Affective Training (CAT) program, an interactive, multimedia-based prevention curriculum for Pre-K and Kindergarten age children. The need for this product arises from the alarming prevalence of violence and other delinquent behaviors in American society. Children with inadequate social and emotional knowledge early in life tend to be rejected by peers, which, in turn, places them at greater risk for the development of entrenched, violence-prone patterns of thought and behavior. To avoid this developmental trajectory, experts advocate the creation of prevention programming focusing on social and emotional skills during the preschool years. However, mostly due to cost and extensive training requirements, the vast majority of Pre-K and Kindergarten age children do not have access to this type of programming. To help address this issue, the current application proposes combining the latest findings and theories on emotional knowledge with multimedia computer technology. The child-focused program will be delivered through an engaging format involving animation and video, as well as personalized feedback and adjunct follow-up exercises to be conducted by parents and teachers. Also intended for parents and teachers, the adult component will consist of a series of audio files demonstrating sample adult-child, \"emotion coaching\" dialogues delivered over the phone or internet. The Phase II development effort will include a stimulus validation study, a series of usability studies, and production of the final program. The final program will then be subject to an experimental field trial in a school-based setting, an exploratory situational study examining use of the CAT program in a home-based setting, and acceptance testing involving teachers, parents, and children.",

The program will provide parents and children (in separate developmentally appropriate modules) with psycho-education about the problem of bedwetting and a suite of tools to help them implement and follow through with a personalized, multi-component behavioral intervention program. While enuresis is a physical problem, optimal management is through learning-based behavioral treatment. Multi-component behavioral interventions offer the highest rates of long-term treatment success, lowest rates of relapse, and do not expose children to the significant risks associated with pharmacological treatment. There are many compelling arguments for treating enuretic children, including the prevention of emotional and social trauma, evidence of improvement in psycho-social functioning following successful treatment, and prevention of parent and family stress that can place children at risk for abuse. Medical experts clearly recommend behavioral intervention as the treatment choice based on historical and current outcome evidence. Presentation of the program in a highly engaging multimedia format will facilitate parent and children's motivation and interest, which are the primary factors associated with treatment nonadherence. This family intervention program is intended for children with medically uncomplicated primary nocturnal enuresis, which make up between 85-90 percent of children diagnosed with enuresis.",

Large potential markets such as skin resurfacing, dentistry, and ophthalmology utilize the Er:YSGG (2.79 mu/m) and Er:YAG (2.94 mu/m) lasers for therapeutic procedures. These lasers are capable of efficiently and precisely ablating both hard and soft tissues while avoiding the peripheral thermal damage and necrosis observed at other wavelengths. During Phase I, we developed an improved germanium fiber for short pulse and high power delivery by removal of bubbles, striation, and particles from the glass and began the development of a biocompatible fiber. Fiber transmission and fiber damage thresholds were determined at both short (500-ns) and long (8-300 us) pulse lengths, and laser parameters were optimized for efficient soft tissue ablation. Hybrid fibers consisting of silica and sapphire tips attached to a trunk fiber were developed to prevent damage of the fiber during contact tissue ablation, and tested for high power laser transmission.      Phase II work will consist of six specific aims: (1) Improvement of the power handling and yield of germanium fibers by reducing remaining glass defects and improved fiber tip polishing. (2) Development of high performance and reliable germanium fibers from compositions that are biocompatible and pass the MEM cytotoxicity and intracutaneous injection tests, and study methods of fiber sterilizaton, such as autoclave and EtO. (3) Development of specialized fiber probe tip designs consisting of hybrid germanium/silica fibers, end caps, micro-lenses, side-firing fibers, and sculpted fiber tips, for flexible delivery of radiation during custom surgical procedures involving contact and non-contact laser tissue ablation. (4) Improvement of the Erbium laser spatial and temporal beam profile to provide higher fiber damage thresholds at the input/output ends of the fiber. (5) Q-switched ErYSGG transmission through fibers and specialty tips with measurement of the tissue ablation rates and quantification of the peripheral thermal and mechanical side effects. (6) Ablation of hard cataracts and precise incision of other, soft ophthalmic tissues for potential clinical applications using fiber delivery of short-pulse Er:YAG energy.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant): The function of modern electrically powered prostheses is limited to actuation of 1 powered joint at a time such as a pincer (hand), elbow, or wrist. These are most often controlled by electrical signals or ElectroMyoGrams (EMGs) from a pair of skin surface electrodes. The joint being controlled is most commonly selected by tensing both muscles simultaneously which causes the controller to change function. EMG control signals are difficult to acquire from skin surface electrodes because of the intrinsic noise and stability problems of skin electrodes, and the limited active areas of small, closely spaced, and often atrophied muscles. For below-elbow amputees, simultaneous control of multiple powered joints (i.e. wrist, thumb, fingers) could be accomplished if multiple sources of high quality control signals were available. By implanting EMG telemeters to access all residual muscles, high quality control signals can be transmitted simultaneously from many muscles to a multi-functional, dexterous prosthesis. The Phase-1 project successfully demonstrated telemetry of low noise EMG signals from a chronically implanted rabbit using optical telemetry for power and signal. A Phase-2 project is proposed for clinical application and commercialization. First, the technology will be perfected and tested as a non-invasive device to establish a product for patients with certain types of sockets and to demonstrate the benefits of this technology. Telemeters will be embedded in roll-on silicone sleeves to eliminate the cumbersome snap-on wiring. For more traditional prosthesis suspensions, the telemeters will be adhered to the skin to eliminate electrical noise caused by movement of the prosthesis shell electrodes over the skin. Devices will be evaluated through steam sterilization cycles, in long term saline soak, long term animal implants, amputee laboratory evaluation tasks and home trials. The second goal, after the technology is proven reliable and functional in the non-invasive testing, we will be to implant devices in amputee volunteers who will benefit most from this approach. In addition to engineering measures and evaluations, simultaneous control of multiple actuators by a below elbow amputee will be demonstrated. During this time final regulatory approval will be sought and marketii begiaon a limited basis.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project will optimize performance of an optical safety sensor for integration with the hydrogen economy infrastructures.  Feasibility of the sensing approach was demonstrated by developing a sol-gel-titania-based indicator formulation, which showed complete reversibility, and response and recovery time of less than a minute with 4% hydrogen. Safety remains a top priority since leakage of hydrogen in air during production, storage, transfer and distribution creates an explosive atmosphere for concentrations between 4% (v/v) - the lower explosive limit (LEL) and 74.5% (v/v) - the upper explosive limit (UEL) at room temperature and pressure. Being a very small molecule, hydrogen is prone to leakage through seals and micro-cracks. The sensor will be further improved with regard to its dynamic detection range, response and recovery times, sensitivity, accuracy, resolution and reduced interference from temperature fluctuations, and atmospheric gases including humidity.  Hydrogen economy is new; public acceptance of hydrogen fuel would require the integration of a reliable safety sensor.  Global energy consumption is projected to increase by 50% over the next 20 years.  Failure to develop alternatives to oil would heighten growing reliance on oil imports, raising the risk of political and military conflict and economic disruption.  The acceptance of hydrogen by the general public as an alternative fuel requires a safety sensor for mitigating the explosion risks due to hydrogen leakage at unacceptable levels.",

Research over the past 25 years has established a consistent relationship between SIPS and aggressive and delinquent behavior in youth. In addition, the majority of current evidence-based programs designed to prevent or treat disruptive behavior disorders, aggressive behavior, or delinquency in children and adolescents are predicated on the SIPS model (Crick & Dodge, 1994) and utilize social cognitive intervention techniques. Despite these many advances in the study and treatment of aggressive and violent behavior in youth, there currently exist no standardized, normed measures of SIPS with known psychometric properties. Thus, mental health professionals and researchers do not have access to state-of-the-art measures to assess the effectiveness of their interventions or to establish treatment goals related to social cognitive functioning.

The mathematical complexity of railroad transportation problems has precluded the development of optimization algorithms for solving them preventing railroads from benefiting from the advances taking place in the field of optimization; they still rely on manual decision-making processes for most of their planning and scheduling needs. During Phase I, the company developed prototype software for the railroad blocking problem and tested it on the data provided by three major US railroads:  CSX Transportation, BNSF Railway, and Norfolk Southern Corporation. In this Phase II project the company will develop a prototype for a commercial decision support system for the railroad-blocking problem by combining state-of-the-art operations research techniques with latest information technology tools. This project will enhance core optimization engines and algorithms using cutting-edge ideas in network optimization, heuristic optimization, data structures, and software engineering. Database connectivity will also be provided. This Phase II project will extend algorithms for the railroad-blocking problem to similar problems arising in postal/package delivery service design and developing prototype software.   Currently, railroads takes months of team effort to determine a blocking plan and undertake this exercise once in several years with intermittent periods of minor adjustments to account for seasonal variations in the traffic pattern. The proposed decision support system would allow a railroad to determine a blocking plan in a matter of a few hours and produce solutions far superior than those obtained manually. The proposed solution will enable a large freight railroad to optimize its blocking plans frequently and reduce cost by at least $10 million annually and hundreds of millions of dollars for railroads companies in the USA and Canada over a few years. The research will establish the efficacy of network optimization and heuristic methodology in solving railroad planning and scheduling problems. The success of this product will lead to a greater acceptance of optimization models and optimization-based software in the railroad industry.",

While inositol polyphosphates are highly charged, making them unlikely to cross membranes, we have developed membrane permeant forms that enable intracellular delivery recapitulating the activity of endogenous inositol polyphosphates. These activities suggest that derivatives of inositol polyphosphates may be therapeutic in cystic fibrosis (CF) and other diseases characterized by abnormal ion flux. In contrast to extracellularly acting agents directed against the extracellular domain of ion channel pores, membrane-permeant inositol polyphosphate analogs modulate ion channel activities from inside the cell. We have identified an lnsP4 derivative, INO-4995, as a potential treatment for CF and have initiated development toward the filing of an IND. INO-4995 is selective for CF epithelial tissue as compared to non-CF tissue. The goal of the current study is to predict how INO-4995 functions in CF tissue and in different genetic backgrounds. This will aid in identifying and treating an optimal patient population most likely to benefit from the compound's therapeutic effects. The specific aims include: Aim 1: Assess the in-vitro cellular metabolism and the in-vivo pharmacokinetics of radiolabeled INO-4995. Aim 2: Assess the bioavailability and safety of INO-4995 using an epithelial airway tissue culture system. Aim 3: Determine the effects of INO-4995 on nasal transepithelial voltage of CF and non-CF mice under a variety of conditions, including genetic background, age, and gender. To date, work has been performed with tissue from deltaF508 homozygous CF patients. We will extend this work to assess the electrophysiological effects of the compound on tissue with other mutations or in tissue that is heterozygous for deltaF508. We will also compare the effect of the compound in deltaF508 homozygous mice on different genetic backgrounds. The broader aim of this study is to further characterize the biological responses to INO-4995, and in conjunction with the ongoing preclinical and clinical development program for CF, would offer further validation for the therapeutic utility of an inositol polyphosphate signaling molecule derivative. This work will help delineate the mechanism of action of INO-4995, will assess the bioavailability and safety, and will help define dosing/regimen protocols, and could expedite regulatory and clinical planning during the development process.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This Phase II SBIR proposal is intended to further develop a new therapeutic approach to save the lives of severely injured trauma victims with hemorrhagic shock (HS). In a small proportion of trauma, a fatal outcome is assured due to the irreversible loss of vital functions or massive blood loss. Frequently, however, emergent resuscitation is possible. These victims survive to hospitalization and are able to receive the full benefits of modern intensive care and surgery. In spite of fluid resuscitation and surgery to repair vascular and parenchymal injuries, however, not all treated patients survive HS. The principal impediment to a successful outcome in this population is the development of cardiovascular failure, a condition in which HS results in profound hypotension refractory to fluid replacement and inotropic support. There is substantial evidence that HS - induced tissue injury is mediated by profound alterations in the biosynthesis of the free radicals nitric oxide and superoxide anion, and their reaction product peroxynitrite, a toxic oxidant. We are developing novel metalloporphyrin-based molecules that act as peroxynitrite decomposition catalysts. An early development compound, FP15, was protective in experimental models of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Based on these data, the central objective of the Phase I grant proposal was to establish that pharmacological peroxynitrite decomposition can improve hemodynamics, metabolic function, end-organ injury, and survival in a rodent model of hemorrhagic shock. We have addressed this objective by characterizing the pharmacodynamic profile of the catalysts in a rat model of severe fixed-pressure HS. The results of the Phase I application demonstrated the efficacy of WW-85, a next generation potent porphyrinic catalytic antioxidant, and thereby established the technical merit and feasibility of the current project. In the current Phase II grant application, we plan to conduct additional efficacy studies testing WW-85 in clinically relevant rodent and large animal models of uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock. Additional aims of the study include formulation and stability work, as well as pharmacokinetic and metabolic characterization of the compound, and toxicological evaluation, in order to advance the technology to the stage of human clinical testing.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Steroid treatment of anterior uveitus is effective but frequently associated with cataract formation after prolonged use. Development of an effective substitute for steroids, free of these safety concerns, would be a substantial advance. In a Phase I SBIR, we proposed a novel therapeutic candidate for treatment of uveitus, based on the introduction of a proprietary novel inhibitor of the inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS), an enzyme whose de novo upregulated expression accounts for the release of injurious quantities of NO and produces inflammatory injury in uveitis. Our development candidate, GED (guanidinoethyldisulfide), selectively inhibits iNOS activity and scavenges peroxynitrate, a toxic oxidant formed from the reaction of NO and superoxide. In a rat model of endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU), GED proved highly effective when administered either systemically of topically (as an 0.3% ophthalmac solution). We also carried out studies that suggest that GED therapy is safe, as evidenced by negative in vitro and in vivo genotoxicology assays, a NOEL in rats and dogs for systemic GED administration 100-fold greater than the potential absorbed drug from ophthlamic use, a lack of cytotoxicity in cultured epithelial cells, and absenceof ocular injury in rabbits challenged with a supratherapeutic (10%) GED ophthalmic solution. In the current Phase 2 SBIR, we will conduct safety and efficacy studies in order to move GED forward to the stage where human clinical testing can begin. To this end, we will first test GED in rabbits to establish the therapeutic window of opportunity in a classic model of uveitis and we will test the safety of the compound in 60 day and 6 month repeat dose studies. The latter study will be critical to establish that GED, in contrast to steroids, does not induce cataract formation. The results of the studies proposed in the current Phase III SBIR application will provide the basis for an FDA-approved IND to perform Phase I/II clinical trials.",

Such models are often used in the analysis of longitudinal and cluster sample data arising in Epidemiological and other studies. The recent methodological advances we propose to implement make it possible to compute consistent and asymptotically unbiased maximum estimates in a much wider variety of problems, and we also propose to compute statistics validating these estimates. The \"Preliminary Results\" section of this proposal shows that it easy to encounter situations with Epidemiological data in which the usual mixed effect model algorithms fail, even in problems with large sample sizes if the 'within cluster' sample sizes are small. These failures are made more troublesome by the fact that the user seldom has any warning that the computational algorithm has failed. We propose to provide such a warning. Most mixed effect model software assumes a multivariate normal random effect density. We propose to allow other densities, including user specified densities, in the random effects model. We also propose to develop software with adaptive MARS like model fitting capabilities.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Ion channels function as cell-signaling effectors for a diverse range of physiological activities, including nerve signal propagation, muscle contraction, cardiopulmonary regulation, and cell metabolism. Their impact on human health is underscored by the existence of forty compounds, including about 15% of the top 100 best-selling drugs, that target ion channels for treatment of important neurological and cardiovascular diseases. Potassium channels, among the most well-studied ion channel classes, are targets for treating diseases such as multiple sclerosis and breast cancer, but their cross-reactivity with drugs is also a major cause of unwanted drug side-effects, responsible for more than 50% of all drug withdrawals from the market since 1998. Despite their biomedical significance, ion channels remain resistant to many traditional and emerging modes of manipulation and detection, in large part because they are topologically complex membrane proteins that span the lipid bilayer of the cell multiple times. Assays for ion channel function usually require the use of living cells because the cellular membrane maintains both ion channel structure and an electrochemical barrier that creates the potential for cellular electrical signals. However, cells possess inherent limitations in size and environmental requirements that, restrict their application to emerging nano- and micro-scale devices that are becoming increasingly important in high-throughput and high-resolution studies of protein function. New methods of manipulating ion channels and studying their function are needed to aid the development of new drugs and to reduce ion channel cross-reactivity.  The purpose of this proposal is to develop a product that will measure ion channel function without the need for living cells and with significantly greater applicability to nano- and micro-scale detection devices. We have developed a novel technology, the Lipoparticle, that enables stable manipulation of native ion channels in a nano-scale format. We use non-infectious membrane-enveloped retroviral structures as membrane protein presentation vehicles, eliminating the need for whole cells or detergent-based protein purification. In manuscripts published previously, we demonstrated that Lipoparticles could incorporate diverse membrane proteins, that the membrane proteins retained their native structure, and that the particles could be used to study biomolecular interactions. In previous studies we demonstrated that ion channels could be incorporated into Lipoparticles, and in Phase 1 studies we demonstrated that ion channels could function within the Lipoparticle.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project addresses the device and market opportunity for thick magnetooptic garnet Faraday rotator films with planar anisotropy to be operated in the near infrared. Magnetic and electromagnetic field sensors could be developed at a variety of near-infrared wavelengths including the 800 nm, 1310 nm and 1550 nm bands. These sensors can be made much less expensively, in much smaller sizes and with much less weight than current technologies such as current transformers. They have a potential for immediate impact in reliability of electric power distribution through failure anticipation and prevention and conservation of electric power through monitoring and control. Planar materials have much higher switching speeds than conventional perpendicular Faraday rotators and as such would permit a magnetooptical approach to packet switching. Such films are an innovative solution to device problems that require high-speed, continuously-varying polarization rotation with applied field. The project will work on improving properties and performance of such thick planar films and incorporate them into devices. Specific materials tasks are directed to improving sensitivity, linearity and temperature range of operation.  If successful these sensors will have applications such as wheel and turbine rotation, electric power distribution, monitoring, metering and control, and battlefield sensors.  The electric power application in particular has potential to revolutionize catastrophic failure prevention in the power grid and reduce power costs at a variety of levels by enabling autonomous reconfiguration. The lack of electrical connectors in fiber optic sensors for explosive, flammable and high-voltage environments represent a significant improvement in safety. New photonic devices not currently realizable will be enabled for telecommunications and military applications such as variable optical attenuators, polarization controllers and increased speed magnetooptic switches. Photonic devices include polarization controllers, variable optical attenuators, switches and new innovative devices. Smart ships and buildings would find utility both for conservation and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "75593B  The Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay Underground Detector has been identified by the DOE as a high scientific priority for Nuclear Physics research; however, the current generation of proposed experiments to determine neutrino mass would require 500 kg of germanium (Ge), which would cost more than $100 million.  Therefore, several alternate parent isotopes for neutrinoless double beta decay have been suggested as candidates.  The 100Mo isotope of molybdenum is particularly promising because it has large decay energy, resulting in a signal above gamma ray backgrounds.  The nuclear structure of this relatively light nuclide has been shown to be simple enough to allow reliable calculation of the parameters needed to extract the effective neutrino mass from the measured half-life.  However, these advantages can only be exploited if a detector can be constructed with both high detection efficiency and excellent energy resolution.  The only known method is to construct a bolometer of a single crystal from a compound that contains a significant fraction of molybdenum.  Therefore, this project will develop technology for the bulk crystal growth of single crystal molybdate (a molybdenum oxide compound), so that large crystals can be routinely and cost-effectively grown.   In Phase I, three molybdate compositions were investigated to determine:  (1) their growability by the Czochralski method of bulk crystal growth; and (2) their potential use as cryogenic bolometer materials without any energy interferences, radiation effects, or other problems.  One of the three materials was selected as a target composition, and independent bolometer tests indicated that the target composition would be an excellent host for 100Mo in bolometer applications.  In Phase II, the target molybdate compound will be optimized for crystal growth and fabrication of cubes for bolometer applications.  A large crystal enriched with 100Mo will be grown and fabricated for complete bolometer testing.  Commercial Applications And Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The dominant application of the single crystal molybdates would be for cryogenic bolometers for neutrinoless double beta decay.   Because the target molybdate compound is a good low-temperature scintillator, with luminescence arising from the molybdenum oxide complexes, secondary commercial applications are anticipated.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this study is to develop a small portable handheld system capable of objectively determining audiogram configurations in infants using auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs). The system will address the need to obtain frequency-specific hearing threshold information in infants less than six months of age in a fast and efficient manner in order to fit hearing aids. Although current ABR technology can also be utilized to determine frequency specific thresholds, tone burst ABRs require expert interpretation and long or multiple testing sessions. Furthermore, current handheld screening devices do not provide frequency specific threshold information. ASSRs allow the application of objective frequency domain response detection analysis techniques that are capable of providing fast and accurate frequency specific hearing threshold information which is required for hearing aid fitting in infants. The proposed system will further improve current ASSR testing techniques by implementing advanced threshold estimation routines in order to reduce testing time. During Phase I, a fast audiogram estimation technique, CAST (Classification of Audiograms by Sequential Testing), was adapted from behavioral to ASSR testing and was shown to be very efficient and accurate. The ASSR testing module developed during Phase I was integrated into an evoked potential and otoacoustic emission testing system which has received FDA approval and is currently being distributed. During Phase II, further refinement of the ASSR CAST technique will be continued and a new ASSR Intensity-Ramping technique will also be refined and tested. The ASSR testing module will be implemented in a miniaturized handheld hardware unit providing greater portability for screening and testing applications at a very competitive price. The portable device will also provide standard ABR and OAE testing with in-ear calibration options for all testing modalities. A large-scale clinical trial will be conducted during the second year of Phase II involving three major testing sites.",

This approach has been used in the most capable automated DNA sequencers, and a number of other biomedical instruments. To achieve this, current machines use either 2 gas lasers with blue and green lines, or 2 lines from an argon ion laser. These laser light sources are bulky, power inefficient, and expensive. A low cost blue-green laser that is compact and provides high output power is highly desirable. Such a device will have a tremendous positive impact on health science related instrument designs. One (1) solution to achieve this aim is the development of a dual wavelength (blue-green) optical fiber lasing cavity based laser source. Such a source has a number of advantages over solid crystal and gas based devices and is considered ideal for developing miniature inexpensive lasers for biomedical applications. Yb-doped optical fiber stands out, in particular, because of its 2 absorption bands. This characteristic shows promise for the development of a dual-line laser. In this project, our overall aim is to develop a double clad single mode Yb-doped fiber based laser emitting at 2 visible lines: blue (489 nm), and green (519 nm). This will be achieved by frequency doubling the primary emission lines of Ytterbium (Yb) at ?=978 nm and ?=1038 nm. In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of generating blue and green lines from Ytterbium-doped fiber. In Phase II, we will fabricate and test a working prototype of the blue-green laser for biomedical applications. In the long term, the commercial availability of this dual wavelength laser light source will enable the creation of automatic DNA sequencers that are much smaller and less expensive than present models, are less costly to operate, and will provide higher sequencing speed and accuracy.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop user interfaces, routing algorithms, and driver notification systems necessary to deliver content-rich traffic information to travelers en route. Large volumes of traffic data, of varying types over large areas, is being gathered by public and private agencies. To be useful to a driver while traveling, this data must be reduced to small amounts of information and delivered in a way that allows easy comprehension with minimal distraction. Key driver behaviors benefiting from traffic information are pre-trip departure time changes, pre-trip and en-route route changes, and en-route anxiety reduction through drivers knowing the estimated arrival time. These behaviors depend on collecting and analyzing the planned route under changing traffic conditions and comparing that route with possible better alternatives. This research will develop user interfaces to collect origin, destination, and route information from drivers, pre-trip via the web and en-route via cell phone. Algorithms to determine alternate routes will be developed through analysis of field collected route data. Notification methods that present the salient information with minimal distraction will be developed and tested. The research will result in the development of better traffic information services that truly support the decisions drivers make as they travel.  The results of this research have potentially broad impacts on society. Traffic congestion is a growing problem in U.S. cities. In some areas, it has become a limiting factor on economic growth. Emphasis has shifted in recent years from providing additional capacity to better utilization of the existing infrastructure. Broad dissemination of traffic information in a form suitable for making optimal routing and trip decisions allows efficiency improvements based on the decentralized decisions of many drivers. Trip modifications based on traffic information can save drivers an estimated $3.9 billion in lost productivity, 225 million hours of travel time, and 340 million gallons of fuel, per year.  It is believed that such savings could support a viable commercial marketplace for personalized traffic information. Similar savings are possible for commercial travel through improvements in delivery routing, on-time delivery, and more efficient dispatching. Congestion management by public agencies strives for efficient use of the public infrastructure by shifting motorists onto less congested roads and would benefit from better interfaces between the traffic data collected and the individual drivers on the roads. The examination of route choice will advance the scientific understanding of how drivers choose their routes and how they alter those routes under changing external conditions.",

By eliminating illumination-induced variations from the raw optical images the proposed sensor will eradicate the vision system's vulnerability to illumination variations and signal loss due to high dynamic range. The core innovation is in a signal processing technique for estimating the illumination field from sensed images. The technique efficiently implements as a dense on-chip massively parallel analog processor distributed among the photo-detectors to produce a reflectance sensitive image sensor. By compensating for illumination, the proposed image sensor inherently addresses the wide dynamic range problem, that routinely causes conventional cameras to over or under expose producing inadequate images. Even when illumination conditions do not saturate an image sensor, the vision system has to account for object appearance variations caused by illumination.  The proposed research has the potential to broadly impact computer vision performance and reliability. Most present and future vision applications including automotive, biometric, security, and mobile computing applications operate in unconstrained environments and have to cope with unknown and widely varying illumination conditions.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Successful gene therapy will revolutionize the treatment of the inherited bleeding disorders hemophilia A and B. Hemophilia A is caused by deficiency of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) and is a prime disorder for genetic correction. The disease constitutes 80% of all hemophilia patients and is the focus of this proposal. The requirements for successful FVIII gene include: the persistent expression of therapeutic levels of FVIII, the lack of significant toxicity to the gene transfer vehicle (vector), the lack of host immune response to the normal FVIII protein, and reduced ectopic expression of the normal product. Gene therapy through the use of Intronn's platform technology, spliceosome mediated RNA trans-splicing (SMART), can potentially circumvent some of these problems. Intronn has developed and patented constructs called pre-trans-splicing molecules (PTMs) that are capable of modifying mRNA in vivo. PTMs work by promoting trans-splicing reactions between the PTM and a targeted pre-messenger RNA. The product of a SMART reaction is a novel chimeric or composite RNA that can encode virtually any desired gene product. The product of a SMART reaction contains one or more exons of the target endogenous pre-mRNA and an exonic or cDNA sequence delivered by the PTM. We propose studies to target mutant factor VIII in cell and animal models of hemophilia A with PTMs that can perform repair of endogenous transcripts to generate full length functional FVIII. In this application we will plan to 1) optimize an adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery system for correction of FVIII in the mouse model of hemophilia A, 2) demonstrate functional long term correction of endogenous FVIII in a knockout mouse model of hemophilia using AAV delivered PTMs and identify a lead AAV delivery system for use in clinical work, 3) identify a lead human FVIII PTM that can efficiently repair FVIII using in vitro screening models, and 4) perform biodistribution and clearance studies in mice using the lead AAV vector and lead human PTM. This work will be performed in collaboration with a key university site(Mt. Sinai School of Medicine) with extensive experience in hemophilia A biology, gene transfer and experimentation with murine and canine models of hemophilia A. The research proposed in this application will form the groundwork for a Phase I clinical trial in humans.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project proposes to fabricate a photonic crystal, thermal mid-IR source with low divergence and low dispersion at about 0.1% the cost of competing technologies.  Phase I research resolved fine structure of the emission spectrum from 2-D photonic crystals showing that the high intensity, large bandwidth peak had many submodes with strong polarization and angular dependence. In a series of designed experiments the intensity and central wavelength of these submodes were varied with geometrical alterations of the photonic crystal, and theoretically were correlated to surface plasmon resonances. A computer model was developed that matched experimental data. Results imply optimization of photonic crystal structure in Phase II could isolate a single sub-mode resulting in very low dispersion, very low divergence emission that could be coherent. The project will support high-end computational research at a university for complex electro-magnetic modeling of photon - surface plasmon interactions. Improved structures predicted by these calculations will be fabricated at an NSF supported nano-fabrication facility. We will examine effects of altered symmetry, periodic defects, and detailed shaping of electrostatic fields.  All existing choices for coherent radiation in the mid-infrared spectral region are too expensive for widespread vapor detection. Examples are wavelength shifting of high power pulsed lasers using non-linear optical effects or quantum cascade lasers (now $5,000 each). The proposed source could sell for less than $10.  Additionally, it could significantly reduce the cost of sensitive spectroscopic instrumentation allowing detection of vapors well below 1ppm concentration and application to widespread use as toxic vapor detectors for commercial, residential, and homeland defense applications. Compared to other technology, these detectors are temperature insensitive, rugged, and free of interference effects with zero maintenance and zero drift. This work will contribute towards understanding photon surface plasmon interactions within 2D photonic crystals. The field has huge implications for the microelectronics and optics industry as optical and electronic functions are combined onto single chips for applications to optical computing, communications, etc.",

VUV photofragmentation yields a near perfect technology for \"on demand\" structural fragment ion analysis of complex peptide mixtures especially when combined with the proven capability of IM to distinguish phosphorylated vs. unphosphorylated peptides. In addition, recent internally funded research at lonwerks [34-37] has rather unexpectedly proved the efficacy of incorporating nanoparticulate MALDI matrices into the near surface of biotissues. Recently, lonwerks publications [34-40] and patents [41-44] have established a new approach to molecular microprobe imaging of biotissue surfaces. Thus, the simplification of complex laser microprobe molecular ion spectra from particulate treated biosurfaces is another application which will also benefit from the combination of ion mobility separation followed with on demand photofragmentation structural analysis. Phase II will develop unique IM-oTOFMS/MS hardware using patented multi-pixel position sensitive detectors in a specially designed oTOFMS. Enhanced mass and mobility resolution as well as photofragment MS of this instrument will be tested for applications in proteomics and tissue imaging. Commercialization depends on showing that only IMS-oTOFMS/MS can perform these applications.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project aims to deliver a dramatic advance in microelectromechanical system (MEMS) deformable mirror performance. Deformable mirrors are the key active component in adaptive optics (AO) systems that provide vastly improved resolution through turbulent air, water, and biological samples. The lack of low- cost, high-deflection (stroke), and low-voltage deformable mirrors has prevented the widespread deployment of AO in a range of fields including biotechnology, ophthalmology, and national security. Phase I successfully demonstrated a new actuation approach for shaping MEMS deformable mirrors. The new approach combines piezoelectric actuation with MEMS deformable mirror technology. The piezoelectric actuators are a true breakthrough as deformable mirror actuation voltage may be reduced from 100-200 volts down to 10-20 volts - a full order of magnitude reduction. The use of smaller, less expensive, safer, and more reliable low-voltage electronics opens the door for a host of applications. The goal of Phase II is to build on the Phase 1 actuator designs to manufacture complete deformable mirror arrays with groundbreaking high stroke, low voltage, low cost, high speed, coupled with superb optical quality. The high resolution and contrast enhancement enabled by adaptive optics (AO) using deformable mirrors is poised to dramatically advance astronomy, ophthalmology, biology, and national security. Yet for the full potential to be realized, miniature deformable mirrors with high stroke, low voltage, and low cost are critical. If successful the proposed mirror will address the key requirements vital for moving AO into mainstream scientific laboratories and commercial markets. This will have enormous social and commercial impact. Biological microscopes that have far higher resolution, ophthalmoscopes that can image single cells in a living retina, laser microsurgery with precise beam control, and telescopes that can image through atmospheric turbulence will push the boundaries of science. The health and well being of millions will be directly improved as commercialization moves early eye disease detection, customized vision correction, and new medical treatments into doctor offices across the nation. Free space optical communication, and long-range surveillance applications will also reap the benefits of this technology.",

We propose to develop a series of instructional modules to increase behavioral capability, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations for these individuals in the following areas: eating more fruits, juice, vegetables and low fat foods (FJV&LFF) at home (primarily snacks), increasing FJV&LFF availability and accessibility, increasing their nutritional knowledge about FJV&LFF, expanding their preferences for these foods, increasing their skills in preparing healthy snacks, and increasing their purchases of FJV&LFF in fast food restaurants and convenience stores. In Phase I, we successfully completed the first module of the curriculum, \"Fruit Rainbow.\" The results from the user evaluations clearly indicate that this product was very well received by all our targeted consumer groups (parents, direct support staff and adults with MR). They uniformly rated the materials as stimulating, engaging, well done for the target population, and highly motivational. Results from the follow up phone call support these ratings, with many of the participants continuing to use the video and workbook. We also completed an interview instrument and accompanying materials to be used for a face-to-face interview with the target adult and an informant. The primary goal of Phase II is to conduct a randomized trial of a theory-based intervention to increase consumption of FJV&LFF among adults with mental retardation. The research settings will be residential facilities where these individuals live. Our sample will consist of 110 adults with mild to moderate MR (Target Adults [TA]) and 110 adults without MR, who will participate as Learning Partners (LP). To evaluate whether adults with mild to moderate MR will increase their consumption of FJV/LFF as a result of using the \"Eat Right for Long Life\" curriculum, we will use a two-group (Intervention/Alternate Treatment Control) design with measurements at four time points (Baseline, Baseline +1 Month, Baseline + 2 Months and Exit). Participants in the Intervention Group will receive the \"Eat Right for Long Life\" curriculum. Since there is no comparable nutrition curriculum for adults with mental retardation against which to test the \"Eat Right for Long Life\" product, participants in the Control Group will receive selected materials from the Produce for Better Health Foundation.",

The purpose of the current project is to develop and test an innovative web-based educational program designed to prevent prescription drug abuse among working women. The program will contain important information on the safe use of medications with abuse potential and on alternatives to taking medications.

Muscadines are harvested from August to October; fresh muscadines are marketed for only 6-8 weeks per year. The predominant markets for muscadines include the fresh fruit market, wine and juice production and preserves, jellies, jams and sauces.

The purpose of this project is to commercialize the production of the first bulk extracts and nutraceutical powders of muscadine for formulation into various products in the dietary supplements, cosmetics, functional foods, and juice industries.

The Structural Genomics Initiative of the NIH aims to solve the 3-D structure of thousands of proteins a year by a major scale-up of technology. X-ray crystallography, which requires high-quality protein crystals, is a significant means of deducing 3-D structures. Growing protein crystals is a process of trial and error, and, in high-throughput protein crystallization, essential for the Structural Genomics Initiative to succeed, combinatorial methods are used to set up thousands of crystallization trials and imaging robots inspect each vessel for crystals and crystal-like objects. A bottleneck is the inability of automatic image analysis methods to recognize and flag the presence of protein crystals and microcrystals to the exclusion of all else. During Phase I, an intelligent imaging method based on a spectroscopic marker of the protein was designed and tested and found to be successful in recognizing protein crystals and microcrystals exclusively. An analytical procedure also was developed to facilitate automation of this imaging method. In Phase II of this SBIR project, we propose to build the imager based on a novel design and use it to image entire protein drops rapidly. Criteria for scoring the drops based on the size of protein crystals only will be established. The imager will be automated so that it can be integrated with the rest of an automated crystal growing process. Crystal screens can be set up and the drops containing crystals identified without human intervention speeding up crystal growth and protein structure determination. There is a demand for such an imaging robot among high-throughput laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, drug discovery firms, and contract X-ray crystallography laboratories. The new method is expected to play an important role in the success of the Structural Genomics Initiative and the discovery of new drugs. The imager also will find use in semiconductor wafer inspection and screening for cancer.",

Producing pulp for papermaking via thermomechanical pulping (TMP) of biomass is a highly energy intensive process that is performed at high temperatures. Research is proposed to demonstrate the feasibility of using a directed evolution strategy and high-throughput, solid-phase enzyme library screening to engineer a new endoglucanase variant with significantly improved thermoactivity, thermostability and resistance to inhibitors. This enhanced enzyme will be sold as an additive to manufacturers who produce pulp and paper via the TMP process. Major benefits include energy savings and improvement of paper quality. The commercial application of this project will be on the pulp and paper industry. New screening technology will be used to engineer an enhanced enzyme that will modify pulp fibers under high-temperature conditions. This enzyme additive will accelerate the pulp refining process and thereby lower production costs by reducing the amount of electricity needed to complete the conversion. Any significant reduction in the energy input will be very economically attractive to the pulp producers. If introducing an effective enzyme treatment could eliminate even a modest 10% of the current energy expenditure, the potential worldwide savings could total nearly US$500 million per year. The enhanced enzyme will be able to create a new market by offering these significant savings to the pulp producers. In addition, the information gained from this study could be applied to other similar enzymes to expand the market for thermostable biocatalysts and broaden the understanding of protein structure-function.",

In particular, there is a need to accurately measure atmospheric carbon dioxide levels at regular intervals, and at various altitudes and locations, using low cost and simple aerial platforms.  This project will create and demonstrate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that will lift carbon monitoring payloads from the ground to an altitude of 10,000 feet.  The high-availability UAV will be able to perform long endurance missions at low cost.  Phase I developed a concept for operations and defined the fuctional and technical requirements for the UVA and supporting systems.  Phase II will integrate the carbon dioxide and other sensors into the selected air vehicle platform.  The air vehicle will be tested under human pilot control, radio control, and finally, fully autonomous mode flight.  The performance of the instruments will be evaluated, and the efficiency of the measurements system will be validated.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The primary application of the UAV would be for stand-off monitoring of environmental parameters such as the atmospheric distribution of key gases, aerosols, radiation studies, global albedo, etc.  In addition, the UAVs could be used for radiological, biological, and chemical threat monitoring for military and homeland security applications.  Lastly, the UAVs could serve as communications nodes for emergency situations, and could be used to monitor wildfires, crops, weather, and traffic.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to overcome barriers to the effective use of The Geometer's Sketchpad software in elementary and middle school math classes, and to deliver on the software's potential for transforming education at these levels.  This research-based educational technology tool and its \"Dynamic Geometry\" interaction paradigm are well known at the secondary and higher level for their ability to foster visualization and exploration in mathematics and to enhance student learning.  This project responds to clear calls for the software's application and adaptation to younger grades coming from teachers, from curriculum development and research communities, and from standards bodies such as the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM).  The proposed research, led by the team that created and maintains Sketchpad, first identifies and prototypes modifications to the software to add scope and age-relevant functionality and to remove barriers to access for young learners; and second pioneers new classroom activities-structures, materials, and vehicles-for supporting and extending standards-based curricula in grades 3-8 through the agency of Dynamic Geometry technology.  The intellectual merit of the proposed activity reflects (a) the degree to which the activity responds to perceived pedagogic need (as cited, e. g., in the NCTM Principles and Standards 2000) for Dynamic Geometry technology at the elementary and middle school level; (b) the opportunity to extend the broad base and literature of research that exists on Dynamic Geometry at the secondary level to significantly earlier grade levels (particularly with respect to effective Dynamic Geometry activity design and Dynamic Geometry impact on student affect and cognition in the early grades); and (c) the resources this proposal brings to the question of how best to integrate effective, standards-based curriculum (in this case, the Connected Mathematics Project, Everyday Mathematics, and Math Workshop curricular programs) with effective, standards-based technology.  The project brings together research experience in both curricular and software design; project staff includes Sketchpad's authors and project consultants include the author teams of each of the named curricula.  The broader impact of this project reaching its objectives will be the creation and availability, in primary and middle grades, of age-appropriate Dynamic Geometry mathematics education technologies and supporting curriculum similar to those which define Sketchpad at the secondary level, where the software is considered the \"most valuable software for students\" (Becker, 1999) by mathematics teachers across the country; and of research-driven solutions to the challenge of supporting standards-based curricula effectively with educational technology.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): When teachers have the comfort, confidence and skills to implement Keepin' It R.E.A.L (KIR), an evidence-based, 10-session drug resistance curriculum, they are more likely to implement with fidelity, therefore increasing the chances of positive student outcomes. However, the reality is that time, travel and cost barriers prevent most teachers from receiving face-to-face skills-based curriculum training and the practice that instructional mastery requires. Training delivered via the World Wide Web or CD-ROM, eliminates the time, travel cost and practice barriers to effective curriculum training. Many current online educator trainings are limited in their effectiveness to teaching knowledge, but not instructional skills, while skills are necessary for effective curriculum implementation. Through innovative development of online training for instructional skill acquisition is the opportunity for high quality modeling, skill discrimination, and practice. Further, training sections can be repeated, even during curriculum implementation. This project will develop Teachin' it REAL (TIR), a skill-based online training to prepare middle school teachers to implement KIR with comfort, confidence, skill and fidelity. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the online training to prepare teachers to lead KIR with fidelity. Teachers (225) from throughout California will be randomly assigned to one of three experimental training conditions: 1) online training, 2) one-day training, and 3) no training. Teacher comfort, confidence, skill and fidelity while implementing KIR will be measured. Phase I found that teachers and administrators had interest in online training, (specifically CD-ROM) and schools had the technology needed. A prototype was developed to prepare teachers to lead a key activity using one of the essential educator skills to effectively lead the curriculum. A national sample of teachers found the prototype useful and effective. Phase I demonstrated that online teacher training for KIR was technologically, instructionally, and commercially feasible. We expect the teachers in the online training condition to implement KIR with greater fidelity than the one-day and no training teachers. We also expect that teachers will enjoy participating in the training and perceive it as effective. In Phase III, TIR will be marketed to schools and after-school programs using direct catalog mailers, websites and listserves, exhibits at conferences, evidence-based program lists, and white papers.",

        "abstract": "The state of affairs facing engineers and scientist attempting to treat low level contaminated water using current technologies results in the selection of a process that has significant shortcomings.  A technically superior, yet operationally simpler treatment process within a reduced cost bracket is needed to assist industries in meeting ever changing environmental regulations.  One of KenGro\u00bfs goals is to provide kenaf-based products as an effective biobased alternative for treating contaminated aqueous streams.    The envisioned process involved the loading of a vertical contact tank to be packed with chopped kenaf.  Contaminated water will be passed through the column and contaminants will adsorb onto kenaf fibers.  This adsorption step will be operated much like an activated carbon column.  The results of the Phase I SBIR provided a strong basis to continue efforts for commercialization of a kenaf-based biosorptive process for use in water treatment.  Once the kenaf becomes spent, the fibers will be removed and place into a compost bed.  The compost bed will be used to reduce the volume of the kenaf mass (the adsorbent) while concentrating the heavy metals and degrading the adsorbed biodegradable contaminants (adsorbates) via biotreatment.  The envisioned compost units are easy to operate and fit nicely into a rural industry\u00bfs capability due to realistic footprint and low-tech training requirements.                                                                                  The main objective of Phase I SBIR was the development of key performance inform-ation on the use of Kenaf for its ability to remove diesel fuel, zinc, and lead from aqueous solution.  This was performed via preparation of adsorption isotherms for the three water contaminants using three processed forms of kenaf (stalk, core, and bast).  The effect of pre-washing and/or pre-oxidizing the kenaf on the adsorption isotherms was evaluated for zinc and lead.  The loadings show that kenaf fibers do have an adsorption affinity for both inorganic and organic adsorbates.  Ozonation and washing appeared to provide some benefit but differences in the value of this processing step were quite dramatic indicating a need for more development of this novel approach.  Another objective of Phase I was to evaluate the rate of compost degradation and track the fate of a pollutant during this degradation process.  Composting of kenaf fibers were found to be a relatively straight-forward process with relatively high mass-degradation rates observed.                            The objective of the proposed Phase II SBIR  proposal are to: (1) Study the effect of numerous washing techniques on adsorption capacity, (2) Closer evaluation of the surface benefits of surface oxidation on kenaf adsorption capacity, (3) Evaluate the impact of product storage on the kenaf product toward lead, methylisoborneol (MIB), toluene, ethylbenzene, and o-xylene. (4) Evaluate kenaf for adsorption of additional pollutant classes, (5) Examine competitive adsorption of key contaminant classes, (6) Optimized the rate of degradation observed within the composters and evaluate the impact of high levels of heavy metals on the observed compost rate.  (7) Set-up a pilot system that fully mimics the envisioned full-scale  system to be commercialized, and (8) Record the results of the Phase 2 effort within the form of a detailed project report.  A common method to be used to conduct all necessary experimental tasks is the generation of adsorpti9on isotherm data.  Chemical analyses and reactor configuration will be performed using duplicate experimentation.  Analytical techniques to be employed will be those approved by the USEPA and/or published peer reviewed standard techniques.                                   It is expected that the successful implementation of the proposed Phase II SBIR will yield the necessary information to determine the efficiency and commercialization potential of kenaf as a bioadsorbent for treating organic and inorganic contaminated waters,",

        "abstract": "Hybrid striped bass (HSB) aquaculture has become the fourth largest form of U.S. finfish production, trailing only catfish, trout, and salmon in market value. To compete effectively with low-cost foreign imports, U.S. HSB producers need to develop advanced strains that grow more rapidly and convert feed more efficiently. However, HSB are produced from two parental species (white bass and striped bass) that have little overlap in their seasonal reproductive cycles. Producers and government and university scientists recently formed the National Breeding Program for the HSB Industry, a collaborative effort to facilitate development of superior strains. To take advantage of the new strains, methods of reliable storage and distribution of broodstock gametes are needed. Advanced cryopreservation techniques may be of considerable use in the management of striped bass broodstock. The purpose of this research is to develop efficient, large-scale sperm cryopreservation and storage technologies for use in the HSB industry. The large-scale techniques we propose to develop are similar to those used in the dairy industry, where sperm cryopreservation has become an indispensable component in breeding and genetic improvement and has created an entirely new commercial industry.",

        "abstract": "76092B  Novel, cost-effective technologies are needed to stabilize and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Microalgae have been shown to be able to fix carbon dioxide (CO2) at high rates, producing a biomass that can be converted to biofuels and chemicals to replace fossil fuels.  However, additional research is needed to increase the efficiency of CO2 fixation and develop the techniques for managing algal cultures in large-scale applications.  This project will develop large-scale microalgae-based carbon sequestration technologies using power plant flue gases for CO2 and agricultural wastewaters as nutrient sources.  The algal biomass harvested from the mass culture ponds will be converted to methane fuel, a substitute for fossil fuels, with the residues used as fertilizers.   Phase I cultured several strains of microalgae that showed high capacity for CO2 fixation.  Preliminary experiments were conducted to determine the optimal conditions for producing rapid and consistent blooms of microalgae using nutrient-rich agricultural wastewaters.  Techniques were identified for concentrating the algal biomass harvested from the ponds and digesting it to produce methane gas.  In Phase II, experiments will be conducted to determine the optimal temperature, light, nutrient, water depth, and water velocity conditions for stimulating microalgae growth in the high-rate pond systems.  An innovative sedimentation belt concept will be evaluated as a cost-effective means for concentrating and harvesting the algal biomass.  Optimal techniques for converting the harvested algal biomass to biofuels (methane gas) and biofertilizers will be developed.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A carbon sequestration process that results in the production of biofuels and fertilizers should provide sufficient revenues to allow the abatement of greenhouse gas emissions to be accomplished.  A potential commercial application of this technology is the removal of nutrients from agricultural drainage waters to prevent pollution of the receiving waters.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the entire U.S. hospital healthcare system, four of the top ten most expensive conditions requiring hospitalization are related to the care of infants. One of these four is \"lack of oxygen in utero\" (birth asphyxia), which requires an average stay of almost 13 days at a cost of nearly $40,000. Fetal heart rate monitoring is intended to detect signs of fetal distress due to oxygen starvation of the fetus. Unfortunately these methods of fetal monitoring are subject to a high incidence of false positives, resulting in more than 200,000 unnecessary cesarean section deliveries in the U.S. each year with an associated cost of over $1 billion per year. Clinicians have long recognized that direct measurement of fetal oxygen status would provide a more definitive indication of fetal well-being. This requires the use of pulse oximetry, the continuous, noninvasive measurement of oxygen saturation in arterial blood.  Intrapartum fetal pulse oximetry has only recently been made available as a commercial product, but with severely limited success. Kestrel Labs, Inc. is developing a fetal pulse oximetry sensor for continuous measurement of fetal oxygen status and heart rate from a single, easily accessible monitoring site located on the fetal scalp. Unlike current sensor technology, which uses a \"blind\" insertion method, has no means for securing the sensor to the fetus, and requires repositioning nearly 4 times an hour, the Kestrel Labs fetal oximetry sensor will be easy to insert, securely attach to the fetal scalp, and will require no maintenance once placed.   This SBIR Phase II effort focuses on the development and calibration of a pre-production, biocompatible version of the sensor that has an integral \"deployment\" apparatus for transvaginal insertion onto the fetal scalp.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The electroencephalogram (EEG) electrode is a critical component for diagnosing and understanding neurological phenomenon. Electrode placement on the scalp is currently problematic, time consuming, and labor intensive. In partnership with Baltimore Biomedical, Inc., a novel self-installed electrode technology was developed and patented as part of a prior NIH SBIR program and uses hair to anchor the electrode near the scalp. Based on this prior art, Key Technologies, Inc. has conceived and developed an electrode placement system specifically to support studies in multi-electrode environments (such as EEG laboratories, sleep centers, and growing markets such as ambulatory monitoring, gaming, and critical care). The new system consists of a disposable electrode and a reusable installation tool. This system has been proven through a now complete Phase I NIH SBIR. Analytical and qualitative analyses have shown system performance to be equal to the gold cup standard in signal shape, amplitude, spectral power density, and artifact density. This design uniquely provides the ability for quick placement of multiple electrodes via a single, hand-held installation tool without the need for messy adhesives or excess electrolyte. The small size, high comfort level, and quick placement attributes make the system ideal for critical care, EEG, anesthetics, and extended monitoring in which multiple electrodes are required. Unlike the current industry standard, the electrode will be disposable, a desirable attribute with the current concern to control the spread of communicable diseases. The project goals, through Phase III, are to design, prototype, validate, market, manufacture, and commercialize this novel electrode system. To date, preliminary prototype designs have been completed and validated through Phase I clinical trials. Phase II will focus on the following tasks: refinement of the mechanical design, development of a custom electrolyte to enhance long term performance, advancement of the tool design to incorporate multiple electrodes, and thorough clinical trials to prove performance across a broad demographic spectrum.",

Many stroke survivors have significant limitations of upper extremity function which have an impact on many important activities such as eating, dressing and personal care. Studies show that to be effective in increasing functional independence, therapy must involve active participation of the patient and repetitive training. However, costs often limit the number of patients that receive this type of therapy. Robotic therapy offers a means of transferring some of this essential, but time consuming, therapy into the home. Phase I of this program demonstrated through laboratory testing and pilot clinical trials the feasibility of this innovative air muscle driven interactive device to provide effective and cost effective therapy. The primary aim of the proposed study is to determine in a randomized, controlled, single blind parallel clinical trial whether the use of this innovative biofeedback technology of Active Repetitive Motion (ARM) therapy in a home environment will increase function and improve the cognitive, emotional, and physical health of people with stroke and in this potentially cost effective manner. One hundred sub-acute (3 to 9 mos post stroke) patients will be randomized to a group that is trained on ARM device therapy and utilize it at home for 3 months or to a group with no ARM therapy. Both groups will receive usual and customary care. Clinical motor function and quality of life measures will compare the groups before intervention, immediatley after, and 3 months later. A subset will be evaluated 1 year later. We hypothesize that the ARM therapy group will improve more than the other group. Time spent using the device and the amount of usual and customary care received by each patient will be recorded, statistically analyzed and comparisons made. The results will provide valuable data on the ability of monitored home therapy to provide effective treatment.

Applications of this technology include embedded routes on maps, electronic medical records, biological atlases, digital tours of 3D environments such as buildings, and mechanical assembly/disassembly diagrams. Analogous to a PDF file, but designed for a 3D interaction environment, the proposed solution defines an open, portable schema that can be efficiently represented using the portable Extensible Markup Language XML.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research(SBIR) Phase II project aims to  commercialize lightweight, flexible, affordable solar cells and modules that efficiently generate electricity from sunlight or indoor room light. These cells are based on dye-sensitized titania which is coated on a flexible substrate at high speed in a continuous coating, laminating process. The overall objective of Phase II is to raise the cell efficiency from its current 7% to 10% or higher, thereby raising the module efficiency from 5% to over 8%.  To accomplish this, the ability of the sensitizing dyes to harvest a much larger number of available photons and convert them into electrons must be increased.  In Phase I of this program, a new class of sensitizing dyes that cover a larger portion of the solar spectrum, have larger absorptivity than the currently used ruthenium-based dyes was discovered. In addition, materials that have similar molecular structures to those of the new sensitizing dyes,  and act as  co-sensitizers by boosting  electron injection from the dye to the titania, are co-adsorbed with the dyes on the surface of the titania.  It is anticipated that the combination of these materials  will bring the cell and modules performance to the desired level. Commercially, the  project  will  result  in  an  inexpensive,  efficient,  flexible  photovoltaic (PV) technology  that  can be  integrated into  consumer products.  Therefore a renewable source of energy could be used to power products, minimizing the battery capacity and disposal requirements, and ultimately  delivering  power  to  building  structures,  avoiding  emissions associated with fossil fuels.    Security is a broad benefit on two levels.  First, grid instability demonstrated by widespread blackouts in 2003 emphasizes the need for distributed power in our national grid.  Secondly, growing homeland security concerns underscore the importance of wireless networks of sensors, cameras, and other monitoring systems for building and border security.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The long-term goal of this project is to develop and commercialize a novel cone beam volume computed tomography breast imaging (CBVCTBI) scanner to provide clinically useful three-dimensional (3D) high-resolution tomographic images for breast cancer detection. The CBVCTBI scanner will require only a single fast volume scanning (5-10 seconds) to provide a true 3D description of breast anatomy with 2.0 - 5.0 Ip/mm isotropic resolution and will provide adequate low contrast resolution and high contrast spatial resolution for early breast cancer detection. The clinical significance of CBVCTBI is that it will significantly improve the sensitivity of breast cancer detection due to its much better low contrast resolution, compared to conventional mammography. In addition, CBVCTBI with its high-resolution volume of interest (VOI) reconstruction mode for target imaging, will also better characterize breast tumors three-dimensionally, while conventional mammography does not provide 3D information of breast cancer. The CBVCTBI clinical prototype scanner will be designed and constructed based on a flat panel detector (FPD) and cone beam tomographic acquisition geometry. This is a Fast Track R43-R44 combined project. Specific aims of the R43 project include: 1) Implement and evaluate a half scan cone beam reconstruction algorithm, 2) Complete the conceptual design of the CBVCTBI scanner including gantry and table, and 3) Finalize the selection of the automation company who will complete a virtual CBVCTBI gantry and table, and manufacture the gantry and table.",

(Kl) proposes to develop a wearable ostomy appliance device with a novel built-in polymer-thick-film (PTF) sensor system that alerts the ostomy user of potential leakage problems due to seal undermining and meltdown. The ability to identify leakage problems due to an ineffective seal could reduce peristomal skin breakdown. Over 1 million ostomy surgeries are performed each year. Patients undergoing ostomy surgery need intensive physical and emotional care to return to a normal life. The pressing need to provide effective skin barriers for colostomy, ileostomy and urostomy patients, achieving an effective appliance seal is critical to physical and emotional well-being as well as functional abilities of an individual with ostomies. Key factors of skin problems, skin contour, stoma construction problems and pouch leakage lead to increased supply usage, increased costs, increased hospitalizations, medical care, home health visits, and surgery revision. An ineffective seal leads to a cycle of misery for the ostomy patient. Leakage causes skin breakdown, which causes further leakage, thus perpetuating the cycle. The proposed Phase II project will focus on the development of a 10.0 mil electrochemical sensor array that can be fabricated with \"sensor-on-tape\" manufacturing, offering a low-cost disposable product that features a lightweight conformal fit. The body-worn ostomy appliance adapts to body contour changes, which promotes patient self-care and wellness. The smart seal device incorporates an innovative bio-alerting function to inform the ostomy patient of potential leakage to take corrective action.",

        "abstract": "75396B  Reactive distilation is a new technology for the chemical and petroleum industries, which can lower energy consumption, improve the yields of reactions, enhance production of desired products, and reduce manufacturing costs.  This project will develop a novel reactive distillation technology, along with improved catalysts, for an important chemical intermediate, vinyl ether.  In Phase I, new catalysts were developed specifically for reactive distillation, laboratory performance data were generated to demonstrate process feasibility, and process simulations and economic studies showed the competitive advantage of the new reactive distillation technology.  The results showed that for the manufacture of polyvinyl alcohols, a multi-billion dollar market, energy consumption was cut in half compared to traditional technology.  Phase II will complete the development of the new catalysts; evaluate the performance of these catalysts in bench scale laboratory systems; conduct reactive distillation simulations, design, and cost analyses; and will prove commercial operability in an integrated, large scale pilot plant.  Production of polyvinyl alcohol that meets commercial specifications will be demonstrated.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new reactive distillation technology should result in immediate benefits in the manufacture of an important set of chemical intermediate, vinyl ethers.  The total manufacturing cost of this new technology is forecasted to be is as low as the raw materials cost alone for conventional manufacturing technology.   Reactive distillation thus would be shown to be a viable technology for the production of other chemical products.",

Several challenges confront current anti-HIV chemotherapy. The frequency of drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant HIV-1 is increasing. Toxicities associated with current HIV medications often result in the discontinuation of these therapies. Physicians are often left with few anti-HIV drugs to prescribe once resistance and/or toxicities develop in patients. Potent drugs with novel mechanisms of action, activity against resistant HIV, and with reduced toxicity are needed. KPC-2 is an anti-HIV compound with a mechanism of action distinct from existing HIV therapies. In vitro studies indicate that it has potent activity against HIV including activity against drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant HIV. The purpose of this Phase II SBIR application is to further develop KPC-2 by completing key preclinical studies. The specific aims of this project include the evaluation KPC-2 activity in an HIV SCID mouse model, the scale-up synthesis of KPC-2, determination of KPC-2 plasma protein binding in human and animal plasma, in vitro metabolism studies of KPC-2, development of a stability-indicating HPLC assay, completion of stability studies, and the completion of pharmacology and toxicology studies of KPC-2 in rats and monkeys. The successful completion of these proposed studies should enable the Kucera Pharmaceutical Company to quickly move the development of this novel compound into human clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New methods for easy, rapid enzymatic assays in very small (sub-microliter) sample volumes will greatly benefit the prognosis, diagnosis, and detection of cancer, in that many cancer markers are enzymes.  Currently, the blood sample must be transported to a clinical laboratory for assay, requiring enzyme storage stability, a problem for some enzymes including prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP). Although assay of prostatic specific antigen has largely replaced PAP for initial diagnosis, PAP is still used for staging, and can be used in the developing world for point-of-care diagnosis by unskilled personnel with the proposed technique. Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of adapting silicon microsampling and assay devices, originally developed for diabetic blood glucose monitoring, to enzyme activity measurement, using PAP as the example enzyme. This work is significant because the novel technique employed, diffusive enzyme activity measurement, is a general method adaptable to assaying a wide range of medically important enzymes. Phase II will develop a complete system for PAP assay and will perform simulations to assess its extension to other enzymes having different kinetic constants. The product emerging from this work will be a hand-held instrument capable of accepting single-use disposables to measure the enzymatic activity of PAP. The disposable has a silicon microneedle chip that draws the very small sample easily and reliably, and performs an on-chip assay without further liquid transfer. This system has no on-chip biologicals, and thus can be stored for long periods at ambient temperature.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in a novel question-answering technology.  The features of this technology are as follows:  (1) Automatic filtering of questions.  During Phase I, Language Computer Corporation (LCC) developed a system that decomposes high-level questions into low-level, fact-seeking questions.  Some of these questions, however, turn out to be nonsensical.  In Phase II, the firm proposes to submit all of the decomposed questions to a knowledge-based system, which will eliminate questions that are inconsistent with tacit knowledge.  All of the questions that survive filtering will be passed back for processing by the question-answering system.  (2) Aligning domain ontologies with a large reference ontology.  During Phase I, LCC developed a tool that generates domain ontologies from raw text.  During Phase II, the firm will extend this tool so that the domain ontologies are automatically aligned with an overarching domain-independent ontology.  This alignment will permit deeper expansion of query concepts, because it will allow domain-independent concepts to be augmented with domain-dependent content.  (3) Formal evaluation of semantic relations.  The foundation of the question-answering system is semantic relations extracted from queries and documents.  These relations will be evaluated to assess the relative contribution of each one to question answering.  The result of this evaluation will establish which aspects of semantics are most useful to question- answering. This project will have a direct impact in the following areas:  (1) The system can be deployed in commercial and government settings where the accuracy, coverage, reliability, and usability of the retrieved information are crucial.  Ideal applications for the technology include homeland defense, CRM, education, medicine, and the law.  (2) The system bridges the gap between domain-independent and domain-specific content.  Domain ontologies are constructed automatically, and these ontologies are automatically aligned with a large reference ontology, so that queries can be simultaneously expanded into the terms appropriate to many different domains.",

The focus of this project will be to develop a miniature, low-cost, ventricular assist device, suitable for use for univentricular or biventricular support, for use as a bridge to recovery, transplant or a longer term implantable device. The specific design will feature a novel magnetically levitated configuration, whose key features allow rapid acceleration and deceleration in response to prescribed motor input power cycles. The major advantages of the current design are its small and relatively simple design, its ability to efficiently regulate pump output over a large range of flow conditions, and its ease of production. This program's overall goal will be to develop and optimize the design and construction of the magnetically levitated, centrifugal pump, and ascertain its physiological performance in vitro and in vivo. During Phase I of this project, in collaboration with the Texas Heart Institute, we demonstrated the soundness of this technology for both the adult and pediatric applications through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. In Phase II we intend to complete the design and validation of the product, and to launch device readiness testing in anticipation of clinical trials. The specific aims of this Phase II proposal are to: 1) Design and optimize the critical functional attributes of the pump system to meet cardiac support requirements. 2) Develop improved cannulae for ventricular assist device insertion. 3) Refine the design of the controller to operate over a broad range of pediatric and adult operating conditions, and to incorporate system alarms for fail-safe operation. 4) Conduct reliability testing of the controllers, motors and pumps to establish system confidence levels. 5) Demonstrate hemodynamic performance and biocompatibility for the proposed long-term VAD in an animal model. We believe that our technology, which provides effective ventricular assistance with a small, disposable device, may provide needed benefits to the health of a broad range of patients, while not adding significantly to the cost of caring for these patients. Achieving the aims proposed in this Phase II program will validate the safety and suitability of this device for evaluation under an IDE clinical trial, which will be carried out in a Phase III program. We project that in Phase III of the project we will meet the regulatory requirements governing an IDE, fabricate verified and validated hardware, establish reliability, and conduct indicated clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The need for new and effective chemotherapeutic agents that selectively target cancer cells and thus, would have a much higher therapeutic index is urgent. Most chemotherapeutic agents damage normal dividing cells which accounts for the majority of the side effects of these drugs. The discovery and development of cancer selective chemotherapy is a principal goal of the National Cancer Institute. During Phase 1, this project we identified symlubricol A, a cancer selective compound isolated from a mushroom. This compound is similar in potency to our positive control, camptothecin. Remarkably, it was also more than 3-fold selective for cancer cell toxicity (ED50 MFC-7/ED50 MCF10A = 3.71) in an assay that doxorubicin was 5-fold selective for proliferating noncancerous cells toxicity (ED50 MFC-7/ED50 MCF10A = 0.16). During Phase 2, we will characterize this compound in 1), cell cycle inhibition studies, 2), in vivo mouse tumor models and 3), the NCI 60 cell line toxicity panel. If the results justify additional development, we will continue this development either through strategic partnerships or in collaboration with the NCI. To discover additional selective and potent anticancer agents, we will continue screening LifePharms' unique and proprietary library of extracts from >13,000 field collected basidiomycetes and ascomycetes (mushrooms) for inhibitors that selectively target the cell cycle events in cancer cells. Natural products have been a particularly good source of compounds that are excellent probes for targets vital to the cell cycle. We propose to screen extracts for toxicity in a panel of three cancerous cell lines, i) MFC-7, ii) NCI-H690 and iii), SF-268. Those extracts with potent activity (IC90 is equal to or less than 20 ug/ml) will be screened against the nontumorigenic cell lines MCF10A, to determine a selectivity quotient. Extracts containing cancer selective compounds will be fractionated and the active compound(s) isolated and identified. The stage at which they block the cell cycle will be identified and lead compounds will be examined further for activity in in vivo antitumor models and NCI 60-cell line panel. By exploiting those differences between proliferating normal and cancer cells, we expect to find additional novel chemical compounds with increased tumor selectivity and reduced toxicity.",

Large-scale consortia and initiatives are underway to understand the structures of newly discovered proteins.  Unfortunately, protein expression and purification are a major bottleneck. Bacteria are usually  the first system of choice for recombinant protein expression. In phase I, LifeSensors proposed the development of a novel SUMO-fusion system to enhance expression and purification of wide variety of proteins in E. coli. The SUMO protein acts as a chaperone to promote enhanced expression as well as solubility of inclusion body proteins. SUMO fusion is also used as a handle for rapid purification of partner proteins. In phase I, a comparative study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the SUMO expression system with other leading fusion technologies. Data showed that the SUMO system was superior to the five leading fusion systems in enhancing expression and solubility of proteins in E. coli. The phase I proposal was centered on the yeast SUMO tag and SUMO protease. In phase II, LifeSensors proposes to build on its success to broaden the scope of SUMO system by identifying new enzymes and rigorously testing the system with difficuIt-to-express proteins. Since the insect cell system has developed as a model for eukaryotic expression, it is proposed in Phase II to develop and market a SUMO system for insect cells. Development of a system that enhances expression of proteins and offers rapid purification tools at the genomic level will greatly aid post-genomic expression and protein array technologies.",

Untreated, the virus slowly destroys the immune system, leading to significant morbidity and virtually 100% mortality within two to twenty years after initial infection. Fortunately, recent advances in antiretroviral therapy have allowed for almost complete inhibition of viral replication in infected individuals. Unfortunately, the ability of the virus to rapidly mutate and become resistant to treatments necessitates the administration of multiple medications, using complex dosing schedules, in order to maintain viral suppression. Although adherence to these complicated treatment regimens is paramount, even the most vigilant persons have difficulty maintaining these protocols for extended periods of time. The purpose of this project is to retool and test a computerized pillbox that will allow convenient storage and transport of antiretroviral medications for persons infected with HIV. The device is designed to further aid adherence by incorporating reminding signals at dosing times and usage reporting functions. The device was tested in Phase I and demonstrated highly positive usability ratings and significant association with increased medication taking timing compliance (as observed via pill lid openings). Modifications that were suggested in the first test will be implemented, and the beta unit will be tested in focus groups before production units are built and beta tested.  When finalized, the device and its infrastructure will be tested in a study population of HIV patients in order to determine its effectiveness, usability, and validity in increasing medication compliance.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Medical Need: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the etiologic agent of acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (AIDS), continues to infect millions of people worldwide. Despite recent improvements in patient outcomes resulting from highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), there remains an urgent need for novel and improved methods of treatment for individuals living with AIDS. This need arises from limitations of existing treatment options, such as emergence of resistant viruses and adverse side effects. Viral entry into the host cell proceeds via formation of a gp41 six-helical coiled coil, which is the final step of HIV-1 membrane fusion and infection of the host cell. Due to the need for additional therapeutic modalities that are safe and well tolerated, inhibition of HIV-1 gp41 function is an innovative new treatment modality. Enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) is a safe and effective peptide inhibitor of gp41 function recently approved by the FDA for treating HIV-1 infection. However, manufacturing, cost and dosing difficulties limit the use of Fuzeon to a small portion of the HIV-1 infected population. A small molecule drug acting on HIV-1 gp41 that could be administered by oral dosing would constitute a significant advancement in the treatment of AIDS. Goal of Research: Using its innovative computational methodology, Locus Pharmaceuticals identified two chemical classes of small molecule HIV gp41 inhibitory compounds. Further improvement of these molecules as drug candidates requires the input of co-crystal structures as a basis for computational design. With the aid of a Phase I SBIR grant, Locus demonstrated the feasibility of generating such co-crystal structures. The focus of this proposal is to solve co-crystal structures of the compounds in complex with gp41 in order to enable computational and structure-based design. These structures will then be used as input for further computational design and optimization of gp41 inhibitory small molecules. The ultimate goal of this research is the identification of drug candidate small molecule gp41 inhibitory compounds for the treatment of AIDS caused by HIV-1 infection. Specific Aims: Obtain a co-crystal structure of a functionally relevant HIV-1 gp41 HR-1 domain in complex with a bound small molecule compound that inhibits gp41 function. Using these new co-crystal structures, apply computational and structure-based methods to design then chemical synthesis to generate additional small molecule gp41 inhibitors with improved potency.",

Significant effort has been expended to develop biological markers (diagnostics) for monitoring levels and/or recency of alcohol use (state markers) and markers for predisposition to alcohol dependence (trait, \"etiologic\", markers). However, this area of research has not yet generated unequivocal tools to be used by treatment and prevention specialists and others interested in such information.      A new era in science emerged with the detailed knowledge of the human genome and the human proteome is now being defined. The power of proteomic techniques and informatics technology is ready to be applied to the search for better (more reliable) diagnostic tools for hazardous alcohol use and alcoholism. Lohocla Research Corporation has access to biological samples (plasma, serum and platelets) from over 1,000 individuals who are well characterized with regards to drinking habits, medical/psychiatric disorders, family history of medical/psychiatric disorders, drug use, etc. Lohocla will partner with Eprogen, the developers of the ProteoSep TM proteomic technology, to discover and test a novel panel of diagnostics for alcohol use,  abuse and alcoholism.      Phase I studies, will test the feasibility of using ProteoSep TM technology to identify and quantitate proteins already known to be altered by alcohol intake/alcoholism and to identify novel candidate markers. We will establish proteomic methodology (ProteoSep TM) to accurately measure currently used state markers for excessive alcohol ingestion (GGT, AST and CDT) in plasma and serum samples and develop a measurement, with ProteoSep TM technology, of MAO-B protein in platelet samples. A panel of bioinformatic/statistical tools will be applied to search for new markers.      If we are able to successfully measure the levels of proteins such as GGT, AST, CDT and MAO, these proteins will form \"internal standards\" against which other novel marker proteins can be tested in Phase II. Phase I studies will also provide the initial panel of candidate markers to be assessed in a significantly greater number of subjects in Phase ll.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The identification of signaling components that promote tumor growth is a critical step in discovering therapeutic interventions that reduce the morbidity, and mortality associated with cancer.  Research has recently validated sphingosine kinase (SK) as an oncogenic protein, suggesting that it is a novel therapeutic target. This kinase produces an extracellular sphingolipid signaling molecule, sphingosine-1 -phosphate (S1P), which promotes tumor growth. Tumor growth is promoted both directly and indirectly by S1P's growth factor actions related to tumor cell proliferation, metastasis and protection from cell death, as well as S1P's pro-angiogenic effects. We have produced a monoclonal anti-S1P antibody (anti-S1P mAb) that could be used as a therapeutic molecular sponge to selectively neutralize S1P, thus lowering the effective extracellular concentrations of this growth factor. In Phase I, we demonstrated that the anti-S1P mAb was able to neutralize the effects of S1P on tumor cell proliferation, protection from cell death and invasiveness in vitro using several cancer cell lines representing multiple cancer types. In vivo the anti-S1P mAb was able to potently inhibit tumor angiogenesis and reduce tumor growth in three orthotopic murine models of human cancer. This Phase I effort not only validated S1P as a therapeutic target, but also suggested that the anti-S1P mAb may be useful clinically in reducing cancer progression by neutralizing S1P's proliferative, metastatic, anti-apoptotic and pro-angiogenic effects.  Successful completion of the Phase I project, positions us for a Phase II project designed to conduct more in depth pre-clinical studies necessary for IND filing with the FDA. Studies are aimed to further characterize the antibody in terms of anti-cancer efficacy, evaluate potential therapeutic regimens, perform safety studies in mice and develop a theranostic platform. The Company is currently perusing humanization of the antibody which will be completed during the year of funding. In Phase II, we propose to characterize the strength and nature of the binding of the humanized antibody to S1P to determine the minimum binding characteristic necessary to achieve efficacy in humans. The company will also support    funding for the necessary GLP qualified safety evaluation of the antibody in monkeys as well as GMP manufacturing and quality control as required for IND filing. The ultimate goal of the Phase II research is to position the Company for an IND with the FDA so that a humanized anti-S1P mAb can be taken to Phase I Clinical Trials. In consultation with our collaborators at MD Anderson Cancer Center, we have designed a Phase I Clinical Trial to be performed at MD Anderson Cancer Center. The Phase I study will be a multiple disease cancer trial with inclusion criteria that could allow us to observe efficacy of the antibody treatment. These inclusion criteria will rely on the use of the anti-S1P mAb in an in vitro assay for S1P levels in patient serum samples to access who might show favorable delay in disease progression with an anti-S1P mAb treatment.",

The software tool described in this proposal will allow organizations to schedule their operations in real-time to generate the optimal plan to maximizing their operational targets. During Phase I, the team created new planning and scheduling algorithms and successful empirical studies using recent innovative research in the areas of large-scale optimization and the newly developed methodology of Nested Partitions. In Phase II the team plan to further develop the concept to create successful implementations in several manufacturing firms. The technology to be developed in Phase II will greatly enhance the capability of the current planning and scheduling software tools. This innovation brings the state-of-the-art decision and optimization methodology to the Advanced Planning and Scheduling software market. In addition, planning systems developed with the proposed methodology will add new levels of flexibility for companies to more quickly adapt to changing material, operational, and market conditions. This SBIR project will make new planning and scheduling tools broadly accessible to virtually any manufacturing firm. The proposed scheduling and planning tools will enable them to communicate, collaborate, and integrate their planning and scheduling functionalities to obtain optimal results throughout their enterprise and their entire supply chain. It is expected that coordinated use of these tools will eventually create an integrated cyber-infrastructure for American manufacturing firms and create more efficient supply chains that will enable these firms to be more competitive in the global marketplace. Moreover, if successful, the development of this proposed tool will lead to fruitful attempts to develop and commercialize an advanced planning and scheduling software tools that can be used for many other sectors of the economy.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Large insert DMA libraries are essential resources for the molecular analysis of the human genome and other genomes important to our well-being. The identification of susceptibility genes for complex disorders is critically dependent on a complete and accurate sequence assembly. Comparative genomics reveals new information about metabolic pathways, cancer, horizontal gene transfer, evolution, protein families, and the genetic repertoire of numerous species. It has also increased the demand for additional genomic BAG libraries. The construction of this type of genetic resource is time consuming, costly and challenging. Numerous gaps in the human genome are difficult or impossible to close with current vector, host systems. The goal of the proposed work is the development of new BAG cloning tools, strains and methods that circumvent traditional bottlenecks and substantially improve the fidelity of molecular cloning and transformation efficiency of high molecular weight DMA. Under Phase I, a simple method for randomly shearing high molecular weight DMA and a copy number inducible transcription-free vector that eliminates several forms of cloning bias was developed. Multiple examples of difficult to clone genomes are shown to be stable in the new transcription free BAG vector. The proposed Phase II work will extend the development of the BAG vector to include additional improvements in functionality and host range, which will allow for the expression of antimicrobial small molecules in numerous gram negative microorganisms. The development of a new E. coli transformation system to significantly improve large DNA uptake and increase average insert size will impact numerous aspects of molecular medicine. A long-term objective of this proposal is to access clone gaps in the human genome and compress the rate of constructing large BAG libraries from months to a few weeks. The quality of these libraries will surpass the current standards for bias, randomness, fidelity, and contamination.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a generator to produce pure radium-223 for use in cancer therapy.  The alpha-emitter Ra-223 has a longer half-life than the other alpha-emitting radioisotopes (213 Bi, 212Bi and 211At) that are currently being evaluated for use in radio-immunotherapy (RIT), and has been shown to have higher bone uptake than the commercially available beta-active bone seekers.  This makes it very attractive for Ra-223 to be developed further for radiopharmaceutical applications and for use as a pain palliation agent.  However, the research and clinical application of this isotope are hindered by the limited availability of pure Ra-223.  A simple technique to produce the isotope is a generator where a suitable parent, in this case Ac-227, is immobilized on an ion exchanger column and Ra-223 is eluted when required.  Current separation methods frequently use organic resins, which tend to degrade under ionizing radiation and thus the product may contain impurities.  Prior Phase I work developed new hybrid inorganic/organic ion exchange materials with high affinity for actinium, but low affinity for radium and good resistance against radiation. The Phase II project will optimize the exchanger performance and fabricate a prototype of the Ra-223 generator.  The commercial application of this project will be in the area of cancer therapy.  It is expected that the easy - to - use generator, which poses a smaller radiation hazard to personnel, will be used at medical research centers, radio - pharmacies and hospitals to produce pure radium - 223 to treat patients with bone metastases and other small solid tumors.",

Repair of deteriorated cement based structures is a major problem, and in United States alone repair cost is estimated to be over $100 billion range.  Commercial stuccos are susceptible to cracking under the influenced of repeated fluctuation in temperature particularly in warm regions.  In this regard, modified elastomers from recycled auto tires represent an efficient and low cost material for improving the desirable properties of commercial stucco.  Our disposable land fields accumulate every 4 years an average of 500 million tires from passenger vehicles.  These mountains of tires cause an esthetical catastrophe to the environment, and they are unsafe.  They are a fire hazard, and are also a breading site for the growth of mosquitoes and rodents that are related to different diseases.  MER proposed here an innovative two-in-one approach to addressing both of these problems.  During Phase I, MER developed modified elastomers from waste auto tires (crumb rubber) by surface modifying crumb rubber in a very simple and inexpensive proprietary process.  The treated and functionalized crumb rubber was incorporated in commercially available stucco (20:80 ratio by volume), and samples were molded and tested in accordance with ASTM standards.

These compounds are typically dissolved in Dimethylsulfoxide and stored at -20 degrees C. Upon repeated freeze/thaw cycles of these compounds, upwards of 40-60% of the compounds precipitate out of solution. Because the compounds are stored primarily in 96 and 384 well plates, there are few acceptable methods currently available to redissolve the compounds in solution, making the undissolved compounds virtually unusable. The \"loss\" of these test compounds is a serious problem for several reasons. First, compounds are not available for testing due to their precipitation, inhibiting the discovery of new drugs. Second, significant resources are wasted in testing samples that contain either no compound or much less compound than expected. Third, this waste results in significant financial expense to researchers in lost compounds, missed lead molecules, and time. The goal of this project is solve these problems by developing a high speed, massively parallel sonication system that can be used to drive precipitated compounds stored in each well of a 96, 384, or 1536-well plate back into solution. This sonication system can also be applied to numerous other applications, including the disrupting of bacterial, fungal or mammalian cells, shearing of genomic DNA into cloneable fragments, and low volume mixing, to name a few.

This project will develop an all-in-one infectious diseases chip (IDChip) technology that can rapidly, sensitively, and \"simultaneously\" detect and identify multiple (6-10) blood transmissible diseases. This all-in-one IDChip contains all required reagents, so loading a very small volume from a finger-stick is the only manual involvement required. This disposable IDChip utilizes microfabrication and integrated microfluidic technologies to provide ultrasensitive biochemistry automation in a disc package. The IDChip system is compact, portable, and will help to ensure that the nation's blood supply is free from infectious diseases.  During the Phase I project, we have designed and fabricated a microfluidic based IDChip, constructed a laboratory system, and characterized the system with three targets: Hepatitis B Surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis B Core Antibody (HBcAb), and Hepatitis C Virus Antibody (HCVAb), performed control experiments, and demonstrated the assay capabilities. The proposed IDChip system not only automated a rapid test (< 25 minutes), but also offers excellent sensitivity.",

The ELISA chip utilizes microfluidic technology to automate and simplify the assay process on a small chip platform.  The plastic chip (reagent pre-loaded) will be affordable and ready for use, and will eliminate the need for a network of tubing connected to bulky external reservoirs and pump systems used in current large clinical laboratory systems.  Prior Phase I work successfully  developed the microfluidic chip platform and the reader system, and performed assays with anthrax toxin protective antigen (PA) and Francisella tularensis. The Phase II project will focus on system optimization, integration and panel tests, and will result in a prototype to be refined into a commercial product in Phase III. The commercial application of this project will be in the area of homeland security, for detecting biological warfare agents (BWA) and in managing BWA suspected patients.  The ELISA based biochip has the potential to be used as a rapid testing standard to quickly yield preliminary data in advance of microbiology tests.  The system, with its extreme sensitivity and specificity, also offers commercial opportunities in the field of clinical diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have developed and prevalidated an in vitro screening test for phototoxicity, the Enhanced Phototoxicity Assay in Reconstituted Skin (EPARS), to replace the current standard animal phototoxicity tests. The phototoxic potential of chemicals, cosmetics, dietary supplements and Pharmaceuticals are a major and growing concern in the consumer products industry, but society and the government have demanded decreased use of experimental animals. EPARS is more objective, faster, and less expensive than animal tests. To-date, no alternative phototoxicity test has been validated in the U.S. (via ICCVAM), although the 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake (3T3NRU) assay has been accepted in the E.U. after validation by ECVAM. EPARS is significantly superior to the 3T3NRU viability test because it overcomes several of the 3T3NRU test's limitations. Specifically: (1) EPARS is based upon a differentiated tissue model that closely parallels human skin morphology, instead of a fibroblast monolayer; (2) the tissues are composed of primary human keratinocytes in a 3D culture system, a more relevant model than a mouse tumor cell line; and (3) test substances can be applied directly, avoiding the often problematic solubilization of formulations into culture media. If developed to its full potential, EPARS would be the most accurate assay available to identify potential phototoxic agents in humans. We propose to confirm the reproducibility, sensitivity, specificity and predictability of EPARS by testing an expanded list of known phototoxins and validate the most predictive and accurate tissue viability endpoints identified in Phase I. We will also use human gene microarrays to measure changes in gene expression patterns and identify genes that can be used as predictors for induction of phototoxicity. This Phase II work will supplement and strengthen the foundation of EPARS in preparation for submission to U.S. regulatory agencies as an alternative to animal phototoxicity testing.",

        "abstract": "75125S  The use of reactive distillation for the Fischer-Tropsch process would have significant technical and economic benefits.  Technically, the process would be far simpler than a conventional reactor followed by a hydrocracking unit.  Economically, products produced by a Fischer-Tropsch reactive distillation column could be sent directly to a fuels blending unit, bypassing all intermediate refinery processes and significantly reducing processing costs.  This project will demonstrate the use of Fischer-Tropsch reactive distillation to control the product molecular weight, and in turn, reduce the energy requirements of chain growth reactions.  In Phase I, two reaction systems, isobutylene oligomerization and Fischer-Tropsch, were selected to determine the applicability of reactive distillation for chain growth reactions.  Reactive distillation was found to be effective for both, but its use for the Fischer-Tropsch reaction was found to be of greater significance.  Phase II will collect the engineering data necessary to scale-up and commercialize the concept.  The effort will be divided into five steps:  (1) system design, (2) construction and operation, (3) configuration testing, (4) economic evaluation, and (5) progress reporting.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The Fischer-Tropsch reactive distillation system should benefit refiners, oil and gas producers, engine manufacturers, and government agencies.  Refiners would have ultra-clean, low sulphur fuels added to their blending stocks to aid in meeting new low sulphur fuel requirements.  Oil and gas producers would be able to \"monetize\" wells that were previously considered to be too marginal to be profitable, either due to substandard gas or environmental requirements.  Engine manufacturers would benefit from the compositional consistency of the fuel produced, and Federal and State agencies would benefit from the ability to develop oil and gas wells on government property.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop a diastolic volume limiting apparatus (divola) for treatment of advanced heart disease in humans. This technology is an entirely new method of treatment of heart disease, and may be used in both dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy. The device is simply a plastic sac that is placed inside the left ventricle of a diseased heart, and functions by limiting filling of the ventricle during diastole. The divola protects the left ventricle from the harmful effects of high ventricular pressure during diastole, allowing for reverse remodelling (shrinkage) of a pathologically jenlarged ventricle. The device may be used in patients who would otherwise require a heart transplant or a mechanical circulatory assist device. The device may also be applied to other forms of heart disease, including left ventricular aneurysms, ischemic ventricular septal defects, and (with modification) primary pulmonary hypertension. Initial research efforts in phase I are directed to designing and testing advanced prototypes of the divola for implantation into animals. Geometric measurements will be taken from sheep echocardiograms to establish the parameters for construction of the divola. The process of fabrication of divolas will be established and refined. High speed video analysis will be used to determine ideal folding patterns and pumping action in order to minimize thrombogenicity and maximize durability. Flow visualization studies will be performed to determine the ideal shape and dimensions of the divola. The divola will be tested on a benchtop apparatus to determine durability and hemolysis.  Successful Phase I research will lead to an advance design of the divola suitable for implantation and testing in large animal models of heart failiure in Phase II research. Successful development of this techology would provide a practical and inexpensive method for treatment of advance heart disease as an alternative to heart transplantation or mechanical circulatory assist devices.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    With significant support from the NIH SBIR grant program (5R44HL53168), MC3 has successfully developed an artificial lung, called the BioLung(r). The BioLung(r) design is based on our patented, ultra-low pressure drop artificial lung technology. This device has undergone extensive bench top and animal testing during its development over the past 10 years, and will be manufactured in a commercial form ready to enter the U.S. and European regulatory process by August of 2004. Given the extensive and expensive regulatory process in the U.S., MC3 believes that it is essential to obtain an investigational device exemption (IDE) from the FDA in order to encourage the introduction of the BioLung(r) in the U.S. by way of a license agreement with a medical device distributor. As such, MC3 is proposing a continuation of a SBIR Phase II grant (5R44HL53168-03) to complete the necessary bench-top and animal studies, and quality systems evaluation of the manufacturing process to submit an IDE application. In addition, preparations for the Phase I clinical trial will be undertaken, including recruitment of centers, study protocol development, and medical reimbursement. The commercial potential for BioLung(r) is significant. The immediate market will be as a bridge to transplant. The long-term potential is as a bridge to recovery or as an alternative to transplant for end-stage lung disease. Currently, the number of patients awaiting lung transplantation exceeds 3,800. Of these patients, only about 25% will receive a transplant in the next year due to the scarcity of available donors, infectious complications, and because the patients are not physically strong enough to survive surgery. The BioLung(r) has the potential to increase the number of lung transplant recipients because it will provide a method to stabilize patients awaiting transplantation, and provide an option of support for post transplant, thereby, allowing the appropriate use of marginal organ donors. This type of outcome has been seen in the application of left ventricular assist devices in supporting patients for heart transplantation.",

These missions range from generating propellants to supplying oxygen to crew and habitat.

A new water electrolyzer was developed by MicroCell Technologies that allows pressurized gas to be generated in a lightweight and compact design. In a Phase I SBIR program, we demonstrated the feasibility of the electrolyzer to generate pressurized oxygen and hydrogen gas in a compact and lightweight electrolyzer design that can operate in a passive mode without requiring water pumps. Based on these results, we propose to scale the process in a Phase II program to a rate of 0.5 kg O2/hr in a device with a mass of 1000 g and a volume of 300 cc. This translates into high power densities of 6 kW/kg and 18 kW/liter, competitive metrics for an electrolyzer that can also generate high pressure to 2000 psi in a passive balance of plant approach.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this project is to reduce the cost, complete government regulatory compliance tests, obtain FDA classification, and establish FDA quality system standards for producing a new and innovative assistive technology (AT) that permits individuals, who otherwise cannot feed themselves, to do so without assistance from another person after they are provided with food. The lack of ability to self-feed currently affects many thousands of people in the United States, alone. A more normalized mealtime environment and many of the other known psychological benefits associated with greater independence, such as improved dignity and self-esteem, result from the ability to self-feed. Over the last 25 to 30 years there have been a variety of technologies studied and devices constructed in an attempt to ameliorate this problem. At this time, only three devices are on the market, worldwide, and they can only serve the needs of a very small percentage of people who cannot eat independently because they are physically and cognitively demanding to use and place difficult positioning requirements on the user. Also, they do not control the amount of food placed on the spoon, often presenting large clumps of food stuck to the spoon (or no food at all), to the user. This has led to user frustration causing high rates of device abandonment. Supported by NICHD SBIR Phase II funding, an assistive dining device (ADD) was developed that overcomes the problems of the other devices. An ADD has three important advantages over the other devices: the ability to reliably form a controlled spoonful of food, a flexible mounting/positioning system to reach users with non-standard seating and/or posture, and a very versatile control system. However, to commercialize an ADD, several other expensive tasks must be accomplished: 1) pass governmental regulatory requirements for electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility; 2) reduce the cost of production by acquiring expensive injection molds; 3) obtain FDA classification and an HCPCS code; and, 4) establish FDA approved quality system standards for manufacturing. At the end of this project, the ADD will be ready for Phase III, commercialization.",

A large proportion of venous ulcers may be present for 7 - 9 months and many more may be present for greater than 5 years; between 67% - 75% of patients have recurrent problems. Callum, et al in a study of 600 CVI patients found that a third had never healed their first ulcer and two-thirds had a series of ulcers. Consequently, half of the study population had ulcers for more than 10 years and some for virtually their entire adult life. Given the enormous impact on the quality of life, the need for improved prevention and treatment techniques is clear.  Compression of the lower extremity is the mainstay of therapy in patients with CVI. Compression techniques have been used in multiple different treatment regimens with modest success. While compression can be effective, it requires strong patient compliance, which is often difficult to obtain.   MedEfficiency proposes to develop a new generation compression system - \"Slip on Compression (SOC)\" - for prevention of CVI wounds. The SOC will be easy for the unassisted patient to put on and take off, will automatically detect and maintain appropriate, consistent, continuous gradient compression, be comfortable and safe, and work synergistically with new wound healing compounds.",

CliniMetrica(R)-Diagnostica (CM-Dx) currently provides systematic psychiatric assessment using the World Health Organization (WHO) Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, version 2.1). The diagnostic logic engine provides raters with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) diagnoses based upon their ratings of an interview subject, and adaptive guidance to further assessment items that need to be rated in order to rule in or rule out any given diagnosis. In addition, CM-Dx automatically indexes digital audio and video recording of assessment interviews, developed with prior SBIR support from NIMH, and includes functions to support remote psychometrics for the training and monitoring of interviewers. The CM-Dx system has application for both biomedical research (e.g., clinical trials) and for more routine clinical practice. While the Phase I diagnostic functionality filled a major gap, a number of improvements and additions can be made to provide greater value. Improved performance and interfaces would make the assessment and diagnostic functions easier to use. These functions will guide clinical raters through their interview and provide them with the current and longitudinal diagnostic status of their subjects. Phase II will also involve a larger study of the use of the functions in clinical settings.

The specific aims of this Phase II project are to: (1) Develop a commercializable type 2 diabetes model that can be used by providers to assess competing strategies for the management of type 2 diabetes, its complications, and its comorbidities; (2) Design, implement, and evaluate software technologies that will allow the diabetes model to execute in a standalone fashion on portable computing platforms; (3) Integrate the Phase II diabetes decision model, an existing electronic medical record (EMR) system, and the American Diabetes Association care guidelines to demonstrate to clinicians the benefits of complying with the care guidelines at the patient-specific level; (4) Evaluate and quantify any changes in clinician care guideline compliance, resulting from providing clinicians expected patient-specific outcomes data at the point of care. MDM's Phase II diabetes model will be based on an NIH- and CDC-funded model developed at the University of Michigan, MDM's Phase I diabetes model, and an MDM model of hypertension treatment. The existing hypertension model is based upon published studies from peer-reviewed medical journals and examines the effects of treatment with ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin II receptor blockers. In Phase II MDM will develop and evaluate a product with the potential to improve health outcomes and reduce overall costs for patients with diabetes by improving the knowledge, awareness, and compliance of appropriate courses of care. The technological innovation in this project stems from the innovative software technologies that will expand the distribution of medical decision models and the world's interaction with them.

In particular, high-flux, moderately-selective membranes will be developed for the dehydration step of the integrated process.  The new membranes would lower capital and operating costs, increasing the competitiveness of biomass-to-ethanol process, compared to distillation and molecular sieve technologies.  In Phase I, composite membranes were made, and their performance was evaluated in laboratory stamps and in bench-scale.  Membrane permeances exceeded those for existing commercial pervaporation membranes by a factor of 4 to 5.  An economic analysis of the total process showed that if the new membranes were formed into commercial-scale spiral-wound modules, the costs would be significantly less than current technology.  In Phase II, a pilot unit, which uses a membrane-based pervaporation-dephlegmation-dehydration process, will be constructed, field tested, and evaluated.  The field test will be used treat a slipstream at a corn-to-ethanol plant or a whey-lactose stream from cheese production.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The pervaporation-dephlegmation-dehydration process being developed should allow a large number of small (50 ton-per-day) fermentable waste biomass streams to be economically converted to ethanol.

Composite membranes with a carbon dioxide/hydrogen selectivity of 10 were prepared and tested as bench-scale membrane modules.  A process simulation model, based on the performance of these membranes combined with hydrogen-permeable membranes, was used to design an efficient pressure-swing-absorption tail-gas treatment process.  In Phase II, the membranes that were prepared in Phase I will be scaled up to industrial scale and evaluated in a complete pilot-scale system, in order to demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of the process.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new carbon dioxide/hydrogen membranes will increase hydrogen production and sequester carbon dioxide in steam reformer plants.  The cost of the process will be covered by the value of the hydrogen produced.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)  Phase II project focuses on developing genetically engineered, broad -spectrum disease resistance in plants. An  Aribdopsis transcription factor, TDR1, has been identified that causes resistance to three pathogens when overexpressed in transgenic plants. However, constitutive expression of TDR1 or any of three related genes causes growth retardation. Phase I research demonstrated that using tissue specific or inducible promoters to drive the TDR1 genes confers resistance with reduced side-effects. The research objectives of the Phase II project are to test the limits of TDR technology by assaying a broad range of pathogens, optimize the TDR phenotype by mutagenesis, demonstrate TDR function in a crop plant (tomato), and use microarray analysis to correlate gene expression patterns with specific pathogen resistance spectra in Arabidopsis. The results will establish the commercial utility of TDR technology.  The commercial application of this research will be to engineer wide-spectrum disease resistance in crops such as soybean and maize. Chemically based disease management is expensive, harmful to people and the environment, and not always effective. Breeding has long been used for developing resistant cultivars, but the gene pool is limited by reproductive barriers, the technique is slow, and the resistance is generally narrow in scope and often not durable. There clearly is a market for genetically-engineered, durable disease resistance. The main societal benefit of this project is expected to be a decrease in the use of toxic fungicides, which will positively impact the environment and human health.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Background: Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is a growing public health problem, but confirming the diagnosis in patients with suspected disease is often costly and time-consuming. Clinicians urgently need a screening test for active pulmonary tuberculosis that is faster, better and cheaper. An ideal screening test for pulmonary TB would be highly sensitive and specific as well as rapid, inexpensive and non-invasive.  No test in current use fulfills these criteria: sputum staining for acid fast bacilli has high specificity but poor sensitivity, and culturing sputum for Mycobacteria has higher sensitivity, but it is expensive and time consuming. However, a Phase 1 pilot study provided evidence that a breath test for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the breath could provide a clinically useful new marker. Pattern recognition analysis of oxidative stress markers in breath identified patients with active pulmonary TB infection with 94.1% sensitivity and 95.1% specificity. Fuzzy logic analysis of breath VOCs predicted active pulmonary tuberculosis infection with sensitivity = 100% and specificity = 83.3%.          Hypothesis: A test for breath VOCs combined with pattern recognition analysis or fuzzy logic analysis could provide a new screening test for pulmonary TB that is highly sensitive and specific as well as rapid, inexpensive and non-invasive.          Plans to test the hypothesis: We will evaluate the breath test in a subset of patients enrolled in a large multicenter trial designed to evaluate antibody-detection assays in the detection of pulmonary TB. Results of the breath test will be compared to the \"gold standard\" of sputum culture for M. tuberculosis. Pattern recognition analysis and fuzzy logic analysis of breath VOCs will be employed to develop predictive models in a training set of patients. These models will be evaluated and compared in a test set of patients to determine the sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of the breath test as a marker of active pulmonary TB.           Long term aims:             a. Scientific: To validate the clinical findings of the Phase 1 study in a larger group of subjects.             b. Technical: to develop a comparatively inexpensive miniaturized and rapid breath test suitable for point of care screening.             c. Commercial: To obtain Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the device and to market it.             Importance of the research: A breath test for pulmonary TB could make an important clinical impact by detecting new infections rapidly at low cost, and also by monitoring the impact of therapy. Also, it could potentially reduce the mortality and morbidity caused by pulmonary TB.",

Mesa Analytics & Computing, LLC provides a commercial, integrated suite of the leading-edge cheminformatics software tools for the pharmaceutical and biotech industry.  However, these tools, incorporating the most recent research in cheminformatics by Mesa, and integrated with other leading cheminformatics vendors` software (OpenEye, eduSoft, ChemAxon, and AccuSoft), are for use in large-scale research and industrial applications, where the users already have experience in cheminformatics software, most often obtained through on-the-job training.  The research goals of this project are to develop an easy to use, comprehensive, and competitively priced cheminformatics virtual classroom.  This project will further the advanced research and development of software tools for interactive distance learning in cheminformatics topics, such as finding compound substructure commonalities, generation and use of structural and property compound descriptors, similarity searching, cluster analysis, compound library design, 3D drug design, compound databases, and Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR).  The project will produce a beta version of the cheminformatics virtual classroom ready for testing and marketing to the academic and industry markets.  There are a growing number of university departments worldwide offering courses and degrees in cheminformatics, across a range of life science disciplines. However, there is no comprehensive cheminformatics virtual classroom product.  Software products used in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry are expensive, difficult to install, and of limited utility for introductory training.  Converting Mesa`s tools and other vendors` software into a coherent set of Web-based training tools for concept learning, with the help of six diverse academic testing sites, will provide the necessary training tools for academia and industry.  Web delivered training software is a cost effective means to provide distance learning for rural and urban academic institutions and industry sites here and abroad.  The virtual classroom will help to lower the cost of on-the-job training for early phase drug discovery research efforts found in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries.  The long term goal is to increase the quality and quantity of new researchers, with the potential benefit of increasing the number of drug leads, thereby improving the chances of finding more effective drugs for a wider range of serious diseases, and possibly lowering the cost to consumers.",

A multiple-chip implementation of the MISD processing model will further demonstrate the scalability and cost-effectiveness of the technology by increasing IDPS processing capacity to levels while reducing costs for the existing system.   Current line speed stateful computations are limited by the cost and scalability of currently available content addressable memories. Ideas derived from memory caching architectures will be adapted to build a novel memory subsystem specifically designed to cost-effectively support critical, stateful, 10 Gbps security applications such as TCP stream reassembly and protocol normalization. Finally, the development of open-source interfaces will extend the use of these innovations to a large community of users who will certainly contribute to the advancement of IDPS technology through inter-organizational collaborative efforts.  Next-generation applications require high-speed network connectivity. For example, supercomputer clustering, medical image delivery, data storage networking, video conferencing, and tele-presence applications all need 10 Gigabit and higher speeds. Unfortunately, public and private communication infrastructures are today being destabilized by security compromises. Network viruses, worms and other attacks can propagate very quickly over the Internet and private networks, disabling commerce and resulting in significant productivity loss. The ability to detect and prevent these attacks from traveling through high speed links is a crucial requirement for fostering their adoption across organizational boundaries. Without proper intrusion detection and prevention, high speed links will introduce severe attacks in information systems and limit the commercial viability and far-reaching benefits of high bandwidth, next-generation applications.  This Phase II project will dramatically improve the cost-effectiveness, openness and scalability of high-speed IDPS technology.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Background: Feeding problems are common in infants occurring in over 50% of those with prematurity, oropharngyeal dysfunction, or central nervous system injury [that may manifest later as cerebral palsy]. They can lead to poor growth, failure-to-thrive, recurrent hospitalization and present major diagnostic and management challenges. The most severe [>1:1000] require extensive evaluations; but apart from X-ray or bariatric studies, the clinical tools are visual and qualitative that still can leave unresolved questions. The Orometer is a novel device that attaches to a normal infant feeding bottle, designed to quantify nutritive sucking by infants with intuitive graphical output that can be shared and exchanged, facilitating professional consultations. No comparable instrument is available. In a phase I SBIR study, we showed successful results in testing a small cohort of normal infants. Hypothesis: It is possible to quantify and characterize such feeding problems even before an underlying etiology may be manifest. Such information would be of clinical value. Specific Aim: To conduct a clinical trial of the Orometer in 200 normal full term, and 200 potentially abnormal infants to establish basic orometric parameters in both normal and infants at risk. Long Term Plan: To develop the Orometer for routine clinical evaluation of feeding problems in infants. To license the Orometer to a manufacturer for final product development and sale. Study design: Test 200 normal full-term infants twice in the first 6 months to determine if the maturational changes occurring at that time can be detected and quantified. Test another 200 infants: 30 normal preterm infants twice in the first 3 months, and 170 others with, or at risk of having, feeding problems or delayed development, at referral and again at one year to determine whether their records differ from the normal patterns, and whether the initial study could identify correctly those infants with later developmental problems. Relevance: If successful, the Orometer would be useful in staging feeding, and thus expedite discharge of high-risk infants from NICUs. It would also be of prognostic and therapeutic value for infants with oral-motor dysfunction, including those with undiagnosed neurodevelopmental difficulties, or those destined to manifest cerebral palsy later. Early recognition of specific feeding problems should lead to earlier and better feeding strategies thus leading to earlier discharge and to better treatment of infants with long term disabilities. Commercial Potential: Potential sales to NICUs, developmental clinics, feeding specialists and pediatricians are projected in the 3000-8000/5years range.",

        "abstract": "This proposal describes the application, development and commercial scale-up of a process successfully developed under EPA contract number EP-D-04-042 for the deposition of copper and copper barrier materials such as ruthenium, titanium and other metals.  This process could replace CU electroplating currently used to fill deep trenches and thin film deposition in microelectronic circuit manufacturing.  In addition, physical vapor deposition and electroless deposition of barrier materials could also be replaced.  The electroplating process generates large quantities of aqueous wastes with copper ions and other dangerous chemical that must be treated in place.  The proposed process uses liquid or supercritical carbon dioxide solvent to transport a metal precursor to a semiconducting wafer substrate.  In addition to being environmentally benign, this process provides additional control of the metal deposition process to create superior films and electrical interconnects.  This project is part of an overall strategy to replace aqueous and organic solvents in microelectronics fabrication.                                         The wafer to be coated will be immersed in supercritical CO2solvent containing the precursor.  The wafer is heated independently of the chamber and a reactant is added to initiate a reaction with a metal precursor leaving behind a metal film on the wafer substrate surface.  Because of the low surface tension and viscosity of the carbon dioxide phase, the precursor will penetrate uniformly into the narrow gaps on the surface of the patterned substrate.  After the conversion of the metal precursor, a solid metallic layer remains on the surface which forms the desired interconnect, thin layer structure or barrier layer.                                                                                                                    Because of the never-ending demand for faster processor speeds and enhanced storage capacities, smaller and more sophisticated structures are required in modern semiconductor products.  As dimensions shrink, copper interconnects and metallic barrier and seed layers will be scrutinized like never before in efforts to achieve maximum yields.  New processes and materials will be adopted in the coming years to meet the challenges of evolving semiconductor products.  As an environmentally benign and technically superior process, metal deposition from supercritical CO2 will have a preferred place in the marketplace.",

As interests to mass spec applications getting broader and the techniques penetrate into each research area getting deeper, more challenges have been created. One of the challenges from proteomic researches is dealing with more complex samples with higher throughputs and wider dynamic range. Existing instruments and technologies are still far from meeting researchers demand. The goal of the proposed work is to develop a novel mass spectrometer and the associate methods which could provide much better peptide coverage at higher throughput for complex protein samples with lower detection limits, especially for low abundant proteins. This project will focus on tandem two-dimensional mass spectrometer and its applications. The new instrument will obtain complete MS/MS information, include fragmentation ions from all precursors with their parent-daughter linkage. The ions from the ion source will not be filtered out or under discriminatory selection, instead each of them will be fragmented to get MS/MS spectra, resulting much higher ion usage efficiency. Under phase I investigation, a prototype hybrid Qit-q-TOF instrument was built for 2D MS/MS experiments. Interfaces between each components have been studied, especially for ion trap ion ejection. Results from both computer simulation and experiments demonstrated the kinetic energy of ejected ions are low enough for interfacing TOF analyzer by using proposed reverse scan resonance ejection, which further approved Qit-q-TOF concept is technically feasible for 2D MS/MS. Under phase II funding, we will continue to improve the performance, eventually achieve the requirements of a commercial instrument.

This device uses sensitive MTJ devices to sense the magnetic field created by a patterned magnetized scale, and converts the resulting information into an accurate reading of angular position. The dual advantages of  high-temperature operation (up to 200 degrees C) and contamination resistance will separate this device from the optical encoders that currently dominate the market for motor encoders. Current motor encoders are rarely capable of operation above 115 degrees C, a problem that requires motors in many market segments to operate in non-optimal configurations, costing end users in terms of time and efficiency. In addition, optical methods are sensitive to dust in the measurement path. This development effort will create a new measurement technology with greatly enhanced capabilities for use in many critical segments of America's manufacturing sector. The creation of cost-effective encoders capable of operation at high temperatures will increase efficiency and enable further progress in a number of areas where hot environments are unavoidable, such as in the turbines of power-generating windmills.

This software will run on a standard desktop PC with the Microsoft Windows(r) operating system and is performed on images acquired from specimen slides. Multiple image modalities can be used, including confocal microscopy, brightfield, and widefield fluorescence. A major innovation of this project is that AutoNeuron will operate in both interactive and unattended modes. Unattended automated tracing of many neuron images will be possible with our robust tracing algorithm based on edge detection and conduit tracking; however, some images will contain complexities that make automated tracing difficult. In these cases, the scientist marks branch points in interactive mode, while the software automatically traces the segment between marked points - accurately locating the centerline and tracing the diameter of the process along its length. In Phase I, we prove the feasibility of applying an advanced tracing algorithm to the larger problem of neuron reconstruction. During this phase we will develop a preliminary user interface with basic editing tools to be used in testing. The software accuracy and efficiency will be assessed comparatively with manual tracings from a variety of neuron types, staining, and imaging methods. Once feasibility of the tracing engine is established, a commercial product will be developed in Phase II. Neuron reconstruction and tracing are important aspects of many analyses of form and function in the nervous system. However, today many valuable studies are not considered because current manual and computer assisted reconstruction techniques are simply too laborious. An automated reconstruction workstation will improve the efficiency and productivity of many currently funded studies as well as future studies once considered impractical.",

This project will develop low cost, high perfomance, self-cleaning coatings based on the superhydrophobic nature of the lotus leaf.  Two proprietary processes, Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition (CCVD) and NanoSpray technology, will be utilized to synthesize nanostructured surfaces, which will demonstrate improved performance at a much reduced manufacturing cost.  Phase I investigated the critical process parameteres for the fabrication of the selected materials system.  Excellent material and physical properties were achieved, including optical haze less than 0.5%, water contact angle higher than 165 degrees, and water rolling angle less than 5 degree.  In Phase II, the process parameters will be fine-tuned to further improve the film's properties, with a shift in focus from laboratory measured properties (hydrophobicity) to field tested properties (abrasion resistance and weatherability).  In addition, the fabrication process will be scaled to accomodate prototype samples (12 inch x 12 inch, or larger) for customer evaluation.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Self-cleaning surfaces have many applications and therefore several large market opportunities, such as architectural glass, automotive glass (where the self-cleaning feature can result in reduced vehicle weight by eliminating the need for cleaning fluids and improved driving safety), and cover glass of photovoltaic cells (increasing light transmission to the cells and thereby increasing the long-term efficiency of solar panels).

While bone densitometry using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the current \"gold standard\" in osteoporosis diagnosis, controlled clinical trials have highlighted its sensitivity and specificity limitations at the individual patient level. Recent research demonstrated the significance of the integrity of the structure of the trabecular network in contributing to bone strength. Up to now, only in vitro research was possible, typically biopsies harvested from the lilac crest. The Virtual Bone Biopsy (VBB) is a micro-MRI technology that has been demonstrated to obtain 3D images of bone architecture in addition to bone mass and provides a platform for assessing bone strength in vivo. It is comprised of image acquisition and processing software and hardware components that augment clinical MRI scanners. Preliminary studies indicate that MRI-derived topology parameters may have the necessary sensitivity and specificity to monitor and direct treatment at the individual level. This Fast-Track proposal aims to conduct the first serial assessment of bone competence and therapy response using topological parameters obtained non-invasively in vivo. The overall goal of Phase I of this SBIR Fast Track proposal is to examine the feasibility of the VBB system capabilities that, until now, have only been demonstrated in the inventors' laboratory, directed by Dr. Felix W. Wehrli. In order to document that VBB can be reliably deployed at any site equipped with GE 1.5 tesla MR scanners MicroMRI will pursue the following aims: 1. Evaluate commercially manufactured hardware customized for standardized performance. 2. Install the VBB at an second study site and evaluate its performance.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers MTBE a potential human carcinogen. Currently, MTBE's Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) in drinking water has been set for 18 parts per billion. It is estimated that the cost of cleaning up MTBE contamination nationwide is $29 billion and growing. Bioremediation holds a great promise for destruction of MTBE in groundwater. The key problems with currently used bioremediation methods for MTBE are (1) the inability to establish high densities of MTBE- degrading bacterial, (2) the inability to maintain contact between the degrading bacteria and MTBE, and (3) the upsets and losses of key bacteria.  Prior Phase I work has successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of a new technical approach called Biological Permeable Barrier (BPB) that uses encapsulated MTBE-degrading bacteria for removal of MTBE in water.  The primary objective for the Phase II project is to assess the long-term performance of a BPB field pilot unit to remove MTBE at Port Hueneme Navy site, and to assess the cost and performance of the BPB / MicroBeads system for longer periods of time under field conditions. The novelties of this technical approach are four folds : (1) the proposed system will deliver high cell density of MTBE-degrading bacteria right to the zone of contamination; (2) the proposed system will create the perfect environment for bacteria with a high degree of degradation and stability; (3) the proposed system will protect the bacteria against environmental stresses; and, (4) the proposed system will prevent wash out of key bacteria. It is anticipated that the proposed BPB pilot scale unit at Port Hueneme will effectively degrade MTBE and other contaminants in groundwater to non-detectable levels. The immediate commercial application of this project will be on the bioremediation of MTBE in groundwater. However, the proposed technology holds promise for effective, controlled and cost efficient cleanup of groundwater at sites contaminated with other toxic and polluting chemicals as well.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of newborn hearing screening is to identity infants with inner ear pathology (IEP), but most neonates who fail screening have conductive disorders (CD) rather than IEP, resulting in high false positive rates and costly follow-up diagnostic evaluation. The Rhode Island study (1993) has shown that the prevalence of conductive disorders (CD) over inner ear pathologies (IEP) to be 17 vs. 3-to-6 per 1000. While in N1CU the prevalence of CD over IEP rises to 36 vs. 23 per 1000. The ramifications of IEP and CD are different, so an accurate typing of the loss at the time of a newborn hearing screening is essential. The main objective of this proposal is to build a hearing-screening device that combines wideband reflectance measurement with DPOAE measurement into one system, where the former provides diagnostic evaluation for CD and the latter provides diagnostic evaluation for the IEP Thus in one test; both the conductive path and cochlear status are evaluated. Since both the reflectance measurement and the DPOAE measurement require an identical calibration step, the extra time needed to perform hearing screening, using the combined screening device, will be no more than few minutes. The benefit of the expected outcome is reduced false-positive rates, reduces follow up diagnostic costs, and reduced parental concern in the case of false positives.  An important auxiliary benefit of the probe impedance, obtained by the reflectance measurement, is to allow for a direct estimate of the signal intensity level in the ear canal so as to mitigate the standing wave problem in the audiometric measurement. In conjunction with DPOAE measurement, the WR-DP screener will provide more accurate measurement above 3 kHz where standing wave problem occurs.  The specific aims of Phase II are (1) to complete the development of the wideband reflectance-distortion product otoacoustic emission (WR-DP) screening device, toward improving its efficiency, reliability and ease of use; (2) to perform clinical studies, to obtain baseline data for the WR-DP screener, and (3) to demonstrate the diagnostic capabilities and cost effectiveness of the WR-DP screener.",

Fishmeal creates environmental and economic constraints for the aquaculture industry. Plant-derived proteins are a good alternate feed source, but do not meet the nutritional requirements of many farmed fish species including trout and salmon.  Prior Phase I work demonstrated that a combination of a selected fungal strain with innovations in solid substrate culture (SSC) would increase the protein content, eliminate the non-digestible carbohydrates and  reduce anti-nutritional factors in soybeans.  This Phase II project will test pilot-scale SSC technology to determine engineering design and economics for a commercial process to manufacture the bio-enhanced soy protein, and to demonstrate the feed value of this protein in trout feeding trials. The commercial application of this project will be in the aquaculture industry. The use of fishmeal creates economic, market and water pollution issues for fish farmers, and consumer concerns regarding environmental impacts (for example, there are reports of PCBs, dioxins, and other pesticides detected at higher levels in farmed salmon that have been fed fishmeal based diets). Replacing fishmeal with plant based proteins will promote health through increased fish consumption and will alleviate environmental and economic constraints facing the aquaculture industry.",

In Phase I, a prototype system was constructed to test concepts. The Phase II system will complete the development and testing of a full prototype with courses developed to teach the management of four critical events. There has recently been a focus on the number of errors made in patient care (To Err is Human, The Institute of Medicine, 1999). Better education focused on the management of critical events is believed to help reduce these errors especially in neuro patients where deficits can be disastrous. The development effort will make use of educational technology developed in the aviation industry and by the military and will combine that with our abilities to create realistic 3-D environments.

In support of this goal and based on initial FDA communications, it has been determined that the addition of a validated electronic controller and power supply system to the MiTiHeart LVAD along with additional in vitro and in vivo testing are needed to support the IDE application. The MiTiHeart LVAD, which has been developed under previous SBIR Grants and company funds, is a small non-thrombogenic rotary pump with magnetic levitation and a redundant hydrodynamic thrust bearing system. The current design specifies that all blood-contacting surfaces be manufactured from TI-6AI-4V alloy and coated with an innovative fully hydrogenated diamond like carbon (DLC) coating. A heparinized organic film overcoat is applied to all rotating DLC coated blood-contacting surfaces. The combination of hydrophobic DLC coating and hydrophilic organic coating provides an innovative means to reduce the shear stresses and minimize platelet activation, thereby reducing the potential for hemolysis and thrombosis. The proposed performance tests include in vitro hemolysis tests, in vivo bovine calf animal testing, and in vitro long-term durability tests. All LVAD components will be inspected following each test for indications of thrombus formation or coating degradation and will be modified if necessary before embarking on the next test. The following Specific Aims are planned for the proposed SBIR Competing Continuation program: (1) Develop the controller and power supply system for the MiTiHeart LVAD, (2) Manufacture blood pumps for performance evaluations, (3) Conduct in vitro hemolysis testing, (4) Conduct in vivo animal testing using a bovine calf model, and (5) Perform in vitro performance and durability testing. As a result of this program a reliable and thoroughly characterized LVAD with percutaneous controller and power supply system will be readied for additional preclinical testing required prior to submission of the IDE application. In the commercialization efforts of Phase II, the technology developed under this study will be transferred to MiTiHeart Corporation, a subsidiary MiTi, established to manufacture and market unique blood pumps for use as destination therapy for adult heart failure patients of small to medium frame that are not being served by present pulsatile devices.",

Studies carried out prior to Phase I and during the Phase I portion of this project have demonstrated that a synthetic retinoid (identified as MDI-301) is as effective as all-trans retinoic acid (RA) in stimulating collagen repair in the dermis of mice (topically treated) and human skin (in organ culture) but, unlike RA, is non-irritating. We expect, therefore, that MDI-301 will ultimately provide a non-irritating alternative to RA for topical use in the prevention and treatment of aged/photoaged skin. In this Phase II application, we have identified a number of critical issues that need to be addressed as part of the development process of MDI-301. The three specific aims of this Phase II application identify the issues and our approach for addressing each of them. In Specific Aim I we will compare MDI-301 and RA for ability to stimulate extracellular matrix production and inhibit extracellular matrix degradation in human skin transplanted to severe-combined immunodeficient (scid) mice. As part of these studies, we will determine if treatment results in a histologically-evident improvement in the structure of the transplanted skin and determine if function (i.e., wound-healing capacity) is concomitantly improved in the treated skin. In Specific Aim II, MDI-301 and RA will be compared for their ability to modulate events in human skin that contribute to irritation. The information from theses studies will be used to help understand, at the cellular and molecular levels, why MDI-301 is non-irritating under conditions in which RA is irritating. Finally, in Specific Aim III, we will begin the safety evaluation of MDI-301 necessary to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the FDA. The major goal of the Phase II effort is to develop MDI-301 to the point where we can attract a drug-development partner having the resources to obtain regulatory approvals (IND, clinical trials, NDA) and to market the drug effectively.",

Abnormalities in the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) system are recognized as a major cause of cancers and significant biomedical effort has been directed towards this target in a search for novel anti-cancer agents. In Phase I of this project we proposed the re-engineering of EGF to transform it from an agonist to an antagonist as the first stage of our Anti Cancer Ligand program. Computational analysis of the EGF sequence and scrutiny of EGF/EGFR interactions led to a rational program of site-directed mutagenesis, production, purification and analysis of EGF variants culminating in the successful accomplishment of the goals established in our Phase I SBIR grant, the identification of our early stage lead, a single point mutant with antagonist properties. In Phase II of this project we will confirm the therapeutic potential of that lead in mouse xenograft studies using the high-EGFR human cancer A431 cell line and then improve upon its potential through a program of affinity maturation using both phage display and rational modification. The high affinity antagonist will be tested in both in vitro and in vivo assays to demonstrate its efficacy against human tumor models and to demonstrate that its mode of action is consistent with its therapeutic properties. The identification of this pre-clinical drug lead is the ultimate goal of this proposed Phase II program, and the intellectual property generated in the course of this program will provide the basis for marketing this lead to the pharmaceutical industry.",

These IDs will be: the Work Hand and the Work Hook. These new terminal devices will be lighter in weight, can be used in more extreme environments, and will offer more versatile gripping shapes than existing electric TDs. Motion Control is perfectly positioned to build upon the development of the Motion Control (MC) Hand, and the Electric Terminal Device, which both utilize our 2-speed drive and are capable of 25 Ib. of pinch force. They both may include the option of the highly functional Flexion Wrist.   Background: Modern electric arm prostheses have significant advantages over body-powered devices: freedom from uncomfortable control cables (also allowing greater work envelope), very high pinch force (requiring little effort), and a more natural appearance. However, existing electric work TDs are not durable enough for many work environments because of suceptibility to water and dirt, and are not designed for truly rugged work.   The effort:  During Phase I, Motion Control has designed and built engineering models of the two TDs based upon the same enclosed, water-resistant drive.

Result: The result of Phase II development and testing will be both the heavy-duty Work Hand and the Work Hook that are ready for commercialization. This system will give upper-limb deficient individuals the benefits of a highly functional externally powered work hand that is suitable for a very wide variety of work, home, and recreational environments.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a transfemoral prosthesis which will allow wearers to walk and run more smoothly, with greater stability and less effort. Typically, transfemoral amputees have difficulty achieving a natural gait, thus causing discomfort and greater energy expenditure. It is expected that the development of this advanced prosthesis will greatly enhance the function and comfort of amputees and bring new technology to the prosthetic industry. In  Phase I research, a unique engineering model of the knee and the ankle was developed,  implementing the pneumatic compliance (spring) and electrically-controlled hydraulic damping. In Phase II, complete prototypes of the microprocessor-controlled knee/ankle prosthesis will be developed, with the following features:  (a) compliant (elastic, rather than stiff) knee flexion during stance phase, which will return energy to the wearer and improve comfort, (b) co-ordination of knee and ankle impedance to match desired walking cadence, and minimal energy expenditure by tuning the spring rate to the natural frequency; and (c) myoelectric control of knee impedance. In addition, high-performance features will be integrated into the prosthetic device, including adaptive swing phase knee impedance, and automatic control of stance phase impedance.  The commercial application of this project will be in the area of prosthetic devices for use by people with knee and foot (transfemoral) amputation. The proposed product will allow the amputees to wear their prosthesis for a longer time period, with less effort and more safety, and to walk on more rugged and uneven terrain. Estimates of revenues resulting from this project show gross sales starting at $750,000 per year, growing rapidly after 5 years to over $8,000,000.",

        "abstract": "75323B  Ethylene is the largest volume petrochemical in the world \u00bf some 40 large scale plants operate in the United States alone.  Ethylene production is energy-intensive and non-selective, with a number of heavier, lower value products being made.  As the price of energy in North America increases, the U.S. ethylene industry becomes less competitive compared to foreign producers. This project will develop multiple-phase metathesis technology, a reactive distillation application that will increase the yield of ethylene and propylene from ethylene plants.  The process works by converting a large portion of the heavier, low value by-products to ethylene, propylene, and downstream derivatives of ethylene in a single step, thereby reducing both raw material and energy consumption per unit of product made.  Phase I investigated catalyst life and defined design parameters.  The catalyst life cycle was determined in a 30-day test run.  The design parameters included the maximum throughput rate and the optimal feed location, both of which were identified during another 30-day test.  A reactive-distillation simulation was developed and confirmed by comparison with pilot plant results.  In Phase II, a semi-commercial pilot plant will be built and operated to confirm the design parameters.  Pail, drum, and truck-load quantities of ethylene samples will be made, and the feasibility of making high value, heavier specialty products will be investigated.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Nearly every ethylene plant in the United States should be able to utilize the multiple-phase metathesis process to reduce raw material consumption, reduce energy consumption, increase capacity, and enhance profitability.  In addition, the technology could be used to make higher olefins, which are currently made via separate step from ethylene or propylene.  The derivatives could be used to make surfactants for laundry and industrial detergents, plasticizers for the processing of plastics, and lubricants or lubricant additives for the motor oil and drilling industries.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, with over one million new cases reported in the world each year. A diagnosis of breast cancer is frequently and understandably associated with high levels of psychosocial distress. While support groups and stress-management interventions have increased social support, reduced psychosocial and physiological stress, improved active coping, and enhanced psychosocial adjustment, less than 10 percent of patients attend these group-based interventions. This is particularly true of minority and other underserved women. In a Phase I project we developed an innovative interactive multimedia instructional CD-ROM entitled, \"Living With Breast Cancer.\" This product is unique in that it describes and normalizes the range of emotional reactions women with breast cancer experience, organizes and walks women through the medical landscape of breast cancer, directs women's education queries to appropriate sources when they need them, and offers skill building strategies for alleviating psychosocial stress and for creating and maintaining constructive social support. The goals of this Phase II project are to enhance and further refine our product and to develop a companion web site. The web site will provide updated information, links to additional valuable, carefully screened references and an opportunity for CD-ROM users to share their experiences with one another. We will recruit a sample of 120 women with breast cancer, across two demographically different sites, to participate in a randomized controlled trial of the effects of the product and the web site. Women will be randomly assigned to Enhanced Usual Care group (UC) who will receive an educational breast cancer video, or to the CD-ROM Intervention group (CDR) who will receive the \"Living With Breast Cancer\" product in addition to the video. Women will be assessed at baseline and 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up on psychosocial stress (i.e., life events, perceived stress), psychosocial distress (i.e., depression, trauma symptoms), coping, social support; physiological stress response (i.e., cortisol), breast cancer disease outcomes (i.e., recurrence), and consumer satisfaction. The products will be marketed to cancer treatment centers, independent oncology health care providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and health maintenance organizations.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The aim of this proposal is to develop a Hardware/Software setup that can be appended to any existing multi-channel MRI system in order to provide it with SPACE RIP parallel imaging capability. The SPACE RIP technique is a parallel image acquisition and reconstruction technique that allows for the flexible choice of phase encoding, and is very well suited for coil sensitivity profile self-calibration; This setup would require minimal change to the pulse sequence in order to allow the user the choice of an acceleration factor, and would enable faster image acquisition on these MRI systems. Once the user chooses the acceleration factor, a program computes the optimal phase encodes to be acquired and would direct the pulse sequence to execute. Once the data is acquired, it is transferred to a multi-processor computer connected to the scanner, where it is processed with the SPACE RIP algorithm. The images are reconstructed off-line in real-time and transferred back to the scanner's memory for viewing and archiving. All existing multi-channel MRI systems may benefit from this setup, as well as new systems. The initial marketing effort will be directed towards General Electric Medical Systems (GEMS) scanners. MRI Dynamics Inc. will pursue a current interest with GEMS to form a partnership and leverage GEMS's marketing and sales forces to promote this product.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop sex pheromone-based techniques for monitoring, mass trapping, and mating disruption of the soybean aphid.  Since its first appearance in North America, infestations of the newly invasive soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura, have continued to cause a  significant soybean yield loss due to either direct feeding damage or the vectoring of  plant viruses by the aphid. In 2003, the total acreage with soybean aphid infestation was estimated at over 8 million, with yield loss ranging from 32% - 45% in the three biggest  soybean growing states in the U.S. (Illinois, Iowa and Minnesota). This project will investigate novel suppression strategies to reduce populations of this pest, thereby reducing the size of the subsequent populations feeding on soybeans. The commercial application of this project will be to manage aphids in the soybean crop. The research aims to increase knowledge of the chemical ecology of aphids, as well as provide a new understanding of how to use these novel  aphid sex pheromone-based control strategies most effectively. This will help growers in the U.S., the world's largest soybean exporting  country, to improve crop quality and yield at a minimal cost for soybean aphid management, thereby increasing their competitiveness in the world market.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will optimize Performance and demonstrate reliability of temperature insensitive silica-based arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) multiplexers developed under SBIR Phase I award. In Phase I we have successfully demonstrated that the temperature sensitivity of silica-based AWGs can be eliminated by a combination of a reflective device with a unique external mirror that rotates with temperature at a constant rate.  The rotation of the external mirror compensates for the temperature induced index change of silica waveguides and the resulting peak wavelength shift of individual channels, making the device athermal. This has been accomplished without penalties in the device performance. The goal of Phase II is to develop compact 40-channel, 100 GHz, totally passive athermal AWGs with Gaussian or flattop passband profiles that is manufacturable in large volume. Special attention will be given to the reliability certification of athermal AWGs as specified by Telcordia standards. During Phase II we will distribute reliable prototypes to our partners and potential customers for field tests. The research and development program carried out under this Phase II project will result in robust manufacturing process of reliable athermal AWGs ready for commercialization. This project is focused on producing a highly reliable, temperature insensitive, AWGs based on silica-on-silicon technology. AWGs are planar optical devices that are considered key components in dense wavelength division multiplexed (DWDM) optical Networks. The novel approach to the manufacture of silica based AWGs, relying on high-technology silicon IC foundries, results in high quality devices that are produced at low cost, in high volume, and without a large front-end investment. The innovative design results in complete suppression of the temperature sensitivity of silica based AWGs. This approach eliminates the need for electric power and external temperature control of AWGs, resulting in a more robust, and considerably less expensive device package.",

        "abstract": "75399S  High field magnets, such as those used in High Energy Physics facilities, require precision placement of the superconducting cables to achieve high performance.  However, current coated metal insulators used for end shoes and spacers have sharp points that can easily damage the cable insulation during installation.  When assembling the magnet, these spacers can be pushed through the fabric, damage it, and potentially flake off the coating.  Electrical shorts can result that require rework.  This project will develop novel moldable ceramic insulators for use in accelerator and fusion magnets, in order to minimize the potential for insulation damage and shorting.  The material can be used in place of the sharp tips or wherever small gaps exist.  The insulators will be capable of withstanding the high mechanical loads at cryogenic temperatures, surviving the high temperature heat treatments, and resisting radiation.  Phase I demonstrated that moldable ceramic compounds can be easily formed to the desired shape or packed into small gaps within a magnet structure.  Characterization included strength measurement, thermal expansion, and dimensional control.  Phase II will focus on the optimization of the composition and processing to further increase strength and to control other properties such as thermal expansion.  Evaluation of the mixing, drying, and firing processing stages will be performed.  Compressive strength, thermal expansion, and electrical properties will be measured at room temperature and cryogenic temperatures.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The ceramic insulators should be more robust and reliable than existing materials used in high field accelerator and fusion magnet systems.  More robust insulators would lower magnet production cost, which will help enable future devices to be constructed within budgetary restrictions.  Commercial magnets could also benefit from molded insulator components, increasing their reliability at lower cost.",

        "abstract": "76166B  Although permeable reactive barriers (PRBs) are an important treatment option for groundwater remediation, no reliable methods are available to monitor or predict their long-term behavior.  The large-scale implementation of reactive barriers will require a means of monitoring their long-term degradation.  For example, gaps can occur in the placement of the reactive material, particularly when construction methods such as jetting or deep soil mixing are used.  This project will develop a reliable method to verify placement and monitor the effectiveness of permeable reactive barriers.  The approach will use arrays of inexpensive electrodes, coupled to autonomously operating hardware and software, to characterize the barrier and determine its effectiveness.  In Phase I, column studies using ZVI and apatite PRB materials were performed.  Numerical modeling showed that a monitoring configuration, consisting of boreholes spaced at 2 m intervals along the upstream face of the barrier, could be tuned to detect age-spots of 2x3 m in size.  Existing instrumentation was modified to provide autonomous operation using solar power, and a reliable, low-overhead protocol for two-way communications was implemented.   In Phase II, a full scale field validation for an existing, instrumented PRB will be performed.  Web-based, automated geophysical monitoring systems will be enhanced, and software for imaging the temporal signature of an aging PRB will be developed.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The automated monitoring system should find use in more than 100 permeable reactive barriers that will have been installed in North America by the time this project is completed.",

As presently envisioned, large muon intensities will be required, due to limitations with ionization cooling, the intended method for cooling the beam.  However, the proton accelerators needed to produce the required muon intensity are expensive, and the decay of the large number of muons in the storage ring create troublesome boundary radiation and make the physics experiments difficult.  This project will combine ionization cooling with parametric resonances to produce beams with much smaller tranverse sizes, allowing high muon collider luminosity to be achieved with fewer muons.  In Phase I, the theory of transverse beam cooling, using half-integer parametric resonances and ionization cooling, was extended to include methods to compensate for chromatic and angular aberrations.  Computer programs were developed which were used to confirm the general analytical predictions and to compare the relative effectiveness of a quadrupole channel to one based on solenoids with alternating polarity.    Phase II will further develop the theory and simulations in order to demonstrate that transverse cooling using parameteric resonances can relax the requirements on the proton driver, reduce the boundary radiation, and provide a better environment for experiments at  muon colliders.  Complete simulations using realistic models of all components of the parametric resonance cooling channel will be conducted.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  If the case for a muon collider as the next energy frontier machine can be made compelling, it becomes a candidate to be added to the other options for the High Energy Physics community.

Reschard was funded by grants for DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Program Agency), which identified a need to have a non-toxic, non-corrosive biodefence decon material that can decontaminated equipment, personnel, structures, and terrain in the event of a bio incident.  A series of surfactant lipid nanoemulsions, which have extensive antimicrobial activity and are not toxic to tissues were resultant of this effort.  Nanoemulsions are oil in water emulsions that employ droplets that range from 200-800 nanometers.  They are composed of detergents, vegetable oil, salt, water, a food grade alcholol and for antrax decontamination a spore germination enhancer.  The physical structure of the nanoemulsion contains the surfactants that mediate the antimicrobial activity.  The emulsion droplet disrupts nicroorganisms through fusion and the destablixation of the cell membrane leading lysis.

The band-gap engineering of nanophosphors allows improvement in the luminescence characteristics such as absorption and emission spectra, half-width, efficiency, life-time, etc. Indeed the role of conventional activators (rare-earths and transition metal impurities) in nanophosphors can be re-evaluated for different applications. Specifically, ternary wide band gap semiconductors such as ZnCdS with dopants like Ag, Cu, Mn offer very efficient broad-band visible spectra that is close to white light. The possibility of band-gap engineering in nanocrystals of ternary semiconductors, similar to that catapulted the optoelectronic devices from III-V semiconductors, opens the door to design of new nanophosphors that match well with the excitation spectra of LED's and compact fluorescent lamps. This development would lead to a new class of white light sources in this Phase II project.  By developing different nanophosphors that can be excited by blue/UV LEDs, it successfully demonstrates that nanophosphors can significantly enhance the performance of not only white LEDs but also can improve the performance of compact fluorescent and arc lamps. Commercially this technological breakthrough of engineering of nanophosphors when used with current efficient lamps, is expected to enhance the efficiency of LED's by 40% and lamps by 15%, respectively. These improvements in overall power efficiency of these lamps, will significantly lower the cost of energy used and it is projected will help to save energy costs equivalent to $25 billion by 2025.",

Current DNA based portable systems for the detection of infectious agents lack multiplexing, i.e., simultaneous analysis of large number of pathogens or their genes, they do not integrate well or automate the sample preparation methods and cannot be used efficiently in the field or in point-of care applications. The microarray platform practically does not pose a limit to multiplexed detection of large number of pathogens as well as their characterization by multiple genes. The Phase I project successfully demonstrated several innovative approaches to sample preparation using centrifugal microfluidics. Three dimensional or multilayer centrifugal discs (3DCD) have been designed and fabricated which offer practically unlimited surface area for implementation of different sample preparation techniques. Several innovative tools for sample preparation in the 3DCD format have been demonstrated in the Phase I project. The overall goal of the Phase II project is to integrate these tools and develop CDs for particular assays for the detection of infectious disease and/or biological warfare agents. A DNA microarray detection platform will be integrated with the sample preparation on the 3DCD. An electronic microarray technology developed and commercialized earlier, will be used in detection. This technology assures fast DNA detection times using electrophoretically driven DNA transport and hybridization on the microarray. Specific aims of the Phase II program is to develop 3DCD technology with embedded tools for complete sample preparation and detection of several representative respiratory infectious disease pathogens as well as biological warfare agents. A fully developed technology will yield a small portable or point-of-care system with exchangeable CDs allowing choice of the pathogen detection panels including respiratory infectious disease, biological warfare agents or emergent viruses panels.",

        "abstract": "This Phase II proposes to develop an innovative nanostructured coating, with a unique integration of hard phases and lubrication phases, for dry machining of austenite steels for the automotive and aerospace industries.  This novel coating will be synthesized using a combination of electrostatic spray coating (ESC), chemical vapor infiltration (CVI), and plasma etching.  W unique biomimetic inspired domes plus reservoirs surface morphology of the coating refreshes the surface of contact with lubricants constantly, leading to significantly reduced friction and wear.  In comparison, current state of art for combining the hard phases and soft phases for dry machining is usually in layered structures, where the soft phases wear away quickly leaving only the hard phase behind.   Dry machining eliminates cutting fluids and relieves environmental loading from sources.  Cutting fluids, at yearly consumption of more than 100 million gallons in the United States, represents a significant health and environmental problem for the nation\u00bfs manufacturers.  The objective of this proposed work is to realize a reliable an scalable coating process for the coating to achieve dry machining with significantly extended tool life.  The following explorative work will be carried out: (1) optimization of the combination of hard phases of different average sizes for controlled dimensions of the domes and reservoirs; (2) deposition of nanostructured solid lubricants dispersion: (3) optimization of plasma etching process; (4) evaluation of the coating (physica1, chemical, tribological and machining performance); and (5) design consideration for scaling up the manufacturing process for batch production.                                                In the Phase I feasibility studies, all the proposed tasks have been completed;  The technical objectives have been successfully accomplished.  The desired surface morphology was achieved for integrating the hard phases and the lubricant phases.  Preliminary tribological testing has demonstrated lower coefficient of friction and better resistance to wear than the industrial benchmark, a nonostructured solid lubricant coating (PVD) combing the hard phases and the soft phases in layered structure.  These excellent results have solidly established the technical platform for Phase II.                                    Upon the completion of the Phase II work, deliverables including the coating, coating system, and coated tool inserts are anticipated.  The application of the coating is expected to facilitate dry machining - a green technology - by offering a 300% increase of tool life as compared to the industrial benchmark, better energy efficiency, and longer tool shelf life, further contributing to cost saving and a strengthening of the US manufacturing industries in world-wide competitive markets.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to design and develop a molecular nano-sensor platform for researchers developing new chemical and bio-sensors. The principal component of these devices will be an array of single-wall carbon nanotube transducers on a silicon chip. The product itself will be a sensor development kit comprised of a set of sensor chips, an electronics module with a standard PC interface, adaptors for gas and liquid sensing, data reduction and analysis software, and directions for product use. General guidelines for the additional of specialized functionalization chemistry and biology to the sensor chip will be included. The project objectives include developing a set of 5-10 different chip architectures for gas, liquid and biosensing together with modules for sensing in both gases and liquids. The CMOS mask design will include as many as ten different architectures suitable for different types of experiments and functionalization layers. The sensor chips themselves will be manufactured on 4-inch silicon wafers and set into a standard CERDIP package that fits into the top of the electronics module. Signal processing electronics and software systems will be designed and integrated to deliver digital sensor output to LabView(TM) on a PC. The research involved in meeting these goals encompasses the design, prototyping and experimental testing of each component of the development platform. At the culmination of Phase II, the molecular nano-sensing platform will be  validated by collaborative users in UCLA, UC Berkeley and UC Irvine, and positioned for market introduction.  Commercially this novel nanosensing platform will enable research and product development in molecular level phenomena related to chemical reactions and catalysis, chemical and biological sensing, and photonics. The work described in this proposal will produce a valuable new nanoelectronics research tool that will ultimately result in new discoveries and products in sensing and diagnostics. Researchers seeking to develop new direct electronic detection sensing applications and conduct charge transfer experiments at the molecular level lack a robust, inexpensive experimental platform. In most cases researchers must develop their own experimental apparatus, interfaces and software. For those wishing to take advantage of the sensitivity and flexibility of nanoelectronic arrays, fabricating the devices is a formidable and cost prohibitive challenge. This project seeks to provide a state-of-the-art nanotechnology-based solution in an ultra sensitive and flexible detection platform.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    A novel process has been discovered in which an enzyme linked to an antibody or biological targeting agent directed to a site of interest deposits metal rapidly and highly selectively from solution. Sensitivity and resolution are both higher then with alternative technologies, sufficient to visualize single gene copies and enumerate low copy number targets such as unamplified genes in the brightfield light microscope without oil immersion. Background binding was virtually non-existent. Signal resolution and clarity are very high even at the macromolecular level, and preliminary studies indicate that this method also provides high cell and tissue penetration for electron microscopy immunolabeling. Variations of this method will now be optimized for four different applications with different requirements. For immunohistochemistry, the process will be refined for highest specificity and reproducibility, then validated in comparison with conventional organic chromogens in an extensive two-center study. 20 commonly used immunohistochemical analytes will be stained in a series of 100 cases, using 10-core tissue midiarrays. For DNA and RNA in situ hybridization and Southern Blotting, enhancements will be pursued to maximize sensitivity: the enzymatic metallation will be accelerated by incorporation of a gold particle, and the method combined with polymer-based signal amplification methods. It will then be evaluated for the in situ hybridization detection of cyclin D1 mRNA in mantle cell lymphomas, and for the Southern Blot detection of clonal B and T cell gene rearrangements in lymphomas, in each case in comparison with autoradiographic and chemiluminescent methods. Enzymatic metallography will also be adapted for use in electron microscopy labeling. The method will be optimized to give highest specimen penetration, signal uniformity, and control over signal size and shape. Following screening in test systems, the new reagent will be critically evaluated against both conventional colloidal gold probes and against covalent gold cluster and nanoparticle probes in electron microscopic studies to characterize the distribution and function of different proteins in developing microsporidia spores.",

The materieal can be used as lightning strike and EMI shielding protective coatings for commercial and advanced aircraft, and in state-of-the-art flexible microelectronics and sensors.  During Phase I, several nanocomposites were modeled and prepared layer-by-layer by the self-assembly of metal nanoparticles and elastomeric polymers.  The relationship between sheet resistance, transmission, and mechanical properties were investigated.  A bulk resistivity of 10-5 O\u00bfcm was demonstrated (recall that the resistivity of bulk gold is 10-6 O\u00bfcm), which is important  because a smaller amount of metal would be needed for manufacturing, thereby reducing costs.   The tradeoff in material properties was controlled through chemical processing based on (1) the choice and volume fraction of metal nanoparticles and (2) the choice and crosslink density of the organic polymer component.  In Phase II, the properties of the material will be optimized for commerical applications, especially as high performance coatings for aircraft and microelectronics packaging.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new \u00bfmetal-rubber\u00bf material should find application as:  (1) advanced window coating materials for next-generation commercial airplanes, (2) similar coatings for military aircraft transparencies, and (3) flexible conducting electrodes and mechanical sensors in the electronics market.

        "abstract": "75963S  Today, 23% of electricity production in the United States is consumed by lighting; yet current technologies (i.e., incandescent and fluorescent sources) operate at a mere 15% or less efficiency.  The need exists for a novel, solid-state lighting technology that provides high luminous efficiency and high color rendering at low cost.  This project will develop an innovative down-converting system, based on engineered nanocomposite materials, which will dramatically improve the overall cost, performance, and efficiency of solid-state white light (SSWL).  This is not merely a new phosphor, but rather a complete down-converting system with the potential to produce solid-state white light that exceeds the performance of the best traditional fluorescent and incandescent bulbs.  Phase I proved the feasibility of the concept by:  (1) fabricating optimum nanocomposite mixtures based on theoretical predictions; (2) demonstrating the effect of controlling the index of refraction and scattering in the phosphor layer; and (3) projecting eventual performance improvements, based upon the continued materials optimization and device design that will be performed in Phase II.  Phase II will focus on the further development of material components and the optimization of white-light device performance.  The output of Phase II will be a prototype white-light-emitting device that employs nanocomposite down-conversion technology and delivers a color rendering index greater than 80, a color temperature of 4,000K, a luminous efficiency greater than 200 lm/W, at a cost less than $5/klm.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  High efficiency, high color rending, low power consumption, rugged, long lifetime solid state white lighting should have commercial applications in general illumination (residential, commercial, and industrial) and mobile platforms for signaling and lighting (automobile, aviation, marine, trains).

This technology is based on a novel thin-film semiconductor on plastic composed of a dense film of parallel nanowires with electronic properties comparable to single-crystal silicon that can be deposited at low temperatures. In Phase I, the feasibility of this innovative technology was successfully demonstrated and key device design and material processing parameters to address underlying device performance were identified. Specific developments included (1) nanomaterial deposition (2) contact technology (3) doping processes and (4) device architecture. Phase II research will build on the knowledge gained in Phase I, and focus on further optimization of device performance and the development of roll-to-roll manufacturing processes. The output of Phase II will be a prototype array of transistors on plastic. In addition, this fundamental concept can be applied to nanowire materials other than silicon, allowing the production of thin films of material that presently are impossible to produce over large areas on any substrate, including semiconductors relevant to communications (GaAs, InAs), optically active materials (GaN, InP), piezoelectric or ferroelectric materials (SrTiO3), or materials of mixed composition with newly engineered properties.  Commercially, this research will impact greatly the development of high performance TFT devices on plastic for commercial, military, and homeland security markets. These high-performance, flexible semiconducting films have the potential to replace amorphous and polycrystalline silicon in important large-area electronics applications such as displays and also radio frequency identification tags (RFID'S).",

While there have been notable recent advances in minimally invasive access to these lesions using advanced micro-catheter systems, there is a paucity of equally high performing embolization materials that can be delivered through these catheters to effectively treat clinically challenging lesions. The overall goal of this project is to further develop a highly promising new hydrogel material for the endovascular treatment of aneurysms. This material, ALGEL-II(r), is an ultrapure alginate that is non-adhesive, injectable, mechanically stable, and biocompatible. Prior phases of this commercialization effort have resulted in successful pre-clinical studies and an IDE application to the FDA to begin clinical trials on ALGEL for embolization of arteriovenous malformations.  The goal is to accomplish the next steps towards commercialization. Specific Aim 1 is to conduct materials testing of ALGEL-II to assess long-term stability and biocompatibility in small-neck aneurysms. This aim is directed at manufacturing clinical-grade ALGEL and completing FDA-standard long-term toxicity studies in mice and the required panel of genotoxicity studies. The final milestone of this aim is submission of an IDE application to the FDA for a Phase I clinical trial. Specific Aim 2 is to develop clinically appropriate techniques for using ALGEL to embolize wide-neck and bifurcation aneurysms. The studies will adopt a new animal model in dogs and compare the treatment and healing response to that previous found in swine.  This project is based on a solid foundation of research and development in the clinical use of ALGEL for treating a wide range of neurovascular defects.

However, manual administration of large neurocognitive test batteries is inefficient, error prone, and does not meet the needs for standardization across multiple sites. The project objective is to develop an advanced, wide spectrum computerized neurocognitive assessment system that will provide a single, unified platform for comprehensive administration and management of various protocols, sufficient to meet the requirements of a minimum of 75% of controlled clinical trials as well as related research applications. The computerized antipsychotic evaluation system (CAES) will introduce an unprecedented range of content, functionality and utility integration. Advantages include: (a) increased data quality through standardized, multimedia-based administration; (b) integral multimedia-based examiner training for all tests; (c) automated project reporting and documentation; (d) automated patient tracking and scheduling; (e) automated protocol compliance; (f) reduced examiner requirements and errors; (g) automatic generation and tracking of CRFs; (h) automated electronic database transfer and (i) correspondingly reduced costs. The computer platform is uniquely suited to assessment of impaired subjects due to its interactive, dual-display and control architecture that integrates a human examiner, enabling precise control of every step of the administration process for any test. An examiner can score verbal report and overt behavioral performance in real time, an important capability not available in the current generation of single-display systems. The CAES dual-monitor architecture will be implemented on an advanced cognitive assessment platform (ACAP) hardware device, providing comprehensive electronic patient response capture and conferring portability. To ensure relevance of the assessment instrument set, as well as system functions for application in clinical trials, development will be guided by a steering committee of recognized authorities in the field of schizophrenia research, including members of the NIMH-sponsored CATIE (Clinical Antipsychotic Trials in Intervention Effectiveness) consortium.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Polysomnography, the advent in the 1950s of an objective means of recording and analyzing sleep, greatly accelerated progress in the scientific description of sleep, including the establishment of age-sex norms. In the 1980s, polysomnography enabled the discovery and description of obstructive sleep apnea, a relatively common condition having co-morbidities such as hypertension, stroke, diabetes, epilepsy, and possibly some variants of Alzheimer's disease, as well as detrimental effects on waking cognitive function and mood. During the past two decades, the marriage of relatively inexpensive desktop computers to polysomnography has spawned the field of digital/computerized polysomnography (cPSG). While cPSG has offered indubitable advantages over its analog predecessor in terms of the flexibility and ease of data display and editing, as well as in space requirements and cost of data archival, cPSG provides a decreased accuracy of its data representation/analysis and display on the 30 second computer monitor screen. The proposed work offers the possibility of a third paradigmatic advance in polysomnography-an originally conceived software system that builds upon technological advances of the past decade in computer hardware and software, enabling accurate representation, display, analysis, report generation, and archival of the core dynamic sleep waves and waveforms of children's (and adults') sleep, while maintaining capability of providing traditionally computed \"sleep architecture\" macroparameters for pediatric and adult sleep. Our completed Phase I work successfully performed bench work development and validation of the system's foundational waveform detection and analysis tools for the accurate representation, display, and analysis of the delta waves of pediatric sleep. The Phase II work will extend this development to all of the primary waves and waveforms of pediatric sleep, additionally scaffolding the development to a tool permitting accessing of PSG data from multiple hardware platforms and in multiple data formats, and to a powerful but relatively inexpensive database management module offering customized data archival. The innovative system development will be validated by bench testing and by a sleep lab validation study of its automated analysis capability. The system's capabilities far exceed the capabilities offered by commercially available systems, auguring an enormous commercial potential.",

It accounts for 21 percent of emergency room visits and 25 percent of annual missed work days and, when considering direct and indirect costs, imposes a greater economic burden than any other disease, with estimates of annual costs adding up to $100 billion. Pain is the primary symptom that prompts individuals to seek medical attention, but despite its prevalence, it remains a stubborn condition to treat and a difficult concept to capture by objective measurement techniques.      The objective of this application is to finalize and evaluate a customizable electronic pain software program for physicians and their patients to monitor key aspects of chronic pain including pain intensity, mood, activity level, and medication use.

The Specific Aims of Phase I were to: 1) develop a content outline for the full program; 2) develop the design and format of the Web-based program; 3) Develop a script and storyboard for a prototype chapter; 4) production of this prototype chapter on the Web; 5) conduct a feasibility evaluation of the prototype; and 6) develop a plan and schedule for production of the full- length program and CME accreditation in Phase II. These Phase I Aims were achieved. Importantly, the Phase I evaluation established the feasibility of the program and the testing methodology. Knowledge about older driver issues improved on average 25% (ES=1.6) for the physician participants. The Specific Aims of Phase II include: 1) development of content for the full program (10 chapters); 2) based on this material, writing the script and storyboard for the content for each chapter; 3) production of the Web-based program; 4) evaluation of the CME program's effectiveness; and 5) dissemination of the CME program on NERI's E-commerce Website. The objectives of the completed CME program are to increase physician knowledge about issues of driving safety for older adults and to improve communication skills with patients and family about these issues. The effectiveness of the CME program in achieving these objectives will be tested with a pre/posttest design including knowledge questions and audiotaped interviews with a standardized patient. The sample will consist of primary care physicians, the target user sample of the final product, identified through the AMA Physician Masterfile. This project involves close collaboration of NERI, the Boston University School of Medicine, and expert consultants in the field of older drivers and risk factors for auto crashes. The Web-based program will be marketed as a CME product for physicians through NERI's E-commerce Website and the Boston University School of Medicine Office of Continuing Medical Education.",

Using such coding concept can significantly increase the disk data storage density and data access rate based on a modification of existing optical disk recording/readout hardware architecture. The new high density disk drive allows back compatibility with the current DVD disk and has advantage of easier market acceptance for product roll out than other developing storage technologies such as holographic and near field storages. The near term objective is to achieve 50 GB/disk capacity and more than 100 GB/disk is the next foreseeable product goal. If successful,  the outcome of this project will enhance the availability of high-density low cost storage for many social applications, increasing US based data storage technologies, and increasing US jobs. It will have extensive commercial and military applications such as computer data storage, on-line storage, library archival applications, image storage, and processing for medical applications, and military target identification and fast access to large intelligent databases.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Published studies indicate that visible wavelength reflectance and fluorescence spectroscopy are each promising techniques for clinically recognizing vulnerable plaque (VP) - a condition prone to rupture and produce arterial thrombosis. Reflectance is already visually accessible in normal angioscopy, and yellow lipid may be seen diffusely through an otherwise white fibrous cap, depending on its thickness, and form a qualitative indication for VP. Progress toward a clinically useful instrument for recognizing VP by quantified spectroscopy requires an arterial, optical-fiber based side-looking probe (SLP). It is a primary goal of the Phase-2 program to accomplish this by building on the Phase-1 tissue-probe-spectroscopy modeling, probe construction techniques developed, and probe - tissue measurements obtained. In the Phase-2 program three SLP designs will be produced and clinically tested in peripheral arteries. The data will be reduced to provide spectrally resolved diffuse reflectance and intrinsic fluorescence. Comparison will be made to results from concurrent Monte Carlo modeling, results from pathology, and results from the measurements of others with respect to characterizing the tissue and recognizing lesions with thin fibrous caps with a significant lipid core - hallmarks of VP. We expect that bringing together the colorimetry information with intrinsic fluorescence will produce results better than either alone.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Influenza is characterized by recurrent annual epidemics and periodic major worldwide pandemics. Because of the high disease-related morbidity and mortality, direct and indirect socio-economic impacts of influenza are enormous. In the last 100 years, there have been 3 major influenza pandemics. It has been about thirty years since the last pandemic. A new pandemic is considered imminent and one of the biggest challenges facing public health systems today. With recent technical progress, it has also become possible for bio-terrorists to create potential pandemic viral strains faster than natural evolution of the viruses. Therefore, a broad-spectrum therapeutic/prophylactic product for influenza is critically needed. We have identified a drug lead, Fludase(tm), which targets on all strains and subtypes of influenza including the potential pandemic strains. With the funding from a Phase I Biodefense SBIR application, we have demonstrated its efficacy against a variety of influenza viruses. Unlike the currently available Flu vaccines, Fludase(tm) does not need to be updated yearly. Fludase(tm) can be produced cost effectively and can be readily available at the onset of a natural pandemic or bio-warfare, and for annual epidemics. As a protein-based therapeutic agent administered topically and locally, Fludase(tm) can also potentially avoid the side effects and the risk of generating drug resistant viruses associated with the currently available expensive antiviral compounds. The objective of this grant application is to complete all necessary pre-clinical development and to initiate early stage clinical development of Fludase(tm).",

Silicon imagers are widely used, from supermarket scanners to the ultra-sensitive charge-coupled devices (CCDs) used in astronomy.  Germanium is photo-sensitive over a wider spectrum, from visible to well into the infrared. Combining this new spectral capability with fine-line silicon manufacturing brings high resolution, high reliability and lower costs to infrared imaging, enabling new applications, especially in dentistry and medicine. Short-wave infrared (SWIR) imagers today using exotic materials have limited resolution and are too costly for widespread use. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to design a prototype silicon-imaging array for use with integrated germanium pixels.  The proposed project has broad impact. The short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral range from 800 to 1600 nanometer (nm) holds considerable scientific and applied interest. The human eye does not focus wavelengths past 1.4 micron, so that infrared imaging using active illumination with bright flashes is possible without endangering safety. The most promising immediate application is dental imaging, where the transparency of tooth enamel at 1300 nm allows improved diagnostics through infrared imaging.",

Availability of this material could result in the manufacture of pollution monitoring, industrial process monitoring, and defense-related products for the identification and quantification of analytes of importance to these markets. Currently available Raman spectroscopy systems provide detection of a broad range of analytes and have met with commercial success but are limited in sensitivity due to the inherent weakness of the Raman scattering phenomenon. They are also limited in their ability to differentiate analytes in complex matrices. SERS offers a means of overcoming these limitations but has been plagued by poor repeatability and limited availability of suitable substrates.  Suspending noble metal particles in an inert matrix could allow their functionalization for analyte sensitivity.  The use of free floating and matrix-bound noble metal particles as SERS substrates has been demonstrated by other researchers but has not yet provided the reliability that is required for industrial and military applications. SERS has remained an \"almost-commercial\" technology for a number of years. It is believed that this material is a platform technology for the widespread investigation and commercialization.   These enhancements and the increased understanding and control of the SERS effect provide should result in dramatic improvements in the sensitivity, selectivity, and cost of monitoring and detection systems for many Raman-active analytes of military and industrial importance.",

The continuing drive for denser integrated circuits and faster interconnects requires the development of new interlayer dielectric materials. The proposed materials rely on newly defined, so called Iptymer molecular design concepts, to create intrinsic free volume within the material. This approach is distinctly different than the current methods under investigation that introduce extrinsic pores into a material to lower its dielectric constant. The standout thermal stability, mechanical strength, and processability of Iptymer materials will enable facile integration into semiconductor fabrication processes. The research objectives of the Phase II program will introduce and supply Iptymer materials into semiconductor fabrication process development programs. This effort builds on Phase I results that demonstrated scaled synthesis of key Iptymer monomers and polymers and validated the dielectric performance, mechanical strength and processability of Iptymer polymers. The Phase II program will demonstrate pilot production of Iptymer materials that possess a dielectric constant less than 2.0 and have superior mechanical and thermal integrity. In addition integration of Iptymers in semiconductor fabrication processes will be demonstrated. Commercially, the impact of reliable low-k dielectric materials is considerable. Higher bandwidth processing and communication for the same cost will be possible with improved materials. Present day microprocessors have a range of clock speeds determined from post-fabrication testing. Superior low- dielectric materials will not  only increase the ultimate clock speeds, but will also improve the yield of the highest speed devices. Every country, economic group, and industry will benefit from such advances. The societal benefits realized through the extension of electronic tools into areas where their use is now impractical or not affordable will be tremendous.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The clinical significance of chronic pro-inflammatory reactions in hemodialysis patients due to exposure to endotoxins has become a central issue in nephrology in recent years. The European Renal Association urges the routine use of ultrapure dialysate with bacteria and endotoxin levels < 0.1 cfu/ml and < 0.03 EU/ml, respectively. The American Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) considered making similar recommendations for the United States, but chose not to do so at the time since many dialysis clinics would not be able to achieve this high level of dialysate purity without major changes in equipment and operating procedures. Recently, AAMI reduced its recommended levels of dialysate bacteria level from 2000 cfu/ml to 200 cfu/ml, and introduced an endotoxin limit of 2 EU/ml. The comparable European levels are 100 cfu/ml and 0.25 EU/ml for bacteria and endotoxins, respectively. To consistently achieve such high-purity levels in dialysate, two major challenges need to be overcome by dialysis clinics, namely: i) prevention of biofilm formation on surfaces of water systems in contact with liquids used to make the dialysate, and ii) ability to adhere to a standardized maintenance protocol to satisfy such low level of contamination. During the Phase I study, we developed a new technology based on the turbulent two-phase flow cleaning method that proved to remove more than 99% of mature biofilm from the distribution loops of a simulated dialysis center water system (DCWS), and with complete killing of any remaining surface bacteria. In the Phase II study, we propose to complete the development of the two-phase cleaning process and to develop an automated clean-inplace/ sanitize-in-place (CIP/SIP) system capable of delivering a validated cleaning/disinfecting cycle to all the components of the DCWS, including: RO distribution loop, bicarbonate distribution loop, connections to dialysis machines, RO-membrane unit and storage tanks. According to our plan, the distribution loops and connection tubing to dialysis machines will be cleaned and disinfected with the two-phase flow process, while storage tanks will be cleaned with a spray system, but without the need to fill such tanks. The entire cleaning/disinfection will be performed with the automated CIP/SIP system. The proposed system will perform a validated maintenance protocol with minimal labor requirements and in shorter times. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1 - To develop the cleaning procedure and analytical methodologies for each component of the DCWS using the simulated system developed in the Phase I study; Aim 2 - To develop an automated clean-in-place/sanitize-in-place (CIP/SIP) system, including: flow and chemical control, cycle steps and sequence, process indicators and parameters; Aim 3 - To validate the cleaning procedure for each dialysis water system component, including: distribution loops, connections to dialysis machines, storage tanks, and RO-membrane unit; Aim 4 - To verify the validated cleaning process and protocol in the clinical setting; and Aim 5 - To define water system designs and cleaning/disinfecting protocols necessary to consistently deliver high quality dialysate in the clinical setting.",

This project addresses this need by combining a novel tunable single-frequency, mid-infrared laser source with cavity ringdown spectroscopy.  The combination will allow many important atmospheric constituents (including formaldehyde, CO, ethylene, acetylene, and N2O) to be monitored with unprecedented sensitivity (less than 25 pptv mixing ratio) in real time (less than 30 seconds).  In Phase I, a single-frequency infrared laser source, operating in the 2.65 micron spectral region, was constructed and fully characterized.

The source was combined with cavity enhanced spectroscopy to demonstrate the sensitive detection of water vapor isotopes.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infigen will use SBIR grant support to develop a model for evaluating the molecular events associated with cellular reprogramming that enables early determination of a cell's probability of developing into a desired organism or tissue. No such model has been reported to date, impeding rational approaches to development of emerging health care applications dependent upon proper reprogramming, such as cell based therapeutics and nuclear transfer technologies. Infigen's proposed model will focus on bovine and pig embryos that are candidates for nuclear transfer and will provide the ability to systematically classify the cells of such embryos for developmental competence--the ability to develop to live birth. However, the model will be designed for applications to all cell types, providing a means to assess the ability of cells to dedifferentiate and re-differentiate into specific desired cell types and tissues. Phase I studies will identify genes reflecting reprogramming competence and confirm that donor cell lines of known classes can be distinguished based on protein expression patterns. Results from these studies will be used in Phase II to develop a donor cell line reprogramming \"chip\" that can predict the competence of a donor cell line to be reprogrammed. The technology will be commercialized through applications in Infigen's own proprietary nuclear transfer cloning technologies for biopharmaceutical production, xenotransplantation, and animal research models, and through strategic alliances with firms developing various applications that can take advantage of the new platform, particularly cell-based therapeutics.",

This instrument will take advantage of fluorescence lifetime probes designed for microscopy and analytical chemistry to measure cell volume, oxygen, concentration of electrolytes, pH, and other variables of importance in and on live eyes in animals and eventually humans. This will have obvious applications in eye research and may eventually have applications in disease diagnosis and monitoring. This instrument will also be useful in the measurement of endogenous fluorescence. Thus, autofluorescence of cornea and lens are elevated in diabetes while fluorescent retinal lipofuscins are implicated in the pathogenesis of Age Relate Macular Degeneration. During Phase I, we demonstrated feasibility of this technique in the eye. We have developed a particularly sensitive method for measurement fluorescence lifetimes that is uniquely suited for ocular applications. The eye poses challenges of limited entrance aperture, potential movement, and limited tolerance to light exposure both in terms of intensity and duration. Our overall goal will be to produce a standardized instrument and to develop protocols for making fluorescent lifetime measurements using endogenous or exogenous fluorescent molecules in or on the eye. A critical goal will be standardization and calibration control, so that results made on different machines are comparable. In addition, we will design this instrument with enough flexibility so that we can add capabilities as new fluorescence lifetime probes are developed, and our customers can develop techniques of their own.",

Compared to current electrical data buses using copper interconnects or conventional fiber optic links, the V-EML will enable the fabrication of higher speed, lower cost, lower power consumption and smaller optical transmitters for multi-channel fiber optic data buses in computer and communication networks. This technology virtually removes the modulation speed limit of VCSEL optical transmitters. At the same time it maintains high channel density at low cost. The low power consumption of the V-EML (~20 mW) and its potential low cost in volume (~$1.0) will provide a solution to the interconnect speed and power barriers in multiprocessor computers and servers. An array spacing of 50 to 100 microns will be possible with V-EMLs.  This means that an 8x8 array with 2.5 Tbps of capacity has less than 1.0 mm2 of footprint.  This offers substantial space savings over the existing copper interconnect technology and creates another strong incentive for transition. This technology could provide societal benefits from the commercialization of this technology by enabling faster and more widespread deployment of broadband services. The potential for ultra-fast delivery of audiovisual information is enormous as the V-EML technology helps to remove data-com bottlenecks. Educational and scientific benefits of the V-EML development arise in the area of supercomputers with sufficient computing power for complex scientific simulations. Applications include climate modeling for better predictions, molecular level modeling such as protein folding in medicine, ecosystem modeling in agriculture, and large-scale analysis of business information and economic statistics. These computers could then operate much faster and much more efficiently when interconnect speed limits are increased.",

Present passive pulse compressors produce a power gain of about 3:1, in return for a 4:1 compression in pulse width.  Active pulse compressors are predicted to have a capability for much larger compression ratios, with high efficiencies as well.  Therefore, this project aims to develop a fast, ferroelectric X-band switch for activating a pulse compressor with the ability to switch several times during the input pulse, thereby allowing efficiency values >90%.  In Phase I, computational techniques were used to refine the design of the ferroelectric switch, in order to minimize losses and thereby increase device efficiency.  Fabrication techniques for large (10-cm diameter) ferroelectric rings were demonstrated, and a plan was formulated for testing high-power versions of the switch in the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) magnicon facility.  In Phase II, fabrication, sintering, and finishing techniques will be used to produce a quantity of ferroelectric rings needed for the switches.  An engineering design for manufacturing the switches will be developed, and at least two switches will be built.  The switches will be tested at NRL up to an input power level of 50 MW.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Hundreds of active microwave switches could be used in a future multi-TeV linear collider, or other high-gradient room-temperature linear accelerator, representing a market of millions of dollars.  Other commercial and military applications of rapid, efficient active switches using ferroelectrics at other frequencies and powers also exist, representing additional market potential.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this research is to identify putative drug treatments in the pre-clinical setting that can rapidly translate into post-withdrawal pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine (METH) addiction. Methamphetamine is an increasingly popular psychostimulant/hallucinogenic drug with an extremely high abuse liability. Presently, there is no cure for METH addiction. Indeed, the overwhelming majority (up to 85 percent) of patients undergoing modern-day drug rehabilitation relapse back into compulsive drug taking. Phase I studies have revealed that post-withdrawal administration of the 5-HT antagonist mianserin and mirtazapine, but not ketanserin reversed the sensitized behaviors established by METH, The establishment of the behavioral and biochemical paradigms at Solentix was successfully completed in 6 months and baseline as well as compound profiles have been generated for the agents mianserin, mirtazapine and ketanserin. The present SBIR grant phase II is posed to extend these basic questions to the clinical/commercial arena, with the objective of developing novel or identified 5-HT antagonists as potential treatments of METH addiction. A companion R01 grant has been awarded and initiated by Dr. Napier and will allow extensive basic research questions to be addressed on the involvement of 5-HT mechanisms and METH addiction, while the current SBIR grant will target commercialization activities of identified drug treatments. In addition, we have identified novel chemical structures that would be synthesized with the focused goal of developing the best pharmacological profile for reversal of METH-induced sensitization behavioral and biochemical events.    The unique strengths of this grant are the focus on the drug-induced neuroadaptive changes in the brain, which will allow agents to be selected for METH drug addiction. The following aims are proposed: Five Specific Aims are proposed for the present SBIR Phase II. Specific Aims include: 1) Rodent behavioral METH-sensitization testing; 2) Novel chemistry synthesis; A patent has been filed to provide for the development of a large library of novel 5-HT compounds with specific substitutions that would provide unique receptor selectivity profiles. 3) In vitro drug screening and profiling; 4) Ex vivo CNS penetration testing; and 5) Drug Candidate - Biochemical & Electrophysiological Testing. The overall phase II SBIR goals will be to establish additional or novel drug candidates for METH addiction therapy through internal Omeros drug discovery efforts. The results of this research may also be utilized to explore additional therapeutic treatments for other drugs of abuse and subsequent identification of novel therapies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Omicia, Inc. intends to deliver genomic information services to individuals that allows them to make use of current genetic and clinical research better to manage their health. The motivation behind Phase II of this SBIR grant is to finalize the mapping and annotation of Mendelian mutations as tabulated in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (\"OMIM\") database within the current human genome sequence assembly. In addition, modified mapping methods are also used to include individual mutations from the Human Genome Mutation Database (\"HGMD\"), as well as polymorphisms from databases such as dbSNP.  A key aspect of research in genetics is the association of sequence variation with disease genes and phenotypes. Sequence variation data is currently available from OMIM, HGMD and others, both of which provide phenotypic information and describe amino acid variation. Unfortunately, in most cases these variation references do not provide sufficient information to support their direct mapping onto current genomic sequences and the associated annotated genes. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data is held in dbSNP and other publicly accessible databases. While these databases contain millions of entries each including the position of the SNP on the genome, they do not provide significant phenotypic information about the SNPs. In order to use these databases to deliver accurate and reliable genomic information to individuals, these gaps must be resolved.  The specific aims of this Phase II program are: first, to finalize the implementation from Phase I of a software system to support the mutation mapping and annotation from various databases; second, to map uniquely and accurately the positions of mutations associated with a human phenotype onto the human genome assembly using a computer-assisted expert driven manual approach; third, and finally, to capture the mutation-disease associations for each of these markers in a meaningful and electronically tractable way using links to the MeSH disease ontology. An initial selected set of 97 disease genes, developed during Phase I, will be used to validate each software development step. The goal of the project is to map and clinically annotate a very comprehensive set of disease genes estimated to be between 2,000 - 3,000 genes.  The deliverables from this project will become integral components of Omicia's business of delivering broad-based, personalized, genetic profile information to its customers. Furthermore, Omicia expects to license its genotype-phenotype database and Biofinormatics infrastructure to interested commercial entities in biotechnology and Pharma. An initial collaboration project with a small biotechnology company, Human Genetic Signatures Pty. Ltd., has already started.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Strategies aimed at limiting and repairing the damage attributed to oxidative stress may slow the advance of numerous age-related diseases. Numerous studies indicate that the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is induced by oxidative stress, contributes to oxidative stress, and promotes subsequent neuronal injury. In this application we propose continuation of our studies carried out under a Phase I SBIR grant to identify suitable COX-2 inhibitor new chemical entities (NCEs) to address oxidative stress-induced damage to the neuronal cells. The overall aim of the proposed grant application is to advance our initial discovery of a novel activity toward a clinical application of these NCEs. During the Phase I grant period, we established that certain Onconova COX-2 inhibitors (analogs of the ON 09 and ON 26 series), but not other commercially available COXibs, prevented oxidative stress-induced programmed neuronal cell death in vitro. Additionally, we demonstrated that systemic administration of naproxen, a non-selective COX inhibitor, partially but potently prevented the injury induced by direct intrahippocampal injection of the glutamate agonist, N-methyl- D-Aspartate (NMDA). Thus, the objectives of this Phase II research plan of study are as follows: 1) to determine the therapeutic potential of a novel COX-2 compound (ON 26040) against oxidative stress-induced neuronal injury in vivo. Studies will be undertaken to identify whether ON 26040 can effectively prevent injury induced by a) direct hippocampal injection of NMDA and/or b) striatal injury associated with systemic injection of 3-nitroproprionic acid; 2) To identify the molecular mechanism mediating the neuroprotective effects of ON 26040 in vitro. Studies will utilize the HCA injury model to analyze COX-dependent and/or -independent mechanisms of death suppression. Specifically, the ability of ON 26040 to modulate the Akt/PKB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signal transduction pathways will be explored; 3) to develop a pre-clinical safety and pharmacology profile of ON 26040 for regulatory submission. Studies will involve short term (7 day) and long term (28 day) repeat dose toxicology studies in rats and dogs and complete pharmacological assessment in both in vitro and in vivo models (rodents and canines). Specifically, this complete pre-clinical evaluation package will permit filing of an Investigational New Drug (ND) application for human clinical studies; and 4) To develop a clinical Phase I protocol for testing the safety of ON 26040 in human volunteers. This will involve selection of appropriate clinical therapeutic indication based on animal models and the establishment of dosing, testing and monitoring guidelines for an FDA and IRB approved study to be conducted following the completion of studies proposed herein.",

The objective of this project will be the industrial fabrication of holographic multi-spectral filters by using the methods developed and demonstrated during the phase I SBIR research. There is a strong scientific and public push in astronomy to look deeper into the universe to discover and observe fascinating phenomena such as the birth of stars and exo-planets. In observations of celestial bodies from ground telescopes, the signal is faint and surrounded with unwanted optical noise from the atmosphere. The hydroxyl  (OH) radicals present in the atmosphere emit light in hundreds of narrow lines that dominate the inter-line sky emission by many orders of magnitude. The multi-spectral rejection filter demonstrated in phase I discriminates the narrow spectral features of the OH emission lines from the atmosphere which increases the image sharpness by increasing the signal to noise ratio. The narrow band grating filter technology is a core platform that has a scientific and economic impact on ground-based astronomy as well as in laser diode systems. To date $3.8 Billion has been spent deploying and maintaining the Hubble Telescope. An estimated $2.2 Billion is required to see it to its final scheduled retiring date of 2010.  It is believed that the introduction of the these multi-line filters combined in some cases with adaptive optics, can boost the performance of ground based telescopes so that they can approach the performance of space telescopes at a price more than 1000 times lower.",

The system has already been applied to low-resolution typing (e.g. for preliminary screening of bone marrow donors), and will be further developed to provide allele-level typing information that is important to improve the clinical outcome of BMT, particularly for the HLA-DRB1 locus (which affects the incidence of Graft vs. Host Disease (GvHD). Over the 3-year project period, HLA-A and -B group-specific typing assays will be added for resolution of serological ambiguities such as Bw4, Bw6, and high resolution typing of HLA-C following National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) priorities. To complete product line capabilities for HLA typing, generic kits will also be developed for DPB1, DQA1, and DPA1 (DQB1 and DRB3,4,5 were already produced). Additional work will be aimed at rSSO typing of the KIR region genes, since recent evidence has shown a beneficial effect of mismatching for these genes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, where a Graft vs Leukemia (GvL) effect was noted to reduce the recurrence of leukemia. The application of a high throughput multiplexed assay to this clinical testing offers the advantage of both cost and labor savings, as well as enabling the resolution of many typing ambiguities observed with current methods such as sequence based typing. In particular, the use of proprietary gap-primers and gap-probes allows for fewer rounds of PCR amplification to achieve the desired rSSO typing. In addition, primers for KIR will be designed to allow for multiplex PCR of the various loci. Finally, analytical software will be developed, which will require new algorithms for assignment of KIR typing results, due to the multiple and variable number of alleles expressed for each individual. Following validation testing and regulatory clearance, a complete line of superior HLA and KIR typing products will be available to the NMDP and HLA laboratories.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Respiratory disease remains the primary cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide due to infectious disease such as community acquired respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Beta-lactam or macrolide antibiotics are currently, a first line of treatment for most RTIs, however, a considerable number of pathogens are developing resistance to these current treatments. A primary resistant mechanism of bacteria towards macrolide/ketolide antibiotics is through target modification (rRNA methylation) whereby 5-O-sugar substituent (desosamine) plays a critical role. Under Phase I, unprecedented macrolide medicinal chemistry was successfully developed that enabled the synthesis of novel 5-O-sugar modified ketolide derivatives that displayed excellent activity against macrolide-resistant bacteria. The specific aims of this Phase II proposal are to continue our progress toward identifying a preclinical drug candidate through a series of chemistry lead optimization experiments. The continued medicinal chemistry efforts to improve in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity will not only be guided by in-house minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC ) determinations (against primary and secondary panels) and in vivo oral efficacy experiments using relevant disease infection models, but in addition, will be guided by computer simulated ligand-receptor docking experiments utilizing computer aided molecular design (CAMD), thus allowing for rational based glycodesigri of our antibacterial analogues. The lead compounds will be further evaluated by obtaining important MIC50/90 data against relevant pathogens (Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Staphylococcus) and by determining important animal-plasma and -lung pharmacokinetic parameters. Phase II funding will also support studies to determine resistance development and the potential for cross-resistance between our lead compounds and other leading macrolides/ketolides, an important criteria for assessing a compound's future marketability. Finally, preliminary safety will be assessed of our most promising leads by performing mammalian cell cytotoxicity assays and by determining acute oral toxicity in rodents.",

        "abstract": "A novel Decision Theoretics algorithm based on cascaded generalized and Bayesian likelihood tests in a Neyman-Pearson detection was demonstrated under Phase-I.  OKSI demonstrated  EO/IR subpixel target detection, identification, and countermeasure mitigation.  The algorithm was tested with the airborne HYDICE sensor and the Forest Radiance data set.  Detector ROC curves were developed to establish the detection probability (Pd) under a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) for various sensor signal-to-noise (SNR) values.  Background statistics were established using a novel in-scene technique by first creating the target subspace, and second, projecting the scene into an independent subspace.  Specific target subspaces can be generated from the Red Team-provided data, and engagement scenario simulations. During the proposed Phase-II, the operability of the algorithm will be tested under more stressing and BMDS-relevant engagement scenarios, with real sensor operating factors such as PSF, reduced number of bands, broader bandpass, etc.  OKSI will work with Project Hercules Blue and Red Teams and the Corporate Clutter Working Group (CCWG) to establish realistic threat signatures and demonstrate target detection, discrimination, and countermeasure and clutter mitigation capabilities.  Also, working with the Decision Architecture (DA) Team, OKSI will contribute to the physics-based discrimination and EO/IR sensor integration.  The proposed technology is applicable to all phases of the BMDS and the various support sensors such as DSP, STSS, SBIR High, CB, HALO-I/II, and AIRS, as well as the KV onboard-sensors for plume-to-hardbody handover and aim point selection (boost, exo-atmpshperic, and terminal intercept), and finally, in closely spaced object conditions.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  An \"instant electrophoresis\" (IE) device is being developed for low-cost, convenient, small-scale sample cleanup. The device, comprised of small units that snap together, fills a gap in the field of electrophoresis. This is because sample cleanup is expensive or impractical to perform with current electrophoresis devices. In Phase I, a process was developed to produce prototype IE devices simply and inexpensively, and these were used to purify (to >99% purity at 59-68% recovery) a charged dye from a mixture with a neutral dye. The device provided intrinsic collection chambers. This met the required Specific Aims for Phase I. In Phase II, several modes of IE will be developed, taking advantage of the diversity of ways in which electrophoretic separations can be performed. Applications will be demonstrated to promote the product with an emphasis on initial, partial cleanup of real samples, an area where electrophoresis has played little role. These applications will emphasize methods based on detection by mass spectrometry. This is a good match because the IE device is intended for purification of small samples, and analysis of small samples is a forte of mass spectrometry. The basic IE device from the Phase I project will be applied to a diversity of applications in Phase II. Some of these applications will be repeatedly tested and others will emerge, as the basic IE device undergoes modifications and additions in such features as size, choice of membranes, inclusion of gels, and availability of variants and physical accessories to broaden its usefulness. Commercially-important applications will be emphasized, in areas such as proteomics, drug metabolism, reagent purification, and derivatization. Potentially, the IE device will be used not only by those who already work routinely with electrophoresis, but also by those who would consider it only if it were a simple disposable technique. Chromatography has solid phase extraction and thin layer chromatography as disposable techniques that provide simple or partial purifications. This project brings a corresponding device to electrophoresis. A simple, low cost new tool will become available for removing interfering substances from samples ranging from human plasma to new drug candidates. It will permit the latest methods of analysis to be more effective in the diagnosis of disease and more rapid and sensitive for the development of better drugs for treatment.",

The development of an Aseptic Plant Culture System would provide a mechanism for experimentation as well as for transporting and storing vegetatively propagated plant material in space. Most culture systems are passive, with no environmental monitoring or control. This project proposes to develop an environmental control and monitoring system for sterile culture that can accommodate, without modification, a variety of standard culture vessels. The system would consist of a modular base unit into which culture vessels can be plugged as desired. Multiple vessel sizes and shapes could be accommodated with a generic connector system. Environmental parameters controlled and monitored would include light level and spectral quality, photoperiod, air and media temperature, humidity, and atmospheric composition. Using innovative, high precision miniature environmental control components allows each vessel to maintain independent control setpoints if desired. Subsystem modularity means the system can be reconfigured for use in specific carriers or to meet an investigator's specific need. Particular challenges include development of a miniaturized humidity control system, precise control of the gaseous environment in small volumes, and maintaining sterility for extended periods.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The development of drugs aimed at reducing obesity and controlling eating disorders represents a major target of the pharmaceutical industry and has become one of the most exciting areas in drug discovery. The long term goal of this project is to develop tools for high throughput testing of drug compounds from combinatorial libraries that target G-Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCR's) associated with appetite control and eating behavior. Novel targets for such drug development arise from the recent explosion of information on molecules and neural circuits involved in appetite regulation. This proposal focuses on developing testing platforms for GPCR families associated with feeding behavior. A distinguishing feature of the drug-discovery strategy we are pursuing is that is based on an efficient and highly reliable system that allows multiplexing of receptors in order to test numerous compounds against numerous targets. This strategy has been enabled by a novel transfection technology that is licensed by Originus, Inc. from the University of Michigan termed Surface Transfection and Expression Protocol (STEP), which has significant advantages over transient and even stable expression methods. Under Phase I funding, testing platforms for two GPCR families associated with feeding behavior-the Melanocortin Receptors (MCRs) and the Orexin Receptors (OXRs) were developed. STEP transfection of 384-we 11 microplates to test the expression and ligand activation of individually expressed MCRs and OXRs (Specific Aim 1) and multiplexing via co-expression of multiple MCRs (Specific Aim 2) were validated in two different cell lines. Under Phase II funding, we propose to build on the information from Phase I to validate platforms for other feeding-related GPCRs with different intracellular coupling, to extend the testing to additional cell lines, to develop new assays for HTS, to optimize allelic variants of the GPCRs, and to multiplex GPCRs of the same or different families in physiological relevant combinations. Finally we propose to initiate our own internal efforts for HTS of multiplexed GPCRs with single ligands per microplate well from a small library of known compounds and for ultraHTS (uHTS) of multiplexed GPCRs using pools of drugs from larger chemical libraries in each microplate well. The proposed experiments have been carefully designed based on interactions with many potential business partners and will allow Originus to demonstrate the efficacy of the STEP platforms for screening multiplexed feeding-related GPCRs and other GPCRs outside the immediate area of obesity drug screening. The proposed Phase II work will be the basis for the implementation of more broadly HTS and uHTS of libraries and testing of potential lead compound in collaboration with selected partners during Phase III.",

For many neutron scattering instruments, detector specifications call for high rate capability, large area coverage, high spatial resolution, and low gamma sensitivity.  Currently, no detector satisfies this demanding set of requirements.  To meet this set of requirements, this project will develop a detector consisting of a scintillator with two perpendicular arrays of wavelength-shifting optical fibers.  In this configuration, neutrons are incident on the front face of the scintillator, and scintillation light is collected in two perpendicular arrays of wavelength-shifting (WLS) fibers optically coupled to the scintillator.  The fibers conduct the scintillation light to multi-anode photomultiplier tubes (MAPMTs), which produces analog pulse information that is decoded by electronics to determine the coordinates of the neutron capture event.  Phase I studied the light balance of the scintillator/fiber arrangement and implemented prototype data acquisition electronics and software appropriate for a crossed-fiber readout system.  A prototype scintillator/WLS-fiber detector was built, which demonstrated the feasibility of these technologies. Phase II will design, optimize, and construct a full-scale prototype of a neutron imaging detector with improved position resolution, efficiency, and  maximum counting rate capability. A state-of-art electronics readout system will be developed, and the detector will be thoroughly tested in a thermal neutron beam.

Colorectal cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related death, can be largely prevented by early identification and removal of precursor lesions. Unfortunately, compliance with colorectal cancer screening remains poor. CT colonography is a fast, non-invasive, and safe test that has the potential to significantly increase screening compliance. However, in order for CT colonography to become a primary screening modality, several current limitations must be overcome. This project attempts to overcome those limitations by developing: algorithms for automated polyp detection to assist radiologists in accurately evaluating large numbers of studies from a screening population with low disease prevalence, methods for digital removal of tagged stool to permit testing to be performed without the need for complete evacuation, enhanced workflow tools and improved visualization methods to permit fast and accurate review of the large volumes of data produced by each examination, and provide more detailed quantification of lesions to assist radiologists in identifying specific lesions with the greatest malignant potential.

Under current network technologies, data access is randomly affected by competing traffic, which slows response and makes interactivity next to impossible.  Much of the commercially available, long distance, fiber optic links use SONET (Synchronous Optical NETwork), which lacks a transfer protocol that would allow its characteristics to be used to advantage.  This project will develop a new data transfer protocol, based on SONET frames, to allow low cost, higher speed, and interactive networking between Grid computer systems that are connected through either carrier-provided or customer-provided fiber optic links.  The protocol will be implemented in hardware and will be based on application-to-application communication rather than on computer-to-computer communication, which is used for current operating systems.  Phase I developed a specification for a SONET Application Memory Transport (SAMTP) protocol, along with an appropriate hardware configuration for eventual manufacturing.   In Phase II, protoype hardware boards implementing the SAMTP protocols will be developed suitable for use with an off-the-shelf microprocessor system.  The resulting hardware will be evaluated for performance and application benefits at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratory.

The proposed study uses Perlegen Sciences' high-density oligonucleotide array-based genotyping platform to genotype over 1.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome in the context of a whole-genome association study of late-onset AD. Late-onset AD is a devastating neurodegenerative disease, characterized by the formation of pathogenic plaques in the brain, which affects as many as 10% of people 65 or older. The disease is complex, likely to involve the interaction of a number of genes, including apolipoprotein E, which increases risk and lowers age of onset. Studies aimed at identifying additional late-onset AD-susceptibility genes are ongoing. Using Perlegen Sciences' high-density array technology, SNPs associated with late-onset AD will be identified by measuring SNP allele frequency differences between 400 individuals with late-onset AD (cases) and 400 matched unaffected controls from samples in the NIMH AD Genetics Initiative collection. The initial 1.5 million SNP scan will be performed using separately pooled case and control DNA samples. A subset of these SNPs will be selected for verification based on the largest estimated allele frequency differences, haplotype structure and biological relevance. Genotyping the individual case and control samples, as well as a replicate population will verify the association of these SNPs with late-onset AD. The number of SNPs to be analyzed in this study is orders of magnitude higher than in previously published case-control studies, rendering this the most comprehensive search for genetic loci involved in AD. In addition to providing further evidence regarding the role of previously identified candidate loci, the study may also identify novel associations with unsuspected loci. Identification of new genetic factors associated with AD will  lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease and provide a basis for new approaches to treatment and prevention.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this Phase II project is to further develop and evaluate the efficacy of a computerized self-help cessation intervention for adolescent and young adult smokeless tobacco (ST) users. The program utilizes a small handheld computer to deliver a scheduled gradual reduction of the frequency and duration of dips or chews until cessation is achieved. In Phase I, the feasibility of the program was tested with 30 smokeless tobacco users age 16 to 23 who utilized the program over a six week period. At the end of treatment, 20% of the intent to treat sample and 33% of the treatment completers were continuously abstinent and met 7-day point prevalence abstinence confirmed by saliva cotinine analysis. Those who failed to quit reduced their ST use by 53%. Subjects rated the program positively, but noted that delivery of the program on the prototyping research units used for the study were difficult to carry and hard to use regularly. For Phase II, the program algorithms will be further refined based on Phase I feedback and the program will be ported to a newly developed special purpose device (QuitKey) which is about the size of a keychain FOB and easy to carry. In addition, a snuff can lid holder will be engineered to allow the user to carry the device with their snuff can, thereby further improving ease of use and compliance. The Phase II program will then be evaluated in a multi-site trial of 350 adolescent and young adult ST users. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either a manual self-help program (Enough Snuff) or the QuitKey for Dippers and Chewers (QuitKey DC). ST use and related variables will be assessed at baseline and at 8 and 26 weeks post treatment initiation. The results of the study will provide data on the relative efficacy of these two minimal contacts, self-help treatments for adolescent and young adult ST users, and will determine if the proposed product is a viable cessation option for young ST users for whom few effective cessation options are available. By intervening early in the drug use trajectory of ST users, cessation can be achieved before long-term physical dependence and negative health effects develop.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  PGS has developed an innovative low cost infant monitoring technology that is completely wireless and requires no intimate patient contact. The PGS monitor combines a state-of-the-art FDA pre-market approved wireless noninvasive inductive respiration sensor with new photo sensor technology for acquiring heart rate, eliminating wires and electrodes. As medical advances improve, the survival rates of pre-term and low birth weight infants in the U.S. continue to rise along with the need for cost effective monitoring.  A phase I feasibility study conducted at Children's National Medical Center, Washington D.C. demonstrated that a viable and stable physiological pulse pressure waveform could reliably be acquired at the umbilicus area of the abdomen on low birth-weight infants in the hospital's NICU. The abdominal area was previously deemed inappropriate for monitoring. We further combined the cardiac sensor with the existing PGS wireless inductive respiration sensor. The clinical data collected in the phase I study demonstrated that the PGS motion artifact rejection performance was superior to the reference pulse oximeter monitor.  A phase II study is proposed to refine the PGS monitor design and to validate the event detection and recording features in a variety of care settings. Research activities will focus on 1) technical development, which will employ design guidelines to meet substantial equivalence to existing monitors and 2) clinical study, which is structured to support the clinical requirements for an FDA 510(k) application. These goals will be accomplished through a 9-month hardware and software development phase followed by two clinical studies. The long term goals will be to demonstrate the utility, ease of use and ultimate cost savings benefit to the current monitoring programs utilized in hospitals.",

Key to establishing the benefits of emerging therapies are: good adherence to clinical protocols, low index measurement variance & high correlation between multi-center clinical sites. Plaque volume, composition and size are currently employed as primary and secondary indices of performance. IVUS, the current imaging standard for late stage coronary disease, is invasive and suffers from deficiencies that limit both performance and patient enrollment during clinical trials. MRI, optimized for plaque visualization and quantification provides a non invasive alternative to IVUS, especially in carotid applications. Advanced ALP phantoms, properly employed, will help achieve statistically conclusive results speeding the development of cardiovascular therapies in less time at lower costs. Proposed project goals are to develop an advanced class of Atherosclerotic Lesion Phantoms (ALP) for use RLT clinical trials. In Phase I, proof-of-concept was established and innovative manufacturing techniques introduced. Phase II technical aims, address performance requirements requested by Pharmaceutical partners: 1) designs based on clinical data, 2) defined plaque morphologies, representing two lesion types including three key plaque components associated with risk, 3) supporting environment which reproduces difficulties associated with clinical imaging (anatomic clutter, blood flow, vessel & patient motion, 4) advanced materials and manufacturing procedures compatible with multiple vascular beds (carotid, coronary). Prototypes are constructed and evaluated at sites currently involved in pharmaceutical trials. The current domestic market for selected cholesterol therapies exceeds $19 Billion. Each additional day a clinical trial must run requires $4 million in expenditures and lost revenue. If successful, ALP will fulfill an unmet clinical need, resulting in significant monetary and societal benefits.",

The special needs of people with disabilities, in this case both impaired mobility due to spasticity and impaired feeding due to dysphagia, are often overlooked. This project will solve an important problem for people in this group by developing a liquid formulation of baclofen, the first-line anti-spastic medication, which can be administered through feeding tubes. The generic status of most spasticity drugs has limited additional formulation research because large drug companies have little incentive to pursue the relatively small market. Commercialization of a liquid formulation of baclofen, however, will improve both the quality and the cost of drug delivery. Quality is increased by a more extensive knowledge base about the interactions between baclofen and commonly used enteral feeding tubes. Cost of drug delivery is reduced at several levels. Caregivers across the U.S. will save thousands of hours of drug preparation time, valued at more than $50 million per year. Phase I of this SBIR will complete prototype drug development to identify a commercially feasible formula for this small molecule drug. The investigational design, research methods and analyses follow FDA guidelines, and have been successfully used by other businesses to obtain FDA marketing approval and commercialize their products. Phase I will also establish the bioequivalence analysis protocol to be followed in Phase II, and perform an initial feeding tube compatibility study with lead prototype drug candidates. To lower costs, Phase V Pharmaceuticals is partnering with a well-established pharmaceutical development company that will provide specialized equipment and skills.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Approximately 8% of adults in the U.S. suffer from type 2 diabetes. Treatment prevents some of its devastating complications, but does not usually restore normal glycemia or eliminate adverse consequences. Hence, prevention is preferable. Evidence from two large, well-controlled trials indicates that type 2 diabetes can be delayed, and possibly prevented, through lifestyle interventions. Nutrition and exercise to achieve a healthy weight are key behavioral interventions in preventing diabetes. However, this evidence has not diffused well into clinical practice. Clinic-based weight management programs are expensive, difficult to deliver on a population basis and are not typically structured to meet the unique needs of medically underserved and Hispanic populations. (Prevalence of diabetes is especially high among Hispanic adults.)         The goal of this proposal is to test the efficacy of a practical and easily delivered intervention for weight management in a balanced randomized controlled trial, involving 150 people in each of two study arms (control group and intervention group) for a total of 300 patients. This study will target medically underserved patients with a risk for diabetes. The primary outcomes will be to reduce their weight and improve glucose metabolism. The intervention will utilize an interactive computer-based software program to tailor the intervention to the unique needs of each patient. This system was developed under a Phase I SBIR award (1 R43- DK066711-01A1). Evidence-based behavioral models that hold promise for helping individuals make changes to better manage body weight will be applied. This system is designed to operate on clinic-based personal computers and will provide individual assessment and tailored, real-time and feedback reports to patients and physician reports outlining key areas for patient improvement and counseling suggestions for practitioners.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop process technology for removing photoresist from semiconductor wafers at high speed while not damaging underlying materials. This process technology can be readily integrated into existing single wafer wet processing tools. The development of higher performance semiconductor devices with smaller feature sizes has driven the adoption of copper and low-k dielectric materials that are susceptible to damage by traditional oxygen plasma based resist removal processes. While other low temperature plasma processes are being explored as low damage alternatives, appreciably lower resist removal rates (1,000 to 2,000 A /min) are a significant limitation. In response to this challenge the company successfully developed a new ozone-water based single wafer process chemistry which does not damage low k dielectric materials such as Black Diamond (TM), and does not corrode copper. In phase I this process achieved an etch rate greater than 8,000 A /min. The phase II research will concentrate on the early integration of the process hardware and process technology into a commercial single wafer spin processing system, the further development of process capabilities using 300 mm customer wafers, and the placement of three systems at customer sites for evaluation.  Commercially, the successful completion of this research program will culminate in the development of a new single wafer process technology for use in the manufacture of the high-density semiconductor devices with feature sizes below 90 nm. Nearly all of the new manufacturing capacity is built for 300 mm wafer fabrication at the leading edge technology node. In addition to direct sales of $60 to $120 million per year of new wafer processing equipment incorporating this technology, this project will enable the productivity benefits and reduction in unit manufacturing costs provided by the early migration to the next technology node. In addition, the innovative copper compatible cleaning chemistry developed here holds promise for corrosion free cleaning and surface treatment of copper in other electronic device manufacturing applications. Finally, this process uses an environmentally benign \"green\" chemistry.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop novel graded-index (GIN) structures for blue/UV light emitting diodes (LEDs).  Solidstate LEDs (SSLs) are among the most efficient converters of electrical energy into light and additionally have the advantages of long lifetime, excellent reliability, low power consumption, light weight, small size and excellent resistance to mechanical shock and vibration. These significant benefits over conventional lighting explain why, according to a recent study, the average growth rate for the SSL market is expected to be around 200% per year for the next five years.Since LEDs are narrow-band emitters, they must be coupled to an efficient downconverting phosphor in order to achieve the broad emission necessary for the generation of white light. However, even for a perfect phosphor, high efficiency will not be achievable unless there is also efficient out-coupling of radiation from the LED into the phosphor and from the phosphor to air. The resulting losses associated with outcoupling are due to the difference in refractive indices (n) of adjacent material layers that cause Fresnel Reflections and total internal reflection (TIR).  In Phase I the research team has developed unique material structures and electrophoretic (EP) deposition process that are expected to realize high out-coupling efficiencies from LEDs at low costs. During Phase I, the feasibility of the EP deposition process has been successfully demonstrated and the advantage of an index-matching structure has been shown to significantly (~50%) improve the light extraction efficiency in LEDs.  This fact was demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically using ray tracing simulations. In Phase II the work will focus on refining these structures for blue/UV LED's to develop the efficient down- converting technology for enabling the new solid state lighting systems. Commercially if SSL technology can achieve this projected goal, the lighting industry would be revolutionized. Potentially an efficiency of 200lm/W is possible, more than 2X better than that of fluorescent lamps (80lm/W), and more than 10X better than that of incandescent lamps (15lm/W). If current lighting, with an aggregate efficiency of roughly 50lm/W (in between the efficiencies of fluorescent and incandescent lamps),  were replaced by semiconductor lighting with an aggregate efficiency of 150lm/W (somewhat less than the target), then the electricity currently used for illumination would decrease by a factor of three, from 2,350TWh to 780TWh. This would represent a decrease in global electricity use of 13%, and a decrease in global energy use and associated carbon emissions of 2.3%. In the U.S., the potential reduction in electricity consumption due to lighting is expected to be as high as 50% by the year 2025.",

Phase I demonstrated the concept of WDM GSE lasers in a cross-grating configuration emitting two wavelengths separated by 9 nm from a common two-dimensional photonic lattice (2D-PL) aperture that can be efficiently coupled to multi- and single-mode fiber.  A low-cost package that can couple 2, 4 and 8 independent wavelengths from one or more 2D-PL GSE lasers directly to a single fiber without multiplexers will also be developed on this program.    The knowledge required to develop these lasers requires expertise in materials, optics, gratings, nanostructures, semiconductor processing, thermal transfer, high-speed electronics, packaging, systems and telecommunications.    Combining the desirable traits of both edge emitting lasers  (high power, reliable material, low voltage, use of proven) and vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers  (low cost, wafer level testing, simple packaging, high integration ability), the advanced research proposed is an innovative photonics technology that has broad applications in telecommunications, information processing, data communications, fiber to the business and home, scientific and medical instrumentation, and computations. A broader impact of this project is the realization of very high data rates at very low cost, and the elimination of barriers to deploying fiber to the desktop and to (or closer to) the home, enabling ultra high bandwidth connections for business, distance learning, entertainment, and computing.    Each wavelength of the 2D-PL GSE laser can presently be modulated at 3.125 Gbps and has the potential for 10 Gbps, enabling data rates of 6.25 to 80 Gbps over a single fiber from a single transmitter package.

This disease involves intense neovascularization of the retina and leads to retinal detachment. Another cause of blindness is corneal neovascularization, which often results from injury and infection in the cornea. Current mammalian models for ocular neovascularization require lengthy, tedious surgical manipulation and do not always result in improved vision; an alternative rapid, less invasive animal model for studying the process of ocular neovascularization and assessing drug effects will facilitate identification of new therapeutics.

No instrument is available for undisturbed and painless blood collection from unanesthetized and unrestrained laboratory rodents 3-4 times a day over long-term experiments. To address this need, Physical Optics Corporation proposes to design, develop, and fabricate a new portable Laser Lancing Device (LLD) for painless and rapid (1-1.5 min.) collection of serial blood samples from the tails of unanesthetized rodents.

Existing in situ optical instruments, used on research aircraft and on the ground for measuring the drop size distribution of water clouds, are inherently limited in the volume \u00c2\u00bf and thus drop size \u00c2\u00bf they can measure.

This project will develop a new holographic water drop size measurement system with high-resolution (less than a micron), a highly sensitive (0.1 microjoule exposure level per square centimeter) photothermoplastic recording material for the hologram, and a high-speed and high-resolution CMOS camera for image recording and processing.

The system will be designed so that the haptic feedback device can be mounted at different locations in the mannequin for simulation of epidural needle insertion at different intervertebral joints by both the median and paramedian approaches. This system will also allow simulation of other needle insertion techniques, such as spinal tap. In the Phase II Program, collaborators at the CIMIT simulation center will develop performance measurement algorithms and design a study to validate that performance on the simulator is correlated with clinical skill. The study will be conducted with residents of varying experience and attending anesthesiologists. Validation work will be accomplished with support from obstetric anesthesiologists at the Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center. When completed, the simulator will aid training medical personnel to deliver epidural anesthesia at several intervertebral joints for relief of surgical pain, chronic pain, and childbirth pain, as well as other needle insertion procedures. It will allow complex cases to be simulated, allow trainees to purposely make mistakes, and ease the anxiety of junior physicians treating patients.",

        "abstract": "Physical Sciences, Inc. (PSI) proposes to develop a multi-metals emissions monitor to support Title V permitting of large air pollution source based upon its patented spark-induced breakdown spectroscopy (SIBS) technology.  Work prior to Phase I has shown that this technique is capable of sensitively monitoring metals in airborne particles that emit in the visible (Pb, Cr, and Cd for example).  In order to be useful for measuring all of the metallic hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), however, use of SIBS in the deep UV must be developed.  In the Phase I program, therefore, we began the development of a SIBS capability to monitor As and SE, which have strong emissions at 193.7 and 196.0 nm, respectively.  This ability will be optimized the Phase II program and will then be married to the existing SBIS technology to create the basis of a monitor that is able to identify and quantify all the metals on the HAPs list.  This monitor will be very useful in enabling large air pollution sources, such as incinerators and power plant, to meet their Title V obligations of monitoring and reporting their emissions.  The SIBS monitor will operate in real-time, an improvement over the currently used EPA reference method 29, an extractive technique which is labor intensive, slow and not amenable to automation.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Physical Sciences Inc. has successfully completed a Phase I program that demonstrated the feasibility of three-dimensional tracking for motion stabilization. The developed system extends the capabilities of our patented, high-speed, non-imaging tracker specifically for optical coherence tomography (OCT) based diagnostic technology. For ophthalmic applications, the three-dimensional tracker will obviate the need for complicated post-processing image registration algorithms currently used in commercial clinical OCT systems. Moreover, the tracking system will improve state-of-the-art spectral domain OCT (SDOCT) and optical Doppler tomography (ODT and SDODT) systems for the measurement of retinal blood flow in the smallest capillaries with improved phase stability and a wider dynamic range. The system will enable unprecedented resolution of retinal structures, creation of speckle and noise-reduced composite images by averaging hundreds of images, the generation of high-resolution three-dimensional maps, and the ability to return to the exact same tissue location days, months, or years later.      We propose herein to continue the development of the three-dimensional tracker in a Phase II program. The optical setup will be moved from the bench-top to a compact optical head mounted to a standard chin rest for retinal imaging. The instrumentation will likewise be moved from the laboratory to a small portable clinical cart. Other extensive optical, electronic, and mechanical modifications will make the system easy-to-use and easily modified for clinical technicians and researchers alike. The system will be tested for two applications. First and foremost, the system will be tested in human volunteers and the primary application will be ophthalmic diagnosis of retinal diseases, included defects in perfusion, where current techniques are limited by eye motion. Second, the system will be tested during in vivo imaging of the innominate artery of a genetically altered mouse for the specific research application of the identification and characterization of vulnerable plaque in coronary artery disease. Since the innominate artery lies directly over the heart, this investigation has been especially confounded by motion artifact. The progress made in Phase II will significantly enhance the tools ophthalmologist and researchers have at their disposal for in vivo diagnosis and treatment of a wide variety of diseases.",

This antenna prototype utilizes two key technologies: (1) a new design of GPS antennas using high-technology materials and manufacturing methodologies, that enables low-multipath, gain control, multi-frequency, tunability, and size reduction; and ( 2) a novel geometry of the metal ground plane to further rejects multipath interference. At the end of Phase II the anticipated results include, multipath error mitigation uniformly at L-Band, gain improvement at low elevation angles up to 10 dB with respect to choke ring antennas, multi-frequency operation at GPS and GALILEO frequencies, and at least 33% smaller size than other commercial low multipath antennas.  Because multipath interference reduction significantly improves GPS accuracy, the proposed multi-frequency GPS antenna will benefit the international scientific community that relies on high precision GPS for new advances in Earth and atmospheric sciences. In particular, the novel substrate antenna will allow accurate real-time GPS measurements, otherwise impossible, in support of the NSF funded EarthScope program, that is intended for the study of the structure and evolution of the North America continent using a network of GPS receivers.",

All of the proposed Phase I objectives were completed, and the team was able to complete several development steps beyond the proposed Phase I effort.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a prototype system for high performance two-dimensional strain rate imaging (SRI) of the heart and assess its ability to provide noninvasive regional quantification of diastolic function.  Current SRI implementations compromise image quality because simple tissue Doppler processing must be used to maintain real-time frame rates. High performance SRI with greatly reduced angle dependent artifacts requires a two-dimensional complex correlation computation at every pixel within a frame of a 200Hz ultrasound imaging sequence. In addition, simultaneous real-time display of tissue strain images and \"trashograms\" can provide valuable feedback information. Using these real-time displays, an echocardiographer can maximize the signal to noise ratio of SRI while simultaneously minimizing artifacts due to out-of-plane motion. Real-time computation of these images is beyond the state-of-the-art for current scanners, even those high performance machines using complex correlation for free hand, three dimensional scanning.  Pixel Velocity Inc. in collaboration with the Biomedical Ultrasonics Lab at the University of Michigan, has validated the feasibility of implementing a practical real-time two-dimensional correlation processor with all these capabilities during the Phase I grant. The result of a Phase II grant will be a real-time system integrating Pixel Velocity's two-dimensional correlation processor with a WmProbe Corp. highly parallel beamformer, specifically optimized for high frame rate, two-dimensional strain rate imaging of the heart.

Ideally, each strand present in a multiplex reaction is meant to form a duplex with only its perfectly matched and complementary single strand. In reality however, depending on the particular sequences present, many of the resident single strands can also anneal with strands other than their perfectly matched complement strand, resulting in cross-hybridization, x-hyb. X-hyb is a major nemesis of multiplex hybridization reactions causing false positive signals, lowered accuracy and sensitivity. Although x-hyb is readily acknowledged as a potential problem by all practicitioners of multiplex hybridization assay, the molecular interactions responsible for x-hyb are not understood.

In particular, the use of both frequency domain and steady state broadband measurements offers considerable promise in the detection, characterization, and therapeutic monitoring of breast cancer.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Millions of people in the USA and throughout the world are affected by neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and brain tumors. Confocal microscopy has considerably enhanced the testing of hypotheses in the basic neurosciences, providing significant insights into the causes of such neurological disorders. However, these systems are currently extremely expensive, putting them out of the reach of most individual scientists; the majority of confocal microscopes are currently to be found only in core facilities. There is also a need for increased optical resolution and the ability to perform 3-dimensional reconstructions of samples using a confocal microscope. If a system could be brought to market at a cost of less than $50,000, confocal microscopy would become available to every individual scientist using fluorescence microscopy, thus improving research abilities and potentially alleviating the financial and medical burdens caused by neurological disorders.        The overall goal of this project is to develop a new type of confocal microscope based on an innovative concept - the swept-field confocal design (SFC). The SFC is a revolutionary confocal concept. This hybrid-instrument uses an array of stationary pinholes for illumination and detection along one axis while using a single galvanometer to sweep the illumination along the other axis (Patent Pending). In Phase I of this project we designed, built prototypes of and evaluated the performance of two variations of the SFC. In Phase II of this project we will move from the drawing board to the laboratory; we will develop, test and refine a high-performance, easy-to-use swept-field confocal microscope at a selling price of under $50,000.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout its history, the United States has been the great melting pot, attracting immigrants from all over the world. Particularly recently, public schools have been challenged to provide English-as-a-Second- Language (ESL) instruction to an ever more complex mix of children. For example, in Waltham, MA (the site of the offices of the applicant company, Praxis, Inc.), children speaking nearly sixty separate native languages attend the public schools. Compounding this communication problem, current practice is to include children with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities in regular classrooms, including those for whom English is not the primary language. Thus, ESL instruction has become an extremely complex proposition, and teachers are challenged to provide effective instruction for their students. The proposed product, PAVE, will be the first of a planned suite of teacher-support tools for ESL and other second-language learning applications. The product will implement programmed instructional technology that is based on more than 30 years of federally-sponsored research. While this technology is in the public domain, no one has yet applied it to the problem of ESL instruction. Praxis, Inc. intends to correct this problem. PAVE will implement a combination of instructional methods of proven effectiveness to create prototype ESL software for teaching and practicing basic vocabulary skills. The intent is not to create a product that teaches a specific language. Rather, the product is conceptualized as a more general authoring system for creating computer programs for ESL vocabulary instruction and practice. The product will have separate modular components for students who can and cannot read in their native language. Using PAVE, a class room teacher can work with the child and/or native speakers (e.g., parents) to create individualized computer-based instruction to support ESL vocabulary instruction in the classroom and home. A unique feature of PAVE is that it can potentially help meet needs of children whose native language is not widely represented in recent immigrant populations.",

The product addresses essential skills critical to completing tasks that involve a sequence of steps. The objective is to teach students to \"read\" pictures (instead of words), either in trained or novel combinations, in order to complete tasks independently. In other words, in the Picture Reader program, the pictures will serve as instructional stimuli. The components of the curriculum require the student to watch and imitate a video model of a task and to reproduce the behavior sequence when presented with pictures corresponding to the steps of the video task. The project has two major objectives. First, building upon a successful Phase I prototype, we will develop a fully-featured version of Picture Reader in anticipation of commercialization. Second, we will verify that the product can be implemented effectively by its intended users and that it teaches picture-reading and task completion skills reliably in settings in which it will be routinely used.  The Specific Aims of the project are to:  (1) Further develop and enhance the capabilities of the Picture Reader prototype product;  (2) expand the ongoing field testing of Picture Reader to include gradual stimulus change procedures and recombinative generalization methodologies;  (3) Complete a full, commercial-ready version of the software product, including user-friendly documentation to support the curriculum; and  (4) Verify that the product's user-support package is sufficient for effective implementation by its intended users.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application seeks support for an SBIR Phase I project to develop and study a computer-based product, SequenceTeacher: Spelling, intended primarily for teaching children with mental retardation, autism, and other intellectual disabilities. The product addresses the acquisition and maintenance of critical skills in the development of an early spelling repertoire. The general task involves a form of constructed-response matching to sample (CRMTS). In this procedure, a sample stimulus is presented to the student who then must select two or more individual stimuli (e.g., letters) from a pool to construct a multi-element stimulus complex (e.g., letter-by-letter) that is related to the sample. For example, in an identity-matching version of the task, the sample stimulus might be the printed word, CAR, and the student must select the individual letters (C, then A, then R) from an array of letters to construct the printed word. In symbolic-matching versions of the task, the sample might be a picture of a car or the dictated word \"car,\" and the student's task is to construct the printed word CAR using letters in the choice array. The current project has two major objectives. First, we will adapt well-developed instructional methods that have been used in laboratory and applied research for teachers and other child-care professionals as well as parents. Second, we will evaluate the product to determine that it can be used effectively in typical educational situations. There is a clear need for this spelling product. Many children with intellectual disabilities fail to learn sequencing skills that are critical for the development of spelling. Others acquire these skills only with great difficulty. However, research supported by NIH has resulted in development of techniques that can establish the generalized serial and relational performances prerequisite to further development. These techniques, however, are not readily accessible to parents, professionals and the children who might benefit. This proposal aims to fill that gap by developing computer-assisted instruction that establishes critical components of generative spelling performances. The Specific Aims of the project are to: (1) Adapt sequence-training procedures developed in the laboratory and an earlier SBIR project for use in an effective, user-friendly computer-managed instructional environment; (2) Develop a prototype to support new spelling curriculum components; (3) Confirm that the prototype designed to use matrix training teaches students from the target population a repertoire of spelling skills that show extensive generalization.",

        "abstract": "Numerous clinical studies have described the negative impact of radiotherapy-induced dermatitis on cancer patients during and after their 5-6 week course of radiotherapy. Virtually all patients develop at least a mild dermatitis, and for almost half it's a painful side effect lasting weeks. There can be scarring, limitations on more aggressive radiotherapy, and can result in patients quitting radiotherapy, with a significant effect upon tumor recurrence. There are no products on the market that prevent or treat this dermatitis. ProCertus, an early-stage biotech company, has developed a topically-applied small molecule drug for a product, DermX, that confers complete protection against the Grade 1->4 dermatitis seen in a rodent radiodermatitis model, a model that closely reflects the human experience. Based upon market analysis, ProCertus has concluded that a topical preventive for radiodermatitis would be well-received by cancer patients, and yield annual revenues in the range of $250 million. A DermX product would reduce radiotherapy-associated pain, could potentially enable more aggressive radiotherapy where dermatitis is dose-limiting, and could reduce the drop-out rate late in radiotherapy courses. Phase II funds will enable us to address the key, remaining issues in DermX scientific development, which are: i) ensure that topicallyapplied DermX does not affect external beam radiation killing of tumor cell xenografts in nude mice, ii) optimize a topical delivery vehicle that enables full radioprotection of skin stem cells while allowing insignificant levels of DermX active agent to enter systemic circulation, and iii) complete cGMP-certified batch synthesis of DermX that is required for studies prior to filing for its Investigational New Drug (IND) status. At the end of this Phase II project, ProCertus envisions a DermX product ready for clinical trials that: i) is a topical solution devoid of systemic side effects, ii) is applied 1-2 times in the 30 min before radiotherapy, and iii) is expected to prevent the Grade 1-4 dermatitis normally experienced by radiotherapy patients.",

It is estimated that 170 million people worldwide, including approximately 4 million individuals in the United States, are infected with HCV. Available therapies are non-specific antiviral agents with modest efficacies and significant toxicities. We have selected HCV entry as a target for the discovery and development of novel antiviral agents. This stage of the virus life cycle represents an important target for drug development, and we have had success in the discovery and development of entry inhibitors for HIV that have now progressed to human clinical trials. In the Phase project, we generated novel HCV structural glycoprotein constructs that were used for the production of HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp). We demonstrated that the HCVpp were able to specifically infect human liver cells, and that entry was sensitive to specific inhibitors. The HCV entry assay recapitulates the essential biology of this stage of the viral life cycle and may have potential utility for identifying new antiviral compounds. The overall goal of this Phase II project is to (1) adapt the entry assay to a high throughput screen (HTS) in 384-well format; (2) screen libraries of 100,000 diverse, drug-like compounds; (3) test active hits for breadth and potency of activity against genotypically diverse HCV isolates as well as a panel of unrelated viruses; and (4) determine the mechanism of action and molecular targets of inhibition in a panel of novel follow-on assays. Success in the Phase project is defined as the identification of 1 or more bona fide lead series of drug-like compounds that warrant optimization for potency, specificity and oral activity.",

Unfortunately, this modality is currently limited to a single approved radiopharmaceutical agent, 18F-FDG, which measures tumor metabolism. The potential of PET in oncology can be advanced substantially by development of PET tracers that can assess other useful clinical parameters, such as the quantitative measurement of tumor perfusion and hypoxia. Such information is extremely useful for diagnosis and staging of cancer. We propose to develop a micro 62Znfl2Cu generator to produce the 9.7 minute 62Cu PET tracer at very high isotonic concentration and further to develop kit formulations to provide instant synthesis of 62 Cu-bis(thiosemicarbazone) compounds. Phase I will concentrate on demonstrating the feasibility of the combined microgenerator and instant kits for the two perfusion tracers approximately Cu-PTSM and x2CU-ETS, and the hypoxia tracer 62 Cu-ATSM. In Phase II, the microgenerator and kit formulations will be fully developed for human use, INDs will be submitted to the FDA for the three compounds, and finally, limited clinical feasibility studies focusing on serial perfusion and hypoxia imaging completed in a brief imaging session will be performed. The resulting perfusion normalized hypoxia map is expected to produce a highly superior measure of regional tumor hypoxia and thus superior information to guide treatment. The distributable generator produced tracers, together with the widely expanding availability of PET, can have far-reaching benefits in cancer patient treatment and management.",

Publicly funded-mental health services for pathological gamblers (PGs) exist in some states, but not in others. As the dependence of state governments on gambling revenues increases, public funding for services to PGs should also increase.       Instruments that measure the severity of PG have been limited in theoretical frame and content. They tend to assess PG by gambling behavior, debts, and other obvious, immediate consequences. This Phase II application intends to use the Rhode Island Gambling Outcome Rating Scale (RIGORS) in a state-funded, hospital- based gambling treatment program to:      1) Examine the utility of the RIGORS in identifying vulnerability to relapse in PGs during a12-month period. We expect that the RIGORS will provide incremental improvement in predictive validity of outcomes, including point-prevalence abstinence, frequency of gambling, and time to relapse when compared to other commonly used outcome measures; and      2) Establish that the RIGORS has strong, unbiased and stable psychometric properties in evaluating outcomes over time. We will compare the reliability, representativeness of items, levels of discrimination, and influence of gender bias on the RIGORS relative to other methods of assessing the severity of PG over time.      3) Commercially, the RIGORS will fill a niche for a brief, clinically useful, valid and reliable measure of a broad, latent continuum of PG severity. It can be used to monitor treatment effectiveness and cost efficiency, as well as for treatment planning and guidance. We hope to show that the RIGORS will be sensitive and unbiased at lower levels of severity in gamblers, and: thus may be used as a prophylactic tool to signal vulnerability to PG.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key factor for angiogenesis, is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of cancer. The abundance of VEGF is in large part controlled at the posttranscriptional levels by sequences in both the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of its mRNA. The 5'- UTR contains an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) that mediates a unique, cap-independent mode of translation initiation. Under hypoxic conditions, cap-dependent translation is dramatically impaired and the translation of the VEGF mRNA occurs through its cap-independent IRES. Thus, even under severe hypoxic conditions, cells are capable of producing large amounts of VEGF resulting in angiogenesis to support further tumor growth. Using PTC's proprietary technology platforms, we have successfully identified a compound that selectively and potently inhibits the expression of VEGF post transcriptionally. In the Phase I of this grant, we proposed to (1) characterize the UTR-selectivity of these compounds, (2) perform medicinal chemistry lead optimization to improve potency, selectivity, and pharmaceutical properties, and (3) establish a pharmacodynamic assay to measure in vivo efficacy. We exceeded these goals, and have identified a compound that is potent, seletive, and orally active in vivo. Here, in Phase II, we propose the following: (1) Conduct efficacy studies in a number of tumor models to establish the spectra of tumor types, optimal dosing regimens, and combination therapies utilizing this agent. Efficacy and combination studies will focus on the following five indications: soft tissue fibrosarcom; glioblastoma; hormone sensitive breast cancer; gastric cancer; and ovarian cancer. (2) Conduct ADME studies and toxicology of the lead compound to enable and design the clinical trials. These studies will include both non-GLP as well as IND-enabling GLP studies.

However, the photon-counting design requires a laser with unique characteristics:  namely, a pulse rate in the 1 kHz-1 MHz range with a pulsewidth less than 1 ns.  This project will develop compact seed lasers, to generate the needed pulse format, along with a compact power amplifier capable of power levels of 10 W or higher.  The seed lasers will use 1064-nm, short-cavity, diode-pumped solid state lasers with either passive or active Q-switches.  The amplifier will be an adaptation of a commercial product, configured for this particular application.  Phase I designed the passively Q-switched seed laser; designed, constructed, and tested a short-cavity, actively Q-switched laser; tested an amplifier stage; and conducted an initial design of the packaging for the entire laser source.  Both spreadsheet and rate-equation models for the passively and actively Q-switched lasers were developed and verified against experimental data.  In Phase II, the semiconductor-based, passive Q-switches, will be fabricated; a breadboard facilty to test the lasers and the power amplifier will be built; system output will be converted into a green wavelength; and the entire system will be packaged into a ruggedized, modular configuration.  At the end of Phase II, the system will be delivered to LANL for testing and system integration.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Beyond the application to non-proliferation sensors, the Remote Ultra-Low Light Imaging sensor should be applicable to:  NASA, for precision landing sensors; the DoD for intelligence on and tactical imaging of areas of interest; and various environmental agencies in need of accurate imaging data for, say, crop and vegetation analysis.

The opportunity is to leverage the greatly increased power and greatly reduced cost of workstation/PC clusters as platforms for high-performance electronic structure calculations, together with fundamental improvements in the computational algorithms for second order Moller-Plesset theory, which yields accurate descriptions of covalent bonds, torsional potentials, hydrogen bonding and dispersion interactions in biological systems. The new computational formulation gives asymptotic linear scaling of computational cost with molecular size for the first time without discarding the small Van der Waals terms known to be important for hydrogen bonds, DMA base stacking, and other non-bonded interactions in biology.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Density-Functional Theory (DFT) is highly desirable for modeling biomolecules due to its accuracy. While DFT calculations of the energy are now common for large molecules, the use of DFT geometry optimizers is still confined to relatively small molecules containing no more than thirty atoms. The key limitation is that the number of steps required to reach the optimum geometry increases with the number of atoms in the molecule. Furthermore, conventional optimizers perform particularly poorly for the floppy molecules typically encountered in biochemistry. This proposal is based on a radical change in the algorithm for DFT geometry optimization, potentially enabling a quantum leap in the size of molecules that can be optimized. The new optimizer takes a much more accurate geometry step than conventional optimizers, so that the optimum geometry is reached in a small number of steps (about 10 for Taxol). Each of these 'smart steps' is obtained via the iterative solution of an equation which is ill-conditioned for floppy molecules. In phase I we devised an economical procedure to solve this ill-conditioned equation, and in phase II we propose to complete the development of a geometry optimizer based on this smart step. The proposed algorithm will be implemented in the Q-Chem software package and, if successful, widely distributed through Q-Chem, Inc. and Spartan, Inc.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 80% of smokers want to quit smoking and over half attempt to quit each year; however, less than 3% succeed in quitting. The PHS Clinical Practice Guideline [USPHS, 2000] reports the use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) approximately doubles quit rates and recommends use of NRT by all smokers who attempt to quit unless contraindicated. However, the effectiveness of NRT is limited in real-world practice by under-use of NRT by smokers attempting to quit and lack of adherence to dosing instructions. There is a clear need to reach more smokers with accessible behavioral treatment and support to increase the use of and adherence to NRT. The Internet is an ideal delivery channel for behavioral cessation treatment and medication support. Each year approximately 7 million Americans turn to the Internet for information and help quitting smoking. QuitNet.com is a field-tested website that provides cessation treatment in accordance with the PHS Guidelines and is interactive. The goal of this project is to improve the rate of utilization and adherence to NRT among smokers attempting to quit. In Phase I we developed a comprehensive Medication Support System (MSS) and tested it in focus groups with QuitNet subscribers. Feedback from the focus groups was very positive regarding its value and usability. In Phase II, we will complete integrative programming of the MSS system and conduct a randomized trial to test its efficacy. We will recruit 500 adult smokers through our partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island. Using a randomized, controlled design with repeated measures at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12-months, smokers will be assigned to one of two treatments: 1) QuitNet (QN); or 2) QuitNet with the MSS (QN+MSS). We hypothesize that at month 12, participants in the QN+MSS group will have significantly higher quit rates compared to QN participants. We will also examine potential mediators of cessation including medication use and adherence as well as dose of behavioral treatment (e.g., number of logins to QuitNet). Lastly, we will examine normative patterns of medication use and adherence among participants in the control condition to establish a base- rate against which to compare the efficacy of QuitNet and QuitNet plus Medication Support. The proposed project could have significant public health impact by increasing the number of smokers who use NRT when quitting, and by improving quit rates through improved adherence with recommended NRT guidelines.",

Improved understanding of the neural code will have a huge impact on both neuroscience and clinical neurology. Existing neural prosthetics will be improved and the door will open on a whole host of new neural prosthetics. The National Institutes of Health have identified that a significant roadblock to progress in many areas of biomedical research is attributable to deficiencies in currently available computational tools. R.C. Electronics proposes research and development leading to a commercial spike train analysis software product that will provide neuroscientists with a sophisticated, state-of-the-art, single-unit and multi-unit spike train analysis tool suite that is extendable, standardized, open and collaborative. R.C. Electronics proposes to implement both standard, well-established spike train analysis techniques as well as novel, more recent strategies. The toolbox will be built in MATLAB for easy user augmentation and algorithm sharing. The long-term goals of this project are to produce a product that will not only provide a high-quality spike analysis capability, but also facilitate the development of new methods and research into method comparisons. The proposed software has a broad applicability to neuroscience research both physiology and pathophysiology, including research aimed at studying the neuronal function of the brain following HIV infection. Relevance: Neuroscience researchers are working to develop medical applications that will allow a person, for example, to control a computer cursor or robot based on \"reading\" the electrical activity of neurons, the specialized cells of the nervous system.

These sources are used not only for the testing of advanced accelerator components but also for cancer treatment, medical device and mail sterilization, food irradiation, and plastics processing.  Radio-frequency linear accelerators are the industry standard, but they are complicated and expensive.  Betatrons hold the promise of being much simpler and less expensive, but previously they were limited to very low currents.  This project will employ Fixed-Field-Alternating-Gradient focusing to increase the current capability of the betatron.  Modern advances in low-loss magnetic materials also will be applied to increase the repetition rate.  In Phase I, the focusing lattice was optimized, collective effects were examined to determine the stability limits, field magnets were designed, a betatron core power supply schematic was generated, and other hardware issues were addressed.  The result of these activities is a robust, efficient, and extensive design for prototype fabrication.  In Phase II, the field magnets, vacuum chamber, and diagnostics systems will be custom fabricated.  Other major systems (the betatron core, power supplies, injector) will be purchased.  Finally, the components will be integrated, and the accelerator will be commissioned to 6 MeV and more than 1 mA average current.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A 6 MeV, high power, inexpensive electron source should find application in a number of markets:  the well-developed medical-products-sterilization industry would readily adopt a less expensive technology; cargo inspection is a rapidly growing application of high-power accelerators, and reduced costs would allow the equipment to be more widely used at port facilities; the use of this device for mail sterilization would fit within the budget of every large postal facility in the country; radiation cancer treatment would be made considerably less expensive, making this life-saving treatment more available in developing nations.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop organic dispersible and photoprintable conducting polymers based on polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT).  PEDOT is the conducting polymer of choice for electronic displays and devices due to its high conductivity, stability and transparency as a thin film.  However, it is only available as an aqueous dispersion, and no one else has been able to render PEDOT dispersible in organic solvents.  It is important to make PEDOT dispersible in organics because water is incompatible with many semiconductor processing steps.  This SBIR project will develop printable conducting polymers that are initially organic dispersible, can be cast a thin films, and conducting patterns can be made permanently fixed by selectively exposing the film to ultraviolet light.  The material that is not exposed to the light can be easily removed.  This project will develop printable PEDOT-based conducting polymers that contain no water, and that can be used in the production of electronics such as organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays.  This project hopes to increase knowledge of organic dispersible conducting polymers.  Sample size quantities of organic dispersible conducting polymers developed in this project will be made available to researchers by sale through a major chemical distributor.  This will promote a more rapid dissemination of the base technology and quicken the pace of additional discoveries and applications using our materials.  The benefits of this research to society include a reduced environmental impact due to electronics manufacturing.  The printing technology presented in this proposal results in fewer chemical waste streams than inorganic electronics production.  Inorganic electronics fabrication facilities produce large amounts of toxic waste including arsenic and heavy metals.  The lack of ground water pollution from toxins in the decomposition process is a plus for municipalities who struggle with this issue today.  Furthermore, this printing technology will result in a reduction in the cost and a greater variety of electronic devices available to consumers.  This technology should have a positive impact in areas where weight sensitivity represents a gating factor.",

        "abstract": "Biocidal additives are vital for both the preservation of coatings in the can as well as for long-term coating integrity after applications.  Anti-fungal additives are critical for delaying attack by fungal and algal growth once an architectural coating is in place.  Biocidal coatings are designed to kill microbes and fungi by slowly and steadily releasing  biocide from the dried film.  Unfortunately, this mechanism is also responsible for the ultimate deactivation of the biocidal activity; once the biocide has leached out or washed out of the coating, all protection against microbes is lost.  The protection of the coating by the biocide typically lasts only around 18 months, and even less in hot, humid environments like the South and Southeast United States.                                                Once the biocides have leached out, a new coating must be reapplied, often after a labor-intensive washing or removal of the previous coating.  This process creates a variety of undesirable environmental impacts, from the contamination of surrounding areas by nonspecific biocide leaching to the increased VOC emitted during the re-application of the coating.  A system that prolonged biocidal coating lifetime and decrease the environmental impacts of the current system would benefit both the environment and property owners.                                                                                                                   In this Phase II proposal TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes to develop a new biocidal coating system that prolongs biocidal activity by immobilizing biocidal additives in a coating.  Biocides are largely wasted as they are continuously but slowly emitted, and a non-leaching biocide would eliminate the undesired contamination of the surrounding area and would stay within a coating for longer time periods.  A coating that retained biocidal activity for twice as long, for example, would require repainting only half as often, leading also to a decrease in VOC emissions and waste production during painting.  Such a biocide would also prevent the formation of biocide-resistant bacteria that can form from a traditional slow-release biocide.",

These catalysts do not consume valuable hydrogen and can operate at warm gas temperatures of approximately 400 degrees Fahrenheit at gasifier pressures.  In Phase II, the catalyst formulation will be further developed and optimized to improve its activity for hydrogen sulfide oxidation and reduce the amount of oxygen that must be added to the system.  A bench scale demonstration of the process will be conducted, and an independent evaluation will be performed by an outside laboratory.  This will be followed by a detailed economic analysis of the process.

These A-beta peptides can cross the blood-brain barrier. Our long-term goal is to develop an effective therapy for Alzheimer's Disease, by using a subcutaneous hydrogel to recognize, concentrate and eliminate AB (beta amyloid) peptides and thereby halt deposition of plaque in the brain. In the Phase I research, we developed and demonstrated a propreirtary detox gel encompassing a retro-inverso peptide which acts like a \"sink\" that draws the AB peptides, in vitro. The amount and rate of AB captured irreversibly (10 ug/100ul of gel in 2 hours, in vitro) could be used to produce the sink effect in humans. We now propose a more potent, specific and convenient therapeutic system in our Phase II proposal. In addition to using the detox depot we established in Phase I, we plan to improve the AB capture hydrogel formulation and evaluate its performance, in vivo, in a murine model of AD. Essentially, a solution containing a conjugate consisting of Abeta binding element linked to a polymer is mixed with a cross-linking reagent. This solution may be injected subcutaneously where it will rapidly become a solid hydrogel. The ability of the detox depot to decrease the level of the toxic aggregates of A-beta peptides in the brain will be evaluated. Several versions of the capture peptide will be included in the detox gels and tested for efficacy in AD mice. Evaluation parameters will include immunohistochemical and biochemical measurements. If successful, this detoxification depot will become a candidate for human use. Safety studies on the hydrogel performed in rats, rabbits and dogs demonstarted no toxicity.

Therefore, if these materials could be made virtually free of radioactive contamination, the probability of successful searches would be enhanced.  In this project, the radiopurity of one such material, electroformed copper, will be enhanced by using an already pure form of copper, oxygen-free high conductivity (OFHC) copper, which is electroplated in baths assembled from ultra-pure chemicals and construction materials.  By performing the electroplating deep underground, cosmic-ray-induced radioactivity, which would otherwise be present in the copper, can be radically reduced.  Other metals could be produced in a similar manner.  In Phase I, an underground copper electroplating laboratory was constructed and outfitted with plating baths made from very pure plastics and high purity chemicals.  It was shown that ultra-pure copper, collected on the cathodes of one bath, could be used as anodes in a second bath, thus progressively increasing the purity of the final product.  In Phase II, techniques will be developed for testing the plating bath and the quality of the copper produced.  Methods will be developed to continually clean the bath of radioactive contaminants thus prolonging the useful life of the bath.  Two tons of copper will produced for use as inner shielding for ultra-low background detectors.  Commercial Applications And Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The high purity material would have applicability to research projects in nuclear physics and other sciences.",

        "abstract": "It has been well established that disease in stored potatoes and many other vegetables and fruits generate a variety of volatile compounds that are released into the storage space Furthermore, specific types of disease produce volatile compounds that generate unique fingerprints on ultra-sensitive spectrographic molecular detection devices. The background atmosphere of commercial storage facilities can contain molecules that interfere with the ability of ultra-sensitive devices to measure organic molecules produced by disease pathogens. An ultra sensitive detector capable of separating background from disease molecules can detect diseases early and thereby reduce damage to the crop. This SBIR project will demonstrate the feasibility of a novel concept for ultra sensitive detection and identification of a broad range of molecular species. This approach will serve as the foundation for a new generation of diagnostic tools for specific and sensitive detection of organic molecules produced by diseases in stored crops. The innovations proposed in this research are aimed at producing low-cost ultra sensitive molecular detection technology that is a versatile, usable, and affordable product designed for wide spread adaptation within the agricultural industry. The significance of this innovation is a cost-performance breakthrough that will enable commercial success for diagnostic products that will reduce the growing disease damage cost.",

The current market supplies no solutions that operate at these speeds.  To address this problem, this project will develop a toolchain for automatically rendering signatures from an intrusion detection system (IDS) into high-speed signature detection engines that run on network processors.  Phase I demonstrated the feasbility of applying  mapping technology to the problem of rendering intrusion detection rulesets onto network processors.  A technique was identified for selecting the signature from the space of possible problem framings at compilation-time.  Phase II  will develop a prototype toolchain for rendering IDS signatures into high-speed signature detection engines that run on network processors.  The toolchain, which will target 10 Gbps on next-generation network processors and will be fully automatic, will be validated and verified.  Commercial Applications And Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The high-speed signature-detection technology should find use in multiple network applications, especially intrusion detection, spam detection, and deep-inspection firewalls.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The specific goal of this proposal is to initiate preclinical studies towards satisfying the requirements for an Investigative New Drug Application (IND) after identifying a compound(s) that could be commercialized and prescribed for the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-positive hospital-acquired infections. The increased frequency of multidrug resistance in key pathogens has motivated us to employ our structure-based design approach to identify compounds that target multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-positive pathogens. For use in nosocomial infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens, a drug must cover Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. Coverage of Streptococcus pneumonias (for treatment of patients who are either hospitalized due to community-acquired pneumonia or develop a Gram-positive pneumonia while hospitalized) and other species of staphylococci and enterococci would be highly desirable. To be commercially successful, it would be highly desirable for the drug to have pharmacokinetics commensurate with once or twice daily dosing. For life-threatening infections in the hospital, an IV agent would be needed, ideally followed by an oral formulation of the same drug. Looking ahead, this agent would cover strains that have resistance to macrolides, quinolones, vancomycin, a-lactams, Synercid(r), and Linezolid.         In our Phase I application, we set out to identify the active core of a new chemical entity that inhibits protein synthesis in the bacterial cell, determine its 3D structure when complexed to its target (the SOS subunit of the ribosome), and determine basic pharmacokinetics of one compound in this promising series. Having successfully completed all the goals from our Phase I application, we seek in this Phase II proposal to:         1. Determine MIC90 values for compounds with MICs = 5 fg/ml against Gram-positive pathogens in our primary panel.    2. Determine efficacy in relevant animal models of infection.    3. Characterize compounds for potential to cause drug-drug interactions, adverse side-effects, microsomal lability, cytotoxicity, and for their potential to have oral absorption.    4. Characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of compounds in rodent and non-rodent species.    5. Determine how quickly resistance occurs with key compounds.    6. Initiate preclinical studies on a compound that meets acceptable criteria for treatment of nosocomial Gram-positive bacteria.        It is expected that these units of work will provide substantial progress toward an IND filing of a compound active against Gram-positive nosocomial pathogens.",

The proposed Phase II project will build on Phase I by building a common core data set across MSSPCare and the information system called PACECare that was developed subsequent to Phase I for the national PACE program. Currently, there is a national and state effort to compare long term care programs, evaluate their strengths and weaknesses and to develop best practice models. The proposed Phase II project will create an operational data warehouse for comparing client information across sites, across programs, and across states for the purpose of improving program management and quality. Specifically, the Phase II project will use the data warehouse to prepare cross-site summary reports, to compare client populations and outcomes, and to prepare Benchmark Reports for the comparison of individual sites to other like programs. Phase II will also employ the data warehouse to address a priority issue revealed in the Phase I and PACECare project development phases: medication management outcomes. This issue has recently become more pressing due to the passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act (MMA), which renders prescription drugs more accessible than ever to seniors. Specifically, The Phase II Project will: 1. Develop a common core MSSPCare/PACECare data set, compatible with the Minimum Data Set for Homecare Assessments (MDS-HC), for comparing client characteristics, 2. Develop a standardized drug interaction detection software across both information systems, 3. Build a multi-site data warehouse and use the analyses generated to improve program management and quality, 4. Use the data warehouse to improve clinical practice to detect redundant medications and potentially dangerous interactions, 5. Study the impacts of the medication problem detection software on prescription patterns and client outcomes, and 6. Evaluate the adoption rates, use patterns, costs and benefits of the enterprise software system and data warehouse.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    SBIR Phase I Research:    This proposal aims to examine the predictive utility of an in vivo primate toxicogenomic model of human hepatotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity is the most significant and common adverse drug reaction. A central challenge to pharmaceutical drug development therefore is the early identification and elimination of drug candidates with unfavorable liver toxicity profiles. The ability to employ microarrays to measure global gene expression patterns that precede biochemical and pathologic change has contributed to the emergence of toxicogenomics as a promising method of rapidly assessing potential toxicity. As with conventional toxicity assays, however, interspecies biological differences may pose a significant limitation to predictive toxicogenomics. Due to genomic and physiologic similarities, toxicogenomic studies in nonhuman primates may improve the relevance to human toxicity and associated molecular mechanisms. The proposed studies test the hypotheses that transcriptional changes can be detected in primate hepatic tissue in vivo that are predictive of primate hepatotoxicity, and hence human hepatotoxicity, and that these transcriptional changes are reflective of the severity of conventional biochemical and pathological toxicity measures in a dose dependant manner. Changes in gene expression in liver tissue, liver pathology and serum ALT, LDH, bilirubin, prothrombin time and glucose will be assessed at multiple time points following acute administration of acetaminophen, a widely used analgesic with intrinsic hepatotoxicity. This will allow a determination of the sequence of transcriptional changes that parallel or proceed histologic and biochemical events. Transcriptional changes induced by an established hepatotoxic dose of acetaminophen will be evaluated, as well as changes induced by two lower doses, the lower of which is estimated not to be hepatotoxic. The resulting dose response data will allow the identification of transcriptional profiles that are associated with acetaminophen toxicity and distinguishable from other biological effects. Defining the chronologic and dose dependent gene expression changes induced by acetaminophen may reveal a unique early transcriptional profile that is predictive of hepatic injury from this widely used medication, providing support for the utility of primate based toxicogenomics. Sharing of tissue, blood, and urine samples and data with FDA and NIEHS collaborators will allow comparisons with their parallel rodent data and add complementary data on accessible biomarkers and metabonomics.",

Semiconductor process engineers and RTP equipment design engineers will use the tool. Currently, the design and development of advanced process controllers is a relatively slow and complicated process. There is no high-level tool that allows the process engineer to design, tune and deploy advanced controllers and develop low-order, fast physical models to be used for control. Based on customer feedback and its own experience the company has found a strong need for an integrated modeling and control tool that can be customized for a specific process. Phase I results proved the feasibility of such a tool by closed-loop simulations of a generic RTP chamber using a proof-of-concept version of the proposed tool. This Phase II will further develop and implement relevant model-order reduction algorithms, implement the algorithm for speeding up the Monte Carlo ray tracing calculations, develop the user interface, and integrate the tool components. The company will work closely with its industrial partner in testing the prototype tool in the design of next-generation RTP equipment.  If successful the proposed software package will result in a tool that will substantially reduce the development time of RTP equipment and processes. The tool also provides components for development of advanced techniques in virtual sensing and fault detection. RTP is the company's initial focus, but will leverage the modular nature of the product to extend its capabilities to other semiconductor equipment (e.g., CMP, CVD, etch, etc.) and even equipment used in other industries. Moreover, devices for MEMS and new nanoscale electronics technologies (e.g. spintronic and molecular computing) are expected to be commercialized using CMOS-like manufacturing processes. Hence, by creating a new way of designing and developing equipment and processes efficiently, this tool will have an impact far beyond RTP. The software will serve as a teaching and training tool that can be used in universities and government laboratories of NIST, DoD, DoE, etc.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     More than half of all lower extremity amputations are in persons with diabetes. These patients suffer from severe, diabetes-induced, peripheral, sensory neuropathy and, thus they frequently do not protect their feet from repetitive shear stress or traumatic episodes and ulceration often ensues. We have previously shown that the temperature profile of the plantar aspects of the foot provides a reliable warning of tissue injury and can be effectively used as a preventive modality. In this study we propose to further develop and clinically test a novel infrared-based temperature instrument (MedSkan) that is intended for home use by high-risk diabetic patients. This step-on remote monitoring device will serve as an early warning system for impending ulcers and Charcot fractures. The study's central hypothesis is that the MedSkan device will reduce the incidence of ulcers by providing an accurate, simple, and effective approach to monitor changes in foot temperatures. To study this hypothesis, the following specific aims are proposed: Aim 1: To develop, validate and implement software and protocols for the following: (i) data acquisition and processing, and (ii) the physician-MedSkan communications interface. A state-of-the-art web interface will be developed to allow clinicians to view the stored data for their patients.  Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of the MedSkan in reducing the incidence of diabetic foot ulcers among high-risk patients. Our hypothesis is that patients monitored with the MedSkan will have fewer foot ulcers and that the ulcers will be less severe. The 110 patient study will comprise two treatment arms: the standard therapy group and the enhanced therapy group. The latter will receive standard care plus infrared temperature monitoring using the MedSkan daily for 12 months. Elevated temperatures will provide information to the physician that prevention practices should be initiated, such as off-loading, skin care, etc.  Aim 3: To determine the normal range of temperature variations for each individual foot for patients in the Enhanced Therapy and to correlate deviations from this range to the incidence of ulcers. Our previous studies have used the contralateral foot as the control to detect abnormal temperatures. We will investigate the hypothesis that with proper trending of normal foot temperatures, the individual foot can serve as its own control for predicting ulcers.

This project will create a tool for assessing cognitive brain function in juvenile populations that is robust, repeatable, and free of cultural bias. It builds on innovative methods we have developed that combine task-related measures of response speed and accuracy with concomitant monitoring of neurophysiologic signals. We have so far established that such combined measures improve sensitivity for detecting the neurocognitive effects of medical treatments, help to separate effects due to variations in level of effort or alertness from those related to the regulation of attention and memory, are stable over time in the absence of developmental or medical changes, and are highly correlated with conventional measures of cognitive ability. However these methods are currently limited to comparing a patient's post-treatment test results to that patient's own pre-treatment baseline. This limitation is analogous to a thermometer that only tells whether a patient's temperature changed from the last measurement or an automobile whose speedometer shows change in miles per hour from yesterday. The current project is concerned with overcoming this limitation by utilizing age-matched reference groups to derive assessments of the neural correlates of sustained attention and working memory that can be used to gauge whether a child's neurocognitive ability is within normal bounds and whether it follows a typically maturational progression when tested repeatedly over an extended period. This will be accomplished in Phase II by collecting and analyzing a normative database that will enable comparison of a child's behavioral and neural responses with those of healthy age-matched peers, as well as comparison of any changes observed over time to those which would be expected as a result of normal maturational processes. The improved measures will then be validated by application to data collected from children with several clinical disorders that affect neurocognitive function including sleep disorders, epilepsy, ADHD and mild traumatic head injury. The resulting method will be embodied in a first-of-its-kind, highly automated Children's Neurophysiologic Cognitive Assessment Test (CNCAT). Because there is a large population of children that could benefit from assessment with the CNCAT in conjunction with their medical care, the test has a promising commercial future.",

Researchers associated with the San Diego Center for Health Interventions, LLC have over 12 years experience designing and testing interventions to improve physical activity and eating behaviors, and have created computer and web-based programs to deliver individually-tailored interventions to a variety of populations, including overweight adolescents.  The purpose of this Phase I SBIR project is to finalize the development of a weight control intervention that physicians can offer their adolescent patients - PACEi-OK (Internet PACE for Overweight Kids). This intervention integrates: a) brief on-line instruction for health care providers about how to use and \"prescribe\" PACEi-OK; and b) an individualized, web-based weight control program they can offer to their adolescent patients and their parents. PACEi- OK enables physicians to offer a specific service to their overweight patients and then engages adolescents for a full year in specific weight control activities they and their parents can take as they follow their doctor's advice to lose excess weight and maintain a healthy weight through adolescence.  We will perform two sets of activities over a 6-month period of time: 1) adapting existing paper-based provider training materials to a web-based format and integrating this with our current web-based programs addressing weight related behaviors of physical activity and diet in adolescents and their families; and 2) two rounds of formative work, first with 3 focus groups of 8 healthcare providers to provide input on the provider training component; second, beta testing the combined PACEi-OK product with 4 physicians, each learning about PACEi-OK via the system and then using it with two of their patients. Input from this formative research will then guide creation of the final product to be tested for effectiveness in Phase II.  The PACEi-OK intervention is particularly innovative because its components--standardized online training for providers, web assessment and behavior change planning for patients and their parents, and the ongoing web-based intervention- are unified through a common theoretical and behavioral framework.",

An ideal tool for eliminating P. falciparum, the causative agent of 99% of all malaria deaths, would be a highly effective vaccine that prevents blood stage infection and thereby prevents all disease and transmission. When attenuated P. falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ) are administered by the bite of infected mosquitoes, gt 90% of human volunteers are protected against experimental P. falciparum challenge and protection lasts at least 10 months. Sanaria's goal is to develop and commercialize an attenuated PfSPZ vaccine that prevents P. falciparum blood stage infection in gt 90% of recipients; a vaccine that could be used to eliminate P. falciparum from the world. This vaccine has the potential for gt  1 billion annual revenues in markets in the developed and developing world. Sanaria has succeeded in accomplishing the goals of its Phase II SBIR grant, 5R44AI055229-05, including robust, reproducible, and consistent manufacture and release of clinical lots of the PfSPZ Vaccine, and in 2009 will be initiating a Phase 1 clinical trial to assess safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of the PfSPZ Vaccine. After demonstrating safety in that trial, the goal is to move as swiftly as possible to safety and proof of concept efficacy studies in African adults, young children, and infants. These will be followed by additional Phase 2 studies, including dose optimization studies, and then pivotal Phase 3 studies to support licensure. Based on the results of 6 successful production campaigns under cGMPs, which have manufactured PfSPZ Vaccine for the first clinical trials, Sanaria has identified specific aspects of its manufacturing process and control assays that represent either bottlenecks or opportunities for significant improvement. The goal of this proposal is to focus on these bottlenecks and opportunities by conducting innovative research and development to establish and finalize a more efficient, scaled-up, validated manufacturing and release process for the PfSPZ Vaccine. To address this overarching goal Sanaria will reduce the quantity of blood products and personnel used for the production of gametocytes to feed to mosquitoes, increase the efficiency of mosquito production, and increase the numbers of sporozoites produced and harvested from infected mosquitoes. The increased efficiency will be accompanied by scale-up of the entire manufacturing process, and improvements in throughput, specificity and sensitivity of assays used for in process control during manufacture and release of the PfSPZ Vaccine. An essential element of this application is that all of these improvements will be validated for subsequent production of PfSPZ Vaccine under cGMPs. Success in this Phase II SBIR renewal will leave Sanaria ideally placed to design and construct a facility in which the PfSPZ Vaccine can be optimally manufactured for pivotal Phase 3 studies, licensure and commercial launch of the PfSPZ Vaccine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malaria causes 500 million clinical cases and 1-3 million deaths annually, is responsible for gt1% loss of GDP in Africa annually and is a serious concern for travelers and military personnel. Sanaria's goal is to develop and commercialize a gt90% protective malaria vaccine for three primary markets with a potential for gt 1 billion annual revenues: 1) Travelers from the developed world to malaria endemic areas. 2) Infants and young children in the developing world. 3) Adolescent girls in the developing world. Success in this Phase II SBIR renewal will leave Sanaria ideally placed to design and construct a facility in which the company's malaria vaccine can be optimally manufactured for pivotal Phase 3 studies, licensure and commercial launch.",

        "abstract": "75575B  The existence, on the North Slope (AK) of two very large, shallow, heavy oil sands has been known since 1985.  These are the Ugnu (8-12 API), at depths of 2,000 to 5,000 ft, and the West Sak (16-22 API), from 2,300 to 5,500 ft, both overlaying the Kuparuk field (which has been producing since 1981) and under-laying 1,800 ft of Permafrost.  With combined oil-in-place over 40 MMBO, its recovery by a current \u00c2\u00bfCold Production\u00c2\u00bf method is limited to 5%.  By comparison, recoveries equal 70% in the Midway-Sunset (CA), using cyclic steam injection in multi-branch wells.  If the steam could be injected through the Permafrost without any melting, domestic reserves would boosted by 28 MMBO and the life of the trans-Alaskan pipeline system would be extended by nearly 40 years, with little negative impact.  This project will use engineering calculations, materials specifications, prototype fabrication and testing, and reliable cost estimates to demonstrate that this goal is now reachable.  Phase I showed that steam injection could achieved by means of \"super-insulated\" well tubulars, which would prevent the Permafrost from melting.  Heat transfer calculations showed that a cold, dry, gas-stream circulation would sub-cool the Permafrost.  In Phase II, short-length prototypes of such tubular joints will be built and tested.  Simultaneously, detailed specifications and welding protocols will be developed.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new technology should permit a large increase in domestic oil production from the Alaskan North Slope with little environmental impact.  The increased supply should slow U.S. dependence upon imported oil from un-stable sources.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Our goal is to improve the versatility, safety and effectiveness of E. coli as a platform for commercial production of DNA, proteins and metabolites. The natural E. coli genome will be reduced to its essentials by removing unnecessary, detrimental and potentially harmful genes through our Scarless Genome Reduction (SGR) technology. The result will be a robust, benign, environmentally friendly organism which can be modified for production as needed. DNA applications include vaccines, gene therapy and RNAi based therapeutics. Protein applications include drugs, hormones, industrial enzymes and some antibiotics. Metabolites include many antibiotics, vitamins, amino acids as well as industrial chemicals and fuels such as ethanol and hydrogen. As the technical ability to manipulate genomes grows, it will be possible for reduced genome  . coli to take on many applications previously reserved for other organisms or chemical processes. In the Phase I work, the E. coli genome was reduced to the point that there were no more IS transposable elements. These elements have the capacity to hop around the genome and inactivate genes including the genes for products. The new IS-free strains have remarkably improved properties, including a greater tolerance for high level product expression, greater cloning ability, and better stability. IS hopping is one of the ways E coli defends itself from the stress of production which, from the bacterial point of view, resembles an infection. For production of medicines, the cleanness of the genome is a benefit because purification of product is less difficult and good quality assurance and quality control are more readily attainable. For injectable DNA preparations, the elimination of IS hopping is a tangible safety benefit, which will avoid the risk of transposition into a chromosome of a patient. Finally, the cells grow robustly to high density in industrial fermentation conditions using inexpensive minimal salts media, alleviating concern about prion contamination from bovine-derived media additives. This Phase II project will explore a variety of commercial applications which have been brought to our attention by companies interested in our product.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main purpose of this proposal is to develop a novel ion source for biological mass spectrometry (MS). It will increase the ionization efficiency of biomolecules in the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) technique by post-ionizing neutral molecules desorbed into a gas phase in the MALDI process. Post-ionization will be achieved via proton transfer reactions with protonated reagent gas ions produced in the chemical ionization (Cl) source. This MALDI-CI source will be interfaced to an orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight (TOP) mass spectrometer using a quadrupole ion guide. Decoupling of the proposed ion source from the TOP mass analyzer will allow operating it at elevated pressures (approximately 1 Torr), thus increasing the effectiveness of the chemical post-ionization. By using reagent gases with different proton affinities we can induce and control the in-source fragmentation of peptide ions. Together with the increased ionization efficiency this will make mass spectrometric identification of proteins and their posttranslational modifications more sensitive and reliable.",

Through a modified TTY protocol, it will provide the same capability over the phone. Extensive human subjects testing with concept demonstrator devices in Phase I demonstrated the potential of such a device to have life-changing effects on face-to-face communication for users who are deaf or hearing impaired. The results of Phase I showed that development of such a communication device is feasible and would be accepted by both users who are deaf and the hearing people with whom they interact. Phase II will test prototype devices with human subjects to determine necessary features and functionality. Two levels of prototypes will be developed with the help of RBC, a product development company. Research on these prototypes will be conducted under the guidance of Boys Town National Research Hospital, a leading research institution for the deaf and hearing impaired. Upon completion of the Phase II research, the final design will be transferred to a suitable manufacturer for volume production. sComm.'s business goal is to put the sComm200A into the hands of people who are deaf at the earliest possible date and to create a viable enterprise around this opportunity.

        "abstract": "75974B  Microalgae biofixation is a candidate technology for abating the emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly CO2, while simultaneously producing fuels and chemicals.  One approach is to use nitrogen-fixing microalgae (cyanobacteria) cultivated in large open ponds and harvested to produce both renewable fuels (e.g., methane, and possibly, in the future, ethanol or hydrogen) and organic nitrogen fertilizers (as substitutes for chemical fertilizers).  However, a major issue is productivity, measured in tons of fertilizers and biofuels that can be produced per acre (hectare) of ponds per year.  In this project, cultures of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria will be cultivated in open ponds, with the harvested algal biomass digested to generate methane gas and a liquid organic fertilizer suitable for crop production.  Productivity will be maximized by selecting for high productivity strains and by developing mutants with reduced light harvesting pigments.  During Phase I, wild-type strains of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria were isolated and cultivated indoors, and work on outdoor mass cultures was initiated.  The anaerobic digestion of cyanobacterial biomass was determined, and selection low pigment- high productivity strains were selected for further study.  Phase II will emphasize the outdoor mass culture of both wild-type and low-pigment mutant strains to determine maximum productivity, in terms of both of both carbon dioxide sequestration into biomass and nitrogen fixation.   Genetic selection techniques will be used to develop algal strains with low phycobiliprotein content and higher productivities, due to reduced self-shading and photoinhibition.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should contribute to the production of organic fertilizer in U.S. agriculture, of particular importance after the establishment of the USDA National Organic Plan.  One immediate commercial application would be in the production of Spirulina, a commercial microalga used as a food and food supplement.",

The sensors must be small and lightweight in order to be compatible with flight in balloonsondes.  This project will develop prototype sensor systems with MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor atmospheric CO2 concentrations with 1 ppm sensitivity.  The measurement will be accomplished by filling the sensors with chemoselective sol-gels whose electric permittivity changes when exposed to CO2.  The sensor systems will be battery operated, portable, and remotely operated, and will be able to compensate for changes in humidity, temperature, and pressure.  In Phase I, MEMS capacitor sensors were demonstrated to have the necessary sensitivity (1ppm) to CO2 in a background of high humidity.  Detection of CO2 \u00c2\u00bf from 0 to 500 ppm, in ambient temperatures ranging from +40 C to -10 C, and in humidity ranges from 0to 80% \u00c2\u00bf was demonstrated.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In light of the efficacy of several new clinically approved monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for cancer therapy, there has been a resurgence of interest in their use for the delivery of cytotoxic drugs to tumor cells. Recent studies have identified critical parameters that must be addressed for therapeutic efficacy, including intracellular uptake of the mAb within target cells, use of potent and stable drugs for delivery, and incorporation of conditionally stable linkage systems that allow for the selective release of active drug. In our Phase I SBIR study, we addressed these issues, and the work led to the development of cAC1O-valine-citrulline- monomethylauristatin E (cAC1O-Val-Cit-MMAE), a conjugate composed of three elements: the cAC1O mAb that recognizes the CD30 antigen on lymphomas, the Val-Cit peptide linker that is cleaved from the drug by lysosomal enzymes, and the highly potent antimitotic agent, MMAE. The conjugate, which contained 8 drugs/mAb, was stable in plasma, released drug in the presence of cathepsin B, and induced cures and regressions of established tumors with unprecedented therapeutic windows. We subsequently found that these conjugates were prone to aggregation and had accelerated in vivo clearance, in contrast to equally efficacious conjugates containing only 4 drugs/mAb (cAC10-Val-Cit-MMAE4). However, the current procedure for producing cAC10-Val-Cit-MMAE4 leads to a complex mixture of conjugates with varying degrees of drug substitution at different positions on the mAb. The objective of the Phase II SBIR research is to establish an optimized form of cAC10-Val-Cit-MMAE4 in terms of in vitro potency and specificity, in vivo safety and efficacy, pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, product uniformity, and ease of production. This will be accomplished by exploring a variety of chemical conjugation strategies for the preparation of cAClOVal- Cit-MMAE4. In parallel, we will engineer cACIO with cysteine to serine replacements, thereby enabling the construction of conjugates with precisely defined sites and stoichiometries of drug attachment. These studies will lead to the identification of a highly optimized form of cAC10-Val-Cit-MMAE4 for clinical trials in humans with Hodgkin's disease, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to test the feasibility of a new paradigm for storage and analysis of complete genome sequences. Inexpensive and rapid DNA sequencing technologies are anticipated in the near future. With this development, the promise of medical decision-making based on individual genetic risk will be realized. The emergence of cost effective DNA sequencing technologies will require information systems capable of efficient storage and manipulation of many thousands of fully-sequenced individual genomes. Human genomes are large, occupying upwards of 6x10/9 bytes each with naive computer storage approaches, whereas the difference between any two genomes is only around 0.1%, or 6x10/6 bytes. The key innovation in this proposal is applying Delta Compression to DNA sequence strings allowing an entire genome to be represented by a set of differences (delta) between a reference genome (R) and a version genome (V). A database representation of delta is proposed that will achieve 60-120 fold compression over a text representation of DNA. In addition to the huge savings in storage space, this storage paradigm offers pre-computed polymorphism data.  A description of the method for determining delta, a data model to represent delta, methods for comparing genomes based on delta, and a method for traversing R to reconstruct V based on delta are part of the innovation. There is currently no information system that seeks to solve the problem of storing complete human genomes on this scale. Delta Compression has been widely applied to other string data to reduce network traffic and simplify data backups. The proposed application of Delta Compression in molecular biology is novel. The resulting technology and content-driven products built around this information system will have wide commercial appeal in all disciplines where the study of individual DNA variation is important.",

More than 85% of strokes are ischemic and these strokes affect more than 2 million people in the developed world each year, including 615,000 in the United States in 2003. Currently, the prognosis for those who suffer from an ischemic stroke is poor - approximately 20% die shortly after the initial stroke and most survivors require full or part-time care. The total costs associated with stroke, including acute and chronic care, rehabilitation and indirect costs, are estimated at about $50 billion annually in the U.S. The aim of the proposed research is the design and construction of a medical device that treats ischemic stoke patients by virtue of breaking-down endovascular blood occlusions using Selva Medical Inc.'s proprietary LIFT (Laser Induced Fluid-dynamic Thrombolysis) technology that is a safer and more reliable approach compared to laser ablation treatments. The device consists of a reliable diode-pumped q-switched Nd:YAG laser source, a laser beam delivery module that interfaces with a novel microcatheter that includes fiber optic probes. The catheter tip design will be based on laboratory feasibility studies and guided by advanced simulation. In Phase I we intend to build conseptual prototypes of the catheter tip aided by novel simulation tools and test them in the laboratory using existing lasers. In Phase II we intend to finalize the design, build prototypes and perform laboratory experiments and initial animal studies to verify the final design of the catheter. Our plan is to include human clinical trials in a Phase II continuation grant and commercialize the device thereafter. The instrument should be reliable, maintainable and easy to use by trained medical personnel. It will be capable of operation within the 6-hour window required for patient treatment from ischemic stroke. It will be capable of basic treatment within 10 minutes of starting operation.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II proposal continues the development and validation of a bioinformatics and diagnostic platform for rapid detection and pre-symptomatic identification of biological agents on the basis of host gene and proteomic expression response profiles. Our collaborators preliminary host-pathogen studies indicate that exposed individuals display idiosyncratic peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) mKNA expression and serum protein temporal patterns to pathogenic agents prior to the onset of full illness. New tools are needed to determine the patterns from the volumes of complex, variable, and noisy genomic/proteomic data generated from host-pathogen studies. Our computational tools are based on the probabilistic power of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) which are utilized to learn, model and recognize the dynamic pattern-of-change of mRNA and proteins (\"biosignature\") of the hostpathogen innate immune response. A unique feature of our approach is the inclusion of \"time\" combined with prior quantitative and qualitative knowledge that improves the recognition accuracy between different pathogenic agents. Phase I s/w prototype demonstrated proof-of-concept that our computational approach produced correct DBN models from time-course data mimicking the innate immune response to nine different pathogen types. The prototype performed remarkably well in both the representation of the time-course biosignatures as DBN models and for correctly identifying an unknown biosignature to the correct infectious agent with better than 98% accuracy. Phase II main objective is to statistically show that Seralogix's computational framework can extract and model unique host-pathogen biosignature patterns in the face of host heterogeneities using real time-course PBMC mRNA and protein datasets for the pathogens/toxin B. anthracis, cowpow, and staphylococcal enterotoxin B. in animal and non-human primate models. Existing time course data will be provided by our collaborators at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and the Biosignature Consortium (comprised of the University of New Mexico, the University of Texas Southwestern Med.

        "abstract": "75778B  Previous research has shown that the Ta diffusion barrier in composite Nb3Sn superconductors, such as those used in the superconducting magnets needed for fusion confinement systems, may develop a failure mode during wire drawing, due to the non-uniform deformation of the thin Ta layer.  This non-uniform deformation can lead to breaches in the diffusion barrier and its premature fracture during wire drawing.  In recent experiments, a process called Equal Channel Angular Extrusion (ECAE) was shown to be effective in refining the grain size in bulk material, homogenizing the microstructure, and substantially reducing the texture.  This project will demonstrate that ECAE- processed Ta exhibits excellent mechanical characteristics for its use as a diffusion barrier in multi-filamentary composite Nb3Sn superconductors.  Phase I demonstrated:  (1) the effectiveness of ECAE processing for grain refinement and microstructure homogenization of pure Ta and Cu, and, (2) the superior mechanical characteristics of ECAE processed Ta sheet, compared with commercially available Ta, for a diffusion barrier in Nb3Sn multi-filamentary superconductors.  Phase II will demonstrate that ECAE-processed Ta sheet is superior to commercially available Ta sheet for multifilamentary Nb3Sn uperconductor diffusion barrier applications.  Superiority will be demonstrated by forming a thinner and more regular Ta layer in experimental fusion magnet conductors.   Commercial Applications And Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should be applicable a to the production of Ta sheet for use as Nb3Sn superconductor diffusion barrier material, with favorable economics.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gastrointestinal motility disorders remain significant both in terms of prevalence and morbidity (e.g., suffering, functional impairment, and health care resource use). Intraluminal manometry is an important diagnostic tool, but technological limitations of current devices having relatively few pressure sensing sites have restricted its clinical use. These limitations are strongly apparent in anorectal manometry where the complex muscular structures are closely spaced and asymmetric structural defects may exist. The novel application of tactile technology to manometric measurement will yield high-definition pressure images of this region. High-definition manometry likely will improve diagnosis and treatment of millions of people with anorectal motor dysfunction (e.g., anal incontinence, constipation). The techniques when applied to other organ regions also may benefit patients with other pelvic floor disorders, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and motility disorders in upper gut sites.       In this Phase I effort we will build a functional prototype high-definition motility visualization system (HD-MVS) with as many as one hundred fold more pressure sensors than are used in current anorectal manometry systems. The data will be displayed on a 3-D model that will ultimately project the radial and circumferential distributions of contractile pressure within the region. We will optimize the probe form factor for anorectal study and perform technology advancements to demonstrate that the sensor is capable of meeting key performance requirements.       The HD-MVS will yield unique benefits for physicians, clinical staff, and patients. High-definition coverage of the entire organ surface promises simplified and shortened clinical procedures with greater consistency in study data site-to-site. The ability to isolate and characterize physiological abnormalities should be dramatically improved. This technology has the potential to significantly expand the clinical utility of manometric assessment in disease management.",

In Phase 1 of this project samples of oral reading fluency were collected from 196 students in grades 2 through 6 and across a range of passage-difficulty levels. Analyses of these data focused on interactions between passage level and reading ability. The data and analyses were also used to tune and test the performance of the Reading Assistant's speech recognition layer. The software's ability to discern competent from unacceptable readings exceeded 95% for both English language learners and native speakers of English. In Phase 2 of the project, Soliloquy Learning plans to evaluate whether regular, classroom use of the Reading Assistant effectively promotes children's reading growth. Treatment students will be asked to read with the software for one hour each week. To examine the impact of the software across demographic settings, the study will involve Grade 2-4 students in inner-city and in median-income, suburban schools. To examine the extent to which benefits of the software extend to older children with longer histories of reading struggle, the study will also include a treatment and control sample of middle-school students. To investigate how the impact of the software may accrue, plateau or change in nature with longer-term use, treatment for both elementary and middle-school cohorts will extend across two school years. Dependent measures include word recognition, fluency, vocabulary, and full-scale test scores. In addition, audio files and data logs created by the Reading Assistant during each reading session will be used to monitor usage and progress more closely. In complement to the intervention study, Soliloquy has proposed several targeted investigations: of reading characteristics, speech timing, and prosodies as they relate to reading fluency, of the nature of textual difficulties that trigger disfluencies, and of the relation of comprehension and fluency measures in assessing overall reading proficiency.",

These microcarrier products would replace current microcarriers that have porcine collagen (i.e., gelatin) as part of the attachment surface. The synthetic collagen peptide-coated microcarriers would be an ideal replacement for existing products in animal product-free manufacturing protocols. Currently, three collagen-coated microcarriers, (a collagen-coated dextran bead [Cytodex 3] manufactured offshore and SoloHill's two gelatin-coated microcarriers) are the most extensively used microcarrier substrates in the industrial scale production of anchorage-dependent cells. As manufacturers of viral vaccines and other biologicals move toward complete animal product-free manufacturing conditions, a substrate containing collagen or gelatin will not be acceptable. Microcarriers with a synthetic collagen peptide - coated surface would provide an ideal replacement. The Phase II studies described here follow directly from the successes achieved in Phase I.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment and prevention of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections remains a major challenge for controlling this worldwide health problem; existing therapies are only partially effective and no vaccine is currently available. RNA interference offers the potential of a novel therapeutic approach for treating HCV infections. Toward this end, we are developing small hairpin interfering RNAs (shRNAs) and modified siRNAs targeting the conserved internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element of the HCV genome. Phase I experiments utilized a reporter gene plasmid in which firefly luciferase (fLuc) expression is dependent on the HCV IRES. Direct transfection of HCV IRES shRNAs, or alternatively shRNAs expressed from pol Ill-promoter vectors, efficiently blocked HCV IRES-mediated fLuc expression in human hepatocytes and a mouse model where nucleic acids were delivered to cells in the liver by hydrodynamic transfection via the tail vein. In vivo bioluminescent imaging revealed that HCVwt shRNA inhibited HCV IRES-dependent reporter gene expression up to 99% in the mouse model; doubly mutated or irrelevant shRNAs had little or no effect. Phase II builds on the Phase I accomplishments to develop efficient methods for inhibitor delivery to liver by 1) derivatizing siRNAs to facilitate liver targeting and uptake and 2) preparation of adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes that deliver shRNAs specifically to the liver. Side-by-side experiments with shRNA, siRNAs (unmodified and modified) and AAV-delivered shRNAs will be performed to determine ability to block HCV IRES-dependent gene expression. As HCV does not infect tissue culture cells, lead inhibitors will be tested in human hepatocytes stably expressing HCV replicons prior to engaging in large scale pre-clinical animal studies. The use of single photo emission computed tomography (SPECT) allows non-invasive imaging and hence optimization of delivery and si/shRNA targeting of HCV IRES-dependent somatostatin receptor-2 reporter expression in mice as well as large animals such as monkeys. Pharmacokinetic and toxicology experiments will be done in rabbits and monkeys prior to investigating the inhibitors in HCV-infected animal models, including non-human primates chronically infected with HCV and the chimeric KMT mouse model.",

In Phase I of the proposed project, we will re-tape our existing 25 lessons to align the content with an improved scope and sequence and to demonstrate more fully the relationship between speech sound awareness, letter-sound association, word reading, spelling, vocabulary and writing. We will then field test the impact of this teacher mentoring/student instruction tool on teaching practices and student outcomes in several first grade classrooms over a three month period. The lessons will be produced as DVD-based presentations designed to illustrate the specific skills that teachers will learn best through modeling and demonstration. We show the teachers how, during instruction, they must differentiate between phonemes and graphemes, call attention to the features of speech sounds, use \"hands-on\" sound blending techniques, teach orthographic patterns, guide students into a decoding habit, use memory strategies for irregular words, follow reading with writing, and explore word meanings even while decoding skill is being established. This approach complements any comprehensive, core reading instruction program that meets the stipulations of Reading First.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The epilepsies are a family of disorders of brain dynamics. Patients are susceptible to seizures (changes in sensation, awareness, or behavior caused by brief electrical disturbances in the brain). Often, the electrical disturbances originate from an \"epileptogenic zone\" in part of the brain, from which the disturbances are propagated to other parts of the brain. Epilepsy affects approximately 2.5 million persons in the United States, over 50 million persons worldwide, and 150,000 to 200,000 new cases occur annually in the U.S. Although most epilepsy patients can control their seizures with the use of antiepileptic drugs, about 20% of patients cannot bring their seizures under control using drug therapy. Many patients with pharmacologically intractable seizures can eliminate their disability largely or completely by neurosurgical intervention, which typically involves resection of tissue in the epileptogenic zone to prevent the spread of electrical disturbances. Candidates for epilepsy surgery are generally evaluated with scalp electroencephalography (EEC) telemetry, and, increasingly, with magnetoencephalography (MEG). We propose to develop computer software that will aid clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of medically intractable epilepsy, using data obtained from structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), MEG, and EEG. Our goal is to develop and validate improved methods for the non-invasive localization of the epileptogenic zone through the automated analysis of spike-like electrical activity recorded in the interval between seizures (interictal spikes). During Phase I, we improved the sensitivity, specificity, and computational efficiency of our automatic interictal spike identification and classification software. The software was evaluated, using MEG and sMRI data obtained from epilepsy surgery patients. During Phase II, we will add additional features for spike propagation analysis, extend the validation to EEG data, and incorporate the resulting algorithms into our commercial EMSE Suite software.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  SHOT proposes research leading to the commercialization of technology for magnetic isolation of hematopoietic stem cells from human umbilical cord blood, bone marrow and peripheral apheresis product cells. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is an established therapy for certain leukemias and other hematologic diseases. The high cure potential of allogeneic BMT is limited by the need for matched histocompatible donors to minimize the possibility of graft-versus-host disease. The ability to isolate stem cells opens a new clinical approach for engineering a most suitable graft. In Phase I research SHOT'S collaborators at The Cleveland Clinic Foundation established that the Quadrupole Magnetic (flow) Sorter (QMS) fulfills most of the requirements for hematologic stem cell selection with its much higher yield and capacity relative to most other methods, and SHOT demonstrated the manufacture of prototype sterile disposable magnetic flow channels and a QMS system. Phase II research thus calls for the design of a package, consisting of an automated QMS facility and disposable channels with sufficient precision, reproducibility and capacity to qualify ultimately for the isolation of human hematopoietic stem cells in the clinical setting. SHOT will (1) perform research to increase the sample size that the QMS system can process from 140 ml to 500 ml; (2) investigate imumunomagnetic labeling technologies to increase the magnetic mobility of the labeled cells, thus increasing sample processing speed; (3) refine the QMS system design in accordance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) design guidelines to incorporate lessons learned, making the system faster, more versatile and more user-friendly; and (4) complete a betatesting program in nationally-known cancer and cell therapy laboratories. The proposed Phase II end items are two pre-market manufactured QMS system prototypes and a set of refined separation channels capable of supporting the beta testing program and ready for the cGMP verification process. SHOT'S goal for the QMS system is the capability of sorting 10 million cells/sec at a total throughput of 8 ml/min or greater with a recovery and purity of 60% or greater. Phase III activities will include manufacture of the QMS systems and separation channels for sale in the research market, as well as a directed effort towards FDA compliance for sales of the QMS systems and separation channels under cGMP in the clinical setting.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II research project will provide research-aircraft and weather-balloon flight tests a new, novel device for measuring the electric field strength of thunderstorms and hurricanes. Electric field strength is a significant factor in the development of precipitation and lightning, and may even play a role in influencing the intensity of precipitation from thunderstorms. Research aircraft flights that typically measure electric field strength in thunderstorms and hurricanes are difficult and potentially dangerous because of the hazardous conditions, such as lightning, hail and turbulence. However, the new device, called an electric field module, can be contained in a device called a dropsonde and dropped through thunderstorms from aircraft flying above the storm, or attached to weather balloons called radiosondes that are released from the ground.  ince over 7,000 dropsondes and 400,000 weather balloons are routinely deployed each year, adding electric field measures to these devices represents a substantial commercial market. Measurements using the new E-field modules deployed by the SPEC Learjet research aircraft will be unique and open a new realm for analyzing the structure of electric fields in storms. A more realizable goal is improved aviation safety, by virtue of a better understanding of lightning discharges from clouds associated with thunderstorms, particularly anvil clouds, where commercial aircraft are often struck by lightning.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    In this fast-track re-submission for re-classification (due to investigator move from academia to industry) of a multi-center, multi-disciplinary project, we will develop a targeted optical contrast agent and improved roomlight imaging system which allow for real-time imaging of surface tumors as small as 0.1 mm (and subsurface tumors as small as 1 mm to a depth of 5 mm) exposed at the excisional margin during radical prostatectomy surgery. Such tumors are now undetectable in real time. Residual tumor at the surgical margin occurs in 30% of all prostatectomies; such patients have a significantly higher risk of local recurrence, metastasis, and death, and require additional radiation therapy. The contrast agent is based on a conjugation of a Cy 7, a fluorescent dye, and huJ-591, a humanized antibody from Millennium Pharmaceuticals targeted to all cells of luminal prostate origin. We will synthesize this agent, test in tissue culture and xenograft mouse, GMP manufacture, and perform pre-clinical safety studies. This project divides into feasibility (R43) and development (R44) phases, in response to NCI/BIP PAR-03-125.    Specific aims of the 1 yr. R43 feasibility component are: a) to produce a targeted optical contrast agent specific for human prostate cells of luminal origin by conjugating Cy 7 to huJ591, b) to test a room-light clinical imaging system that detects a fluorescent signal in operating room ambient light from at a dye concentration expected to be found in tumors in vivo, with quantitative, milestone-based performance characteristics selected so as to make success in vivo likely, and c) to demonstrate that this agent can be detected with a signal to noise of at least 2:1 in 10 seconds or less, and imaged at nM levels in tissue models, while retaining 20% huJ591 binding activity. This specific aims by which we will measure the success of the 3 year R44 development component are: a) to optimize dye kinetics, b) to deploy an OR-ready real-time imaging system, c) to produce a GMP pharmaceutical grade conjugated antibody-dye, and to perform pre-clinical safety testing in culture and in animals, and d) to evaluate performance in OR conditions, and e) quantitate the ability to surgically obtain negative margins in animal studies.   If successful, this approach may lead to fewer positive margins during surgical prostatectomy and, in the long term, allow for more effective treatment, with ultimate extension to breast cancer and melanoma as well.",

Early detection and diagnosis can saves lives and reduce the burden on the national healthcare system. We have built a non-invasive research-prototype point-of-care device to detect early cancerous conditions of the uterine cervix. We have tested this prototype in a multi-center national study accruing data from 600 women for training our algorithm. Through conversations with the FDA we now have in place a pivotal trial protocol for validating our algorithm. We will use a pre-production version of our device in this pivotal study. The pre-production device will be a cost and size reduced, portable, rugged and user-friendlier device and is intended to be identical to the device intended for sale without incurring the tooling costs necessary to enter the production phase. In Phase I of this fast track application we will address the high-risk aspects of building this pre-production device as well as arrive at a conceptual design. In Phase II we will finalize this design (both component level and systems integration) and build ten copies of the device to support the pivotal trial. We will also complete necessary systems tests and determine inter/intra device variability. We will conclude with the design documentation necessary for our PMA submission.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This proposal is to develop a power M-mode Doppler ultrasound device for monitoring blood flow in the basal arteries of the brain for embolic events, and characterizing these emboli as gas bubbles or particulates. This device is of significant value in several venues where medical procedures result in emboli going to the brain. Substantial clinical significance of embolus characterization is found in surgeries utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass, for which numerous outcomes studies have documented short and long term cognitive decline. Approximately one third of strokes associated with CPB are intra operative[l], a majority of which are embolic. The effects of embolization are currently not appreciated until the patient comes out of anesthesia and manifests neurologic deficits in the intensive care unit, which is too late to take preventive or therapeutic action. Ultrasound differentiation of embolus composition during surgery is therefore of great value for appropriately responding to the type of emboliziation with therapy or modification in surgical approach or technique. This proposal is based on successful in vitro (flow phantom) and in vivo (characterization of emboli from prosthetic heart valves in a human subject) feasibility experiments for Doppler ultrasound discrimination of gas bubbles and particulates. The critical elements for this technology are: (1) a high dynamic range Doppler ultrasound platform capable of processing Doppler shifts from fundamental and second harmonic reflections from moving scatterers and (2) a transducer with similar sensitivity patterns at both fundamental and second harmonic frequencies. The proposed work is to further develop these critical elements by refinement of probe design, enhancement of signal processing of the fundamental and second harmonic echoes from emboli, and presentation of the characterization results to the operator in an easily appreciated image format. The system developed in this proposal will be tested in a series of experiments on a flow loop, an animal model of the human middle cerebral artery, and on human subjects undergoing Tran cranial Doppler evaluation for presence and severity of patent foramen ovale. These tests will include observation of single emboli and embolus showers, with variable embolus size and composition. This work is anticipated to result in improved neurological outcomes in the targeted heart surgery application, and a Phase III partner is ready and waiting to take the technology to market.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This proposal is to develop new Doppler ultrasound technology for automatic diagnostic mapping of blood flow in the basal arteries of the brain. These vessels include the middle cerebral artery, the anterior cerebral artery, and the posterior communicating artery. This technology will enable transcranial Doppler diagnostic workup of the acute stroke patient for the rank-and-file emergency department physician, something not currently possible because of the expertise required to utilize transcranial Doppler in any setting. The Phase I SBIR work, from which this proposal moves forward, successfully demonstrated feasibility of the technology with particularly important demonstration of the fast signal processing algorithms for rapid location of flow signals in the angular territory viewable by the ultrasound beam. This technology is needed to quickly and simply provide diagnosis of pathological blood flow conditions that indicate acute stroke in progress, or the risk of stroke, as well as to selectively apply ultrasound to basal arteries of the brain during thrombolytic therapy for stroke. This technology also presents the potential for dramatically increasing the application to a much wider range of health professionals to obtain important diagnostic information with high sensitivity and specificity, and without the utilization frustrations experienced by current users both in locating and maintaining blood flow signals. The emergency department, the operating room, and the vascular laboratory all represent awaiting markets. Phase II targets significant enhancements to the technology demonstrated in Phase I, including increased angular viewing capability for mapping flow in multiple cerebral vessels. The work proposed will result in a prototype platform to explore a new ultrasound modality from which decisions can be made regarding production prototyping for each of the markets noted above. A device for automatic location of and fast mapping, tracking, and monitoring of blood flow in the basal arteries of the brain represents a major commercial market potential.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The therapeutic use of some analgesic compounds is often limited because of potentially adverse and dangerous side effects. However, combinations of analgesics with different mechanisms of action could enhance analgesic efficacy (synergy) while reducing the dose-dependent adverse effects of the individual components. The development of combination analgesics that are synergistic, therefore, would effectively reduce the dose of each compound, thus reducing the adverse effects while maintaining analgesic potency.    Combinations of acetaminophen with opioids (i.e., hydrocodone, codeine) are frequently prescribed for acute and chronic pain management. However, although acetaminophen combinations have greater efficacy for moderate to severe pain and are some of the most popular prescription analgesics on the market, it has been recognized that even at therapeutic doses acetaminophen (and combinations containing acetaminophen) can cause liver toxicity. Thus, a drug with a similar analgesic profile to acetaminophen, but with little or no hepatotoxicity, would be a valuable substitute for acetaminophen in these combinations. Phase I supported the development of a non-toxic acetaminophen analog (SCP-1) in which we explored the feasibility of using this compound in combination with other opioid and nonopioid analgesics. Our goal was to identify two SCP-1 combinations (one opioid and one nonopioid) that displayed synergistic analgesic properties, and would be the basis for further drug development in Phase II. Based on their superior synergistic analgesic profile, SCP-1+codeine and SCP-1+clonidine combinations were identified as candidates for further development. Under Phase II support we will evaluate and screen further the analgesic profiles and adverse side-effects of different SCP-1 : codeine and SCP-1 : clonidine combination ratios (i.e. formulations). These results will be the basis for conducting key early stage pre-clinical GLP safety studies under Phase II that will be used in our IND applications to the FDA. In Phase III we will conduct Phase I human clinical trials to evaluate tolerability and oral bioavailability in normal human volunteers, and Phase II human clinical trials to evaluate the combinations in postoperative pain patients.",

This project will develop a novel magnetic detector system, based on ultra-sensitive superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) sensors, that is sensitive to magnetic field gradients and discriminates against uniform magnetic fields and ambient noise sources.  During Phase I, three prototype detector designs were developed, fabricated, and tested.  The third design met the key technical goals and was shown to be operable in a typical laboratory environment with very low-noise performance.  In addition, the design of suitable packaging for the detectors was completed and the first package assemblies were built. In Phase II, STAR further design improvements will enhance detector performance by a factor of two, and an existing detector fabrication process will be transitioned from 100-mm wafers to 150-mm wafers, significantly reducing detector costs.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The advanced superconducting quantum interference device magnetic detectors, with high ambient noise rejection and low cost, will be attractive for commercial biomedical imaging applications such as magnetocardiography.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Severe burns and other major trauma to the skin are life-threatening injuries that often require immediate surgical intervention. Typically, this involves temporary coverage of the wound site with cadaver skin or synthetic dressings to prevent infection and dehydration. Permanent closure of the wound is generally accomplished through split-thickness skin autografting after the wound bed has healed to the point that it will accept autograft tissue. Although this regimen is the standard of care for severe skin wounds, limited availability of cadaver skin, the potential for transmission of pathogens from donor tissue, and the ultimate rejection of the cadaver skin pose serious drawbacks to this approach. Safe and effective alternatives to the use of cadaver skin are needed to improve the care of patients with these life-threatening wounds.       Stratatech Corporation has developed a novel cultured skin substitute tissue, StrataGraft(tm) skin tissue, for the temporary management of severe skin wounds prior to autografting. The development and optimization of StrataGraft(tm) tissue was funded in part by the Phase I portion of this SBIR project. StrataGraft(tm) tissue is a living combination skin substitute with a fully-stratified epidermal layer which imparts permeability barrier function comparable to that of native epidermis. The FDA has approved a Phase I/II clinical trial (IND#10113) for Stratatech to evaluate the safety and efficacy of StrataGraft(tm) skin tissue as an alternative to cadaver skin in the temporary management of severe skin defects requiring surgical intervention. This Phase II SBIR proposal is designed to build on the success of the Phase I project by performing a clinical evaluation of StrataGraft(tm) skin tissue. Successful completion of this Phase l/ll clinical trial will position Stratatech to conduct a pivotal Phase III clinical trial, leading to the ultimate commercialization of StrataGraft(tm) skin tissue as an improved therapy for the management of burns and other severe skin trauma.",

        "abstract": "Summit Safety will develop an ultrasonic, non-contact sensor and system capable of detecting small displacements of structure - such as roof sagging and structural bending - and the acoustic sounds and fire-induced vibrations of structures that are precursors of structural collapse. The system will provide advanced warning to the Incident Commander of potential or imminent structure collapse. In Phase 1, the basic sensor was built, with the capability of measuring displacements under a thousandth of an inch at a distance of up to 12 feet from the structure. Velocity and acceleration signals provide additional motion sensing. For acceleration measurements, the sensor's performance is comparable to commercial accelerometers. By being non-contact, the sensor can measure motion at otherwise inaccessible locations. The sensor can be set up and aligned in a matter of seconds. COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The total U.S. market for this product includes the over 1 million firefighters in over 26,000 fire departments and 40,000 fire stations, potential monitoring and tactical military and law enforcement applications, as well as Search and Rescue (such as FEMA USAR teams).

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The specific aim of the Phase I and Phase II research program will be to design and build an \"open\", split pair coil, high field (>1 .5T), cryogen-free MRI magnet. The key innovation that will make this goal feasible is the development of an advanced, high performance, round high temperature superconductor capable of operation at 20 Kelvin. Operating at a temperature of 20K will allow cooling of the magnet by conduction with a mechanical cryocooler. A cryogen free system does not require the vacuum and cryostat space and therefore will allow the magnet designer to use a split pair coil configuration for an open system for easier access to the imaging subject and the central imaging volume. An open magnet also provides more patient comfort by removing the claustrophobic \"tunnel\" of conventional cylindrical superconducting magnets. The cryogen free structure might also allow the magnet to be used in the horizontal and vertical position, allowing imaging while the patient is in the standing position.      The benefits of open, superconducting MRI magnets are being realized daily. In 1994 a superconducting GE open magnet system was installed at the Brigham & Women's Hospital. Since then researchers at the Harvard Medical School believe that the machine will pay for itself by increasing the speed and accuracy with which surgeons can do biopsies on cancerous tumors. Also, by allowing surgeons to biopsy tumors that cannot be diagnosed by conventional methods, the new technique could save patients not only the costs but also the pain and discomfort of needless or inappropriate therapies. Another application of an open MRI is the use in osteoporosis diagnosis. In this case, the calcaneum of the feet of the patient is placed into the MRI machine. Most patients examined are typically elderly with very little mobility and cannot withstand significant discomfort by positions required in the conventional MRI system. A split coil configuration would then allow a much easier and more comfortable access to the volume of interest.",

        "abstract": "75077S  An economical process will be needed to produce super conducting material for the high field magnets that will be used in future accelerators for High Energy Physics (HEP) research.  To achieve this economy, it will be necessary to reduce the hysteresis losses that occur in the new high-current-density conductors.  One way of doing this is to reduce the size of the super conducting units into which these conductors are divided.  This project will accomplish this goal by dividing the super conducting units (the subelements) with radial fins of non-superconductors.  In Phase I, three different designs of small diameter billets with fins were assembled, extruded, and processed to wire.  Reductions in the hysteresis losses were shown in most of the individual subelements and in several of the 18-subelement restacks.  In Phase II, the most promising designs will be selected, the process will be scaled up to full sized billets, and material will be supplied to the National Laboratories for coil winding experiments.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In addition to its use in HEP accelerator applications, the material should be useful in magnets for open-area Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), where the patient is more accessible to the surgeon. (MRI is the largest commercial application of low temperature superconductors).  Fusion and levitated transportation projects represent other possible applications.",

We plan to: (i) optimize and build a pre-commercial prototype ES/PI source for use on commercial mass spectrometers, and (ii) develop and demonstrate key applications that highlight the unique benefits of the ES/PI source, The goals of the phase I project were met and a prototype ES/PI was built and tested on a Micromass LCT and an Agilent MSD mass spectrometer. Since phase I, Syagen has performed additional tests, and has adapted a new source to a Waters ZQ. The ES/PI performance was measured as a function of flow rate, heating, PI position, and ES ionization (ESI) voltage. Tests were conducted using a variety of compounds not ionized efficiently by ESI (e.g., steroids, phenols, aldehydes, etc.). PI ionized these compounds efficiently. Further tests were performed on drug and protein mixtures to examine the potential to analyze both classes of compounds simultaneously. The significance and importance of this work is high. Developing new ionization sources for life science research is a major thrust in mass spectrometry as witnessed by the awarding of the 2002 Nobel Prize for ESI and laser desorption/ionization (e.g., MALDI) of biological molecules. This proposed work will greatly expand the capabilities of ESI making possible the development of new advanced methods for high-throughput analysis. There is already interest in this technology by commercial MS vendors. If we are successful with the phase II work, we are confident of finding a commercialization partner for the ES/PI source.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a new technology called tissue-initiated photopolymerization, which permits direct covalent integration of a polymer into collagen, that has been shown to mechanically stabilize the hydrogel-cartilage interaction. Furthermore, the technique we have developed, allows in situ hydrogel formation to occur without exogenous photoinitiator, improving biocompatibility. Patent applications covering this technology have been filed. There are several envisoned applications of this technology, and the objective of this program is to develop the first application, to provide a method for annealing of grafted cartilage to the surrounding host articular cartilage. It is anticipated that this will provide a stable implantation of grafts into the articular defect site, and that this will substantially increase long term performance of the implanted material.  The overall hypothesis for this program is that articular cartilage can be successfully integrated into the surrounding tissue to repair focal articular defects. The work in the Phase I project was to demonstrate feasibility of the approach, with the goals to achieve adhesion >2 times greater (160 kPa) than that achieved previously, and to not extend cell death beyond what would be expected by cutting cartilage (100-200 um). The adhesion strength achieved was 543 kPa, and cell death was not extended beyond 113 um. We therefore achieved the goals in the Phase I project.  The aims of the Phase II project is to optimize the device for articular cartilage, demonstrate effectiveness in a goat model of osteochondral repair, and assess biocompatibility. The successful outcome of this project will allow for submission to the FDA for product clearance (510k) or initiation of a clinical trial.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a disease affecting infants who become oxygen dependent as a result of prolonged mechanical ventilation with supplemental oxygen early in life. Barotrauma and elevated levels of oxygen induce direct injury to the immature lung tissue, resulting in an inflammatory response and infiltration by circulating neutrophils. When neutrophils chemotax to the site of lung injury, the damage to the lung is compounded by the potent oxidant properties the neutrophils possess. Increased injury to the lung results in decreased blood oxygenation, requiring ventilation with progressively higher concentrations of oxygen that further accelerates the pace of injury. One way to break this vicious cycle of inflammation and injury is to block the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung. Novel inhibitors of neutrophil chemotaxis have been discovered that potently inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis both in vitro and in vivo. The goals of this SBIR Phase II proposal are to optimize the chemical structure of these chemotaxis inhibitors for potency, metabolic stability and intestinal absorption, and obtain the pharmacokinetic and toxicological data necessary for submission of an investigational new drug (IND) application for advancing these novel inhibitors towards clinical evaluation in humans.",

The total cost of stroke to the United States is estimated at about $43 billion per year. The only FDA-approved treatment for acute ischemic stroke is recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt- PA). However, the therapeutic window of rt-PA is only up to 3 hours from onset of stroke, and the treatment may increase the incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage. In the past decade or more, hundreds of neuroprotective compounds have failed in clinical trails due to either their insignificant effectiveness or high toxicity. SynZyme Technologies, LLC, has developed a novel therapy, polynitroxylated albumin (PNA). PNA is synthesized by covalently labeling human serum albumin with a high molar ratio of nitroxides, which act as neurovascular protectants and potent antioxidants. PNA has been tested in a number of leading stroke research centers in the U.S. and showed great promise in various animal stroke models. The feasibility of PNA treatment is confirmed not only by its promising pre-clinical results and its good safety profile, but also by previous clinical trial experience involving either antioxidants alone or those involving human albumin alone. The extensive research efforts are leading PNA into the drug development phase as a treatment of acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. We received clear recommendations from the FDA on PNA development on May 6, 2004. The goal of this proposed work is to complete the requirements of the FDA for an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, an essential step to new drug approval. There are three major components for the completion: chemistry manufacturing and control (CMC), GLP toxicity studies, and clinical protocol development. SynZyme's team will manage and work with high quality certified contract research organizations (CRO) to achieve the proposed Aims according to the FDA's guidance.

Development of novel high throughput functional genomics tools are critical for genome-wide discovery and validation of drug targets, and to open avenues for newer concepts in drug therapy and diagnostics of complex human diseases. The recent introduction of gene knockdown technology based on small interfering RNAs (siRNA) holds a promise to revolutionize gene functional analysis. The goal of the proposed program is to develop and make commercially available a comprehensive set of genome-wide siRNA libraries in lentiviral vectors that are more effective and cost-efficient than the currently available collection of synthetic siRNAs. Under Phase I funding, the biosafe feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) lentiviral siRNA cloning vectors and technology for construction of high complexity siRNA libraries were developed. The Human 1.5K siRNA library, comprising of a redundant set of 7500 siRNAs for 1500 genes, was constructed and functionally tested in the radiation resistance HT1080 cell model. High-throughput technology for genetic screens of radiation-resistance genes, based on a combination of siRNA libraries and Affymerix GeneChip(r) microarrays, was developed. Lentiviral siRNA cloning vectors were released as commercial products and ready-to-use, prepackaged in viral particles, human 1.5K and 8.5K siRNA libraries are currently in the product launch cycle. Under Phase II funding, we propose to extend the program towards development and commercialization of a comprehensive set of genome-wide 50K human, 40K mouse and 30K rat siRNA libraries in lentiviral vectors with a selection of different reporters and tet-regulated expression of siRNAs. siRNA libraries will allow the performance of global searches for key genes involved in a variety of diseases and to validate new drug targets by arbitrary selective inactivation of diseaseassociated genes in the context of the living cells. The established technology will be applied, in collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, for identification of targets for drug development, aiming at prostate cancer. The anticipated outcomes of the proposed research and product development program will be a commercially available set of kits comprising of lentiviral vectors and siRNA libraries for high-throughput gene functional analysis, custom genomewide functional screen service and validated anticancer drug targets for treatment of prostate cancer.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Experts recognize that the proper assessment and treatment of pain should extend beyond the biological injury to include more complex multidimensional variables. These variables include patient expectations, impact on quality of life, beliefs, prior experiences, and social and recreational variables. Research indicates that pain related outcomes are improved if the whole person is treated instead focusing only on the physiological process. In spite of the acknowledgement of the benefits of multidimensional pain assessment and treatment, significant conceptual and practical barriers remain. The disparity between state-of-the-art knowledge and clinical practice accentuates the need for strategies and tools to help bridge this gap. Primary care providers, in the frontline of pain management, are particularly in need of tools to improve care and efficiency as they are increasingly asked to provide more care with limited resources.        In order to help bridge the gap between conceptual understanding of pain management and delivered care in the primary care setting, we developed a pilot version of a computerized assessment and feedback tool that provides multidimensional pain evaluation and treatment advice. We conducted pilot studies with both primary care providers and chronic pain patients. Results indicated that both patients and providers found the MPAT tool to be a useful and functional piece of software. Feedback from providers about report types and features will be used to further develop the Phase II product. We propose (in Phase II) to extend the MPAT reporting tool to include a wider range of assessment measures and to further develop our software to allow for more complex data analysis and synthesis. We will also create a clinician and patient website to improve efficacy of report generation, and from which providers can access a tutorial that presents the theoretical rationale for the product, training to use the MPAT, educational handouts for chronic pain patients, and from which patients can access brief, didactic information for patients about non-pharmacological treatment of pain. In the project's second year, we will conduct a utility study with a sample of primary care providers and their chronic pain patients to examine changes in patient mood, activity, and pain ratings, as well as to investigate the usability and utility of the MPAT Phase II system in a real world setting.",

This grant proposes to use the Internet to deliver a coping skills workbook for PTSD patients as a supplement to face-to-face treatment (Strategic Personal Resources for Overcoming and Understanding Trauma: SPROUT). Technology enables this workbook to be highly interactive with a multimedia presentation format (e.g., audio, animation, and interactive exercises) and customized feedback. SPROUT will teach coping skills gathered from EST's and will include training in symptom identification, relaxation skills, mindfulness, affect identification and regulation, and cognitive restructuring. Each module will include psychoeducation, on-line exercises, self-monitoring assignments, and individualized feedback. An accompanying clinician website will consist of individualized reports of each patient's progress with suggestions about how to facilitate the strengthening and generalization of the skills. In Phase I, two pilot modules were completed (Introduction to PTSD and Basic Relaxation Skills) as well as the content for a third module (Advanced Relaxation). A successful feasibility study was conducted wherein the two pilot modules were used and evaluated by 30 PTSD patients. These participants gave the modules very high ratings. Phase E will complete the ten workbook modules as well as patient and companion clinician websites (including discussion board options for patients). A randomized clinical trial of 128 PTSD patients will be conducted on the completed product using six private practice clinicians as research therapists.

Seven enhancements are planned: (1) an automated system for identifying peer leaders and social isolates; (2) an automated method for collecting and organizing students' responses used in the Opinion Poll Game; (3) an application for creating personalized commitment certificates; (4) an application to help students prioritize desired futures; (5) an application to assist students create high-quality personal crests that embody their ideals; (6) an application to provide students with monthly normative feedback about students' attitudes; and (7) a product called the Digital Yearbook that will contain photos, video clips, and text that summarizes students' participation in All Stars to reinforce their personal commitments. The Phase I project demonstrated the feasibility of these enhancements. Teachers found the enhanced version of the program easier to implement and reported meaningful time savings for completing out-of-class tasks. During Phase II, technological enhancements will be completed. An independently evaluated field trial will be completed. This study will document the extent to which enhancements increase fidelity, make the program easier to complete, and improve targeted mediators and behavioral outcomes for students.",

Current microbial survey methods capture only the most abundant organisms in complex communities, organisms that may represent less than 1% of the species present.  This project involves the development of a new genomics tool, known as SARD (Serial Analysis of Ribosomal DNA), which enables deep surveys of complex microbial communities by creating an inventory of short DNA sequence tages representing members of the community.  A particular application of the technology is the identification of bacterial species that can be used to locate hydrocarbon plumes that originate from sub-surface petroleum reservoirs.  Phase I isolated a greater number of unique sequence tages than currently reside in any public database, identified clusters of sequences that correlate with propane/butane abundance, developed quantitative assays, and conducted surveys to show the geographical distributions of these sequences.  In Phase II, the technology will be further developed by profiling on-shore exploratory well sites and marine samples from known reservoirs.  These profiles will be further analyzed to determine the ability of this technology to accurately predict a commercially viable well.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  By creating inventories of any microbial community, the SARD profiling technology should have commercial application to petroleum and mineral exploration, pollutant detection, and clinical diagnostics.  In addition, the SARD DNA sequence tages themselves represent a genomic resource that should find use as: (1) a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) primer to recover the corresponding full-length 16S rRNA gene; (2) a primer in a quantitative PCR assay to query the presence of the tage sequence in a large sample collection; (3) a fluorescently-labeled probe in fluorscent in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments; and 4) a probe on a DNA microarray for hybridization-based surveys.",

The development of relevant analytical and simulation-based technologies for the prediction and control for fail-safe adaptivity under adverse and upset conditions is an important step in advancing flight safety goals. Impaired aircraft operate much closer to bifurcation points than a fully functional vehicle. Thus, it is necessary to be able to evaluate aircraft and flight control system performance near stability boundaries. Understanding behavior near operational limits and developing control and recovery strategies for these circumstances is fundamental to achieving that goal. To that end TSi proposes an integrated set of computing tools involving symbolic, numerical and visualization environments. In phase I, the architecture was validated using a benchmark problem.

In particular, new diagnostics are required to observe electron cloud formation and trapping in quadrupole magnets, in order to test theories and simulations of cloud buildup and beam dynamics effects induced by electron clouds.  To date, no diagnostics have been developed that can measure the electrons trapped in accelerator quadrupole magnets.  This project will develop a diagnostic instrument that can measure electron cloud formation and trapping in quadrupole magnets used in high intensity rings or beam transport.  In Phase I, extensive simulations of electron cloud formation and trapping in were made to determine the expected characteristics (including trapping) of the electron cloud in quadrupole magnets.  The simulations revealed the unexpected result that numerous electrons were ejected from the quadrupole when the long bunch beam pulse was present.  Based on these simulations, an optimized physics design for a diagnostic was developed.  Phase II will involve the design, fabrication, and installation of a prototype diagnostic assembly.  Tests of the prototype will evaluate the effectiveness of the diagnostic, and data on the electron cloud formation and trapping in quadrupoles will be collected.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The results of this project should benefit the high intensity proton and positron rings now being upgraded, under construction, or under active consideration at such facilities as the Spallation Neutron Source, the International Linear Collider, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, Proton Drivers for Neutrino Factories, the Japanese Proton Accelerator Complex, and the Large Hadron Collider.

This incompatibility also makes comparison of the data difficult and the inter-working of codes problematic.  Therefore, systems are needed to facilitate data interchange and the interoperability of analysis tools.  This project will address these problems by developing the Fusion Simulation Markup Language (FSML), which is based on the extensible Markup Language (XML).  The system will include:  (1) metadata markups and schemas for describing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation data; (2) uniform C++ API for accessing MHD HDF5 data on different meshes, and interpolating the data without converting it; and (3) comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) environments for visualization of MHD data.  Phase I developed a prototype FSML schema for several fundamental variables of two MHD codes (NIMROD and M3D), implemented a C++ library for parsing FSML and accessing the native HDF5 data, and wrapped this library into AVS/Express modules for data visualization.  Phase II will generalize the FSML schema to include all fundamental MHD variables and other simulation metadata, facilitating data analysis and visualization, and develop comprehensive modules for 3D visualization using AVS/Express and SciRun.  Then, the FSML will be augmented with a set of tools for data interpolation and for accessing data on structured and unstructured meshes through a uniform API.

An electron cooling section is being planned as part of a luminosity upgrade.  Because the parameters and conditions for this electron cooling section will be fundamentally different than those built at other accelerator facilities, the research and design process will require high-performance, high-fidelity numerical simulations.  This project will develop a parallel three-dimensional particle code that incorporates novel features for the detailed simulation of the electron cooling section planned for the RHIC.  In particular, a \"smart\" particle algorithm will be used to incorporate the physics of Coulomb collisions, enabling the simultaneous capture of space charge effects and thermal energy transfer.  In Phase I, a proof-of-principle implementation of the smart particle algorithm was developed within a parallel particle-in-cell code.  The importance of relativistic effects on thermal exchange via binary Coulomb collisions was found to be a modest concern for the case of large emittance electron beams.  Relativistic treatment of space charge forces was shown to be important.  In Phase II, a three-dimensional, semi-analytic algorithm for binary collisions will be implemented.  The replacement of the expensive superconducting solenoid with a long \u00c2\u00bfwiggler\u00c2\u00bf magnet will be simulated in detail, and the \u00c2\u00bfsmart particle\u00c2\u00bf implementation will be completed.

Commercial Applications And Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The parallel 3-D code should benefit scientists working to design the electron cooling section for the luminosity upgrade to the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.

A new non-invasive, bunch-length diagnostic is critical to continuing the rapid advances in LWFA technology.  Coherent transition radiation (CTR), generated as the short bunches exit the plasma, could provide this diagnostic if the effects of various secondary complications were quantified.  This project will develop particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to characterize the CTR emitted from a LWFA and self-modulated (SM) LWFA configurations.  Phase I demonstrated that explicit two-dimensional (2D) PIC simulations could correctly model a full SM-LWFA interaction, including CTR emission from the micron-scale electron bunches emerging from plasmas.  Also, a 2D ponderomotive-guiding-center treatment of the laser pulse was implemented within the framework of the existing PIC code.  In Phase II, the ponderomotive-guiding-center model for the laser envelope will be extended to three dimensions, with improved dispersive properties.  The emission of THz-scale CTR, from accelerated electron bunches (at 10 \u00c2\u00bfm scale) emerging from the plasma, will be simulated using a numerical technique, in order to obtain far-field radiation patterns from near-field plasma currents.

We will conduct longitudinal assessments with 600 adolescents, randomizing them into a High-Feedback (HF) group and a Low-Feedback (LF) control group. In both groups, subjects will take both an initial SR-T-ASI and a CM-T-ASI clinician interview at intake, as well as four follow-up SR-T-ASI assessments over the next 12 months. In the HF group, clinicians will receive feedback reports after each survey administration, as well as referrals to ancillary treatment. For the LF group, clinicians will receive feedback only at intake and no referrals.

AFIT instruments take advantage of the physical behavior of foams to identify bubble stability and breakup activity. The Phase I project confirmed concepts behind AFIT to measure air entrapment.  The Phase II project creates a commercial-ready instrument.  The Phase II research objectives are to (1) construct, test and then refine the tabletop AFIT and the automated sampling, control AFIT prototype instruments; (2) confirm correlations between the foam index/air content values from AFIT prototypes and visual/ASTM measurements; (3) install an AFIT at a partner company and verify its efficacy within a industrial setting; and (4) commercialize these instruments for the concrete industry. Commercially widespread application of AFIT for the concrete industry would promote replacing cement with less expensive mineral admixtures up to specification limits of 30%.  On a worldwide view, the potential cost reduction associated with this replacement is greater than $5 billion per year.  Significant societal benefits also accrue.  First, because cement production is approximately 10 times more energy intensive than the average of all other industrial activities, green house gas emissions worldwide are decreased significantly when cement is replaced by a less energy-intensive substitute.  Second, because the primary mineral admixture used is coal combustion ash, and because it is now predominantly landfilled, environmental impacts and land usage issues are ameliorated.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the past 40 years there has been a remarkable decline in the prevalence of dental caries due to the widespread use of fluoride in public health programs, such as communal water fluoridation, dental practice and in oral hygiene products. In spite of this, dental caries continues to be the most prevalent dental disease. It is known that the traditional visual-tactile clinical caries examination procedure cannot detect lesions until they advance to the stage where they are difficult to reverse with fluorides and other measures. The understanding of the caries process has progressed far beyond the point of restricting the evidence for dental caries at the E2 (caries in enamel only) or D3 (caries in enamel and dentin) levels of cavitations. Recording lesions only at the cavitation level is no longer acceptable (ICCCT, 2002). Quantitative Light Fluorescence (QLF) is a technology that has been shown to detect and quantify the progress of lesions at an early stage (pre-cavitation). This technology will allow dental practitioners to: (a) identify early enamel demineralization reflecting caries risk prior to cavitation; (b) implement appropriate interventions to reverse the disease process at an earlier stage with more efficient outcomes; and (c) monitor the success or failure of the applied intervention measures. The overall goal of this program is to develop a QLF research system for use in clinical dental practice. The Phase I program successfully overcame the limitations of a research hand-piece to permit routine clinical use. The Phase 2 program seeks to further refine the instrument hardware and user software to make the technique practical within clinical practice. The specific aims of this application are to: (1) refine the instrument to make it more ergonomic and facilitate practical infection control procedures; (2) verify the ability of the redesigned instrument to detect early caries and monitor changes in a laboratory; (3) develop user-friendly computer software interfaces that are compatible with the existing software for use by dental professionals; (4) develop appropriate training materials; (5) verify efficacy of the system through a clinical investigation. The results of this research should improve dental health of the general population by identifying dental patients at greater risk of developing dental caries and result in the implementation of interventions to reverse the process and reduce or prevent the need for restorations.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION: The goal of this research program is to develop an improved agent for use in oral health care products that will help prevent gingivitis and, in turn, may prevent progression to periodontal diseases. We have identified a new generation of proprietary salicylanilides, termed the 5-naphthoylsalicylanilides, as a potential source of this agent. The combined physicochemical and biological properties of this new generation of LAAD-type salicylanilides gives them several advantages over other drugs and formulations currently used for this purpose. These include a broad spectrum of antibiotic activity, particularly against cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria, activity against biofilm (plaque) formation, topical anti-inflammatory activity, activity against several enzymes involved in soft tissue destruction, and a high degree of substantivity. These qualities, plus the patent status of the technology, make an optimized 5-naphthoylsalicylanilide an excellent candidate for development. In this amended Phase I application we plan to demonstrate the feasibility of developing an optimized 5-naphthoylsalicylanilide by comparing the activities of a focused series of compounds designed around our \"lead\" agent, NAlmF, in several in-vitro systems predictive of in-vivo efficacy and safety. From these data we will choose the three most promising compounds for scale up synthesis and preliminary in vivo efficacy evaluation in mouse models of acute inflammation and P.gingivalis-induced alveolar bone loss, and for oral safety in the rat. Based upon the results of these studies we will choose one \"optimized\" agent for progression to Phase II. In Phase II we intend to produce and analyze sufficient material for further testing of the optimized compound, develop experimental pharmaceutical rinse formulations containing the agent, determine the long-term chemical, microbiological and physical stability of the agent in its preferred formulation, and further evaluate safety and preclinical efficacy using additional models and dosage schemes to allow for IRB approval to evaluate the formulated agent in a \"proof-of-principal\" test in humans. We are seeking =Fast-Track\" status for this application because we have a strategic alliance with a Fortune 500 Corporate Partner who will pursue this testing in humans and the subsequent development, manufacturing and marketing of our optimized agent should the studies proposed here and in Phase II prove successful.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a compact, light-weight and noiseless cooling system for laptop computers. The product will be an air cooled, micro-channel heat sink with an electro-hydrodynamic (EHD) pump integrated within the channels. Research will focus on the development of a heat sink with a large parallel array of micro-channels to provide optimal thermal resistance. The second major area of development will be the EHD air flow device; a modification to the corona wind technique will be used to provide air  flow through the heat sink. Other tasks include power supply development, system integration, manufacturing process development and reliability improvement. As the speed and performance of laptop computers increases, the power density in the microprocessors rises and they dissipate more heat. The proposed project addresses the fact that laptop computer cooling systems will be required to dissipate upwards of 40 Watts while maintaining the microprocessor below 85 degrees C.  Commercially, the proposed cooling system is being developed for the growing laptop computing market. More than 235 million personal computers will be sold in 2007; roughly one-third of which or about 80 million will be laptop computers. The proposed product's small size and excellent heat dissipation capabilities will enable laptop computer manufacturers to incorporate faster processors while simultaneously reducing the overall size and weight of their products. Besides cooling applications, electro-hydrodynamic pumping technology can be used as a means of providing precise control of small amounts of liquid. This has application as an insulin delivery mechanism for diabetics and in the so-called laboratory-on-a-chip.",

This Phase II project continues the research and development (R&D) of an innovative social and behavioral intervention program, \"Interact!\" for children ages 8-12. Interact! Offers multimedia resources, interactive web resources, and a structured skill-based curriculum. \"Interact\" also provides a unique means of bridging the intervention setting with home efforts through the power of TV to enhance treatment effects. During Phase I, the prototype was developed and tested for feasibility with community- and school-based mental health professionals and elementary school teachers. Skill acquisition and product feasibility were tested with parents and children. Feasibility of the product was successfully established as well as substantial support for continued development. The Phase II project utilizes Phase I findings to revise, modify, and extend intervention components to maximize quality and effectiveness. Once finalized, a scientific evaluation of the efficacy of the intervention for mastery of social skill concepts and positive change in social and behavioral functioning will be conducted. Given that Interact! Is applicable within both community and school settings, 2 efficacy trials will be conducted. For the clinic-based trial, 100 children ages 8-12 will be randomly assigned to treatment or waitlist control conditions. For the school-based trial, all 3rd-5th grade classrooms in the participating school will be randomly assigned to treatment or wait-list control conditions (6 classes per condition). For both trials, outcome data will be collected regarding skill acquisition and social and behavioral functioning.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Standard wheelchair handrims are too small to provide an ergonomic grip for the hand, there is no place to rest the thumb, and there are not separate propulsion and braking surfaces. As a result, over 60% of wheelchair users grab their tire when propelling their chair. The poor fit to the hand also makes propelling less efficient and more harmful to the arms and shoulders. The Natural-Fit Handrim was designed to directly address the shortcomings of standard wheelchair handrims. The Natural-Fit (NF) has a wider surface area for the palm of the hand and a contoured area for the thumb that sits between the rim and wheel. These dual surfaces create an improved contact area for gripping the handrim, and allow for specially coated high and low friction surfaces to maximize the efficiency of propulsion and braking. After a two-week trial use period in Phase I, subjects indicated highly favorable evaluations of the NF, and propulsion biomechanics analyses indicated that the NF facilitates more efficient wheelchair propulsion. Our Phase II efforts focus on four goals: 1) Create size options for the oval component of the handrim to better customize the fit to the hand for additional target populations, particularly women and children. 2) Make design modifications to the NF to create a new model that is specifically designed for wheelchair users who have tetraplegia. 3) Test coating alternatives for the high-friction propulsion surface to optimize effectiveness and durability. 4) Examine the long-term consequences of using the NF among various populations. Extensive testing over a 4-month trial-use period will allow us to systematically test the extent to which the NF eases stress on the shoulder, wrist, and hands, and helps to reduce the likelihood of experiencing fatigue and pain as a result of daily propulsion. For the 2 million wheelchair users in the U.S. alone, the Natural-Fit will help to reduce the pain and injury associated with the repetitive stress of daily propulsion, improve quality of life, extend the time that one can remain in a manual wheelchair, and reduce medical costs associated with secondary injuries.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke remain 1 of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the US, and platelets play a major role in CHD/stroke. Thus, the use of antiplatelet drugs is helpful in the prevention or treatment of such vascular disorders. Despite routine use of antiplatelet agents in a large number of patients, the efficacy of antiplatelet therapy is rarely monitored in each patient. Most patients are prescribed a fixed dose with no effort to establish therapeutic efficacy, and the lack of suitable strategies precludes individual monitoring and adjustment of dosage to ensure adequate protection. The need for monitoring antiplatelet therapy is further accentuated by the fact that as many as 30% of patients may be resistant to standard dosages of commonly used antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin and clopidogrel. The current methods for the assessment of platelet function are cumbersome and time-consuming (laboratory methods), or relatively expensive, unreliable and offer only an indirect/incomplete measure (current point-of care instruments), and therefore lack sensitivity. Thrombodyne Inc. has developed, with funding from NIH, a novel approach to assess platelet function in whole blood. A functional version of the Thrombodyne Platelet Function Analyzer (TPFA) has withstood the rigors of laboratory and limited clinical testing, and detects platelet function abnormalities and identifies patients who may be resistant to standard doses of antiplatelet agents. Through this application, the investigators request support to sustain their efforts to: 1) make TPFA a cost-effective, convenient and versatile point-of-care instrument, 2) to seek FDA approvals to prepare it for marketing, and 3) to demonstrate that individually tailored dosing of antiplatelet agent (or combination of agents) would lead to better therapeutic efficacy, reduce side effects, and result in better outcomes. The applicants are at a unique point in their development path where the requested funding would allow them to take the device to market. The introduction of this convenient, cost-effective point-of-care platelet function analyzer would make it possible to tailor antiplatelet therapy for each individual and improve outcomes.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new capability to model emergency egress from buildings. The primary focus of the research is evacuation due to fires, but the software will be designed such that exposure and response to biological and chemical agents can also be simulated. The project will couple egress analysis to time-varying fire conditions (e.g. smoke density, heat, and CO) calculated using a Computational Fluid Dynamics fire simulator. This will enable simulation of emergency situations in which, for example, some exit paths become blocked. In addition to incorporating current human response models, the software will allow researchers to specify more complex individual behavior based on the results of recent studies of observed human behavior during emergencies. Thus, the project will not only result in a commercial product of immediate use to the fire safety industry, but will also provide a framework in which to incorporate future knowledge into a problem of fundamental importance to an urban society. This research will lead to a product that will facilitate broad use of fire emergency egress analysis and will introduce a new technology (coupling egress analysis with CFD fire modeling) into the present fire safety design and regulation process. In 2003 fire claimed 3,925 American lives and caused direct losses of $12.3 billion, with a total economic cost of $165 billion. Any technology that reduces even a fraction of this cost will be significant. The integration of egress analysis with fire simulation provides new capability to more accurately simulate emergency building evacuation. The engineering time required for the analyses will be significantly reduced by a common user interface and geometry database that will enable the broader application of this technology throughout the fire safety industry. Societal impacts include increased public safety, advancement in fire research, and reduced building costs. Coupling egress analysis and fire simulation will lead to new discoveries and recommendations based on post accident analysis. The software will enable researchers to add their own models of human behavior to the analysis.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cells are the basic building blocks of tissues and organs. Along with the extracellular matrix they produce and maintain they constitute the physical framework of the tissue. In addition, each cell can be regarded as an individual 'computational unit' that contains the entire genetic code of the organism. This interconnected network of individual cells is what ultimately determines the form and function of a tissue or organ, and the study of this network has been recognized as of central importance not only in areas such as embryology but also in other biological processes that exhibit a strong spatial component to their etiology such as cancer. A central challenge for biologists in the post genomic world is to develop techniques that show how this genetic blueprint is deployed in the 3D environment of a tissue or organ. Ideally in meeting this challenge imaging techniques that can image intact organs and tissue with sufficient detail to reveal the 3D morphology and underlying genetic state of individual cells will be developed that can help bridge the divide between the genotype and phenotype of an organ on both a microscopic and macroscopic scale. This proposal describes the development of a high throughput Two-Photon Tissue Cytometer that is capable if imaging entire mouse organs with subcellular detail in less than a few hours. It has multi-spectral capabilities, integrated microtomy, and high sensitivity detectors particularly well suited for deep tissue imaging. We will apply this system to the study of the metastasis by tracking the metastatic cascade of solitary cancer cells throughout an entire organ. We believe this class of instrument will have wide applicability to a wide host of problems in tissue physiology.",

We will then deploy several Beta Units at water production plants at which arsenic removal systems are under test. The Beta Test Program will collect data for as long as one year in order to validate the method and gain industry acceptance.      Successful completion will be immediately beneficial and commercially viable: the EPA has lowered the allowed amount of arsenic in drinking water to 10 ug/L and thousands of wells will be deemed out of compliance in 2006.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The goal of this Phase II SBIR proposal is to develop a novel electromagnetically tracked bone screw and comprehensive demonstration software for minimally invasive spinal procedures. The prototype bone screws were developed in the Phase I work and the feasibility of using these screws for non-line-ofsight localization of a vertebral body was demonstrated. Percutaneous lumbar instrumentation and fusion techniques can result in substantially less trauma to the patient, but these methods are technically difficult and traditional image-guided systems require substantial exposure of the spine. The bone screws will be further refined into a form resembling tracked k-wires. The image-guided system we propose will utilize C-arm fluoroscopy, which is readily available in spinal surgery suites. The successful completion of this work will: 1) validate the concept of percutaneously placed bone screws for image guidance in the spine; and 2) result in a prototype image-guided system based on electromagnetic tracking for percutaneous spinal procedures. The bone screws will then become part of Traxtal's product line and the prototype system can be licensed to commercial vendors. The specific aims of the proposal are:        1. Bone screw enhancements. The bone screws successfully prototyped and validated in Phase I will be further developed to decrease their size and form factor.        2. Develop fiducial-based registration system. As an intermediate step, an image-guided system incorporating pre-operative insertion of the bone screws and CT will be developed. A method for registration using two 5 degree of freedom bone screws will be implemented.        3. Develop 2D/3D anatomy-based registration system. The image-guided system developed in Aim 2 will be extended to include anatomy-based registration. This registration does not require pre-operative insertion of the bone screws. The C-arm will be calibrated and electromagnetically tracked. The bone screws will be used intraoperatively to track vertebral motion only.        4. System validation.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It has been estimated that 90% of all eye injuries could have been avoided if proper safety eyewear had been used. Despite widespread required use of safety eyewear in the work place, there continues to be a significant reluctance among workers to comply because of discomfort and the inability to see clearly due to scratches. Commercially available scratch resistant coatings (Hardcoats') do help to a degree but they also significantly decrease the impact resistance of the polycarbonate substrate. Compared to commercially available Hardcoats, TriboFilm's Phase I feasibility study has demonstrated clearly that a well designed multilayered scratch resistant coating comprised of a tougher and less brittle Base Coat and an anchored lubricious TopCoat produces a 10-fold increase in scratch resistance without affecting the impact resistance of polycarbonate. Based on the developments in the Phase I feasibility study, this Phase II proposal is aimed at process optimization and scale-up along with a series of intensive testing to evaluate the performance and durability of the Multilayered SR coating.   The proposed coating will allow the production of safety glasses and ophthalmic lenses with a combination of scratch and impact resistance far better than any currently on the market. This coating technology will be of great benefit to eyewear users in the $330 million eye protection market and the $15.8 billion eyewear market. If successful, this work would have widespread applicability in additional plastic applications where optical clarity, scratch resistance, and impact resistance are key requirements.",

        "abstract": "This proposal outlines the final steps in achieving the successful commercial qualification of the Tribo-Glide? high performance non-silicone lubricant system developed in Phase I and Phase II for syringes and medical devices. Achievement of regulatory approval of the non-silicone lubricant system applied to disposable glass-clear COG syringes will open the door for numerous drug companies to incorporate their expensive protein/peptide drugs in syringe format without encountering the traditional contamination and particulate problems associated with silicone lubricant migration in syringes. Hospitals and pharmaceutical companies will no longer have to throw away \"cloudy\" solutions or concern themselves with silicone lubricants interfering with medicant performance in the field. Commercialization of the Tribo-Glide? high performance lubricant system will eliminate the \"stick-slip\" problems found with silicone lubricated syringes which routinely cause syringe pumps to alarm and shut down in hospitals. Also, the elimination of this \"jerky\" syringe movement is estimated to save 20-30% of the drug during manual filling of the medicant in the syringe. In addition, the smooth gliding performance of the Tribo-Glide? lubricant system will make administering drugs and drawing blood more precise by the practitioner in all medical environments. Upon the initial qualification of the Tribo-Glide? lubricant system several pharmaceutical packaging and drug companies are anxious to utilize this development with their new generation drugs that are very sensitive to the migration problems posed by current silicone lubricants which are employed in 99% of all commercial syringes.",

A novel topomeric descriptor has been providing very rapid and effective shape similarity searching of combinatorial \"virtual libraries\". However that technology would not succeed in \"discovering\" structures whose syntheses involve many steps, including most drugs on the market. Therefore, during Phase I, technologies were developed for representing and topomerically searching products of multistep synthesis, by repeatedly applying reactions to reagents and generating topomers for each of the resulting synthons. Validation experiments suggest that roughly 10E20 \"drug-like\" structures will now be searchable overnight, including about half of those appearing in the medicinal chemistry literature.      As the critical question then becomes \"is the proposed synthesis practical\", individual synthetic chemists become the key decision makers. Therefore Phase II activities emphasize adding value for such users of the system. Its numerous projects have two general objectives, building a satisfactory user interface including dynamic reaction data management, and broadening the new techniques for representing synthesis outcomes in topomerically searchable forms, thereby covering more chemistry better.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We will develop a prototype inverted SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) microscope for neuroscience research. The signal levels are expected to be much weaker (100-500 ftrms, ft = 10/-15 Tesla) than signals in the area of non-destructive evaluation (> 1 pT, pT= 10/-12 Tesla) where SQUID microscopes have been used previously. Therefore, in Phase I we have determined the feasibility of constructing an ultasensitiveSQUID microscope. We have shown that a magnetometer-SQUID assembly with a submillimeter diameter pickup coil can be constructed with a noise level of about 70 fTrms/VHz that meets one of our design criteria set forth in our Phase I objectives. We have also determined the minimum thickness of the sapphire window that will serve as the barrier between the sample at atmospheric pressure and the SQUID sensors in vacuum. Based on these results, we expect that it should be possible to build an inverted SQUID microscope sufficiently sensitive for neuroscience research. In Specific Aim 1, we will construct a prototype with a 8-channel magnetometer-SQUID sensory array, each magnetometer being about 0.6 mm in diameter with a field sensitivity around 70 fTrms/VHz or better with the detection coils at a distance of 200 mu/m away from neurons and glial cells to be studied. The microscope is similar to an inverted optical microscope except the objective is replaced by an array of superconducting miniature magnetic field sensing coils. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the microscope in an experimental setting in order to evaluate its utility in neuroscience research. First, the field sensitivity (in fT/VHz) will be determined in a magnetically shielded room without any sample. Once the system noise level is determined to be within the specified level, it will be used to measure magnetic fields produced by a neocortical slice. We will determine the signal levels from the slice and compare with our predictions. Agreements between the observed and predicted values will indicate that the microscope should be useful for other applications that will include measurements of: (1) electrical currents from single neurons and glial cells in culture, (2) efficiency of bonding of antigens and magnetically tagged antibodies (immunoassay), and (3) movements and conformational changes of a small number of magnetically tagged molecules in a cell for studying signaling pathways. The proposed SQUID microscope should be useful in both academic setting and industry for understanding the electrophysiology of small cells that are difficult to study with electrodes, for drug discovery and for studying second-messenger systems.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cerebral edema is associated with traumatic brain injury. The overall HYPOTHESIS of the proposed intervention is that free water removed from the brain following traumatic injury will minimize cerebral edema. Approach: The applicant proposes to complete preclinical development of an innovative catheter for the reduction of cerebral edema. The initial clinical application of this catheter will be traumatic brain injury, and will involve replacing standard ventricular drains with Water Removal Therapy (WRT) catheters that 1) remove fee water from the CS, 2) remove bulk cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) samples, and 3) monitor intracranial pressure. Removal of water free will increase osmolarity of the CSF, which will theoretically result in removal of interstitial brain water and improved nutrient exchange, creating improved cerebral perfusion. Phase I studies have demonstrated that human CSF osmolarity increases with traumatic brain injury and WRT catheters can remove water from CSF at clinically significant rates that improves water movement in ex vivo ovine cerebral tissue. Specific Aims: (1) Build and test WRT catheters in vitro to meet human study requirements. (2) Test WRT catheters in vivo in a non-injury swine model. These tests will establish device safety under different operating parameters. (3) Measure cerebral changes (pressure and swelling) and functional outcome with ventricular WRT catheter treatment in vivo after cold freeze injury in swine model. Acute (6 hours) and chronic (1 week) randomized controlled injury studies will be undertaken. Significance: Cerebral edema after traumatic injury and severe stroke is a life threatening condition that is refractory to conventional treatments in a significant population of patients. Current treatments (i.e. hyperventilation, osmotic agents, or hypothermia) are associated with serious side effects that increase with prolonged use. Successful completion of Phase II aims will make human studies of WRT catheters possible.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is directed toward the development of cadmium zinc telluride (CdZnTe) single crystal films by using an ion beam layer separation process from bulk single crystals. The separated layers will be transferred and bonded on to silicon (Si) wafers for applications as substrates for epitaxial growth of mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe) films. HgCdTe films are of interest in infrared detectors. The ion beam layer separation process will allow the fabrication of a large number of films from a single bulk crystal, thus providing an economical wafer production technology for infrared detector materials. High-energy (MeV) light ions will be used to produce a buried damaged layer in the bulk crystal. Thermal annealing at elevated temperatures may generate lateral crack enabling the layer separation. Phase I has shown the feasibility of this approach. Phase II research objectives are to optimize the process parameters for wafer-scale separation without breaking and develop the process to transfer the separated films on to Si wafers. The wafers thus fabricated will be used for epitaxial growth of HgCdTe and fabrication of IR detectors. CdTe and (Cd,Zn)Te alloy crystals have been grown by various techniques including zone refining, vertical gradient freeze (VGF), liquid encapsulated Czochralski (LEC) methods, horizontal and vertical Bridgman techniques. Due to variable yields, none of these methods have produced enough material with the quality needed for today's infrared (IR) detector applications.  The proposed method has been developed to overcome these limitations.  Commercially, the proposed technique has the advantage of producing many good quality substrates from a single bulk crystal by ion beam slicing, thus providing an economic way of producing reliable and reproducible quality material. Also, large area CdZnTe substrate for the growth of HgCdTe will be possible by stacking smaller slices in a floor tile pattern on cheaper Si substrates. Bonding with Si substrate will also allow the integration of IR detectors with electronics on a single chip. IR photodetectors and focal plane arrays are of interest in many industrial and scientific applications including environmental monitoring, chem-bio detection, medical and space sensors.",

However, alternative power sources such wind turbines, fuel cells, and microturbines will require improvements in existing power inverter technologies, in order to make these systems feasible for widespread commercial or industrial use.  Existing power inverters are large in size, expensive, limited in power capability, and prone to failure.  This project will develop a family of DC/AC power converters that utilize a modular design based upon a current-sourced motor drive.  The new design will deliver a smaller, reliable inverter that will operate more efficiently, deliver more power capability, and be more cost effective than what is presently available on the market.  In Phase I, a compact DC-DC converter, which will serve as a prototype for a family of modular DC-AC converters, was designed, built, and tested.  A packaging concept also was created for the modular inverter.  Phase II efforts will entail the complete development of a modular family of DC-AC inverter products.  A 5 kW base unit will be designed, built, and tested to demonstrate higher power levels through \"stackability.\"  Two 5 kW modular inverters will be used to demonstrate a paralleled power level of 10 kW.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The energy conversion market is enormous, and products currently on the market are not meeting needs.  Applications include private use (farm, home, RV, electric and hybrid-electric vehicles), new energy source use (photovoltaic, wind turbine, fuel cell), commercial use (construction sites, oil wells, telecommunications infrastructure), public utilities support (through distributed generation systems), and federal agency use (military applications, remote site support).",

Existing commercial semiconductor UV avalanche photo detectors (APDs) suffer from high-dark count due to the fundamental material limitation. Unlike other wide band gap semiconductors, 4H-SiC has intrinsically more than an order of magnitude disparity in the electron and hole impact ionization coefficients, making it ideally suited for APDs and SPADs which require, as a key performance parameter, ultra low excess noise. The major research efforts will be focused on the novel design of the 4H-SiC SPADs and the development of the processing technology to manufacture the SPADs in both single element and in linear array forms. The goals are to achieve drastically improved dark count rate, quantum efficiency, and photon counting rate in comparison to the results achieved in Phase I.  Success of the project will have significant impact to the scientific understanding of cryptography for secure UV free-space communication, of fundamental quantum mechanics of single photon-molecular interaction, and of astronomy and space exploration. The results of the project are expected to lead to commercial products including hand-held or field-portable compact UV analyzers with single-molecule unmatched sensitivity, UV spectroscopy and fluorescence systems for pharmaceutical /drug development, and biowarfare agent detection.

Recent breakthroughs in highly-efficient phosphorescent organic light-emitting device (PHOLED) technology have created an enthusiasm that this technology may someday provide such a solution.  However, significant engineering challenges remain.  For example, OLED extraction efficiency needs improvement in order to meet the demanding power efficiency targets of general lighting.  This project will develop a higher-optical-extraction-efficiency device using transparent-cathode OLED (TOLED) technology for white lighting sources and future smart windows.  Phase I simulated and fabricated a white transparent phosphorescent OLED (T-PHOLED), with light output equivalent to a conventional bottom emission OLED, and demonstrated an approximately 1 cm2 white T-PHOLED light source on a glass substrate.  The resulting optical extraction was 20% greater than that for a similar conventional bottom emission device.  Phase II will further improve the TOLED efficiency by optimizing the cathode transmission, replacing the conventional glass package  with a monolithic mutilayer thin film encapsulation, and optimizing the design by taking advantage of microcavity effects and reduced optical losses at the air/OLED interface. Lastly, a phosphorescent TOLED lighting prototype will be fabricated to achieve greater than 25 lm/W at a luminance of 1,000 cd/m2.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The light source should find use in diffuse lighting applications in commercial, residential, and industrial sectors.

H.264 is the latest video compression standard, jointly developed by the ITU-T and ISO/IEC (MPEG). It is also designed for transmission over packet-based networks and to achieve significantly superior compression efficiency compared to previous standards and proprietary solutions. This compression efficiency, however, is achieved at the cost of severely increasing the complexity of the encoder. Real-time, high-resolution H.264 encoders are not feasible with current personal computers or DSP-based approaches. The new algorithms and designs for hardware acceleration will be targeted at video compression techniques that were introduced by the H.264 standard for the first time. They are anticipated to improve encoder performance by at least one order of magnitude compared to current implementations.  If successful a real-time, network appliance with the compression efficiency of H.264 will have broad applications, particularly in the areas of distance learning, remote training, security and surveillance. The innovations resulting from this should enable implementers to significantly improve the real-time performance of H.264. Limited bandwidth and the resulting poor quality video have so far been an impediment to realizing the full benefits of digital video. A real-time, high-resolution network appliance with the compression efficiency of H.264 will bring digital video in the mainstream by delivering high quality video to the endpoints of the network. This will drive both business and consumer uses. It will provide the visual communication crucial to making distance learning and remote training a superior experience and compelling from an economic viewpoint - and therefore mitigate geography as a barrier to participation in scientific and engineering activities.

Its milestones are (1) examination of an additional 24 individuals per year, evaluating four different growth factor activation states in each individual (pre and post bone formation), and (2) design, implementation and population of a relational proteomics database that allows coordinate evaluation of biological, biochemical and protein image data. The second aim is to discover and confirm biomarkers of human osteoblast bone formation; Goals: (1) evaluate at least 50 proteins for their specific/common modulation during growth factor induced ex vivo human bone formation; (2) for those proteins showing a common expression characterize their ability to correctly predict the physiological state of the cell during bone formation, defining as many bone formation biomarkers as possible. The final Aim is to perform a preliminary proteomic drug discovery analysis using selected compound libraries, its milestones are to screen two small, compound libraries (selected for a predicted ability to stimulate human osteoblasts).",

Efforts will be directed towards refining the composition of these copolymers such that they exhibit maximum adsorption & electrostatic charging effects upon AlTiC surfaces.  This will enable rapid removal of AlTiC swarf formed during lapping producing GMR Heads of superior surface quality and uniformity compared to those manufactured currently.  Furthermore, the adsorption properties of these copolymers upon AlTiC ceramic GMR Head surfaces as well as their metallic sensor layers will also be characterized in greater detail using Zeta Potential & Electrochemical Techniques.  An optimized procedure for synthesizing these copolymers will be established enabling them to be economically produced in bulk quantities. Finally, the company will work closely with hard drive manufacturers and will integrate the aqueous lapping fluids formulated from these copolymers into its current GMR Head manufacturing operations. Commercially and from an industrial standpoint, lapping fluids formulated from these copolymers will enable the last vertically integrated domestic hard drive manufacturer to produce GMR Read Write Heads more economically & efficiently thereby enhancing the company's competitiveness within the marketplace.  Future data storage technologies may also benefit from these fluids since they will in all likelihood still require high precision lapping or a related super finishing technique to polish their drive components.",

The NBR System will provide advanced, rapid analysis of nystagmus and graphic and textual guidance for carrying out repositioning maneuvers (RMs) manually on an exam table. Dizziness and balance disorders are common problems, with 6.2 million Americans chronically affected between ages 40 and 69, and a majority of those over age 70 reporting balance problems, where balance related falls account for more than half of accidental deaths in the elderly. The most common vestibular disorder is positional vertigo, or BPPV. Current diagnostic and treatment protocols limit optimal care and prevention of untoward consequences. Additionally, existing technology was developed before BPPV was well understood and, therefore, has limited diagnostic utility and is not designed for treatment.  The NBR System will monitor spatial orientation and head/ torso motion, coupled with videographic eye movements and novel 3-D nystagmus analysis, to display data in intuitive 3-D animation, and provide guidelines for diagnostic and treatment maneuvers. Phase I goals were met or exceeded: we integrated 3-D VNG software with inertia sensors via software and hardware components and developed basic maneuver protocols and first-level guidance with interactive 3-D animation of real-time conditions. We then demonstrated clinical value of the prototype in a human feasibility study with a small subject cohort. For Phase II, we will: a) develop advanced diagnosis and treatment protocols from 1000+ database, outside expert review and beta site feedback; b) develop additional software and hardware to implement and integrate protocols, including VNG algorithm refinement, optimization and a PC hardware solution with advantages over existing vestibular technology; c) develop four beta units with wireless transmission; d) demonstrate improved clinical applications in a human study with a large subject population.",

The principal innovations are the use of multi-coil arrays and the development of coherent signal processing methods to reconstruct 3-D images. The feasibility of this system concept through computer simulation, analysis, and by acquiring experimental (very low SNR) multi-coil NMR data has been established. It is now proposed to design and assemble a field-scale multi-coil MRS prototype instrument with surface coil diameters on the order of 50-100 meters, and to field test this prototype extensively with the U.S. Geological Survey and a groundwater  -consulting firm. This multi-coil MRS system enables a critical performance improvement in the area of spatial resolution (3-D vs. 1-D) and at least an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity (effective SNR). Inadequate access to clean, safe, and reliable sources of drinking water is a primary cause of disease in the developing world. Inadequate access to groundwater resources, and inadequate understanding of the long-term effects of groundwater use, pose fundamental limitations on economic and agricultural development in much of the developed world, including the United States.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the universal energy currency of the body and is made in large amounts by cells using substrate and oxygen. In the absence of oxygen, such as in disease states or surgical procedures that affect oxygen delivery, sufficient amounts of ATP cannot be produced and life ceases. We have developed a solution which can deliver large and controlled amounts of ATP to cells and tissues using highly fusogenic lipid vesicles containing Mg-ATP (VitaSol) and thus significantly reduce the effects of ischemia. During knee surgeries and many extremity procedures, tourniquets are used to create a blood-free operation field. However, the use of tourniquets for periods in excess of 2 hrs significantly increases morbidity. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a safe and effective solution which can deliver ATP to tissues during tourniquet-induced ischemia and significantly decrease morbidity from reperfusion injury. This is a first step in eventually using VitaSol in many surgical procedures were ischemia or hypoxia are problematic. The ultimate goal is to be able to use VitaSol to decrease the effects of whole-body hypoxia.      In Phase I, VitaSol was optimized and stabilized (as a freeze-dried powder), and we have proven its efficacy in maintaining animal viability and function in the absence of oxygen. We have maintained cells, tissues, organs, and organisms under hypoxia or chemical hypoxia (KCN) for periods of time that exceed any known method of preserving tissue. Composite tissues can be maintained viable for up to 21 hrs at room temperature with little or no loss in viability or function when perfused with VitaSol. In addition we can currently maintain rats for up to 1 hr without oxygen at normothermia or completely abolish the effects of an 8x lethal dose of IV injected KCN (2.5 mM). These and other exciting results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of this technique, and given that VitaSol(tm) has a shelf-life in excess of 12 months, will allow VitaSol to be tested to prevent the effects of tourniquet-induced ischemia.      In Phase II of this proposal, we will optimize the delivery of VitaSol for tourniquet-induced ischemia, test VitaSol in a large vertebrate animal model of tourniquet-induced ischemia, and ready VitaSol for a Phase I clinical trial by running pre-clinical toxicity studies, preparing a pre-lND meeting, and producing VitaSol under cGMP. If the Phase II study is successful, VitaSol will be readied for a Phase I clinical trial. Once approved, VitaSol could be indicated for many other ischemic tissue procedures, such as free-flap surgery, limb replantation, resection of invasive tumors or lesions, repair of congenital anomalies, and bilateral extremity surgery. If these trials are successful and once we better understand its toxicity and efficacy, we will reenter VitaSol in trials for whole-body hypoxia.",

An in-home trial study will allow a group of users to have the DTD over an extended period of time in their homes, to establish whether or not they continue to like to use it over time.  Technical development during Phase II will produce a powerful interface tool that translates computer display information into an intuitive, tactile format, and allows much greater accessibility of computer tools to the blind and visually impaired user.  Modern computer software and web pages are highly visually oriented.  However, there are millions of blind or severely visually impaired individuals whose visual disability prevents them from seeing the standard computer screen.  User frustration with existing computer access solutions is high, and the number of visually disabled people currently using computers is very low--much lower than the rate in the general population. This low rate of computer use indicates a serious need for better computer access technology for this disabled population.  The DTD is primarily being developed as a new, more effective interface for visually impaired users to use windows-based software and experience the Internet.  Providing such a tool is increasingly important as computers become more pervasive in everyday professional, educational, and social life.

        "abstract": "75253S  The beneficiation of bauxite ore, used to produce aluminum and the subsequent refining of the aluminum to specific alloys and/or shapes, is an energy intensive process.  Large amounts of heat energy (generated via electrical discharge in the primary process and from the burning of fossil fuel in the secondary process) are lost as a result of the insufficient thermal insulating properties of current refractory linings.  As a consequence, the increased BTU value per unit of aluminum is accompanied by a greater use of energy generating resources, increased emissions, and an elevated cost of the final metal product.  This project will develop an insulating refractory lining, suitable for use in hot processes for aluminum manufacture.  The lining will allow for limited metal and flux penetration, while offering an estimated 10 to 35 percent reduction in heat loss compared to conventional refractory linings.  Phase I investigated compounds and mixtures of compounds of the general formula (CaO)x(Al2O3)x, in combination with aluminum penetration inhibitors, as candidate aggregates for forming a refractory monolith.  Energy savings greater than 35% was demonstrated theoretically.  Phase II will optimize the physical traits of successful compounds and provide sufficient material for experimental trials in customer process vessels via the creation of a pilot production facility.  Data collected from the pilot production facility will be used to design, engineer, and build a full scale production facility.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The material should find use in the aluminum industry in the working lining of holders, hearths, upper and lower sidewalls, belly band areas, roofs, chip melters, troughing, transfer ladles, and over-the-road crucibles.

Studies show that flow control to attenuate hydraulic rates by utilizing available storage will optimize treatment capacity and reduce downstream water quality impacts making it the most cost-effective component of almost every wet weather control system.  There is a significant market opportunity for a non-mechanical maintenance-free flow control technology that will not inhibit existing capacities or aquatic biology.                                                                      Innovation - The WWETCO technology consists of a downward closing flexible bladder containing a static fluid (adjustable) that seals the bladder against all or a portion of a conduit that transports base flow and/or stormwater flow.  The hypothesis is that the bladder will open from the bottom to relieve excess flow or solids to maintain a maximum upstream level equal to the contained static liquid level.  The bladder will operate to optimize diversion to treatment and/or attenuation of wet weather flows.  Operation is passive riding on the optimized drainage system hydraulic gradient, without need for control instrumentation or mechanical devices, is non-clogging, and inverts providing full-bore peak flow-through not altering system capacity.  An option allows base flow for combined sewer or stream flow aquatic-biology-tolerant applications.

Phase II objectives include design development of a full-scale product, prototype fabrications and verification testing.                                                                       Effort - The Phase I efforts included pilot testing for hydraulic measurement and observation with debris injection for different static control and backwater levels and an evaluation of different bladder materials.  Phase II efforts include recommended material strength testing, pilot-scale grit erosion testing, and full-scale fabrication and field testing.  Results - Hydraulic testing demonstrated smooth operation and upstream gradient control requiring minimal head (4-inches) under all constant and rapidly varying flows with bladder automatically adjusting to free any debris.  Implication of the demonstrated approach is a simple, low-cost, no maintenance, adjustable flow control, applicable anywhere in the natural or constructed drainage network without inhibiting capacity. Commercial applications include in-line and off line storage and treatment control and optimization.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This proposal for \"Optoacoustic and Ultrasonic Imaging of Angiogenesis\" combines optoacoustics and ultrasound in a single instrument for the first time. A I 2MHz phased array ultrasound probe equipped with fiber optics for delivery of laser illuminations will operate in the backwards mode. In this method the ultrasonic image and the optoacoustic image will be spatially overlaid and then fused in some presentations. The ultrasonic images will include B-Mode, color Flow Doppler, power Doppler and Spectral Doppler. A stacked transducer will double the acoustic spectral capabilities to 24 MHz on reception to attain visualization of very small vessels in the neovascuIarization.   An OPO laser will provide a narrow wavelength from a spectrum of Infra Red wavelengths of light to photometrically select different compounds for light absorption, expansion and emission of ultrasound. Estimation of the oxy / deoxy hemoglobin in small vascular regions will be displayed as an image overlay.   This unique instrument differentiates blood in optoacoustics, and tissue in ultrasound, allowing very high resolution of blood vessels, their flow (especially low flow without interference of wall motion) and their oxygen content.   WinProbe's Scientific Research Platform will be optimized for this new combination of modalities and will produce fused images in real time.   This proposal includes clinical studies to image and quantitatively access angiogenesis in mice under the effect of known anti-angiogenesis drugs. The goal is to commercialize an instrument for clinical research.   The role of angiogenesis in cancer is well documented in the literature and this instrument can be expected to make a significant contribution to the science of cancer research.   Future commercial products are expected to follow in endoscopic instruments to assist in the detection of cancer where optical assessments are limited to the surface and are contrast deprived.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project will apply an optoelectronic detection system into an integrated high-speed manufacturing system aimed at commercial identification and sortation of aluminum scrap by alloy type - particularly aluminum alloys containing various alloying elements such as silicon and perhaps magnesium. The goal of the program is to commercially sort mixed aluminum alloys from an automobile shredder. Commercial technologies in existence today sort automobile shredder nonferrous metals based on density, but there are no technologies in commercial operation that sort the metals into 1) cast and wrought alloys, 2) various aluminum alloy series (100, 200, 3000, 7000 etc.), or 3) into individual alloy types. Sorting aluminum alloys based on chemical composition is the objective of this SBIR Phase II program. A very sophisticated, proprietary sensor and detection system has been developed and demonstrated in Phase I in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the technology. The broader impacts (commercial potential) of this proposed technology has the potential to transform the efficiency and utilization of scrap metal in the U.S. In 2001, the aluminum industry consumed nearly 800 trillion Btu, was responsible for 1.8% of the total manufacturing energy consumed, emitted 43.5 million tons of CO2, and consumed 1.6% of all U.S. electricity - mostly from primary production. Secondary production is much more efficient - economically and environmentally. Recovering aluminum from scrap consumes only about 6% of the energy required to produce primary aluminum and requires only 10% of the capital. In spite of efficiencies in making aluminum from scrap, exports in 2003 were 562,090 million tons because the industry could not utilize much of its low-grade scrap. This technology will allow utilization of this scrap in existing U.S. plants because the scrap will be converted from low-grade to high-grade scrap which is more consistent with U.S. consumption and needs. The result will be job preservation, reduced emissions, reduced energy needs, reduced raw material imports, and a better balance of payments.",

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has developed an Automated Radioxenon Sampler/Analyzer (ARSA) that concentrates Xe from the atmosphere and then counts it using a nuclear beta-gamma coincidence counter.  Although extremely sensitive, this system employs 12 photomultiplier tubes to count 4 sample cells and requires far more complex calibration and gain stabilizations efforts than would be compatible with remote, unattended operations.  Therefore, this project will construct a composite \u00c2\u00bfPhoswich\u00c2\u00bf scintillator by joining a fast plastic scintillator for beta detection to a slow CsI(Tl) scintillator for gamma-ray detection, and coupling this composite to a single photomultiplier tube.  Phase I demonstrated that a phoswich detector and digital signal processing could be used to detect beta-gamma coincidences characteristic of Xe radioactive decay, achieved energy resolutions equivalent to typical CsI detectors, and found an upper limit for wrongly detecting coincidences of 0.1%.  Monte Carlo simulations of the radiation transport and light collection in the detector were used to produce an optimized design.  Phase II will build a replacement module for the current ARSA detector system, consisting of four phoswich detectors along with their readout and high voltage electronics, a pulse-shape analyzer integrated with the readout electronics, and a control computer with software for interfacing with the current ARSA system.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  An upgraded ARSA system would be a key component of the U.S. monitoring network for detecting nuclear explosions.  The phoswich technology also should find use in the detection of radioactive Xenon emitted by nuclear power plants, providing U.S. and international agencies with a sensitive tool to confirm compliance with environmental regulations.  The technology also should have application to the environmental monitoring of key isotopes of nuclear processing activities, and to medical imaging.",

Analysis of strain gage placement conducted during this Phase I showed that the strain sensors required for neural control will require very high precision strain measurement (less than 1 microstrain), potential sensors were tested and characterized. Phase I data acquisition system limitations prevented full closed loop hardware demonstration. As a result Xinetics demonstrated the closed loop function using FEA analysis to provide simulated data to train the MATLAB based neural control algorithm.

We proposed to develop a tabletop transmission x-ray microscope for in-situ 3D imaging of biological specimens with a resolution of 30 nm and was funded in August 2003 to carry out the Phase I of the project. We have successfully completed the tasks proposed. Specifically, we have modified our commercial tabletop transmission microscope for biological imaging in phase contrast mode and acquired 3D images of a critical-point dried 3T3 fibroblast cell with 70 nm resolution. We propose to advance to Phase II of the project to develop an Alpha unit of a commercial transmission x-ray microscope with the ability to image the 3D structure of frozen hydrated cells or tissue culture samples at 30 nm resolution, with the ability to utilize feature-specific labeling and other contrast-enhancement methods.

These analysis techniques are not suitable for automated field use because they require control gas or vacuum to function.  A simple, robust, non-destructive analysis technique is required for in situ remote monitoring applications.  This project will develop a grazing-incident-monochromatic micro x-ray fluorescence (GI-MMXRF) analysis system, which, when combined with an innovative dried spot sample preparation system, will offer high sensitivity and automated sample preparation.  The combination of low power GI-MMXRF and ink jet printing technology makes this an approach that can be readily adapted for remote monitoring or in situ applications.  In Phase I, a doubly-curved crystal optic was designed for use with an existing x-ray fluorescence analysis setup.  A lab setup of the sample deposition system demonstrated GI-MMXRF detection at parts-per-billion (ppb) levels.  A detailed onceptual design of a field-deployable system was developed.  In Phase II, the optics will be further developed to increase sensitivity and reliability, and system optimization will be performed to decrease system size, weight, power, and cost.  Measurements with contaminated and base ground water samples will be used to demonstrate remote, unattended field operation.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our phase I work addressed one of the major current trends in HPLC - the development of materials for improved chiral chromatography. In response, we prepared two new classes of chiral stationary phases (CSPs). We prepared 10 different examples of the class wherein the chiral selector is covalently bonded to the surface of carbon-clad zirconia. Additionally, we prepared 26 different variants of the second class of CSP wherein the chiral selectors is bonded to the surface of zirconia through a Lewis acid/base coordinate covalent anchor group. We found that the second class of phase generally has much better chiral selectivity than the first and was very comparable to commercial phases based on related chiral selectors. Given the very different surface chemistry of zirconia we believe that Bronsted surface acid-base reactions with aminated drugs will be much less serious issues with zirconia based phases compared to silica-based phases. For these reasons phase II work will center on exploiting the newly developed Lewis acid-base anchored CSPs. Our four principal aims in phase II are: to extend our phase I work on 3 micron analytical HPLC particles unto 5, 7,10 and 25-micron particles for semi-prep and prep-scale LC, to scale-up production to the larger batch sizes, to characterize these larger particles made in bigger batches for their critical chromatographic properties (chiral selectivity, loading capacity, efficiency) and last to synthesize a series of Whelk O 1-like and alpha-Burke 2 emulator phases that can be used for rapid chiral selector screening in new HPLC method development to quickly determine the most appropriate type of chiral selector.

In this grant application, the \"no-fold\" balloon technology will be applied to create a very low profile balloon catheter which will serve as a platform for an ultra low profile stent delivery catheter. An ultra low profile stent delivery catheter has broad clinical applicability in the field of interventional cardiology due to the current emphasis on stenting dilated coronary arteries. We will utilize this phase II grant to design, construct and characterize through physical, biocompatibility and animal testing, a fully functioning ultra low profile stent delivery balloon catheter device. After FDA approval the device will be ready for commercial production. The ultra low profile stent delivery balloon catheter device will incorporate the novel \"no-fold\" balloon developed in phase I. We will mount a commercially available stent, such as the Medtronic \"Racer\" cobalt-chromium stent in order to test our catheter device. It should be noted that any ballon expandable stent (including drug-eluting) is mountable on our catheter. We will demonstrate in Phase II that our ultra low profile stent delivery catheter will be an improved stent delivery and deployment platform due to its significantly lower overall crossing profile and decreased stiffness. Our goal is to achieve approximately a 33% reduction in the profile of our catheter when compared to current 3.0 mm stent delivery catheters (such as Medtronic S7 stent system). Clinical practitioners using our stent delivery catheter system will observe an increased ease in delivering a stent to a stenotic lesion and an increased ability to directly deploy the stent without requiring pre-dilation.

The development program is prompted by the realization that there is presently only one scintillator that fulfills the needs of PET imaging, namely LSO. While in many ways remarkable, LSO is expensive, it is not widely available and it varies greatly in quality. The hafnates have higher stopping power than LSO, about the same decay time and, being cubic (or nearly cubic), are candidates for fabrication as perfectly transparent optical ceramics.

The program would take advantage of our extensive experience in ceramic scintillators.      The results of Phase I are very encouraging.

This project will establish the chemistry of transparent aerogels and develop process parameters for producing thick aerogel panels.  This would eliminate the need for stacking tiles within the array of Cherenkov detectors, significantly decreasing the number of tiles and interfaces and thereby improving the accuracy of particle separation and detection.  Phase I identified the sol-gel parameters that control the transparency and monolithicity of thick aerogel panels.

Increasing evidence indicates that a combination of elevated external forces (pressure and shear) and altered tissue properties is of prime importance in the etiology of foot ulcers. The overall goal of this research is to develop a software package that will allow a clinician to see an accurate representation of three-dimensional (3-D) pressure and shear patterns on the plantar surface and identify areas of concern. Adaptable to a variety of measurement systems, the software uses innovative techniques to simultaneously visualize horizontal shear and vertical pressure. User options are available to enhance the visualization. Phase I results demonstrated that the visualization approach and prototype software can provide clear indication of both shear and pressure and the relationship between the two. Analysis algorithms have been created that identify location and magnitude of patterns of pressure and stress most likely to cause, pathological consequences to the skin. Orthopedic specialists have evaluated the software using baseline data from an experimental sensor array and simulated data in the same format and provided positive feedback regarding its utility. Based on these achievements, the Phase II work will focus on development of a complete software system for foot pressure and shear data visualization and analysis. Tasks include design of a flexible data model, an extensive suite of automated analysis tools, a comprehensive, easy-to use graphical user interface, and implementation of these features in a modular software architecture suitable for commercialization as either a turnkey system or a module for integration in a sensor vendor's existing software. Other Phase II activities include the establishment of licensing arrangements with one or more hardware vendors to use the software in conjunction with their systems. In conjunction with a new generation of measurement systems that monitor vertical pressure and horizontal shear forces, this software will emerge as a key tool for research in the etiology of foot ulcers and clinical evaluation of risk factors in diabetic patients.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Of approximately 4 million live births in the U.S. in year 2000, 11.6 percent or about 471,000 infants were born less than 37 weeks gestation (Martin et al). Preterm infants may spend days or weeks in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), where they are nutritionally supported by nasogastric feeding tube, until they are capable of oral feeding by means of sucking and swallowing and can digest human milk or formula (Schanler & Lau). For otherwise healthy preterm infants, oral feeding difficulty is the single most important determinant of prolonged stays in intensive care (Eichenwald et al). Serious health consequences can result from persistent oral feeding problems, including malnutrition and impaired intellectual growth (Jones, Morgan & Shelton). Moreover, it is estimated that in the U.S., the cost of neonatal intensive care ranges between 50,000 and 100,000 dollars per patient (Zupancic et al). A reduction in number of NICU days associated with oral feeding difficulty could substantially reduce this cost and the risk of feeding-related health problems.        The Phase II will undertake a clinical research program to evaluate both safety and proof-of-concept of a computer-controlled active bottle milk delivery system developed and tested in the laboratory during the Phase I. This system is designed to promote coordination of breathing with sucking and swallowing and to reduce the number of days that preterm infants remain in intensive care. Engineers at Infoscitex will provide the necessary active bottle systems, including bottles, electronics and control, and disposable components to conduct the clinical research at Children's Hospital Boston (CHB) and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). Subjects will be 32 infants receiving care in the Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) at CHB and BIDMC, who are 32 to 34 weeks post conceptional age at the first test and are healthy except for their early birth. In addition, the Phase II project team will work with caregivers to conduct a human factors evaluation of the active bottle design.",

        "abstract": "76063S  International initiatives are underway to reduce greenhouse gases in the air.  The sequestration of carbon in agricultural soils is a candidate technology for achieving this reduction; however, more rapid and less expensive methods of measuring soil carbon are needed.  This project will develop a soil probe for carbon measurement based on near infrared reflectance spectroscopy.  The probe will measure carbon and bulk density in order to provide a rapid inventory of carbon on a field or project scale.  In Phase I, a probe was designed that delivered low noise spectra during in situ field measurements in Kansas, Missouri, and Iowa.  Calibrations using these spectra were used to measure soil carbon with a root-mean-square error of 0.5% or less.  Phase II will automate the optical reference on the probe to make it practical for usage by a more general end-user.  In addition, modifications will be made to the probe geometry to increase the accuracy of bulk density measurements.  Finally, effective calibration methods will be identified, tested, and integrated into a user-friendly interface.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The soil carbon measurements made by this probe should find use in auditting sequestered soil carbon, the subject of carbon trading and carbon offsets.  In addition, the probe and calibration methods would be applicable to the measurement of other soil attributes that are important for making good agronomic decisions.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The concept of islet allotransplantation as a treatment for Type I Diabetes has been demonstrated as feasible by the pioneering work done in Edmonton, Miami, Minneapolis, Philadelphia and other sites during the last five years. However, there still exists a considerable shortage of tissue for transplantation. The focus of Microlslet, Inc is to meet the increased demand for endocrine tissue by providing immune-isolated adult porcine islet xenografts. To date we have developed novel cold storage and islet processing solutions and generated modified islet culturing conditions. We have processed over 87 pancreata at the time of this writing and our average yields have increased to 437,000 q34,000 lEq per pancreas with approximately 90% purity (>90% successful islet isolation rate). Though not proposed in the Phase 1 aims, islets generated during Phase I of this proposal were encapsulated in 2 types of Ca2+-alginate microcapsules and were tested for function in two streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse models. In 4 experiments, naked and encapsulated porcine islets were transplanted into the peritoneal cavities of 47 immunodeficient, diabetic mice (NOD/SCID). Animals received varying amounts of graft tissue ranging from 500 to 104 IE per animal, with a return to normoglycemia occurring in 100% of the animals within 2 days of transplantation. To date, these animals have maintained graft function for more than 6 months post-transplantation. In the second series of studies, encapsulated islets were transplanted into immune competent mice (C57BL/6) with a return to normoglycemia achieved within 2 days in 100% of animals without any immunosuppression. Presently, 3 groups of streptozotocin-induced diabetic C57BL/6 transplanted with islets coated with our core technology, a gelled-core Ca2+-alginate bead, where 40% of the animals have been normoglycemic for over 200 days. These data demonstrate that encapsulated adult porcine islets are functional and biocompatible when transplanted intraperitoneally in a diabetic rodent model. To ascertain whether this xenograft has the potential to function in humans, the next step is to test it in diabetic nonhuman primates, an established large animal preclinical model. Therefore, the objective of Phase II is to demonstrate the long-term function of encapsulated porcine islets in non-human primates. SPECIFIC AIM 1: Demonstrate the safety and efficacy of alginate microencapsulated pig islet xenografts in streptozotocin-induced diabetic non-human primates. The goal of Aim I is to determine the safety, efficacy and fate of adult porcine islet xenografts encapsulated in a proprietary alginate-based formulation, in diabetic rhesus macaques. SPECIFIC AIM 2: Qualification of methods and materials for islet isolation, microencapsulation and transplantation for END preparation. The objective of Aim 2 is to validate and qualify the methods and materials described by Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) standards in preparation for an Investigative New Drug/Device (IND) application.",

        "abstract": "75650S  For the plasma jet liner approach to magnetized target fusion, a plasma accelerator is required that is capable of launching a plasma jet with a mass of 0.2 mg to 0.4 mg and a diameter no larger than about 20 cm.  In addition, the accelerator must be capable of attaining plasma/plasmoid velocities in excess of 200 km/s, a timing precision better than a microsecond down to nanoseconds, and a controllable density profile of high uniformity and purity.  This project will achieve the desired acceleration parameters by designing and constructing an inductive plasmoid accelerator (IPA).  In addition, two IPAs will be merged to form a suitable target plasmoid that will be compressed to high density and temperature with a suitable plasma liner, providing the first experimental test of the plasma liner fusion concept.  In Phase I, the inductive plasma accelerator was analyzed analytically and numerically to determine an optimal configuration for application to the plasma liner approach to target fusion.  A complete design of the inductive plasma accelerator to be built was executed.  Additional analysis and design was conducted on an experimental testbed for merging accelerated plasmoids and compressing with a plasma liner.  Phase II will construct a plasmoid accelerator and produce a magnetized plasmoid that is suitable for the formation of the target plasmoid as well as for later compression by an array of similar plasmoids.  An interaction chamber will be constucted that is capable of producing a plasma liner for compression experiments.  Simulations will be performed for all three components of the experimental work:  the acceleration of two plasmoids, their merging, and the formation of a plasma liner followed by the radial implosion of the plasma liner onto the colliding plasmoids.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The inductive plasma accelerator (IPA) should have a natural application to high power electric propulsion in space.  The IPA also should be readily adapted as a fueler for future fusion reactors such as the international fusion reactor (ITER) now being planned.  It also could find application in current tokamak experiments, in order to add rotational momentum and velocity shear for enhanced stability and transport control.",

        "abstract": "75935S  Conventional electron-cyclotron resonance (ECR) charge breeders, used to create beams of rare ion species as part of the DOE Nuclear Physics program, have gravitated towards higher frequencies and smaller plasma chambers.  However, the smaller plasma chambers exacerbate the problems of plasma interactions with the walls and complicate the injection of rare ion species.  Increasing the physical dimensions of the plasma chamber should improve the performance.  This project seeks to accomplish this goal by developing a charge breeder based on lower frequency operation.  Lower frequencies require lower magnetic fields, provide additional volume for larger plasma chambers, and improve the acceptance phase space for injected rare ion species.  Phase I created a solid model of a charge breeder using a modular design, which facilitates the easy replacement and/or substitution of major subsystems and components.   The device also can be used as a test bed for further development.  In Phase II, the cyberspace design of the charge breeder will be converted into hardware. Commercial Applications And Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Improvements in the efficiency of converting rare and short-lived radioactive ion species into ion beams for further acceleration is crucial to the future of the Nuclear Physics Research program.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The principle of ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) has been developed to reduce the risk of induced malignancy from radiation exposure, In practice this requires a rigorous quality control process for clinical operations in radiology. Currently, a critical tool (a radiographic test phantom) needed for quality control is not commercially available for computed radiology and digital radiography. The application's long-term goal is to develop a new class of phantoms and objective system performance tools for use in digital radiographic systems.  These devices will be used to address emerging needs in computed radiography and digital radiography. These needs include (1) quality control procedures for daily operations, (2) quality assurance methods to evaluate products arid perform acceptance testing, (3) quality assurance methods for optimizing system operating parameters, and (4) development tools for manufacturers to assess new hardware and software products.      Because neonatal chest radiography is a technically challenging procedure, with profound radiation dose implications, a prototype neonatal chest phantom was successfully developed in Phase I and is the focal point for Phase II phantom development. The neonatal chest phantom will be developed to simulate the disease states of pneumothorax and hyaline membrane disease. An observer's ability to diagnose these two disease states will test system resolution and noise, respectively. An automated objective system performance tool will also be developed to measure quantifiable parameters, such as resolution (modulation transfer function), noise (noise power spectrum), and detector efficiency (detective quantum efficiency). Phase II has two Specific Aims: 1) Clinical Validation of the Neonatal Chest Phantom in Normal and Disease States; 2) Clinical Validation of the Objective System Performance Tool.      Successful neonatal chest phantom design will be determined by the appearance and histogram analysis of images; the attenuation values of anatomic structures; and the diagnostic performances of radiologists for detection of disease states within the phantom. Successful objective system performance tool design will be determined by agreement with established methods of calculating quantitative parameters. The commercial applications are driven by the phantom's clinical significance, which is to assure optimal equipment performance and minimize x-ray exposure, thereby reducing the concomitant risk of induced malignancy to neonates.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It was our Specific Aim in Phase I to: 1) develop a clinically relevant indirect sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) model and 2) utilize this model to determine the efficacy of prophylactic COL-3 in preventing the onset of ARDS.  Both goals of our Phase I study were achieved and the results are as follows: 1) we successfully developed an injury consisting of a fecal clot (FC) placed in the peritoneal cavity plus clamping of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) which resulted in ARDS within 48 hours of the insult, and 2) we found that prophylactic COL-3 treatment COMPLETELY prevented the development of ARDS in this model. COL-3 prevented lung injury so effectively that the primary end points including lung function, oxygenation, serum and alveolar cytokine concentration, lung water and histologic pathology were not significantly different from the non-septic Control Group. In addition to preventing ARDS, COL-3 also precluded the development of septic shock, an unexpected effect that was not originally hypothesized.  Our SPECIFIC AIMS for Phase II are:  I) - Transfer manufacture of COL-3 to a cGMP facility and scale up batch size, reduce the level of impurities, and refine analytical methods. This cGMP material will then be used to accomplish Specific Aims II and III.  II) - Establish the \"treatment window\" following injury during which COL-3 will remain effective at preventing ARDS and septic shock. COL-3 will be given: a) concomitant with injury but before the onset of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), b) following the development of SIRS (SIRS will be confirmed by an increase in plasma IL-6) but before sepsis development, c) during sepsis (positive blood culture), and d) after lung injury (significant fall in PaO2/FiO2ratio). These data will be crucial in refining the objectives for the final stage of COL-3 development - a multi-center clinical trial.  III) - Determine that COL-3 improves 10-day survival in a smoke inhalation plus burn sheep model of ARDS. Can COL-3 improve survival in a clinically applicable non-septic model of ARDS? This Aim will establish that COL-3 is effective in: a) treating ARDS caused by direct (smoke inhalation) pulmonary injury and b) that COL-3 reduces not only morbidity but also mortality.",

These tubes offer greater sensitivity, easier sample recovery, greater flexibility and safety, reduced costs, improved response to magnetic fields, and new sampling possibilities. Sensitivity advantages may reduce the time required for many NMR acquisitions by nearly half. This proposal aims at creating tubes for use in the full range of standard 5 mm NMR probeheads for liquid samples, and for 1 mm nanoprobes. The tubes will be compatible with the most common solvents used in NMR. The project will bring the new designs to market readiness. Subcontractors will receive funding to fabricate materials in configurations that are not standard for industrial plastics, concentrating on improved dimensional specifications. Rigorous Quality Assurance procedures will be designed and implemented. User testing of the new tubes will occur in distinguished academic and pharmaceutical company environments. Almost every component in NMR spectrometers continues to improve, except for sample tubes. ARTech's plastic tubes will change that by improving sensitivity, permitting rapid handling without breakage, and allowing for affordable disposability. These advantages have no offsetting disadvantages and benefit both routine and highly sophisticated spectroscopists.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objectives of this study are to develop a new portable rehabilitation device with intelligent control to stretch an ankle joint with spasticity and/or contracture repeatedly to reduce spasticity/contracture in neurologically impaired patients. It will stretch the joint to true extreme plantar- and dorsi-flexion until a specified peak resistance torque is reached with the stretching velocity adjusted constantly based on the resistance torque. Once the peak resistance torque is reached, the ankle will be held at the extreme position for a period of time to let the stress relax before it is rotated back to the other extreme position. The stretching velocity will be very slow at the joint extreme positions, making it possible to reach a larger ROM safely, and it will be fast in the middle ROM so the majority of the stretching exercise is not spent in the middle ROM where contracture/spasticity is less significant. The device will also be used to evaluate outcome in multiple aspects including changes in passive ROM, joint stiffness, viscous damping, energy loss, and reflex excitability. The stretching device will provide a useful tool to both the therapists and neurologically impaired patients.   In Phase II of this project, we will make comprehensive improvements of the intelligent stretching device and make it ready for commercialization. Mechanical and electronic designs and relevant software will be improved considerably, making it a stand-alone medical device with a user-friendly handheld interface. We will evaluate its use in clinical treatment and outcome assessment in stroke patients with spastic ankle. The overall objectives of the Phase II project are to develop an effective, portable, low-cost, and user-friendly intelligent stretcher, suitable and economical for patients to use in clinic or home and ready for commercialization.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alternative tobacco cessation agents are needed due to the high rate of relapse with currently available pharmacotherapies. The overall goal of the current Phase II STTR grant application is to provide supporting data towards the development of the natural product, R(+)-nornicotine, as an orally-effective, alternative tobacco use cessation agent. Smokers are also exposed to alkaloidal nornicotine from tobacco and as a nicotine metabolite. Compared to nicotine, nornicotine has a long residence time in brain and a unique pharmacological profile. Recent data from our laboratory demonstrate that R(+)-nornicotine is more potent than S(-)-nornicotine in stimulating dopamine (DA) release from rat nucleus accumbens slices in vitro, and that the efficacy of R(+)-nornicotine in this assay is less than that of both S(-)-nicotine and S(-)-nornicotine, suggesting that R(+)-nornicotine is a partial agonist at nicotinic receptor subtypes (a6-containing) mediating DA release. Importantly, we found that R(+)-nornicotine decreased i.v. nicotine self-administration more potently than S(-)-nornicotine in rats. These preclinical results set the stage for determining the potential therapeutic benefit of R(+)-nornicotine as a tobacco use cessation agent in humans. Toward this goal, Yaupon Therapeutics, Inc., is close to the stage at which an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA can be submitted to conduct a Phase 1 human clinical trial with R(+)-nornicotine. The proposed studies will fully assess the oral bioavailability of R(+)-nornicotine. In addition, as part of the FDA requirements, preclinical toxicology will be performed to provide safety information as part of the IND submission requirements. Following FDA approval, a Phase 1 safety study of oral R(+)-nornicotine will be conducted using a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation design in healthy tobacco smokers who are exposed regularly to nornicotine as a result of smoking behavior. This safety study will be conducted in the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at the University of Kentucky Chandler Medical Center. The cardiovascular, performance and subjective effects of R(+)-nornicotine will be measured before and at multiple time points after dose administration, and the relationship between behavioral effects and plasma R(+)-nornicotine levels will be determined. The results from this Phase 1 safety study will inform future clinical efficacy studies with R(+)-nornicotine.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Approximately 30,000 patients per year in the US suffer from subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Although SAH represents only 5-10% of strokes, its impact is proportionally much higher because SAH patients are typically younger (mean age is 50 years) than other stroke patients. Nearly half of SAH patients die from either the initial hemorrhage or secondary complications that are caused by SAH-induced vasospasm. The only approved pharmaceutical for SAH-induced vasospasm is the calcium channel antagonist Nimotop (nimodipine). Although Nimotop significantly improves the outcome of surviving patients, it does not alter the incidence or magnitude of vasospasm and does not decrease mortality. Thus, there is a significant unmet clinical need for an agent to address SAH-induced vasospasm. Pharmacologic vasorelaxants, which activate cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways that converge at the phosphorylation of the small heat shock-related protein HSP20 are largely ineffective for treating SAH. We have recently determined that SAH-induced vasospasm is associated with down regulation of HSP20. This finding may explain why pharmacological vasorelaxants are ineffective in the treatment of SAH-induced vasospasm; the downstream protein effector molecule is not available to be activated. More importantly, we have determined that a single intrathecal injection of the HSP20 phosphopeptide analogue, 24 hours after the SAH, completely inhibits vasospasm. The goal of this Phase II project is to commercially develop a proteomic-based therapeutic to prevent SAH-induced vasospasm by directly injecting analogs of an endogenous relaxing protein (HSP20) in to the cerebrospinal fluid. Proteomic-based approaches deliver proteins/peptides into cells by fusing protein transduction domains (PTDs, \"carriers\") to biologically active molecules (\"cargo\"). The Phase I project demonstrated that HSP20 analogs are effective at relaxing smooth muscle from a variety of species in vitro. The specific aims of this proposal are to conduct safety testing of PTD-HSP20 analogs in vivo prior to advancement into phase I clinical trials. Since there is currently no effective agent for the treatment of SAH-induced vasospasm, this proteomic treatment would have significant therapeutic potential. This product utilizes a \"post-genomic\" platform for engineering biologically active protein/peptide molecules and has the potential to be the first proteomic-based pharmaceutical.",

We have developed novel cell-based assays to identify drugs that target the RNA-protein interactions. The assays incorporate a system of genetic reporters to accurately recapitulate RNA-protein interactions and enable screens with high sensitivity and specificity. In an initial test of the system, the HIV Rev-RRE interaction was successfully targeted with control inhibitors of the RNA-protein interaction. Experiments to optimize and convert the drug screening assays to high throughput format are currently in progress. The assays will be tested by screening a combinatorial library of RRE-binding peptides to be followed by a high-throughput chemical compound library screen. The development of high-throughput genetic methods to identify specific inhibitors of RNA-protein interactions is expected to help in the discovery of drugs directed against novel therapeutic targets.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The overall goal of this project is to develop human recombinant Lactoferrin as an adjuvant to BCG to augment cell mediated immunity (CMI) and protect alveolar integrity upon infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Improved nontoxic adjuvants, especially adjuvants capable of inducing CMI, are needed for research in immunology and for development of human and veterinary vaccines. This is especially true for development of vaccines to combat tuberculosis, where efficacy of the bacille Calmette-Guerin strain of M. bovis (BCG) as a vaccine has been unsuccessful to curtail worldwide incidence. Other adjuvants that do induce CMI are much too toxic for use in humans and are being progressively restricted in animals. Lactoferrin is different from microbial adjuvants and from cytokine adjuvants; it is a natural effector molecule that directly participates in host defenses and in the induction of cell mediated immune responses. Phase I studies demonstrate that Lactoferrin as an adjuvant given with BCG enhances delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) in mice in a dose dependent fashion with no apparent toxicity. Mechanistically, it induces IL-12 and TNF-alpha production by macrophages thereby generating a local environment likely to push immune responses towards development and maintenance of CMI. Our Phase I data indicates Lactoferrin augments BCG vaccination as demonstrated by increased lymphocytic proliferation, and IFN-gamma, IL-2 and IL-12(p40) production towards BCG antigens. Furthermore, aerosol challenge with virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) following Lactoferrin vaccination demonstrated reduction in organism dissemination to spleen, and markedly improved lung pathology that was comparable to Complete Freund's Adjuvant controls. Phase II will specifically address the utility and efficacy of a novel, fully humanized glycoform of recombinant Lactoferrin produced in Pichia pastoris as an adjuvant to augment efficacy of BCG vaccination to subsequent challenge with virulent MTB.",

The goats will carry the gene for human growth hormone (rhGH) under the control of a mammary gland specific promoter such that the milk of transgenic females will be an efficient source of protein for purification of human growth hormone. The milk of transgenic goats is a safe, abundant and cost effective production source for recombinant human biopharmaceuticals. GTC Biotherapeutics (formerly Genzyme Transgenics Corp.) has nearly two dozen commercial transgenic programs in development. However, even state-of-the-art methods for generating transgenic founder (first generation) goats remain relatively inefficient and expensive. Methods have been developed in rodents for transplanting genetically modified male germ cells into recipient males and mating these animals to produce transgenic offspring. During phase I of this project we successfully adapted the systems of germ cell transfection and transplantation to goats and demonstrated feasibility that recipient goats produce offspring carrying the genetic makeup of the germ cell donor animal. Now we propose to: 1) produce goats making transgenic sperm after transplantation of transfected germ cells; 2) generate transgenic embryos by in vitro fertilization and produce live transgenic offspring carrying expressing a commercially significant protein in their milk; and 3) establish a system for caprine germ cell culture to make the approach universally applicable to a wider range of transgene constructs. Successful introduction of a transgene through the male germ line will increase the efficiency and reduce the cost of generating founder animals, which is a critical early step in the transgenic production process.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cloning of hot and cold thermal receptors has advanced the understanding of the molecular basis of thermal sensation. Two (2) important remaining questions to be addressed are the identification of additional thermal receptor genes and the elucidation of the mechanism(s) that enable the receptor proteins to alter gating properties in response to changes in temperature. Existing technologies for studying thermal responses employ devices that elicit temperature changes, some under feedback control, at rates less than 4o C/sec. These rates are probably inadequate for characterizing distinct temperature responses of individual sensory neurons and for elucidating kinetic components of conformational changes in response to temperature. In phase 1 we demonstrated that our system for rapid temperature stimulation was viable. The goal of this project (phase 2) is to engineer, and bring to market, our device that can generate much faster temperature changes, under feedback control, than are currently attainable in the industry. This device will use a proprietary technology that enables rapid temperature switching of solutions applied from a focal application device built with nanofabricated components. The output of the device will be applied to excised membrane patches under patch clamp, or to individual cells voltage-clamped by discontinuous single-electrode voltage clamp or patch clamp. We intend to set an industry standard by employing nanofabrication techniques to allow our system to approach the theoretical limits of performance. Only a high performance system will enable the accurate deduction of the mechanism of action in thermally sensitive ion channels. An understanding of these mechanisms will lead to the creation of new and/or better pain therapeutics.

Recent studies have indicated that 12% of patients afflicted with MCI will develop Alzheimer's disease, as opposed to 2% of the general population. Although the causes underlying MCI are not known, there is much evidence implicating oxidative damage. Eukarion has developed a class of low molecular weight molecules that are catalytic scavengers of reactive oxygen species (ROS), acting as mimics for the endogenous antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. These compounds are effective in many models for neurological and other classes of diseases.  During Phase I of this STTR grant, two of these compounds, EUK-189 and EUK-207, were tested for their activity in preventing age-related loss of cognitive function and accumulation of oxidative stress in mice of early middle age\" (8 to 11 months). Both improved cognitive performance and reduced several indicators of oxidative stress in the brain. These Phase I data support further investigation of these compounds as therapeutic agents for MCI and, potentially, for age-related neurodegenerative disease in humans.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reading the conformational state of membrane proteins is central to understanding their role ir cell signaling, to using them as sensor elements and for screening candidate drug compounds that are targeted toward this important class of biomolecules. While the patch clamp technique for doing this is ubiquitous, it does have significant limitations: two electrodes are required to measure current flow, the gigaohm input impedance combines with unavoidable stray capacitance to limit the amplifier's bandwidth (typically to -10 kHz), and the gigaohmseal required at the cell membrane precludes scanning to image both distribution and dynamics of membrane proteins. To address these limitations, we will develop near-field probes, readouts, positioners and software to make a prototype system that confines high-frequency excitation to sub-wavelength proportions, enabling interaction with single membrane proteins. Since there are inherent dielectric contrast mechanisms available in protem-lipid systems, these can be used at high frequencies to provide a new method of protein readout.  We have succeeded in demonstrating simultaneous recordings from alpha-hemolysin blocked by beta-cyclodextrin using both a conventional patch-clamp amplifier and a microwave source and detector. The microwave probe has the advantage of approximately 1 MHz bandwidth, so it is able to resolve more temporal detail than the patch clamp. Furthermore, the microwave probe is sensitive to changes both in conductance and capacitance, i.e. the movement of charge groups in the channel. This opens the door to probing for the first time changes in conformation that do rot otherwise change channel conductance. Finally, the microwave probe by its nature does not require a gigaohm seal (in fact, its impedance is 50 ohms), enabling us to realize a scanning electrode that can map both distribution and dynamics of channel activity. We will develop this prototype in conjunction with a collaborator in neuroscience so that the feedback gained from a field test will be used in making the system commercially viable.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The informed development of new treatments for cancer would be greatly facilitated if tumor cells could be directly sampled at multiple time points following the administration of new drugs or drug combinations.  Many new agents are not classic cytotoxics, but specifically target tumor cell biological processes or elements of the tumor stroma. In many cases, the appropriate doses of such agents will not be maximally tolerated, but rather will be the lowest doses found to selectively and thoroughly inhibit the function of their target(s). Accordingly, it is desirable to have direct access to relevant target cells in order to learn about a drug's mechanism of action and its pharmacodynamic or pharmacogenomic properties. Despite much effort, it has proven difficult to directly sample solid tumor masses even once in the context of early-phase clinical trials. The overall goal of this research proposal is to obtain circulating tumor and endothelial cells from the peripheral blood of patients with solid tumors, and to study the effects of therapy with new agents on gene expression, on putative drug targets and on downstream events such as apoptosis. In the Phase I portion of this award we pursued the following specific aims: 1) Isolate and enumerate circulating tumor cells (CTC) and circulating endothelial cell precursors (CEC) in cancer patients undergoing therapy with established and new agents. These studies demonstrated that circulating epithelial tumor cells and endothelial cell precursors can be isolated and enumerated in sufficient numbers to permit analysis of gene expression; and 2) Analyze gene expression in CTC and CEC using microarrav analysis. These studies showed that microarray analysis of CTC and CEC gene expression corresponds to gene expression patterns seen at tumor sites. We now will extend this work to determine the feasibility of using CTC and CEC to monitor the effects of cancer therapy with new agents. In the Phase II portion of this work we will test the hypothesis that circulating tumor and endothelial cells can provide pharmacodynamic surrogates of drug-induced signaling perturbation and apoptosis that can inform the conduct of early-phase clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surgical excision of hard and soft tissues of the head and neck or high impact trauma can lead to lead to major tissue deficits. Reconstruction of the lower jaw typically involves bone, gingiva, and teeth. Current mandibular distraction devices are used in combination with reconstruction plates, but while the reconstruction plates take the contour of the jaw, the distraction devices have a linear vector. The devices also have a limited distraction distance, producing short segments of straight bone and so cannot accommodate large deficits with a single procedure. The size of the combined apparatus makes it impossible to move dentate bone segments. Extra-oral devices function both as external fixator and bone-transport distraction devices, with which it is possible to re-build the mandibular parasymphysis and chin. However, the newly formed mandible is retruded due to soft tissue pressure and normal curvature of the mandible is not achieved. The objective of Phase I of this proposal was to build and test a prototype of an intra-oral mandibular distraction device in which the reconstruction plate, advancing mechanism and bone transport device are combined into a single unit. The prototype was built and shown to be mechanically robust, easy to place and use, and able to successfully transport a dentate bone segment across a 2cm bony gap in a live goat model. The objective of Phase II of this proposal is to build and test the second and third generations of this device. These devices will enable transport of dentate bone segments over large curved distances including the midline of the jaw, and prevent the inhibition of form by soft tissue pressure. The purpose of these devices is to allow immediate reconstruction of mandibular bone following surgical excision, eliminating the need for bone grafting or secondary reconstruction. The advantage of the devices is that they will enable us to regain the mechanical integrity and shape of the original mandible, and allow appropriate occlusion to occur when implants are placed in the reconstructed bone. This will be done without adding to the difficulty, duration, or complication of surgeries. A critical feature of the devices is that they are not limited by the size, shape, or location of the bone gap and because of the low position of the device; the transport disc can safely carry viable teeth without injuring the roots during fixation. The \"check-point osteotomy\" technique will make it possible for the first time to regain the normal curvature or the original mandible, and preserve the original lower facial dimensions as the traction force exerted by the soft tissue over the transport disc is rigidly shielded by the transport plate.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of this proposed Phase 2 STTR project are to further develop and test the online distance learning system and courses that we developed in Phase 1 to teach health care professionals to provide low vision rehabilitation services. The first aim is to develop and test interactive online lectures. Online lectures will have hyperlinks in the slides that will jump to context-sensitive mini-tutorials for students who require more background information to understand the slide. Students also will be able to post questions to the instructor or make comments in the forum during the lecture. And, students will be able to type notes for each slide during the lecture that will be saved with a printable copy of the slide. Aim 2 is to develop and test interactive computer simulations of the components of low vision rehabilitation. In Phase 1 we developed a simulation of visual acuity testing and trial lens refraction. In Phase 2, we will develop simulations of kinetic visual field, Amslergrid, contrast sensitivity, reading ability, and color vision testing; taking the patient's history; mobility, eccentric viewing, and home environment ADL and safety evaluations; rehabilitation plan development; home adaptations for ADL and safety; and teaching patients eccentric viewing and how to use low vision devices. Aim 3 is to improve our current synchronous online case conference capability and to develop best practices for case conferences. Aims 4 and 5 are to develop and test interactive web video for synchronous online clinical observations where the students watch an instructor work with patients (Aim 4) and synchronous online clinical mentoring where the instructor supervises and guides the students who are working with patients (Aim 5). All testing will be done with volunteers recruited from among students taking the online low vision course developed in Phase 1.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 5 million word recognition tests are administered annually by audiologists in the United States with an associated cost of more than $100 million. These tests are currently performed manually by highly trained audiologists. This application describes the Phase II development of automated clinical speech recognition tests using clinical test recordings and an automated speech recognition system to score the subjects' responses. A method for automatically interpreting the test scores will also be evaluated. The objectives are to increase the accuracy and efficiency of these clinical tests, substantially reduce the cost, and provide an objective, automatic, evidence-based method for interpreting the results. The automated speech recognition test in combination with the automated pure tone audiogram (currently an STTR Phase II project) will perform diagnostic testing of a majority of audiology patients, freeing the audiologists' time for activities that require their training and skill. Contemporary changes in training and reimbursement patterns create a high demand for automated clinical procedures. The automated procedures are implemented on existing commercial audiometers with a personal computer that controls the audiometer delivery and routing of stimuli. Phase I results were obtained with automatic speech recognizers that were trained on a limited number of subjects (n=9). Estimates of the agreement between human and machine scoring ranged from 82-93%. Additional refinements with benefits that are predictable from prior experience will increase recognizer performance to a level that equals or exceeds human-human agreement and provide the basis for efficient and accurate clinical tests. In Phase II, an automatic speech recognition threshold test will be compared to the manual method used in routine clinical practice. Two different recognizer scoring strategies will be developed, one that requires more test time but is independent of individual speaker differences and is easily adaptable to other languages, and one that requires less time but may not be applicable to all patients. A pilot study will test the method on a Spanish-language speech-recognition test.",

Recombinant Nt.CviPII was expressed in E.coli and purified. Nt.CviQXI was expressed in E.coli and by an in vitro transcription/translation system. Nt.Sapl and Nb.Sapl were engineered from Sapl endonuclease using a novel two-step genetic selection procedure. Under Phase II funding, we will optimize the expression conditions for Nt.CviPII and Nt.CviQXI to alleviate cytotoxicity. Constitutive expression of M.CviPII and M.CviQXI will be achieved to fully modify host DNA. Nt.CviPII and Nt.CviQXI NEases will be expressed in pACYC-T7. In addition, C-terminal truncation variants of Nt.CviPII and Nt.CviQXI will be constructed (in fusion with intein and chitin binding domain). Synthetic peptides will be ligated to the truncated versions via intein-mediated peptide ligation to construct full-length enzymes. Secondary amino acid (aa) substitutions will be introduced into Nb.Sapl to optimize the nicking activity and eliminate dsDNA cleavage. The equivalent aa changes will be introduced into BspQI (a thermostable Sapl isoschizomer) to isolate N.BspQI. Sapl and Earl share similar DNA recognition sequences and the aa sequences of the two endonucleases display a high level of similarity. The aa changes that resulted in Sapl nicking variants will be introduced into Earl endonuclease to isolate N.Earl. We will isolate nicking variants from a 4-base cutter Mnll (CCTCN7 A, ANeGAGG). Extremely thermostable nicking variants will also be isolated from Tth111II (CAARCA11/9) that is active at 75 degrees C. We will engineer nicking variants from homing endonucleases l-Scel and l-Dmol with15-18 bp recognition sequences. We will clone and characterize HNH type homing endonucleases from chlorella virus genomes. In Phase I, we discovered a novel DNA amplification method using Nt.CviPII and Bst DNA polymerase. Random DNA amplification has been achieved from a small amount of genomic DNA or from a single bacterial colony without addition of exogenous primers. Under Phase II funding, this isothermal amplification method (NEMDA) will be optimized and the sensitivity will be improved. Finally, we will investigate the potential of NEMDA for detections of pathogens and its use in bio-prospecting.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    In the United States, more than 250,000 persons annually experience out-of-hospital sudden cardiac death (SCD). However, few, approximately 4%, are revived with standard CPR and advanced life support interventions and survive to be discharged from the hospital. Successful restoration of cardiac function after SCD is dependent on early electrical defibrillation in patients found to be in ventricular fibrillation (VF) and early provision of effective artificial circulation and ventilation, i.e., CPR. However, standard CPR, as currently practiced, provides only 10-20% of normal cardiac output and low coronary perfusion pressures; and is usually ineffectively performed. A new manual CPR device has been developed and tested in a Phase I STTR. The Phase I study of the LifeBelt(tm) device defined the mechanism of blood flow with the device during cardiac arrest, defined optimal performance parameter for the device, served to stimulate early revisions in the design of the device, and demonstrated efficacy for resuscitation from prolonged cardiac arrest and short-term survival. The specific aims of this Phase II application are a logical extension of the Phase I study: Aim 1: To convert the existing prototype device to a \"second generation\" pre-production model that replicates the function of the prototype but which is light weight, made of inexpensive material, and easily produced in quantity. This will be accomplished through collaboration with a mechanical/bioengineering team. Aim 2: To compare the second generation device to standard manual CPR, using manikin simulators, for \"ease of use\" characteristics in different \"rescuer\" populations. These rescuers will include physicians, nurses, paramedics, and lay persons. Aim 3: To compare long-term (72 hour) neurologic outcome after prolonged cardiac arrest and resuscitation with the LifeBelt(tm) device versus manual CPR in a swine model. The long-term objective of the project is the production of a simple manual CPR device that will produce greater blood flow than standard CPR, minimize the need for mouth-to-mouth ventilation, and that can be used by the lay person with minimal instruction. The device could easily be deployed with existing automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) which provide brief and simple audio instruction regarding use. Use of early and effective CPR with the new device preceding or following early defibrillation attempts by lay persons (public access defibrillation) could result in more lives saved.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents a significant health hazard that is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Unfortunately, little progress has been made in advancing the treatment of ARDS. Phase I STTR funding supported the successful determination of a feasible formulation of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for pulmonary delivery. The successful outcome of phase I established the rationale for studies in animals to determine the safety of lung delivered; this is the primary objective of our phase II application. Thus, this application represents the advancement of work for pharmacological innovation in the treatment of ARDS and extends phase I studies to in vivo animal models to test the hypothesis that pulmonary delivery of tPA will be safe and well tolerated. To this end, the specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Formulate pulmonary tPA for lung delivery. Mouse and human tPA will be formulated for pre-clinical toxicology and pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) studies; 2) Assess the tolerability of the pulmonary formulated tPA by assessing both acute (dose escalating) and chronic (repeated dose) toxicity as determined by utilization of a mouse model which will be subjected to pulmonary instillation and intravenous (IV) administration of tPA formulated for lung delivery. These experiments are designed to measure indicators of toxicity such as pulmonary injury, disruption in coagulation homeostasis and hemorrhage; and 3) Determine the PK and PD disposition of pulmonary delivered tPA. This aim will be accomplished by measuring lung and systemic therapeutic protein concentrations following pulmonary and IV administration of the pulmonary formulation in a rat model. These experiments are designed to assess disruption in coagulation homeostasis (PD end point) in the context of systemic tPA concentrations that are achieved following high doses of tPA (toxicokinetics). The anticipated outcomes associated with the successful completion of the work proposed in this application are: 1) establishment of the safety profile of a pulmonary formulation; 2) the development of a risk probability model for the clinical situation; and 3) preparation of an IND application that is required for eligibility for an FDA Orphan Products Grant Application. The proposed Phase II project will complement and extend our Phase I work and will facilitate the development of a promising new, greatly needed therapeutic for the treatment of ARDS.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen responsible for a significant proportion of serious hospital acquired infections. The organism has intrinsic resistance to most types of antibiotics and can readily acquire resistance to all clinically available antimicrobials, resulting in infections that are impossible to treat. P. aeruginosa colonization occurs in many hospitalized patients, in particular amongst those who have undergone procedures (e.g. intubation or bladder catheterization) that impair local host immune defenses. Some of these patients will develop P. aeruginosa infections, and require aggressive and appropriate antimicrobial therapy to survive; others, however, will not develop invasive disease though P. aeruginosa is repeatedly isolated from respiratory secretions or urine. Although some host factors are correlated with an increased risk of infection, the recent recognition that P. aeruginosa isolates produce distinct complements of virulence factors that are required for virulence in animal models has led several groups to investigate whether such virulence factors also influence clinical P. aeruginosa disease in humans.  Such a correlation has indeed been established by two research groups for virulence factors associated with the Type III secretion system of P. aeruginosa; however, no clinically useful test currently exists to measure expression of these virulence factors in patient P. aeruginosa isolates.          In Phase I of this project, we developed a diagnostic test which quantitates virulence factor production by clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. In Phase II, our aim will be to obtain prospective clinical validation of this test. We plan to test several thousand isolates obtained from Yale-New Haven Hospital. We will correlate production of virulence factors with severe disease in two specific clinical settings, namely acute Pseudomonas respiratory infection, and exacerbation of disease in chronically infected cystic fibrosis patients. Such information can improve the care of individual patients, by revealing the presence of highly virulent isolates that warrant aggressive therapy. We also believe that such a test may decrease the inappropriate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in patients carrying avirulent organisms and showing no overt signs of infection. This can have significant consequences both for public health, by limiting the emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens in our hospitals, and for containing the cost of medical care.",

Availability of a compact, robust, commercial polarizer producing 50% polarization in useful quantities for human imaging would trigger widespread investigations and applications of hyperpolarized xenon as an imaging agent. The UNH group demonstrated a new type of xenon polarizer that flows the gas mixture at relatively high velocity and low pressure along a direction opposite to the laser beam. This polarizer demonstrated polarization of over 60% for small quantities and 20% for a production rate of over 4 liters per hour. The figure-of-merit (polarization times production rate) of this polarizer presently exceeds all other polarizer technologies by an order of magnitude. Separate STTR projects to increase the useable laser power and to the cryogenic accumulation capacity would increase the polarizer output by another factor of 6 to 10. The polarization technology relies on a long polarization column immersed in a uniform 25 gauss field, an NMR region with adjustable field having 100 ppm uniformity, and a very strong field accumulation region. The interaction of these elements must be eliminated to make the system compact. Our Phase 1 STTR project included numerical simulation of novel asymmetric permeability structures to transport, shape, and spread magnetic field lines creating uniform field volumes and smooth transitions between regions. It also included fabrication of prototypes and measurements confirming the agreement between simulation and realization. We completed several hundred design calculations and fabricated and characterized 2 prototypes, meeting the design critera. In Phase II we propose to further refine the design for improved performance, intergrate the polarizer components into their new magnetic environment, and engineer for ease of access to internal components particularly the final hyperpolarized xenon product. These developments will convert our large laboratory prototype into a practical compact commercially-available hospital-based device.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this Phase II project, Vegrandis, LLC proposes to develop a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) microfluidic based \"sample-in, answer-out\" bioassay chip for diagnosis of ovarian cancer. The proposed bioassay chip will use MHD microfluidics to pump the sample and reagents necessary to perform the assay and will have integrated micro-electrochemical detection of a panel of ovarian cancer biomarkers to provide quantitative results. A new approach to MHD microfluidics was demonstrated in Phase I to overcome previous limitations of bubble formation and short electrode life while retaining the key advantages of this approach to microfluidics. MHD microfluidics has a wide range of functionality, is compatible with a wide range of materials and solvents, and has several unique capabilities. One (1) key capability of MHD microfluidics which was demonstrated in Phase I is the ability to pump fluids along closed paths (e.g. a toroidal loop). This capability will be utilized in Phase II to realize the sealed bioassay chip with no external fluidic connections other than a self-sealing sample introduction port. An integrated, self-contained micro-electrochemical detection approach will be used to minimize false positives and false negatives and will provide quantitative results important for treatment monitoring. Together, the combination of MHD microfluidics and micro-electrochemical detection offer a unique platform for biomolecular analysis. For point-of-care diagnostic applications where minimum sample handling steps and maximum automation are typically essential features, the proposed system should excel. For the specific application proposed, the bioassay chip will use a newly developed panel of biomarkers from a subcontracted partner that can reliably detect all major ovarian tumor types in their early stage. A handheld analyzer instrument suitable for point-of-care use will also be developed. The proposed bioassay chip and analyzer will provide results in less than 30 minutes. This new ovarian cancer bioassay has the potential to become equivalent to the Pap test for cervical cancer as part of routine annual examinations that will provide for diagnosis of ovarian cancer while it is still in an early stage. Early intervention will not only dramatically increase the chances of surviving ovarian cancer, but will also allow application of less drastic treatment procedures and thereby improve the quality of life of the cancer survivor.",

We also comprehensively address the remaining limitations to scaling up the entire polarizer: polarizer column glassware design, gas flow parameters, and vacuum capacity.

A single test that could readily distinguish between an autoimmune and non-autoimmune disorder would allow physicians to focus efforts on the specific disease that affects the patient. This is critical for diabetes mellitus (DM), which has two subsets, Type I and Type II. The subsets of DM differ in pathogenesis, treatment and prognosis. Using microarray technology, we have compared differences in gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells among patients with autoimmunity, including type I DM, and patients with non-autoimmune Type II DM. In Phase I, we investigated differences in gene expression between the DM types in adults and children. The findings from these studies suggest that we can readily identify subgroups of patients based on the gene expression patterns. The goal of our phase II application is to take these diagnostic tests closer to the marketplace. We have the following four specific aims:   I. We will expand our microarray analysis using a larger cohort of individuals with diabetes from different racial backgrounds (Caucasian, African-American, and Hispanic) and different geographical locations to validate our results and to further test the notion that two classes of type I diabetes exist in the human population.   II. We propose to validate identity of clones that exhibit extremes in hybridization among the control and different disease groups and develop \"mini-microarray\" and quantitative PCR tests that distinguish among the different disease groups.   III. We will test these platforms by analyzing blood samples from a large cohort of control and diabetic individuals.   IV. We will validate the diagnostic test in a cohort of individuals with an initial diagnosis of hyperglycemia.    Long-term goals are to use results from microarray experiments to develop tests that have predictive value for the therapeutic management of individuals with autoimmune and non-autoimmune diseases.

These conditions can be ameliorated by reactivating production of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) in the patients' blood. Pharmacologic re-induction of HbF has been achieved in two-thirds of patients with these diseases in clinical trials, using first generation short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) therapeutics. Some of the treated patients experienced both biochemical and clinical / hematologic improvement, and became independent of blood transfusions for several years. The first SCFA therapies, butyrate and phenylbutyrate, required IV infusions or large amounts of drug (20-30 grams/day) which are difficult for long-term use. Combined therapy with rhu- EPO to stimulate erythropoiesis and with Butyrate to induce fetal globin expression produced additive effects, suggesting that both actions are necessary for an optimal definitive treatment for beta thalassemia.         During the Phase I STTR, the applicant organization developed a new SCFA (sodium ST-7) which has substantial advantages over the first generation agents, in inducing Hb F and also stimulating erythroid cell proliferation, with oral-bioavailability, and with pharmacokinetics demonstrating feasibility for once/day oral administration at tolerable doses (0.5-1 gram for an adult). The agent has proven effective and safe in a primate model for Hb F induction and in mice transgenic for the human globin genes.         In this Phase II STTR application, we propose to conduct the additional preclinical development studies required by the FDA to obtain Investigational New Drug status for Phase I clinical trials of this lead erythropoietic HbF-inducer (sodium ST-7). The goals of this proposal are: 1) To conduct the preclinical toxicology studies required for an IND for sodium ST-7 to stimulate HbF and erythropoiesis; 2) To prepare an IND application for phase I clinical trials of the erythropoietic Hb F-inducing agent; 3) To evaluate four other novel Hb F-inducing compounds for pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in baboons, as potential back-up therapeutics.",

As in our previous Phase I STTR, this Phase II STTR unites the Stenzel-Poore laboratory and Virogenomics, Inc., a Portland-based genomics and drug discovery company. Here we plan to develop the use of an endogenous 'injury response' protein, osteopontin (OPN) for the treatment of stroke. The fundamental discoveries made during our Phase I STTR were: 1) OPN given at the time of stroke provides marked protection against ischemic injury and 2) cleavage of OPN by thrombin increases its neuroprotective capacity in vitro. These findings motivate us to move forward with OPN as a potential therapeutic and test whether the neuroprotective effect of thrombin-cleaved OPN can be extended to acute stroke injury.    Furthermore we propose to expand the therapeutic potential of OPN by determining the efficacy of OPN when given continuously during the acute recovery phase of stroke injury. Finally, we seek to develop a new delivery strategy for OPN using intranasal administration to improve delivery to the brain. The aims are: Aim 1. Determine whether proteolytic fragments of OPN confer neuroprotection against stroke injury. Aim 2. Determine whether continuous OPN administration during the recovery phase of injury improves stroke outcome. Aim 3. Determine whether intranasal delivery of OPN achieves neuroprotection against stroke injury. The immediate goals are to enhance the efficacy and therapeutic potential of OPN as a neuroprotectant in stroke. Improvement of the potency and delivery of OPN in the brain should advance the development of OPN as a treatment in stroke. Moreover, intranasal administration would offer a profound advantage over conventional routes of administration due to improved drug delivery and access to the injured brain.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Solidus Biosciences, Inc. is developing a proprietary Metabolizing Enzyme Toxicology Assay Chip (MetaChip), along with a xenobiotic metabolism and toxicity screening device that uses these chips (the MetaReader), for high- throughput analysis of drug metabolism and toxicity. The MetaChip integrates the high-throughput metabolite- generating capability of P450 catalysis with human cell-based screening on a single microscale platform. As a result, P450-generated drug-candidate metabolites can be generated and screened against human cell lines even if the metabolites are unstable. The MetaChip platform along with the MetaReader provides Solidus Biosciences with an enabling technology that will have myriad applications in both early stage and preclinical toxicology testing. Solidus is therefore developing the first technology and associated products that can rapidly replicate human metabolism and perform in vitro toxicity testing in a single, automated, high-throughput manner. Consequently, Solidus' products have significant commercial potential and the promise to greatly benefit human health. The proposed Phase II program will focus on the full optimization of the MetaChip and on the design, preparation, and operation of the MetaReader, both of which can be readily combined with other in vitro toxicology and metabolite profiling approaches that deal with ADME (adsorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of xenobiotics. The specific aims and milestones for the Phase II STTR are to: 1. Optimize P450 loading, activity, and stability within sol-gel matrices and generate sol-gels with physicochemical properties that accurately and reproducibly mimic the human liver; 2. Perform rapid P450 inhibition assays on the MetaChip using well-known inhibitors of the different human P450 isoforms; 3. Complete development of the collagen gel and other 3D cell culture techniques for growth inhibition assays on the MetaChip; 4. Expand the repertoire of metabolic enzymes to include phase II drug metabolism enzymes. This also includes addition of glutathione for conjugation to metabolites generated in the MetaChip; 5. Co-develop (with an industrial collaborator) the MetaReader to streamline the application of sample, the enzymatic reaction and assay steps, and image analysis in a simple operating scheme; 6. Use the fully operational MetaChip platform to correlate in vitro toxicity results to in vivo toxicity results. This aim involves components of the ICCVAM validation process. The end result of the Phase II study will be a fully operational and integrated device, the MetaReader, that will become an important tool in early-stage testing of drug and drug-candidate toxicity, and in the development of in vitro models that mimic human metabolism.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The high cost ($0.8 - $1.7 billion) and long time frames (about 13 years) required to introduce new drugs to the market contributes substantially to spiraling health care costs and diseases persisting without effective cures. A major factor is the high attrition rate of new compounds failing due to toxicity identified years into clinical trials. This particular circumstance cost the pharmaceutical industry approximately $8 billion in 2003. In silico tools generally offer the promise of identifying toxicity issues much more rapidly than clinical methods, however, they are not sufficiently accurate for pharmaceutical companies to confidently make definitive early screening and related investment decisions. LiverTox is a highly advanced, self-learning liver toxicity prediction tool that represents a quantum leap over current in silico methods. It offers a highly innovative use of multiple analytical approaches to accurately predict the toxicity of candidate Pharmaceuticals in the liver. A differentiating capability is its self-learning computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets. They rapidly assimilate massive volumes of information from LiverTox's extensive, dynamic, and thoroughly reviewed databases. Initially, LiverTox will generate predictions derived from five independent CNN-based submodules; one trained in advanced computational chemistry methods to make quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analyses; a second trained with microarray data; a third trained with Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing and Gene Expression (MPSS/GE) data; and fourth and fifth submodules trained with proteomics and metabolomics/metabonomics data, respectively. Challenging LiverTox with new chemical formulations triggers the five independent submodules to each make toxicity endpoint predictions drawing upon its knowledge base and its similarity analysis/fuzzy logic/statistical training. This tool's flexible, highly advanced system architecture and advanced learning capabilities using data obtained from diverse techniques enable it to rapidly digest new data, build upon new data acquisition techniques, and use prior lessons learned to achieve overall toxicity predictions with greater than 95% accuracy. LiverTox's ability to rapidly and accurately predict the toxicity of drug candidates will allow pharmaceutical companies to move from discovery to curing disease faster, at greatly reduced cost, and with less reliance on animal-based tests.",

A quantitative method to evaluate efficacy of therapy, or better, to define tissue at risk & prevent initial ulcer formation would be highly beneficial. HYPERMED'S long-term objective is to reduce frequency of foot ulcers & amputation by developing Foot HyperSpectral Imaging (FHSI) as a camera-based system to 1) identify tissue at risk for ulceration, 2) evaluate an existing ulcer & predict capability of tissue to heal & 3) monitor efficacy of therapy.       FHSI provides a 2-D image with spectral data inherent in each pixel which reflects the presence & concentration of various chemical species that represents a \"gradient map\" of components. Our Phase II goal is to validate FHSI as a quantitative anatomic metric for assessing therapeutic progress of foot ulcers seen in Type 1 diabetes & identify tissue at risk for future ulceration to assist in prevention. We will build on advances from proof of principle Phase I data & on our other work. Specific aims are to: 1)build upgraded FHSI systems for use at 4 well-respected diabetic clinics with strong Type 1 patient volume in statistically- powered studies, 2)study 50 Type 1 patients with manifest foot ulcers for 6+ months to assess healing or progression, 3)study 160 Type 1 patients at high risk for foot ulceration in a 24-month longitudinal study aimed at predicting ulceration, 4)develop algorithms that will deliver a Hyperspectral Microvascular Index that can be used as a biomarker for tissue viability & wound healing & give a spatial quantitation of risk & 5)validate merit in further developing FHSI using clinical outcome measures & comparing FHSI with existing methods (ABI, laser Doppler, TCPO2) to determine advantages & limitations of FHSI in clinical foot care. Our collaborative effort with the Hospital for Joint Disease, the Cleveland Clinic, Olive View UCLA Medical Center, and the Beth-Israel Deaconness medical centers will be highly advantageous in meeting our specific aims during this research program.       FHSI delivers metabolic information about tissue in an easily interpretable picture that correlates with anatomy. This adds a new dimension to assessment of ulceration risk & tissue healing & allows physicians to target care to specific at risk areas earlier than previously possible. FHSI has clear potential to be a cost effective, easy to use, turn-key camera based tool. If successful, FHSI will address two Healthy People 2010 goals: \"Reduce the frequency of foot ulcers in persons with diabetes\" & \"Reduce the rate of amputations in persons with diabetes\". We believe FHSI can have positive impact on quality of life of people with diabetes, impacting morbidity & mortality & lowering overall healthcare costs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Otoreflectance (OR) is a new class of hearing-test instruments utilizing acoustic signals presented and recorded in the ear canal. OR instruments address the following limitations in existing instruments to screen and diagnose middle-ear function: (1) detection of otitis media, (2) prediction of conductive hearing loss, (3) detection of middle-ear dysfunction in infants receiving a newborn hearing screening exam or follow-up audiologic assessment, and (4) general use to assess middle-ear function at frequencies in the bandwidth of speech. An OR test provides measurements over a wideband range (approximately 0.25 to 8 kHz) of such transfer functions as reflectance and admittance, and power absorbed by the ear canal and middle ear. Energy reflectance and absorbed power are OR functions that are relatively insensitive to probe position in the ear canal, and thus are well suited to interpreting middle-ear function at higher frequencies. One type of OR instrument can be used with probes similar to otoacoustic emission probes to screen middle-ear function in several seconds at ambient ear-canal pressure. Phase I of this project established the feasibility of measuring such OR responses in normal-hearing adults and children, as well as in children with surgically confirmed middle-ear fluid. Phase I also implemented a wideband OR test to assess the function of the middle-ear muscle reflex, and compared reflex thresholds in infants and adults with thresholds measured using conventional instruments. In Phase II, a wideband OR tympanometry instrument will be implemented, adding a pump to vary ear-canal static pressure, and OR tympanometry norms will be measured in adults. The test performance of ambient-pressure OR and conventional 226-Hz tympanometry will be compared in young children to detect middle-ear fluid and to predict a conductive hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion. OR tympanometry will form part of a new objective and efficient wideband test to measure middle-ear muscle reflex thresholds, which will be compared to thresholds in adults and infants measured using a conventional test. The test performance of the ability of OR tympanometry, ambient-pressure OR, and conventional 1000-Hz tympanometry to detect middle-ear dysfunction will be compared in infants also receiving a standard newborn hearing screening exam. Outcomes from Phase II will evaluate whether OR is more accurate than conventional tests to screen and diagnose middle-ear dysfunction in clinical applications of important societal concern.",

The stigma towards homosexuality and HIV/AIDS has been proposed as one of the underlying factors leading to unprotected sex, hence, to HIV and AIDS. The stigma towards homosexuality and HIV/AIDS may put individuals at risk for HIV because of its negative impact on the self, because it may diminish social support, and because it may prevent individuals from accessing resources. Despite the decline in negative societal attitudes towards homosexuality and HIV/AIDS in the U.S., gay men continue to experience stigmatization. Unfortunately, research and intervention activities focused on stigma are limited. The overall goal of our research activities is to reduce HIV and AIDS among Latino GET. The goal of this Phase II project, thus, is to produce and test an educational documentary film to decrease stigma towards homosexuality and HIV/AIDS as a means to prevent HIV-risk behaviors among Latino GET. The specific aims include: 1. To produce an educational documentary film. The primary target audience for this film is Latino youth between the ages of 14 and 24. The secondary audiences include Latino adults; and members of the gay, bisexual, lesbian, and transgender communities. 2. To develop a discussion guide for use with the educational film. 3.

For many genetic diseases, it is difficult and expensive to screen for all possible mutations that may cause the disease.

Certain DNA dyes are compatible with PCR and can detect mismatches between two copies of DNA by simple melting analysis after amplification. The dye is added before PCR, and heterozygotes are easily identified after a 1-2 min high-resolution melting curve after PCR. Specific genotype confirmation is provided by an unlabeled oligonucleotide probe. The specific aims for Phase I of this Fast Track proposal are: 1.

After PCR, each tube will be automatically analyzed by high-resolution melting. Simultaneous scanning and genotyping will be demonstrated using special DNA dyes. Advantages of our system includes speed (PCR in 15 min, analysis in 1-2 min/sample), homogeneous design (no need for sample transfer or reagent additions), closed-tube analysis (no amplicon contamination risk), both scanning and genotyping capability, and nondestructive analysis (immediately available for sequencing in the rare case when it is necessary).",

Digital systems of this type will facilitate the use of CAD algorithms, the movement of patient data from enterprise to enterprise, and the location and supply of prior mammographic images to radiologists. Today's PACS systems have difficulty providing high volume storage for mammograms, and this is especially difficult in a multi-site or multi-enterprise environment. i3ARCHIVE offers NDMA as a solution to structure, manage, and analyze, large, distributed, networked, adaptive databases. This STTR proposes to enhance NDMA with recently available international standards (OGSNOGSI). Since NDMA was being developed as these standards evolved, components required were not available, so they were developed by i3ARCHIVE. While these components meet the current needs of NDMA, they do not enable i3ARCHIVE to meet the strategic objective of seamlessly integrating with, and accessing information from, other medical databases. This grant will enable i3ARCHIVE to design and plan for the replacement of current techniques with these more flexible industry standard ideas. It is imperative that these standards be incorporated in the development of any databases with large amounts of medical data from disparate sources, if this information is to be combined and shared among clinicians and researchers. Introducing these standards into NDMA will ensure its long-term viability as a reliable, efficient, and cost effective solution for healthcare providers transitioning to digital mammography, in order to provide better care to women. These standards will also allow the wealth of clinical data accumulated in NDMA to be easily accessible, and to be provided in combination with related data held in other local or remote medical databases.

Minimally invasive surgical techniques deliver specific intervention without the morbidity associated with large open incisions. Image-guidance technology has the potential to provide significant benefits for minimally invasive surgery, where surgeons must usually cope with difficult access and reduced visualization. A new generation of minimally invasive surgery has emerged that uses a robot to hold surgical tools during laparoscopy or thoracoscopy, under direct control by the surgeon. Surgical robots offer an excellent platform upon which to fuse the benefits of image-guided and minimally invasive surgery. The da Vinci surgical robot system has a high-fidelity video display, a stereo endoscope, and sensors to track the position of each surgical instrument and the endoscope, offering a potentially ready-made stream of data for registration and tracking.   The proposed project will bring together a leading academic center of excellence in image-guided therapy and the market leader in surgical robotics to give da Vinci the fundamentally new capability of steering to a specific point in the patient's frame of reference. Using the current da Vinci control paradigm, the robot simply follows the surgeon's relative motions and has no concept of the patient's frame of reference. With the new ability to navigate through the patient's frame of reference as described by preoperative imagery data sets registered to the patient during surgery, da Vinci will enable surgeons to more accurately perform targeted tasks such as biopsy, tumor ablation, resection planning, and gene therapy in a minimally invasive manner. The proposed project uses liver surgery as a motivating application. Phase I will address three feasibility milestones: Establishing communication between the surgical robot and existing image-guidance software, establishing robot tracking error under 2 mm, and establishing surface registration errors under 5 mm.

The project is based on the technology developed by the PI in which antisense oligonucleotides are used to restore correct functioning of a defective gene rather than, as commonly practiced, to inhibit the expression of an undesirable gene. Specifically, oligonucleotides are used to reverse aberrant splicing of human beta-globin pre-mRNA by blocking splice sites activated by a mutation IVS2-654 in intron 2 of the beta-globin gene. Aberrant splicing is also reversed for betaE mutation in exon 1. The oligonucleotides not only inhibit aberrant splicing but, by forcing the spliceosomes to form on the existing correct splice sites, restore correct splicing of beta-globin pre-mRNA, which is translated into the beta-globin polypeptide, ultimately restoring expression of hemoglobin. The main goal of this Phase I proposal is to improve the effectiveness of morpholino oligonucleotides targted to the aberrant IVS2-654 splice site by conjugating them with penetrating tat-like peptides. The proposed work will be carried mostly in erythroid cells from the IVS2-654 mice, in vivo in this mouse model of thalassemia and in cells from thalassemia patients with IVS2-654 thalassemia. The Specific Aims of the project are: 1) To test if morpholino-peptide conjugates effectively correct splicing of beta-globin pre-mRNA and restore expression of hemoglobin in vitro in erythroid cells from IVS2-654 mouse. 2) To test if morpholino-peptide conjugates effectively correct splicing of beta-globin pre-mRNA and restore expression of hemoglobin in vivo in IVS2-654 mouse. 3) To confirm that the most effective oligonucleotides identified in Specific Aims 1 and 2 are effective in erythroid cells from patients with thalassemia.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The aim is to develop a high resolution, high contrast detector for digital x-ray imaging systems. The target detector would have a Detective Quantum Efficiency much greater than 80%, a limiting resolution of at least 10 lp/mm, ultra-low noise, linear response and a dynamic range of more than 14 bits. The proposal is to build such a detector by using CdZnTe crystals. The detector crystal is hybridized to a readout integrated circuit device that allows the signal to be collected efficiently, digitized and stored in a computer as an image matrix. The planned individual detector unit, designed for use in a slot scan system, has 192 stages in the scan direction and 384 columns in the non-scan direction. The detectors are planned to be mounted in a staggered array with overlap at the ends up to the full breast x-ray image width (approximately 25 cm) in the non-scan direction. The detector pixel pitch will be 50 microns with 100% fill factor. Compared to the present film systems, a reduction of patient dose by a factor of six can be achieved without loss of image quality. To achieve these objectives, in this proposal we plan to develop and demonstrate: a high quality and high spatial resolution bump bonding technique; an optimized readout IC for the CZT crystals; and a reliable, low-cost, high throughput technique to test and select high quality, high uniformity CZT crystals.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An innovative manual wheelchair design concept that utilizes a lever for propulsion has been developed. It is well documented that levers promote a natural and efficient propulsion motion. Pushrim wheelchairs require an awkward motion that leads to injuries of the shoulders, elbows, and wrists for the majority of the 1.4 million users in the United States. These limitations also force users into power wheelchairs prematurely. The opportunity for rehabilitation is then lost.    Lever propelled wheelchairs have not been widely successful due to their unintuitive operation and poor maneuverability, excessive weight, size, and complexity, or lack of important design features such as multiple gear ratios. The proposed design meets all the requirements formulated by users and wheelchair design experts.    The design utilizes a single lever for propulsion located in front of the user's knees. Steering and braking is accomplished with a bicycle-style handlebar interface at the top of the lever. The lever propulsion mechanism was tested in Phase I and exceeded all the functionality and robustness requirements. A unique wheelchair design that fully exploits the advantages of the mechanism has been developed. A complete prototype will be built and fully tested in Phase II, including extensive user testing.    The result will be a fully developed stand-alone product poised to create a new market segment between pushrim and power wheelchairs. A finance, production, and marketing plan appropriate for the unique characteristics of both the wheelchair market and this product has been developed.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Phase I:  It has become increasingly clear that the metastatic potential of solid cancer best correlates with the nature of the cells emigrating from the primary tumors. These emigrating cells enter the circulatory system and thus can readily be recovered using a simple and minimally invasive procedure. However, molecular analysis of these cells remains technically challenging because the emigrating metastatic tumor cells are few in number relative to the enormous numbers of normal blood cells, and because many of the tumor cells found in peripheral blood are dead or dying at any given moment. Current technology to detect tumor cells in peripheral blood involves a combination of cell size and density or positive- and negative-selecting immuno-enrichment steps. However, these protocols recover only a small fraction of the potentially available tumor cells, and the resulting cell populations are merely enriched, i.e., they are composed partially of non-tumor epithelial cells as well as dead and dying tumor cells.  In Phase I, we propose to develop a clinically useful assay for the identification and isolation of circulating gastro-intestinal (GI) tumor cells by optimizing a novel cell separation technology. Our assay will use a cell adhesion matrix (CAM) to build a blood filtration unit that mimics the tumor intravascular microenvironment and thus will enable function-affinity purification of the circulating tumor cells. We anticipate the CAM enrichment will be able to accomplish a single step, one million-fold enrichment of viable human tumor cells from the peripheral blood of patients with late stage GI cancers. Flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry and real-time RT-PCR using cell lineage markers will be used to validate the CAM-recovered cells. The proposed Phase I study will measure the feasibility and efficiency of the CAM technology for use in the Phase II pathological study and molecular analysis of cancer cells in the blood. Ultimately, the combination of metastatic tumor cell enrichment and molecular targets acquired for specific GI cancers will create a technology that clinicians can use to establish staging, predict prognosis, and determine therapeutic responsiveness for multiple types of epithelial tumors.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Phase I   Reflectance confocal microscopy images the cellular and structural morphology of tissue in-vivo or ex-vivo without the need for histological processing. Existing reflectance confocal microscopes use single wavelength laser to generate gray scale intensity images.      The goals of this proposal are to build and characterize a coherence reflectance confocal microscope with a broad-band light source synthesized from high-power discrete semiconductor laser sources. Adding this form of coherence imaging to confocal reflectance microscopy offers several enhancements to traditional reflectance confocal microscopy:   1. Increase axial resolution for a given focusing objective numerical aperture (NA),   2. Maintain axial resolution for a reduced NA,   3. Collect both amplitude and intensity information from a sample tissue,   4. Collect intensity information from a sample tissue at several discrete wavelengths.   These enhancements will increase the clinical utility of confocal microscopy by allowing deeper imaging in the tissue and improving the specificity of the images by gathering more information about the tissue through heterodyne amplitude detection and multi-wavelength intensity detection.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a well-recognized need for devices capable of sensing and recording data from physiological sources and converting such input into usable control signals. A device of this nature that could generate control signal input without external bodily movement would significantly enhance quality of life issues for many of the physically impaired. The use of power wheelchairs in particular would expand greatly in scope and utility from the development of a feedback control system with this capacity. Such a device would enable individuals suffering from conditions such as spinal cord injury, diseases effecting the nervous system and brain, arthritis, stroke, and repetitive motion damage, with the capability to far more effectively use assist devices such as mechanized wheelchairs.   Think-A-Move, Ltd., introduces a method for detecting tongue movement, and generating a control instruction corresponding to that movement in real-time to enable patients with limited extremity function control of power wheelchairs. This method consists of detecting specific tongue motions through monitoring of air pressure in the aural cavity, and correlating air flow in the ear-canal to tongue motion. To our knowledge, our device is the only tongue-based human machine interface that does not involve obtrusive insertion within the oral cavity. In Phase I, Think-A-Move demonstrated the feasibility of using this technology for \"hands free\" power wheelchair control. Our system demonstrated itself capable of recognizing tongue movements with over 96%-99% accuracy, and of directing a simulated power wheelchair in response to said tongue movements. Phase II will expand on this accomplishment to produce a commercial-ready device for power wheelchair control. Commercial partnerships with wheelchair control component manufacturers are already in place to insure this unique technology reaches market",

        "abstract": "Parallax Research, Inc. proposes to build an Ultra-High Vacuum compatible Wavelength Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (WDS) that can be used on small spot Auger, XPS, TEM and FESEM analytical instruments for elemental analysis. The effort draws upon Parallax's experience in designing WDS systems for Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM) and for XRF. This new type of x-ray spectrometer will eliminate the sources of leakage that plagued previous WDs systems used on UHV systems by using UHV compatible materials, motion feedthroughs and by replacing the leak prone gas flow proportional counter x-ray detector. During Phase 1, Parallax tested a potential proportional counter replacement with sufficient success to be very confident of Phase 2 success. The proposed spectrometer is conceptually based on Parallax's new 6-diffractor HeXLEXS extended energy range Wavelength Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer. COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The largest and most direct commercial application of this technology will be for a WDS system to be used on Transmission Electron Microscopes. Although it is intended for use on a small spot Auger system, these represent only a few systems/yr. In addition, the technology will by immediately applicable for WDS systems to be used on Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopes (FESEM) where manufacturers are hesitant to warranty systems with existing WDS spectrometers.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will reduce mechanical external-cavity diode lasers to a centimeter-sized waveguide chip using a novel giant electro-optic effect.  The device, a waveguide external-cavity semiconductor laser (WECSL), will be environmentally robust, compact, entirely electro-optic and capable of continuous, mode-hop-free tuning over 100 nm in fewer than 5 milliseconds.  The laser will also exhibit a side-mode-suppression ratio of 40 dB and a (fast) linewidth of ~200 kHz.  In Phase II we will demonstrate advanced prototype WECSLs, develop critical manufacturing processes, and perform basic environmental qualifications.  We will also conduct research allowing the laser to sweep over a 50 nm band at a rate of 5 kHz.  The low-cost technology platform of WECSLs, and their precision performance specifications could enable laser-based sensors to assume a prominent role in commercial applications.  In biophotonics, tunable lasers can replace broadband light sources and enhance the performance of optical coherence tomography instruments that measure the tissue layers in the human retina and the vascular system.  Distributed fiber sensing arrays greatly benefit from tunable lasers that probe Bragg sensors spaced along the fiber.  Distributed fiber sensors needing low-cost tunable lasers are being developed for chemical and biological sensing, pressure sensing, and vibration, strain and temperature sensing for a wide variety of monitoring applications such as homeland security; civil structures such as buildings, bridges, and dams; oil wells and pipelines; electrical power lines; aircraft and spacecraft; and all-optical shipboard sensing.",
