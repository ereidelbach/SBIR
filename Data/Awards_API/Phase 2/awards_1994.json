        "abstract": "Ontogenic neural networks, those which automatically discover their topology during synthesis, offer substantial advantages over traditional machine learning techniques. They also have the potential to offer many benefits in several areas of avionics research. Among potential application areas is the ability to predict or forecast the behavior of a seemingly random or chaotic system. This proposal presents an existing ontogenic neural network paradigm - polynomial networks - and discusses both substantial enhancements to its learning algorithm and the development of an evolutionary modeling environment. This will be achieved by implementing system modeling strategies in a production-rule environment using the CLIPS expert system tool. This proposal also discusses a feasibility demonstration for a specific avionics application to clearly demonstrate the utility of the ontogenic paradigm. During Phase I, AbTech will design major enhancements to the existing ontogenic neural network paradigm, implement and deliver a substantial subset of these enhancements, and demonstrate the results of applying the resulting Phase I learning system to a well-defined avionics application. During Phase II, AbTech will implement the full Phase I design and apply the resulting modeling environment to an operational solution of the chaotic avionics system behavior prediction application.",

        "abstract": "We will use an innovative neural network algorithm to perdict and control National Aero-Space Plane(NASP) unstarts at the earliest possible moment. Unstarts present a design challenge to hypersonic aircraft. An unstart occurs when the pressure at the aft end of the engine flow path reaches a critical level. This overpressure causes a \"choking\" of the air flow. The flow tends to spill around the inlet and the pressures in the flowpath become excessively high. The thrust goes to zero. These high pressures can damage the engine and if the design is not sufficiently robust, an unstart could lead to loss of the vehicle. By predicting the unstart at the earliest possible moment, the prediction algorithm will give the control algorithm enough time to prevent the unstart. A few extra milliseconds additional lead time could improve control. We will compare traditional methods of pattern recognition against a neural network approach to determine if critical time could be gained with the neural approach.

The active smart material system proposed has distinct advantages over traditional passive damping treatments and active articulated control surface techniques. This innovative smart material approach has the potential to improve aircraft performance and reduce maintenance costs significantly. The technical objectives of the proposed project include: (1) defining the functional requirements for the active smart material system, (2) assembling an integrated aeroelastic/smart material model, (3) choosing the most appropriate controller architecture, (4) and designing and analyzing controllers for active smart material systems in order to suppress unwanted buffet loads. Essentially, the goal of the Phase I effort is to determine the effectiveness, in terms of performance achieved versus added weight, of an active smart material system for buffet load suppression. The program is targeted toward buffeting problems experienced by the F/A 18, but the innovation described in the proposal has application to other operational, as well as future, high performance vertical tail aircraft.",

        "abstract": "Jet engine test cells are faced with meeting regulations related to NOx emissions and opacity. Based upon reported research results, it appears that the Pulse Induced Plasma Chemical Process (PPCP) could be effectively applied to jet engine test cells for the control of NOx. The process provides high efficiency NOx removal at relatively low temperature without the need for NH3 injection. PPCP can be designed for a flow-through configuration which could be installed in a test cell with minimal pressure drop. In addition, VOCs present in the exhaust stream would be destroyed and particles would be collected by this system. The primary objective of the Phases I program is to determine the technical feasibility of developing PPCP for jet engine test cells. This requires the design and testing of components that can be incorporated into a control system that will fit the specific geometric constraints of size, flow rate, and pressure drop necessary for use in the existing test cells. The Phases I effort will involve a laboratory study to evaluate several key subsystems of the proposed technique and develop data required for designing a prototype full-scale test system.",

        "abstract": "The development of a simple, reliable, and easily operated system to detect and measure airborne lead (Pb) to trace levels is the subject of the Phase I effort. Lead is toxic to humans at very low levels and is ingested easily by breathing air in which elemental Pb or compounds of this element are dispersed. In firing ranges there is an opportunity for shooters and range personnel to be exposed to hazardous levels of lead and its compounds. Control of Pb levels in firing ranges typically depends on adjusting ventilation to limit Pb buildup. This control strategy depends on the ability to monitor Pb levels in the air if maximum energy efficiency in use of fans and maximum heat conservation is to be achieved. The Phase I real-time monitor for Pb levels in firing range air will provide a monitor to protect human health for those using the range and provide a continuous monitor suitable for ventilation control to assure that acceptable Pb levels can be reached and maintained. After successful demonstration of the monitoring technology for trace levels of Pb in air during Phase I, the project will proceed to development and testing of a prototype analyzer at operating firing ranges in Phase II. The results of the prototype testing will serve as the basis for a commercial lead-in-air analyzer to serve a market, expanded beyond just firing ranges, in Phase III.",

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses the immediate need for models for accurate description of metal matrix composite (MMC) response to multiaxial loadings such as those existing in most turbine engine components. The model is needed for both design and life prediction of engine components. The proposed effort will result in a cost-effective method of predicting MMC response under multiaxial loading which will include the consideration of fiber-matrix debond and matrix inelasticity. However, the final model will be in a relatively simple form so that it can be readily incorporated into design and life prediction analysis software used by engine manufacturers. the technology resulting from the proposed research will be of immediate use to turbine engine manufacturers as well as airframe structure manufacturers using MMCs. But the model will provide an essential (and currently unavailable) input to design of MMC components for a wide variety of defense as well as civil applicatins.",

        "abstract": "Diamondlike multinetwork and network-crystalline atomic-scale composite coatings constitute a new class of materials with unique properties including high adhesion to virtually any substrate (including materials, crystalline and glass dielectrics, plastics), excellant thermal and diffusion barrier properties, good hardness, high elasticity and flexibility, very high thermal shock resistance, extremely low friction coefficient, controllable electrical properties, controllable refractive index, and good thermal stability especially in oxygen free environments. Films are deposited at low temperature (300-500K), and substrate size is limited only by chamber diameter (currently a 760mm diameter substrate can be coated). Coatings represent a significant advance over conventional diamondlike films in allowing the ability to tailor properties. A range of coating materials can be produced for potential use in a wide variety of applications. The requirement for protective and insulating devices for microwave and plasma equipment may fall well within the characteristics of these materials. The fundamental structure of these atomic-scale composites is comprised of two self-stabilized random networks, each stabilized chemically by additional atomic species. An example of such structures is diamond-like Nanocomposites (DLN) containing a C:H and a-Si:O networks. During Phase , diamondlike carbon, DLN and doped-DLN coatings will be prepared on a selected substrate, and performance compared with the existing data on DLN and DLC. Properties of the most promising material will then be optimized and its dielectric, ablation, temperature resistance and ionization behavior studied under simulator plasma device conditions to evaluate longevity.",

The wide band-gap and consequent high breakdown field of silicon carbide theoretically allows efficient high power solid state power amplifiers. Its high thermal conductivity will permit compact devices and high power density. To date, virtually all silicon carbide-based devices have been fabricated using 6H-SiC; recent advances in bulk and epitaxial 6H-SiC crystal growth have increased its availability. However, 6H-SiC may not be the preferred polytype. The performance of high power and high frequency devices would significantly increase if 3C-SiC, the cubic form, were available. 3C-SiC has twice the electron and hole mobilities of 6H-SiC and has a slightly higher saturation electron drift velocity. In Phase I the feasibility of 3C-SiC substrate growth will be demonstrated with an innovative sublimation crucible design. The objective for Phase II is to optimize the growth of 3C-SiC substrates for device demonstrations. In Phae III, ATM and its partners will scale the crystal growth process to enable the manufacture of specific devices and to supply substrates in order to accelerate the growth of an SiC-based semiconductor industry.",

This project will implement a unique new analysis capability to analyze and assess a novel propulsion device that could greatly enhance applications in the hypersonic class of flight vehicles. The ODW Hy-Scram Engine is configured to use gas dynamic wave interactions to provide inlet stream primary compression(after vehicle forebody compression), bulk ignition, and rapid combustion. The major advantages over previous Scramjet engines are:1)use of the vehicle forebody for fuel injection and complete mixing(due to longer distances, lower temperatures and lower pressures than is typical in the inlet fuel injection systems of Scramjet Engines), 2)simpler and shorter inlet design due to lower Mach range through which the flow must be decelerated (typically incorporated into the vehicle forebody), and 3)shorter and simpler combustor design. The primary benefit of this approach is the reduction of the weight associated with the propulsion system for a given combustion efficiency. The secondary benefit is stabilized combustion due to the bulk ignition of the fuel and oxidizer in the stable over driving of the oblique detonation wave.",

These systems must be maintained in a state of readiness to support critical mission functions, and must be able to perform these functions correctly despite the presence of faults in system hardware and software components, and in the environments in which the systems operate. Automated tools are needed to assist in specifying and evaluating dependability characteristics of mission critical computer system designs, and in balancing dependability against other system attributes such a performance and cost. Phase I research will determine the feasibility of an automated system dependability assessment tool (SDAT) for assessment of mission critical computer system dependability. SDAT will consist of separate design specification, design translation, and design evaluation components. These tool components will be extendible and will be compatible with other Navy system engineering methods and tools. Quantitative dependability measures that will be produced by SDAT include mission reliability and operational availability for critical system functions. Dependability modeling capabilities provided by existing automated tools, including the START integrated reliability and performance analysis tool, as well as other reliability prediction tools sucyh as SHARPE and ARAM, will provide a starting point for the SDAT specification to be developed in Phase I.",

The goal of this project is to develop a new open-path absorption cell suitable for in situ measurements of reactive trace species from an aircraft platform. The open-path design, in which the laser beam undergoes multiple reflections between two mirrors located on the wing and the fuselage, is preferable to more commonly used enclosed path sampling cells because reactive gases may be perturbed by sampling inlets and surfaces. This project will test a multipass cell that uses a novel astigmatic mirror system which can obtain sufficient path length (600 m) with relatively small diameter mirrors (\u00bf10 cm). This cell will minimize size, weight, and aerodynamic perturbations and will make the system particularly suitable for deployment on small, unmanned aircraft being developed for stratospheric research. Phase I research would optimize the design of the mirrors, develop an automated alignment method, and evaluate the applicability of the open-path absorption system for detecting target stratospheric trace gases such as HNO3, HOCl, HCl, ClONO2, and the HO2 radical.",

Impact testing is currently underway in ground test cells such as the wind tunnels and arc facilities located at Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC). For these tests, instrumentation that can determine the velocity vectors and size distribution for a wide range of particles, including irregular crystalline particles is needed. In this proposal, we describe a probe that features a combination of spatially resolved velocity vector measurement capability of an LDV with an imaging sizing method which is not restricted to spherical particles. The resulting single probe will allow simultaneous single-particle 2-dimensional velocity and irregular particle size characterization in a diameter range of 0.1 mm to 1.0 mm, with an expected accuracy of 10%, and a velocity accuracy of better than 1%. It will have an easily adjustable probe volume dimension in order to cope with the expected different number densities and will be easily moved between facilities. In addition, the probe will feature a high spatial resolution in order to asses the spatial ditribution of the particle accurately.",

This task will involve a linear interpolation of primitive variables in three dimensions with a gradient weighted flux correction method aimed at maintaining global flux conservation. For applications such as complex internal flows and hypersonic vehicles where engine/airframe integration analysis is crucial, sophisticated multi-block structured grid techniques are required. These techniques must not only be flexible and easy to use, but they must also be accurate. An arbitrary zonal interface interpolation scheme with global flux conservation will provide these characteristics. The Phase II portion of this research will build on the Phase I work by considering additional state variable interpolations, nonoveralpping grid topologies, time accurate calculations with moving grids, and interpolation across zonal boundaries between a structured and unstructured mesh.

IN THE PAST FEW YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS, MOTIVATED BY THE WAVELET TRANSFORM, IN OPTIMAL MULTISCALE IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING, PROVIDING A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR IMAGE SEGMENTATION AND FEATURE EXTRACTION, CLUTTER REMOVAL, AND MULTISENSOR FUSION THAT HOLD THE PROMISE OF SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN BOTH PERFORMANCE AND COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY. WE DESCRIBE HOW THIS FRAMEWORK CAN BE USED FOR TARGET DETECTION, FEATURE EXTRACTION, AND CLUTTER REJECTION BASED EITHER ON SPATIAL OR SPATIO-TEMPORAL FEATURES. WE ALSO DESCRIBE HOW THE WAVELET TRANSFORM LEADS NATURALLY TO THE IDEA OF A WAVELET NETWORK, A NONLINEAR ADAPTIVE LEARNING FRAMEWORK THAT APPEARS TO HOLD CONSIDERABLE PROMISE FOR TARGET FEATURE EXTRACTION AND CLASSIFICATION. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: RESULTS OF THIS EFFORT SHOULD LEAD TO NEW AND EFFECTIVE METHODS FOR THE DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF SPATIO-TEMPORALLY LOCALIZED PHENOMENA IN COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTS, AND FOR MOTION DETECTION AND ESTIMATION. SUCH METHODS WILL BE OF VALUE IN BOTH MILITARY APPLICATIONS AS WELL AS IN SUCH CIVILIAN/COMMERCIAL AREAS AS REMOTE ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND BIOMEDICAL IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES.",

        "abstract": "Continuing increases in computing capability present numerous opportunities to assist the staff of a command center as they analyze enemy operations, construct and evaluate courses of action, and monitor the execution of the selected option. Nowhere are these opportunities more critical than in the areas of national and theatre missile defense. ALPHATECH has developed the most advanced and mature fixed-algorithm decision aid for missile defense, the Look-Ahead Battle Planner, which evaluates the expected outcome of an engagement given certain data about threat and friendly forces. It is based on complex optimization algorithms which schedule interceptor missions against the expected target set. Recent advances in neural computing techniques offer the potential to augment this capability with faster, adaptive techniques which can be rapidly retrained as threat characteristics change. This proposal describes a program to implement and test a neural network which may provide order-of-magnitude increases in responsiveness. Our approach is to generate training and test data sets using the Look-Ahead Battle Planner, to develop and implement a neural network to assess potential battle outcomes given coarse information about threat and friendly forces, and to compare the performance and computational requirements of the neural approach with the existing aid.",

Hybridization reactions typically require long incubation times, i. e. overnight.

The overall goal is to use this technology to develop high-speed nucleic acid hybridization procedures for use in solution and solid phase assays such as Southern blotting. To demonstrate feasibility, we will couple this high-speed hybridization technology to a new streamlined method developed at Ambion for ribonuclease protection assays. We will use nucleic acid probes immobilized to beads to determine optimum conditions for high-speed hybridization. The results from these experiments will then be applied to the development of protocols for high-speed Southern and Northern hybridization procedures. The successful completion of this project will have major impact, both on the research and especially the diagnostic applications of nucleic acid hybridization assays.",

To address this need, American Research Corporation of Virginia (ARCOVA) proposes the development of an intelligent data compression interface for transmission of video imagery, graphics and multi-dimensional array fields to environmental computer systems at shore sites and ships. The program technical objectives include identification of environmental database specifications, selection of an optimal neural network paradigm, training and testing of the neural network paradigm selected, and design of a user interface. Successful completion of these objectives will result in an automated data reduction system capable of achieving maximal compression with minimal loss. The significance of this effort is the innovative use of neural networks for compression and distribution of video and animated data for use on newly developed environmental computer equipment and systems. Since neural networks have been shown to be faster and more accurate than traditional data compression techniques in similar applications, ARCOVA will demonstrate a proof-of-concept system for video image compression that is superior to current methods.",

This will reduce boresight errors and power loss resulting from the radome and makes the area at the nose of the missile available for other complementary sensors. - The antenna system and the proposed associated feeds and operating system will preclude the need for phase shifters and other expensive phased array technology. - Gimballed antennas are not required. - The proposed antenna system will have a higher reliability with fewer parts and no moving parts. - Because of the absence of the radome requirement, the system is compatible with all seeker frequencies through 94 GHZ. - No requirement for a rolling airframe to unmask monopulse blind areas. The array antenna achieves the electronic equivalent to a rolling monopulse by using banks of 8 elements, switched electronically, to achieve 2 sets of orthogonal views 45 degrees apart.",

The feasibility of using GaN for short wavelength (up to 365 nm) OEIC's will be established in Phase I via the demonstration of a channel waveguide based phase shifter. The Al(sub x)GA(sub 1-x)N material system with its transparency from 365 nm to 12 microns, tunable refractive index (with alloy composition) and a high electro-optic coefficient is an excellent choice for fabricating short wavelength waveguide devices. It also has been deposited in excellent single crystal form over substrates such as sapphire, GaAs and silicon which makes possible integration of control and driver electronics along with the guided wave components. With our demonstration of GaN planar waveguides and measurement of the material electro-optic coefficient we are in a good position to demonstrate a channel waveguide based phase shifter in Phase I. This will be followed by the fabrication of an active OEIC component such as a modulator in the Phase II effort.",

The innovative aspect of the proposed device is the use of an integrated optics device chip to enable coupling of the dispersed laser wavelengths into separate electro-optic modulators which encode each of the carrier wavelengths with a different signal. This device could be used in data communication systems to achieve the volume of data flow required by data systems that have an integrated form where video, voice, and data are simultaneously distributed and processed. The objective of the Phase I program is to design the various components of the wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical modulator, and to write specifications detailing critical component parameters, fabrication procedures and/or sources for procurement of components. Phase I experimental studies will provide data for the design studies through measurements of the spatial characteristics of both the light beam of the specified laser source and the guided light beam of the integrated optic waveguide structure. This Phase I effort will provide the design specifications required to fabricate and evaluate a prototype WDM optical modulator in the Phase II program.",

        "abstract": "Mice lacking a functional c-src gene develop osteopetrosis due to a defect in bone resorption by osteoclasts (1). This evidence implicates the role of Src in osteoclast resorption activity. We aim to develop a drug that blocks the action of Src protein kinase as a potential treatment of osteoporosis. To do this, we are targeting a domain of the Src protein kinase termed SH2 (src homology 2). SH2 domains are found on a number of intracellular proteins and function as receptors for tyrosine-phosphorylated polypeptides. Our Phase I goal is to identify peptides that tightly bind to the Src SH2 domain using a technique termed \"phage display\". A library of pentapeptides is expressed on the surface of M13 phage fused to the gene III protein, a minor M13 coat protein. Each phage displays a single peptide sequence on its surface. The phage library is mixed with immobilized SH2 domain and non-binding phage are removed by washing. Bound phage are eluted and propagated through E. coli to produce a population of phage enriched for sequences that recognize the SH2 domain. Since SH2 domains exhibit a higher affinity for tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides versus nonphosphorylated peptides, we will use several novel approaches to phosphorylate the phage-displayed peptides. The selection cycle is repeated 5-10 times then individual phage are cloned, and the encoded peptides are sequenced. Peptides derived from the selected clones will be synthesized and tested for binding to Src SH2 domain.",

        "abstract": "It is clear that the utility of tactile aids degrades even more rapidly in the presence of noise than is the case for hearing aids. This is particularly apparent in the integration of visual and tactile cues as for example in speechreading. One reason may be is because many of the cues derived from tactile inputs are quite crude, depending more on temporal properties devoid of fine spectral features, than is true even for a defective auditory channel. One consequence is that short transient noises occurring in the background give rise to tactile stimuli that are indistinguishable from those derived from transient speech waveforms. While most existing tactile aids incorporate some form of noise suppression, the improvements obtained are modest at best, particularly as regards the transient noises which are the most deleterious. The long range goal is to evolve a recently developed highly directional microphone into a format suitable for use with tactile aids in order to improve their use under noisy conditions. At present, the microphone has as a major shortcoming excessive case noise. The goal of Phase I is to determine if the design can be replicated by using small hearing aid microphone elements to obtain a small case-noise resistant package that can be conveniently worn. If successful, the design would most likely be useful for cochlear implants and hearing aids as well.",

IN THIS TREATMENT RADIOACTIVE SOURCES ARE PLACED DIRECTLY IN THE TUMOR VOLUME (INTERSTITIAL BRACHYTHERAPY) OR IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE TUMOR IN BODY CAVITIES (INTRACAVITARY IRRADIATION). RECENTLY THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF BRACHYTHERAPY SOURCES EMITTING LOWER ENERGY PHOTONS IN THE ENERGY RANGE OF 20 TO 100 KEV BECAUSE THEY OFFER ADVANTAGES OVER HIGHER ENERGY PHOTON EMITTERS IN TERMS OF EASE OF RADIATION SHIELDING WITHIN THE PATIENT AND RADIATION PROTECTION OF MEDICAL PERSONNEL. FOLLOWING THIS TREND, SM-145 SOURCES FOR BRACHYTHERAPY WERE DEVELOPED AT BROOKHAVEN NATIONAL LABORATORY (BNL). THESE SOURCES EMIT PHOTONS IN THE ENERGY RANGE OF 38 TO 45 KEV AND DECAY WITH A HALF LIFE OF 340 DAYS. IN ADDITION TO THE ADVANTAGES OF THE EASE OF RADIATION SHIELDING, SM-145 SOURCES EMIT PHOTONS WITH ENERGIES JUST ABOVE THE K-ABSORPTION EDGE OF IODINE (33.3 KEV). THIS CHARACTERISTIC MAKES SM-145 SOURCES AN IDEAL CANDIDATE FOR RADIATION ENHANCEMENT WITH THYMIDINE ANALOG IODINATED DEOXYURIDINE (IUDR) BY STIMULATING CASCADES OF AUGER ELECTRONS RESULTING FROM PHOTOIONIZATION OF THE IODINE. THUS, SM-145 OFFERS A NEW POSSIBILITY FOR MAXIMIZING THE EFFECTS OF IUDR RADIOSENSITIZATION IN COMBINATION WITH BRACHYTHERAPY, WHICH ARE BEING INVESTIGATED BY NCI SPONSORED PROTOCOLS AT YALE, OHIO STATE AND BNL.

With the current trends in aircraft design and execution driving maneuvering requirements for military aircraft to progressively higher angles of attack the need for such a facility is becoming paramounnt. The availability of the existing research facility at Wright Laboratory's Vertical Wind Tunnel provides the opportunity to develop test apparatus to provide the necessary static and dynamic test information for the appropriate analysis and simulation of aircraft characteristics. As a result, a thorough evaluation of the Air Force facility in conjunction with future test requirements must be made to ensure that the new test apparatus will be capable of providing all required test data and will be of high quality.",

The distortions resulting from data nonlinearity will be corrected by a calibration process acting upon the x-ray data. The blurring errors will be avoided by performing the measurement in the Fourier transform domain. This method can be used to perform automated, nondestructive inspection of crucial parts, such as turbine blades and rocket nozzles, for which substandard dimensions can cause failure. The preliminary system is expected to measure wall thicknesses down to 0.5 mm with better than 1% accuracy, but the method can be used to measure much thinner walls in small components.",

Briefly, the specific objectives of this Phase I proposal are to: a. Develop a process to make prototype, uniform, optical quality thin films of bacteriorhodopsin or bacteriorhodopsin-polymer films; b. Test the holographic properties of the thin films of bacteriorhodopsin, including diffraction efficiency, sensitivity and response times; c. Develop concepts and designs for materials improvements that optimize the quality of bacteriorhodopsin films for dynamic holography.

        "abstract": "This proposal describes the design and testing of new enzyme-based amperometric sensors for the neurochemically important species, choline, acetylcholine and glutamate. In these devices, the electrical communication between the flavin redox centers of an oxidase and an electrode is achieved via a network of donor-acceptor relays chemically bound to a highly flexible polymer. Because the electron transfer mediators are covalently attached to an insoluble polymer and cannot diffuse away from the electrode, these sensors should be suitable for implantation; thus, they would be useful for in vivo neurochemical research. The research plan concerns the development of highly sensitive and selective micro-biosensors which can be used as implantable probes or in combination with conventional microdialysis techniques. The sensors should permit detection of these neurochemicals over much shorter time scales than presently available assays.",

Difficulties in access and utilization result from the lack of 1) uniform standards for minimum data sets, 2) open systems architecture, and 3) a system for tracking and updating medical records as patients move through different health care institutions. As a result, duplication of tests and prescribed medications occurs which is not only dangerous to patients, but contributes to soaring health care costs. An innovative approach is necessary to re-engineer the patient information system to achieve an effective, efficient health care system. We will undertake a comprehensive approach to address these problems. Blue Chip will 1) apply information engineering to develop a minimum patient data set to be implemented on a client-server based Relational Database System; 2) design an open system technology based on client-server distributed network information system to solve the data interoperability and systems integration problems; 3) design a uniform patient ID system and data interchange standard to allow vital patient information to be transferred throughout the continuum of care.",

        "abstract": "Assessing the environmental structural damage caused by U.S. Air Force supersonic flight operations is costly and time consuming. A contributing factor is the need for dedicated site flyovers. These are required to measure (i) the sonic boom induced pressure field on the structure, whihc owing to diffraction and scattering, is site specific, and (ii) the induced response of the structure, to be related to peak stress. It is proposed that the use of structural-acoustic reciprocity techniques would allow the U.S. Air Force to circumvent this requirement and in turn reduce the associated costs. Such techniques have been used successfully for other structural-acoustic applications, for example the shock response of ships to underwater explosions. With this approach, a vibration source substitutes for the flyover and microphones and accelerometers substitute for stress measurements. Digital post processing of the measured signals allows for the simulation of virtually arbitrarily shaped free field booms. The approach is valid for the seismic response of the structure, e.g., to sonic boom-coupled Rayleigh waves as well as for the direct effect of the overpressure on its surface.",

IN PHASE I, AN EXISTING CFD CODE (REFLEQS-3D, WHICH ALREADY HAS WELL-TESTED BODY FITTED COORDINATES CAPABILITY) WILL BE MODIFIED TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL GEOMETRIC DETAILS OF THE SEAT, OCCUPANT, EQUIPMENT, AND PROTECTION/STABILIZATION DEVICES. A THOROUGH AERODYNAMIC ANALYSIS WILL BE PERFORMED FOR A SELECTED EJECTION SEAT, TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE APPROACH.

        "abstract": "Cavitation is believed to cause damage to tilting disk mitral mechanical heart valves (MHVs). Previous studies have indicated that this phenomenon may be dominant during MHV closure. The \"squeeze-flow\" field between the closing occluder and valve housing, water hammer pulse at closure and the Venturi effect are possible contributing factors. These underlying physical mechanisms have not been thoroughly investigated yet. A two phase study is proposed for systematically investigating cavitation in tilting disk MHVs using a combined experimental-nu- merical approach. During Phase I, a computer model will be developed for detailed investigation of the \"squeeze-flow\" effect which occurs in regions where cavitation damage has been observed in MHV explants. The valve closure velocity data, needed for these simulations, will be measured at different physiologic flow conditions in mono and bileaflet MHVs. These experiments will be performed by Dr. Ned Hwang at the University of Miami. In Phase II, a similar methodology will be used for investigating the remaining flow mechanisms that could induce cavitation. The computer models will be validated experimentally and then used to correlate the cavitation potential of tilting disk MHVs with the valve design parameters.",

The technology will be used to recover valuable organic soluts, such as flavor and fragrance chemicals, from aqueous waste streams.  In Phase I we addressed the recovery of onion flavor from an aqueous waste stream generated during the production of onion oil.  We successfully demonstrated the technical and economic feasibility of the proposed process, which relies on selective partitioning of flavor components from the aqueous waste into a food-grade oil.  We demonstrated that onion-flavor can be recovered at high concentrations in the product oil and that the overall production costs are very low--about 1% of the oil's selling price.\n\nThe proposed Phase II program will be focused on optimization of the technology of processing onion wastewater and other target aqueous food wastes, including the recovery of orange essence and organic acids from aqueous wastes.  In Phase II we will also construct and test a prototype field-test system, and we will perform comprehensive engineering and economic analyses.  The overall goal of the proposed Phase II program is to bring the technology to the point that is can be commericialized in Phase III.  A major manufacturer and user of natural flavors has agreed to sign a Follow-On funding Commitment for Phase III.

Two types of software documentation are typically produced: (l) formal documentation describing the structure, interfaces, data types and other mathematical properties of software, and (2) semantic documentation describing the meaning and purpose of software components and actions. Our automation of formal documentation will make use of data about software structure obtainable from CASE tools. Semantic documentation will require either a specialized domain (either by application domain or by system type) or additional structured input from users. The modularity of our proposed text generator design and the linguistic sophistication of our underlying language model will allow the production of fluent, professional-quality documentation from a wide variety of information sources (difrerent CASE representations or user input), The proposed documentation generator framework will use text planning and grammatical knowledge to produce more fluent generated text than is possible with template-based approaches and have less need for augmentation by manually created free text. By decreasing the reliance on manual documentation we will guarantee better consistency between software documentation and program code via the specifications which guide the production of code.",

        "abstract": "Two forms of turbine expander are proposed. One, the single-rotor, partial admission, multistage, reentry type reaction turbine, is suitable for use at any realizable pressure ratio and should be especially effective in low mass flow engines because rotor blade Reynolds number can be maximized for a given flow area. The other, a modified form of the radial flow turbine, is adaptable to and abets structural compactness in both conventional gas turbine engines and systems based upon high pressure ratio wave engines. Both expanders inherently increase the maximum allowable material-limited gas inlet temperature because of the temperature averaging effect of the gas streams. The unsteady gas dynamics involved in the reentry type reaction turbine requires the modificationn and upgrading of existing computer simulation programs in order to address some of the unique characteristics of this machine and provide data for the design of a laboratory test rig. However, current capabilities in numerical techniques and modern computers permit effective solution of these problems. The performance and basic structural analysis of the radial flow turbine variant can be carried out with existing programs. These two expanders can drastically broaden the range of gas turbine propulsion applications.",

In addition, we have combined the wavelet transform with the affine transform of fractal compression to provide a means to represent features in a rotation and magnification independent format. Once can use these transform coefficients or identifiers (in the case of VQ and fractals) to represent the components of the image. Using these values, it is possible to apply finite inductive sequences (FI) to strings of these identifiers for the purpose of pattern recognition.

The activity weighted particle size distribution can then be inferred from these measurements using an unfolding technique. Inhaled radon progeny, particularly those due to the \"unattached\" fraction, are estimated to be the dominant sources of background radiation that deliver significant doses to the tissues or cells of the respiratory tract. Phase I will result in the construction, testing, and calibration of a laboratory working model of the particle size sampler. Phase I will demonstrate that a transportable monitor based on wire screen arrays, low cost solid state alpha particle detectors, and associated electronics can be reliably utilized. During Phase II, we will configure the technology into a relatively inexpensive system. This system will be readily transportable for real time measurement of activity weighted radon progeny particle size distributions in environments where complete characterization of the alpha activity is required. Phase III will involve commercialization of this technology through fabrication and sales of various stand-alone instruments based on the technology.",

Objective: Develop an ISA that will remain competitive and compatible for over 256 generations and will support the existing 1750A software base. The ISA will be implemented with the development of a high performance, multi-issue, multi-generational microprocessor. Approach: Phase I involves modeling the 3 inventions and simulating them using proprietary design environment to apply concepts. Model other functions and simulate as necessary in order to perform trade-offs. Generate specifications derived from work. Phase II involves generating and verifiying a fully operational model of a high performance microprocessor based on the ISA through system simulation of the SEAFAC suite and other diagnositcs.

        "abstract": "THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF THE TECHNOLOGY FOR PRODUCING HIGH QUALITY SINGLE CRYSTAL SiC WAFERS AND THIN FILMS PRESENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO FABRICATE SOLID-STATE DEVICES WITH POWER-TEMPERATURE CAPABILITY FAR GREATER THAN DEVICES CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THIS CAPABILITY IS IDEALLY SUITED TO THE APPLICATION OF POWER CONDITIONING ON THE ALL-ELECTRIC AIRPLANE, TURBINE ENGINE ACTUATORS, AND SPACE-BASED POWER SYSTEMS. THESE APPLICATIONS REQUIRE SWITCHES AND AMPLIFIERS CAPABLE OF LARGE CURRENTS WITH RELATIVELY LOW VOLTAGE DROPS. WHILE CONVENTIONAL SILICON POWER DEVICES ARE ALREADY BEING USED NEAR THEIR LIMITS OF OPERATING TEMPERATURE AND POWER, THE POTENTIAL OF SiC IS JUST BEGINNING TO BE DEMONSTRATED. VERTICAL POWER MOSFET STRUCTURES FABRICATED IN 6H-SiC WITH 50 V CAPABILITY HAVE ALREADY SHOWN CURRENT AND POWER DENSITIES AS HIGH AS 191 A/CM2 AND 5.4 KW/CM2. THE SPECIFIC ON-RESISTANCE (R Ds(on)) OF THESE DEVICES WERE AS LOW AS 37.5 M -CM2. THESE DEVICES SHOWED GOOD CHARACTERISTICS AT TEMPERATURES UP TO 300 0C. WHILE THESE ARE PROMISING RESULTS, IT IS PREDICTED THAT MUCH BETTER RESULTS COULD BE ACHIEVED IF THESE DEVICES WERE FABRICATED IN 4H-SiC. THE 4H POLYTYPE OF SiC HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE AN ELECTRON MOBILITY ALMOST TWICE THAT OF 6H-SiC, WHICH WOULD GREATLY REDUCE THE R ds(on) OF A SiC POWER DEVICE. ADDITIONALLY, THE WIDER BANDGAP (3.26 eV) OF 4H WILL RESULT IN AN EVEN HIGHER BREAKDOWN FIELD THAN 6H-SiC, WHICH IN TURN ALLOWS ANOTHER REDUCTION IN R ds(on). THEREFORE, IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE USE OF 4H-SiC BE EVALUATED FOR A HIGH TEMPERATURE POWER MOSFET. THIS EFFORT WILL INCLUDE THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE ELECTRON MOBILITY OF 4H-SiC, PARALLEL TO THE C-AXIS, USING HALL EFFECT MEASUREMENTS. PLANER MOSFETS WILL ALSO BE FABRICATED IN 4H-SiC IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE CHANNEL MOBILITY OF THESE DEVICES.

        "abstract": "This proposal offers an innovative methodology to measure and improve shipyard productivity. The methodology creates a cooperative reporting environment in which labor and management seek to accomplish identical performance goals. Measures distinguish between two kinds of labor lost due to reasons beyond labor control. Lost time includes suchurs activities as waiting for materials or equipment, crew reassignment or rework due to design changes. Counts of work actually accomplished divided by the hours actually worked at that task provide a \"true\" unit rate that accurately measures labor performance for each task. Measures of lost time hours, categorized by reason, provide a prioritized list of problems requiring management action. Regular identification of the best unit rates and recognition for crews that set new performance records generates positive feedback to both labor and management. The ratio of the best rate to the average rate serves as an indicator of management performance. Projecting the hours required to complete the remaining work quantifies the potential worth of pursuing alternative productivity gains. The methodology is simple to apply, requires minimum extra time or paperwork, allows crews to measure and report their own productivity, and costs little to implement.",

This dynamic behavior includes the ability to replicate the \"wave of disruption\" that, once triggered by a delay, often seems to propagate itself far beyond its starting time (and place). Analysis of the causes for delays and their impact on system behavior will lead to discovery of effective policies and actions to limit their detrimental effect on USN ship construction costs and schedules.

T-LAYER MHD IS A PROCESS WHEREIN A HIGH TEMPERATURE PLASMA LAYER, A T-LAYER, IS PRODUCED IN THE FLOW STREAM OF AN MHD DEVICE USING EXTERNAL EXCITATION, e.g., ELECTRIC DISCHARGE. THE T-LAYER FORMED BY THE HIGH ENERGY EXCITATION IS A FULLY IONIZED PLASMA WITH EXTREMELY HIGH ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY.

        "abstract": "The overall goal of this program is the development of tools for rapid synthesis of common classes of electronic systems. DQDT's approach is to create generators which synthesize application specific VHDL descriptions of systems from high-level specifications. These generators can then leverage readily available and constantly improving VHDL based CAD tools for simulation, gate level synthesis, and mask level synthesis. By synthesizing at the VHDL level, these generators have complete independence from the chip fabrication vendor, the CAD tool vendor, and the hardware platform. Also, the inherent technology retargeting and upgrading capability of this approach shields new systems from early obsolescence due to rapidly improving chip technology. Through a novel use of standard VHDL constructs, the proposed generators offer the user control over the amount and degree of bit-level pipelining and over the implementation style of arithmetic elements. These features significantly broaden the speed-area solution space beyond existing gate level logic manipulation methods. A library of generators will be created which are oriented around common signal processing functions such as filters, convolvers, adaptive operators, and transforms. The end product of the Phase I effort will be a complete implementation of a digital filter generator tool to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach.",

These uncertainties can not be eliminated or even significantly reduced without a tremendous expenditure of resources. ASAT needs an algorithmic approach which is designed to operate in the presence of uncertainty. During the past few years, fuzzy logic has belatedly become important design paradigm in the united States. There are a few tools available for developing fuzzy logic applications. These tools are for the most part tied to some particular hardware development system. They are also not designed ho support the ASAT application or be integrated with the current ASAT resources. We are proposing to develop a fuzzy logic tool which is primarily designed. to support the ASAT project. In addition, th&s tool will be designsd to support a wide variety of image-based fuzzy logic design efforts.

        "abstract": "Endometrial hyperplasia (EH) is characterized by hyperproliferation of the endometrium. Women with EH are at increased risk for developing endometrial carcinoma, the most common malignant neoplasm of the urogenital tract in women. Unopposed estrogen or hyperestrogenism, which can arise from hormonal imbalances that occur during menopause, obesity, estrogen-secreting ovarian tumors, or estrogen replacement therapy, are the predominant causes of EH. Most women at some point in their life experience abnormal uterine bleeding that results from EH. These women often undergo hysterectomy which is the most over-prescribed surgical procedure in the United States. The estrogen receptor, a DNA-binding transcriptional activator that is a member of the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily, mediates the ability of the endometrial cells to respond to estrogen. In the presence of estrogen, the ligand-bound activated estrogen receptor induces changes in gene expression and proliferation of the endometrium results. This proposal describes a novel pharmaceutical agent that can be used to prevent and treat endometrial hyperplasia, especially in conjunction with estrogen replacement therapy. We will inhibit the function of the estrogen receptor locally within the uterus, but in no other tissues.",

Although the anatomical resolution of these images remains to be determined, they are generated for each millisecond sample of electrical recording, and thus, provide information with a temporal resolution not possible with metabolic and hemodynamic methods of neuroimaging. This temporal resolution may be necessary to research the cognitive activity of cortical networks. The major advances in visualizing dynamic brain function promised by this new technology will have immediate applications in psychology, neurology, psychiatry, education, and human factors research.

We propose to commercialize an apparatus that attaches 128 EEG electrodes in an even spatial array across the surface of the human head. This apparatus comprises two specific inventions by Tucker (patents pending). The first is a method for positioning sensors for individual head geometries by a network tensional structure of elastic lines forming the geodesic partitioning of a spherical surface. The second invention is a sensor pedestal, a simple device that attaches at the vertices of the geodesic triangles, such that the compression directed radially by the tensional network toward the sphere center is used to hold a simple Ag/AgCl sponge electrode against the scalp. The Geodesic Electrode Net can be applied within half an hour and worn comfortably for several hours. With appropriately-designed, inexpensive amplifiers, it yields excellent EEGs. Our visual event-related potential (ERP) data with 64-channel arrays confirms the need for dense electrode arrays to adequately characterize the information on brain activity available from the scalp EEG.",

To keep abreast of the increasing demand for high speed devices, such as HEMTs or FETs, it is imperative for the III-V compound semi- conductor systems producers to make the transition from laboratory to production systems. Two main issues surrounding the epitaxial growth onto large area GaAs substrates are the layer thickness uniformity and the doping uniformity, It is important that the layer thickness of HEMT, HBT, and PET devices be uniform in order to control recess etching so that uniform threshold voltages and hence device characteristics are reproducible. The doping uniformity plays an important role in controlling the transconductance, and will be studied during this work. Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) is best suited to cost effectively produce the required materials with high yields. A strategic advance in the development of this materials technology is the shifting to 4\" to 6\" diameter process substrates. As yet, there is no established method for production of device structures on 6\" diameter substrates. In Phase II, we will demonstrate a fully automated cassette to cassette 6\" diameter wafer production capability. The Phase I and II efforts will be performed in an ENCORE high speed rotating disk vertical reactor systems, which is known to efficiently produce high quality MOCVD materials through 4\" diameter substrates.",

For this reason EMCORE proposes to use its low pressure, high speed, rotating disk MOCVD technology for the deposition of pseudomorphic HEMT structres. The technology is scaleable so that increasing the growth chamber size to accomodate growth runs of multiple 4 in. wafers should be possible. ENCORE proposes in phase I to extend our GaAs/AIGaAs HEMT technology to the pseudomorphic HEMT structure. We will examine the In fraction InGaAs layer thickness to optimize the mobility of the structure. These will be a \"characterization\" structure grown which has an undoped GaAs cap layer so that both 300 k and 77k Hall effect measurements may be done. Also, a sheet resistivity map of the entire wafer is generated to insure film uniformity. The inital growth runs will be done on 2 in. diameter substrates. When the process has been optimized the growths will be done on 4 in. diameter wafers. These wafers will again have the sheet resistivity map prepared. Nine samples will then be cleaved in a cross pattern. 300k and 77k Halleffect measurements will be performed to examine uniformity of mobility.

This device can allow a small, battery powered acoustic source to be easily located and ranged using a small flashlight sized imager. The imager relies on the piezo-dichroic properties of a continuous layer of a dichroic material thin film that serves as both the sensor and the display. The image can be viewed directly or remotely by using a CCD camera. The source would be placed at a location as a position marker. A diver, using a hand held locator, could identify or signal several other divers with a slight sophistication of the basic device. The phenomenon used allows sensitivity levels of 10^-14 w sec/cm^2. In Phase I the contractor will investigate the engineering specifications applicable to the design of a small, hand-held, real-time, ranging acoustic imager for diver location and signaling in conditions of limited optical visibility. A brassboard model will be produced for the later prototype versions anticipated in Phase II.

A LARGE NUMBER OF WET SCRUBBERS ARE ALREADY INSTALLED IN STATIONARY COMBUSTION SOURCES OR ARE PLANNED FOR THE NEAR FUTURE. THEREFORE, A PROCESS THAT PROMOTES NO REMOVAL SIMPLY THROUGH THE INJECTION OF CHEMICAL ADDITIVES INTO COMBUSTION GASES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON AIR POLLUTION CONTROL STRATEGIES. PHASE I WILL DEVELO A NOVEL CONCEPT: GAS PHASE MULTIPLE AIR POLLUTANT EMISSION REMOVAL BY INJECTION OF A SINGLE CHEMICAL ADDITIVE INTO COMBUSTION GASES AT HIGH TEMPERATURES. CHEMICAL KINETICS CALCULATIONS AND EXPERIMENTAL DATA AVAILABLE FROM THE LITERATURE PREDICT THAT AN ADDITIVE EXISTS WHICH, UPON BEING INJECTED INTO COMBUSTION GASES AT SPECIFIC CONDITIONS, CAN EFFICIENTLY CONVERT ALL MAJOR GASEOUS AIR POLLUTANTS TO NO2, AND CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2): UNREACTIVE NO, UNBURNED CARBON MONOXIDE (CO), CORROSIVE SULFUR TRIOXIDE (SO3), BYPRODUCTS. NO2 AND SO2 CAN BE EFFICIENTLY SCRUBBED IN A SLIGHTLY MODIFIED CALCIUM-BASED SO2 SCRUBBER. PHASE I WILL PROVIDE A LABORATORY-SCALE FEASIBILITY DEMONSTRATION OF THE CRITICAL STEPS OF THE PROCESS: THE CONVERSION OF NO TO NO2, SO3 TO SO2, AND CO TO CO2 IN THE GAS PHASE WITHIN REACTION TIMES, TEMPERATURES, AND OTHER CONDITIONS WHICH ARE IN THE PRACTICAL RANGE FOR APPLICATION IN BOILERS AND FURNACES.",

THE PRESENT GENERATION OF CARBONATE FUEL CELLS IN QUITE ATTRACTIVE FOR BASELOAD UTILITYAPPLICATIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGH EFFICIENCY, SUPERIOR ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE, AND COMPETITIVE COST OF ELECTRICITY. HOWEVER, COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF CARBONATE FUEL CELLS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED IF THE POWER DENSITY IS INCREASED BY A FACTOR OF THREE (from one to three kw/(2). SUCH AN INCREASE WOULD NOT ONLY LOWER THE POWER PLANT AND STACK REPLACEMENT COST, BUT ALSO IMPROVE VOLUMETRIC AND WEIGHT DENSITIES. WHILE INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS IN STACK PERFORMANCE HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT UNDER DOE/ELECTRIC POWER RESEARCH INSTITUTE AND OTHER PROGRAMS, THE EMPHASIS OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE TO ACHIEVE A QUANTUM JUMP INPOWER DENSITY WITH ACCOMPANYING COST BENEFITS BY INNOVATIVE CELL DESIGN. A MONOLITHIC CARBONATE FUEL CELL DESIGN USING THIN ELECTRODES IS PLANNED IN PHASE I FOR ACHIEVING VERY HIGH POWER DENSITY OPERATION AND REDUCTION OF CELL MATERIALS USE. THIS CELL DESIGN MAKES HIGH POWER DENSITY OPERATION FEASIBLE BY PROVIDING 12% HIGHER ACTIVE AREA WITHIN THE SAME GEOMETRIC AREA, LOWERING MASS TRANSFER RESISTANCE OF THE ANODE AS WELL AS THE CATHODE AND REDUCING CELL INTERNAL RESISTANCE BY ABOUT 60%.",

This project will investigate novel means of implanting individual fibers through the thickness of laminated composites. Such reinforcement with separate fibers extending through multiple plies is expected to offer the preferred combination of mechanical properties, in which interlaminar strength is improved without degrading the in-plane strength. The fiber implantation method, which does not involve stitching or weaving, appears to be suitable for large scale processing. It may be used also with non-weavable fibers and whiskers. Phase I effort will focus on experimentation with the process variables. Diverse fiber materials, fiber diameters, fiber lengths, and laminate forms (unidirectional and woven) will be tested. An objective is control over fiber orientation and areal density as required for interlaminar reinforcement purposes. Reinforced composite samples will be fabricated and inspected. The most promising process will be used to fabricate samples for short beam mechanical testing. Potential improvements in the damage tolerance of composite facesheets and the potential for aircraft weight reduction will be assessed. Phase 2 would develop further the leading process and scale up to fabricate and test prototype composite panels.",

The carbon tubing is derived from polyimide tubing. The radial fiber structure is created by electrostatic flocking. Coatings to block hydrogen permeation and to prtotect against erosion are applied by chemical vapor deposition. The proposed process is suited for various guages of tubing and for various curvatures. The flocked carbon tubing my be integrated with carbon fiber preforms and processed to form an actively cooled carbon-carbon structural component for use with hot pressurized hydrogen. Phase 1 effort will focus on materials processing. We will investigate the carbonization of selected precursors, fiber flocking methods, and CVD coatings. Electron microscopy will be used to inspect the tubing wall and fiber attachment. Sections of flocked carbon tubing will be fabricated for thermal cycling, and measurements of permeation and the rate of erosion in hot hydrogen. Preliminary thermal analysis will model carbon-carbon heat exchanger structures with the new tubing to investigate design trades and assess the overal performance.

The MAHEM is an explosive warhead that utilizes magnetohydrodynamic effects to transfer the \"global\" explosive energy (that is mainly wasted in a conventional warhead) at electromagnetic speeds to a \"localized\" region where it may act on the metal mass of a shaped charge cone that is to be propelled in a given direction toward a target. Our concept exploits the phenomenon of electromagnetic braking for the purpose of transforming the kinetic energy of detonation products in one part of a system to kinetic energy of metallic ejecta in another part. Hence, the local region can become a region of huge energy accumulation. It should be possible to propel metallic ejecta at velocities much greater than can be done using expolsives alone...or to propel a much greater mass...in order to obtain greater kill probabilities. Methods for doing this are outlined, and some examples are provided. The explosive used in the MAHEM can be a truly insensitive explosive, e.g. TABT, resulting in invulnerability to accidental detonation.",

Two basic types of curved tubular weaving were considered, a single shuttle flat loom and a multishuttle circular loom. After considerations, the circular loom was selected as the preffered method. The circular loom is of a very high production, and can be designed to accomodate an inner tube integrally during the weaving. The circular loom by definition working out if a creel warp, which makes it easy to weave a curved tube. A circular loom can also control the weft yarn rotation on its own axis precisely to prevent undesirable twisting of the weft if a tape shape yarn is woven.",

Among the two color detectors, the ones with multi-spectral response and sharing the common optical area are of particular interest for military applications. The goal of this program is then to develop a technology to produce two color detectors, arrays and focal plane arrays. The final FPAs to be produced by the technology developed in this program will have a monolithic structure, a common sensing area and will be on silicon wafers. The infrared material will be HgCdTe grown by MOCVD method. In this phase I program period, HgCdTe multilayers consisting of MWIR and LWIR layers will first be produced. Subsequently, two color detectors will be fabricated in these materials by ion implementation and related processing steps. There are a number of two color detector types. By the end of this Phase I period, we will determine which type will be favored and be used in the Phase II program for producing FPAs. In the second phase of this program, multiplexers for operating two color detector arrays will be designed and fabricated. The HgCdTe two color detector arrays will be integrated to the multiplexers and then the final FPAs will be tested.",

A basic waveguide strucutre, common to lasers, detector and waveguide, is proposed here for optical amplifiers, integratible with MMICs. By choosing a common structure these components can be readily integrated together without the need for complicated multiple growth procedures and conflicting material and process requirements. The idea centers on the principle that the property of a gain medium can be manipulated by injection of carriers to vary its gain. Similarly, for an absorbing medium by adjusting its reverse bias voltage its absorption can be varied.",

Confidence has been built applying composites to such aircraft as the A6, V22, B2, and F22 Prototype. Now that composites materials have been proven the focus is shifted to obvious limitations in manufacturing technology. Significant weight reductions, cost savings, and performance enhancements can still be made by the development of advanced manufacturing technologies. A limiting factor for composites has been the issue of attachment. Most attachment schemes center about what is acceptable for metals. Taking advantage of the flexibility of composites can eliminate much of the demanding fastening requirements. Composite structure such as intersecting ribs and spars or frames and stringers is an excellent example. Current composites fuselage concepts have a stringer mousehole cut in a frame and/or use a combination of clips, doublers, rivets and bolts to assure attachment. This is a costly process that adds weight and increases manufacturing risk. Foster-Miller is proposing advanced braided performing technology which will produce continuous intersecting structure. In the case of a composite fuselage a continuous frame would be fabricated with continuous intersection spars. Fibers which make up the spar would be continuous through the frame eliminating the need for attachment at this critical location. In Phase I demonstration intersecting or cruciform structure will be fabricated. Several demonstration articles will be impregnated cured and tested to determine structural integrity. In addition enhanced quality functional deployment (EQFD), which integrates House of Quality methodology and Pugh concept analysis techniques will be employed to determine critical components for process automation. One determined component will be conceptualized, designed, fabricated and demonstrated.",

This unique portable instrument will make it possible for the first time for non-technical Air Force personnel to make quick, reliable in-the-field characterization of the organics in complex hazardous waste solutions stored at Air Force baes. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is the most powerful analytical technique for the identification of organic compounds but has not often been used for hazardous waste because of the lack of a suitable sampling mechanism. Foster-Miller's unique fiber optic probe with a disposable sensor coupled with our commercialization partner Bomem Inc's special field portable FTIR spectrometer and with special analytical computer software to be developed by Foster-Miller will accomplish this goal. The successful completion of Phase I will provide all of the necessary data to design, fabricate and test a prototype field portable device during Phase II in conjunction with Bomem and the Air Force. This will lead to commercialization of an optimized system during Phase II by the Foster-Miller-Bomem team.",

The replacement of larger, bulk-optic mechanical systems will result in lower throughput losses, lower weight and volume, and higher reliability. For this program, Foster-Miller proposes to exploit the unique properties of a new holographic film that can be reliably and repeatedly tuned with an applied voltage at millisecond speeds. The technique involves the combination of liquid crystals in a polymer holographic host. Using this composite a nurnber of optical interconnect components, active solar filters, and other optical and fiber optic devices have been previously tested. The goal of the Phase I effort will be to demonstrate wide band tuning over at least three wavelength regions with diffraction efficiencies approaching 99 percent and near zero optical throughput losses. Multiple holographic film elements will be scanned at rates exceeding 100 Hz. In Phase II we will demonstrate a prototype multiple filter unit to be tested under realistic conditions. Commercialization issues will be explored with our partner Polaroid Corporation.",

        "abstract": "Inductive couplers are foreseen as an implement to modular design of advanced fuzes. Ferrite pot cores have been used for increased coupling efficiency, but are undesirable for use in hard target penetrator weapons due to their brittleness. Recently, magnetic ordering phenomena have been observed in a number of organic systems. These ferromagnetic polymers would seem to be an ideal choice as a binder for ferrite powders; however, these materials have yet to reach their full potential as magnetic systems due to the fact that the science of synthesis and post-processing of these materials is still in its infancy. Most of the ferromagnetic polymers discovered thus far exhibit magnetic interactions along the polymer backbone only; however, three-dimensional order is necessary to obtain the bulk magnetic properties desired. The Foster-Miller approach will develop novel orientation techniques which will result in permanent three-dimensional alignment of magnetic domains in ferromagnetic polymers. By controlling the morphology and chemistry of the most advanced ferromagnetic polymers, Foster-Miller will achieve an order of magnitude improvement in magnetic properties. In Phase I, Foster-Miller will work with California Institute of Technology (Prof. Dougherty - inventor of organic ferromagnets), and DuPont (Joel Miller - inventor of room temperature organometallic magnetic materials) to impart morphology control to most advanced ferromagnetic polymers to achieve lOX improvement in magnetic properties. In Phase II, we will team with KDI (a fuze manufacturer) to demonstrate a mechanically robust fuze with excellent magnetic properties.",

        "abstract": "The AVLB is a combat system employed in the assault phase of land operations to provide a means for rapid narrow gap crossing. This mission dictates that the AVLB often leads the way and hence can be subject to direct and indirect enemy fire. This fact suggests the minimization or total removal of the crew from this vehicle and the development of a remote operation system for it. The data required by the operator to ensure a successful bridge deployment is immense, including vehicle and AVLB status, vehicle location and orientation relative to the gap and gap profile. However, as the bandwidth of the operational radio fit of these vehicles precludes the use of standard video based remote control systems, a non-video based system must be developed. Foster-Miller proposes an animated graphics based remote control display system which minimizes the operator data overload possibilities by automating as many control functions as possible. This automation will minimize data flow rates and improve the efficiency of the operator in his primary role - providing a bridge for the assault forces to cross. Foster-Miller also offers an optional development of a near real-time \"snapshot still video\" as a means to enhance operator virtual presence at the bridging site.",

        "abstract": "Advanced composite materials are finding new applications in critical components of military and commercial equipment to exploit their synergistic properties. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor in real-time the integrity of critical composite components during the manufacturing processes. Accomplishing this task (producing high quality/reliable components) will reduce/eliminate the in-service catastrophic failures of the components. Additionally, manufacturing expendatures will be reduced due to a reduction in scrapped components and waste time and energy. Foster-Miller proposes a novel system consisting of advanced NDE sensors and related software to develop an \"expert\" manufacturing process. The concept employs magnetostrictive particles (sensors) embedded in a composite to detect the changes in magnetic signatures associated with the stress fields due to voids, cracks, holes, delaminations and thickness variations. Magnetic detectors can be used to monitor the magnetic signatures. In addition to the NDE sensors Foster-Miller will develop algorithms to collect, record, store and interpret the sensor signals. An \"expert\" system will be developed to make \"expert\" changes to the manufacturing process to increase product quality and reliability based on the sensor data. In summary, the Army will have developed an advanced technique to improve the quality and reliability of critical equipment such as composite gun barrels now under investigation; composite armor and outer skins on tanks and personnel carriers; and composite rotor blades on helicopters. Additionally, the Army will realize a savings on equipment acquisition due to reduced manufacturing costs.",

During Phase I, Foster-Miller will demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. We will review four development options: BPMBs made from an all-biodegradable polymer, copolymerization of biodegradable polymers, physical blends of two or more biodegradable polymers, and biodegradable polymers filled with inclusions of various hardnesses. We will select the most promising option and materials to compound and mold into test coupons and grind into blast media. The coupons will be tested for mechanical properties including toughness and hardness. The blast media will be analyzed for biodegradability and stripping efficiency.

NEUTRAL ANALOGS ARE OF SPECIAL INTEREST BECAUSE OF THEIR POSSIBLE ABILITY TO PENETRATE INTO CELLS BY PASSIVE DIFFUSION. THIS RESEARCH HAS TWO ASPECTS. THE FIRST ASPECT IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF SYNTHETIC METHODS FOR THE FACILE SYNTHESIS OF DEOXYOLOGONUCLEOTIDE ANALOGS BEARING A NEW NEUTRAL, ACHRIAL AND STABLE INTERNUCLEOTIDE ANALOG LINKAGE - NAMELY, FORMACETAL. SYNTHETIC METHODS WILL BE USED FOR THE IMPROVED SYNTHESIS OF FORMACETALS. PROMISING CHEMISTRIES WILL BE ADAPTED TO POLYMER BOUND SYNTHESIS. THE SECOND ASPECT FOCUSES ON THE IN VITRO HYBRIDIZATION OF THESE MODIFIED ANALOGS TOWARD COMPLEMENTARY RNA AND THEIR TRIPLEX FORMATION ABILITY WITH DUPLEX DNA. THE RNA INTERACTION WILL BE STUDIED BY CLASSICAL THERMAL DENATURATION EXPERIMENTS AND A NEW KINETIC ASSAY DESCRIBED IN THE PRELIMINARY DATA. THE COMBINED GOAL IS THE FACILE FOOT-PRINTING ASSAYS ON A NOVEL DNA TARGET REPORTED IN THE PRELIMINARY DATA.

RESEARCHERS HAVE DEPOSITED THE C70 LAYER WITH AN ION CLUSTER BEAM DEPOSITION PROCESS AND ACTIVATED THE LAYER WITH A MICROWAVE PLASMA METHOD. ENHANCED NUCLEATION OFFERS THE POTENTIAL FOR ENHACED GROWTH OF SUPERIOR ULTRATHIN DIAMOND COATINGS WITH A FINE-GRAIN STRUCTURE, WHICH ARE OF INTEREST FOR MANY APPLICATIONS REQUIRING EXCEPTIONAL MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND CHEMICAL INERTNESS. RECENTLY, DEVELOPMENT BY GINER, INC. WITH BORON-DOPED CONDUCTIVE DIAMOND FILMS HAS EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS OF DIAMOND-FILM TECHNOLOGY. WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE AN ALTERNATIVE ECONOMIC, SCALABLE METHOD FOR DEPOSITING A THIN C70 LAYER BY A SOLUTION-CASTING TECHNIQUES, FOLLOWED BY ELECTROCHEMICAL ACTIVITION OF THE C70. WE WILL INVESTIGATE THIS NOVEL DEPOSITION AND ACTIVATION METHOD FOR ENHANCING THE GROWTH OF CONDUCTIVE DIAMOND FILMS ON SELECT CONDUCTIVE SUBSTRATES. DURING PHASE I, WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE NATURE OF THE CHEMICAL STRUCTURE OF THE ELECTROCHEMICALLY ACTIVATED C70 LAYERS AND CORRELATE THE MORPHOLOGY TO THE PROPERTIES OF THE CONDUCTIVE DIAMOND LAYER. FORMATION OF SUPERIOR, PORE-FREE ULTRATHIN CONDUCTIVE DIAMOND FILMS WILL BE DEMONSTRATED THROUGH MEASUREMENT OF SURFACE AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND CORROSION RESISTANCE. FOLLOWING TESTING, ANY CHANGES IN FILM PROPERTIES WILL BE DETERMINED. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: FULLERENE-BASED, CONDUCTIVE DIAMOND FILMS ARE EXPECTED TO FIND APPLICATIONS IN MANY ELECTROLYTIC CELLS, ELECTRODES, AND AS BIPOLAR PLATES FOR LOW-TEMPERATURE (80-200OC) FUEL CELL SYSTEMS.

        "abstract": "An intelligent nonlinear control methodology, based on an innovative combination of feedback linearization and artificial neural networks, is to be adapted to control remotely piloted helicopters. A mapping is derived which transforms a nonlinear dynamic model of the plant into a linear, time invariant space. A single point linear controller design is then carried out in this linear space. The derived control is then mapped back into the nonlinear space using an inverse transformation. An artifical neural network can be trained prior to flight to realize the inverse mapping in real time. A second network can be trained in flight to learn, and correct for, the vehicle characteristics not captured in the dynaic model used to derive the control. The feasibility and value of this approach is to be demonstrated by evaluation of a controller design for the current US Army/NASA X-Cell model-scale helicopter using a high fidelity dynamic simulation. The design will include optional position feedback loops which can be used to track a prescribed trajectory. Once the computational burden of the control algorithm has been quantified, conceptual design of flight worthy hardware will begin.

The ability to measure gas mask leak rates will greatly enhance chemical warfare training effectiveness, thereby increasing the level of protection that gas masks provide. The proposed system will also provide a sound basis for proper gas mask selection and issue. A new method for measuring leakage rates into industrial respirators has been developed. The method employs a controlled negative pressure (CNP) technique to eliminate many of the problems associated with systems based on the use of aerosol challenge agents, and is significantly faster and more precise. The objectives for Phase I are to conduct a comprehensive review of technologies that can be applied to the mask leak measurement problem. A specific set of criteria will be used to analyze advantages and limitations of each identified technology relative to the CNP concept. Information needed to define an acceptable leak criterion for gas masks will also be identified during Phase I. The product of Phase I research will provide a comprehensive basis for evaluating and selecting the most cost-effective system for measuring gas mask leakage.",

        "abstract": "With the advent of cytokine therapy, thrombocytopenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity of anti-cancer and anti-AIDS drugs. Early screening of developmental agents for toxicity to hematopoietic, particularly megakaryocytic, progenitors would allow the selection of drugs that are effective against tumor or virus, but are not toxic. Current clonogenic assays for human megakaryocyte progenitors (CFU-Meg) are hampered by a non-specific staining procedure and a requirement for human AB plasma. We will attempt, firstly, changes in the staining methodology and secondly, development of serum- and protein-free conditions. Serum-and protein-free assays can better model in vivo conditions by addition of physiological concentrations of human drug-binding proteins (i. e., human albumin, y-globulin, etc.). An alternative to clonogenic assays will also be investigated. This approach will use flow cytometry to measure changes in the total number of megakaryocytes growing in liquid culture. The use of flow cytometry to measure progenitor differentiation would be of significant advantage over traditional clonogenic assays because of the simple labeling procedures, thequantitative and objective nature of the measurement and the potential for obtaining results sooner the 12-14 days required for a human CFU-Meg assay. Simple, standardized assays for human megakaryocyte progenitors may assist physicians in determining the number of progenitors necessary for successful bone marrow and/or peripheral blood transplants.",

THE OBJECTIVE IS TO DEMONSTRATE BIOLOGICAL IMAGES WITH A NEW TYPE OF SOFT X-RAY MICROSCOPE OF A NOVEL AND VERY SIMPLE DESIGN. THE GEOMETRY OF THE MICROSCOPE IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE FIELD EMISSION MICROSCOPE. INSTEAD OF USING A SOLID EMITTER, THE INSTRUMENT USES A SPECIAL CONE-LIKE, HOLLOW EMITTER. THE SPECIMEN TO BE EXAMINED IS PLACED INSIDE THE EMITTER TIP. SOFT X-RAYS ARE BEAMED THROUGH THE SPECIMEN AND ONTO THE HEMISPHERICAL EMITTER TIP MEMRANE. THE TIP MEMBRANE IS TRANSPARENT TO X-RAYS AND IS COATED WITH A HIGH EFFICIENCY PHOTOEMITTER. PHOTOELECTRONS ARE LIBERATED INTO THE VACUUM, OUTSIDE THE EMITTER TIP, IN A PATTERN CORRESPONDING TO THE X-RAY ABSORPTION OF THE SPECIMEN (CONTACT IMAGE). THE PHOTOELECTRONS ARE ACCELERATED RADIALLY TO A DETECTOR BY A HIGH VOLTAGE ON THE EMITTER. A MAGNIFIED, HIGH RESOLUTION, REAL-TIME IMAGE RESULTS. THIS INSTRUMENT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR VALUABLE USE IN BIOMEDICINE. SPECIMENS CAN REMAIN WET, UNSTAINED, AND UNSECTIONED. THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED WITH HARDER X-RAYS.

        "abstract": "In Phase I of DARP MIMIC program, Hittite Microwave Corporation, in co-operation with Harry Diamond Laboratories, has developed a GaAs MMIC chip which performs complete RF functions of an FM-CW radar designed for proximity fuze applications in Army's Multi-Option Fuze for Artillery (MOFA). The RF package for this fuze is a miniature IC package measuring .25\" x .25\" x .09\". The RF assembly integrated with a single-patch antenna is about the size of a five-cent coin. This MMIC radar consumes .9 to 1.25 watts of DC power. In Phase 2 of the MIMIC program, Hittite has a task of developing a smaller and lower-cost chip which consumes much less DC power for fuzing applications in small munitions. MMIC processes based on enhancement/depletion-mode MESFET and hetero-junction bipolar transistor (HBT) devices are becoming available as stabilized production processes. These new device technologies will be utilized to develop lower cost, less power hungry radar MMIC with added performance capabilities. In addition to the basic radar function, the new radar chips to be developed in this program will incorporate ECM-resistance and HPM protection capabilities. The MMIC functions to be developed for these added capabilities are: advanced modulation and demodulation circuits and self-activated switch/attenuator used as a limiter. The proposed Phase I study will lead to design, simulation, performance analysis, and preliminary layout of the low-cost, low-power MMIC radar chip with added jam/burn-out resistance capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Stirling Power systems have the potential to provide enabling technology for solar system exploration space science missions because of their relatively high efficiency and low mass. There is a need for a 2 watt electrical output power source for Martian weather stations and other applications. Radioisotopes are the only feasible heat source. The General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) is oversized because its minimal output is 250 thermal watts. The Radioisotope Heating Unit (RHU) supplies 1.1 thermal watts for heating of electronics, and is capable of operation at 500 degrees C. This heat source temperature is well-suited for small power level stirling engines; the number of RHUs needed depends on the desired output power. Stirling Technology (STC) proposes to design a Stirling power converter with an output of two electrical watts. The innovative work is based on 5 watt and 11.7 watt output engines previously developed at STC, but requires novel displacer support and alternator configuration.",

        "abstract": "In 1984, the United States had the lowest tuberculosis infection rate in modern history. In 1985, TB incidence started rising and has continued to rise. Additionally, TB resistance to drugs has increased, from 10 percent in the early 1980's to 23 percent in 1991 for one standard drug and from 3 percent to 7 percent for multi-drug-resistant TB. Current identification procedures utilize growth and enzymatic tests to distinguish between bacterial genera and species. These tests can add several weeks of uncertainty onto the time needed to culture colonies to testable sizes and fully identify the microbial species when tuberculosis related. This delay may be crucial for treatment regimens needed for drug resistant strains. Mycolic acids in the cell walls of mycobacteria have been shown to be indicative of individual species. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is a useful analytical method for obtaining distinct chromatographic patterns of these acids. Pattern recognition methods have been applied to develop 100% accurate classification models for 188 samples of 8 mycobacteria species. We propose to extend these models to identify 36 species. Preliminary indications are that this approach is as fast as genetic probes after colony growth at 1/4 of the cost, or less.",

Due to the inherent side-effects of sedative-hyponotics there are many times when they cannot be used such as in-flight sleep during long hauls. Recently, significant strides may have been made in the nonpharmacological treatment of insominia that may be of use in inducing and maintaining higher quality sleep than might otherwise be obtained under common stressful or adverse military conditions. Phase I will measure the quality and quantity of sleep obtained by crew chiefs on KC-10 aircraft via Medilog recordings. Actilume data will be obtained for the might preceeding the mission through three nights post completion and sleep logs will be kept. Crew chiefs will undergo three different prototype \"sleep training\" regimes using nonpharmacological insomnia treatment techniques including a new 3-D \"Virtual Reality\" audio technology delivered via ordinary tapeplayer and headphones. A repeated measures design using the same Medilog/Actilume protocol will evaluate effectiveness both on in-flight sleep and potential impact on sleep disrupted by circadian dysrhythn associated with long distance transmeridian flight.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this proposal is to develop an ultrasonic technique for the measurement of the thickness of thin films in an integrated circuit manufacturing environment. Our approach is to use ultrasound in the regime where the wavelength is comparable to that of light; that is in the frequency range of 1-10 GHz. In this range, it will be possible to measure the thickness of very thin and opaque films. Also, because the mechanical impedances of materials vary significantly more than their dielectric constants, we expect to be able to measure the individual thicknesses of layered thin films. An XY scan will be made to generate film thickness contour map of the wafer. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: This project will demonstrate the feasbility of a technique which can be developed into a commercial thin/thick film thickness measurement system. Economical, quantitative, simple, inexpensive, and nonrestrictive measurements of the thickness of transparent and opaque, simple and multiple films, will have a great impact on the cost and quality control of thin film deposition in an integrated circuits manufacturing environment.",

        "abstract": "Intelligent Reasoning Systems (IRS) is developing an integrated active vision system (AVS) based on design principles derived from experimental analysis of mammalian visual systems. The AVS design is based on a asynchronous analog encoding of location and motion data, and a custom VLSI Hybrid Temporal Processing Element (HTPE) develped by and available soley to IRS (patent pending). The HPTE can operate on analog data at frequencies in excess of 100 MHz, allowing rapid oversampling methods to be used for resolution enhancement, motion detection, and multiple-template matching. HTPEs have low device count and power dissipation, and can be fabricated in small layout areas. The AVS is intended for eventual on-board application in robots, intelligent machine tools, and other autonomous sensory-motor systems that require visible, IR, or similar input. The initial step in visual processing is the collection of data from the primary sensor. The goal of this Phase I proposal is to evaluate the feasibility of a silicon retina for the AVS based on the HTPE,and to investigate various methods for achieving sub-pixel resolution and enhance motion sensitivity with such a retina.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the proposed multi-phase program is to develop and commercialize MEMCAD, a family of computer-aided design (CAD) tools to assist in the design and manufacture of microelectromechanical (MEM) structures. MEMCAD tools should drastically reduce the development time and cost for MEM devices, resulting in more devices being available at lower prices. Developers of MEM devices such as microsensors and microactuators rely on trial-and-error methods in laboratories to develop new devices. This significant cost of prototype development is now reflected in the high prices which the Navy and others must pay for these devices. MEMCAD integrates simulators, databases, and solid modeling tools into a system which mimics the fabrication and performance of microstructures, allowing a desinger to conceptualize, simulate, and iterate the micromachining fabrication process on a workstation, thus making MEM devices more affordable. The first prototype of the MEMCAD family of tools, referred to as MEMCAD_p (MEMCAD for pressure sensors), is expected to provide the core technology for the development of additional MEMCAD tools for other sensors and microstructures, including eventually integrated circuits.",

        "abstract": "Data links are considered to be of major importance for the Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) in its role as a reconnaissance/surveillance platform. Secure, reliable and timely data communication will increase the acceptance of UAVs in the military community. The large amount of communication data needed for video images together with jamming-resistant overhead techniques may not permit timely transmission of images. Thus data compression techniques are needed. This proposal intends to investigate a data compression concept named Walsh Neural Network Unmanned Vehicle Image Transmission (WALNUT) based on vector quantization techniques. Vector quantization (VQ) is emerging as a leading and powerful data compression technique because of its ability to utilize peraceptually meaningful nonlinear correlation techniques. Competitive learning based on neural network (NN) technology applied to VQ brings effective adaptation to motion and scene changes and superior performance needed for near real time compression of image sequences obtained from UAVs operating in a military environment. Such a system has the potential of providing: (1) Economical quantization of pixel information, (2) fast compression and expansion techniques, and (3) protection against channel noise and jamming. In addition VQ with NN learning also inherently maps into parallel computing design makeing possible an even greater data communication speedup.",

Such pressure measurements are critical for proper control of operating parameters in aeronautical propulsion systems, rockets and materials processing. Silicon pressure transducers, which have found extensive use in the aerospace industry, are inoperative above 600 degrees Celsius due to the unstable mechanical properties of silicon at those temperatures, and are unable to monitor pressure in the hot sections of aircraft engines. We, at Kulite, have initiated a program to develop ultra-high temperature pressure transducers using high temperature semiconductors, namely SiC and Diamond, as sensing elements. The program involves characterization of the materials, development of processing methods and most importantly, the demonstration of a prototype sensor capable of operation at temperatures up to 800 degrees Celsius.

Because these methodologies exploit a priori knowledge of a limited number of target models, while allowing the targets to be oriented towards the viewer in any arbitrary fashion, they result in a powerful ATR system. The central focus of this proposal is on building an automatic target recognition system for identifying mobile targets using an object-image alignment approach. Using this approach, we propose to develop a two stage recognition algorithm. The first stage of this algorithm makes use of the three-point object-image correspondence theorim of Huttenlocher and Ullman (1990) to narrow the search for constrained matching of object-image pairs. The second stage of the algorithm uses the mean-field annealing techique to compute the object-image transformation parameters from multiple matches by minimizing a least-squares measure. For segmentation of the target from its background, we employ a motion-based segmentation algorithm developed earlier by LNK.",

Leonard Associates will use a unique approach to characterizing core, face sheet, an adhesive separately to determine their tolerances before testinsg them in combination. By testinsg and evaluating individual performance, Leonard Associates will seek to discover the most effective synergistic combination to resist moisture ingression and absorption and maximize resistance to low velocity impact damage.

        "abstract": "The study of a method of imaging through thick turbulent layers using extended sources is proposed. The method uses the technique of phase diversity to generate multiple images of the source in multiple focal planes. A parametric description of the turbulent distortion and the source is found by a multidimensional fit of the data to a model of the turbulent distortion and the extended source. The phase diversity method simultaneously solves for the phase distortion (as a function of look angle) and the source distribution. In addition to the estimate of the source, the informatin can be fed back into an adaptive optics control system. The phase distortion can be parameterized in the pupil plane as a function of look angle or in a layered model where the layers sit at different distances from the pupil. Either model lends itself to estimation of the correcting phase to be applied at each element of a multi-conjugate adaptive optics system that corrects for anisoplanatic distortion. This method has application to imaging systems with synthetic beacons and passive systems that only use ambient light.",

The excellent cycle life and specific energy (e.g. 200 deep cycles at 165 Whr/Kg), wide operating temperature range, low self-discharge rate and ruggedness make the Li/CuCl*2* system particularly attractive for such an application. The approach in Phase I will be to characterize the low temperature 1.1 mA/cm^2 continuous discharge and 10-50 mA/cm^2 pulse discharge performance of 80 mAhr size laboratory cells at 23, -20 and -55 degrees C and then to evaluate the performance again after a number of innovative improvements to the positive electrode, electrolyte and cell design. Innovations that will receive particular emphasis will include reducing the particle size of the positive electrode active materials and conductive additives, modifying the crystal structure or purity of the active material and changing the electrolyte salt and adding volatile cosolvents.

A requirement exists for an automated tool which will gather and organize information, facilitate documentation of alternative concepts, tie the components of these alternatives to other information, and support prioritizing these concepts. LGA has developed an approach to automated planning for R&D organizations, called the Roadmap Information Management System (RIMS). RIMS provides graphical and hierarchical representations of user-defined concepts called Concept Roadmaps. The Concept Roadmaps permit decision makers to document current capabilities, goal capabilities, and subgoals that have to be accomplished to reach the goal. Alternative concepts are represented either as \"alternate paths\" in a single Roadmap or in separate Concept Roadmaps within a single roadmap set. Concept Roadmaps are tied to a database containing other decision-related information. We are proposing to modify the approach used for RIMS to support the additional requirements identified for military acquisition decision support. The proposed Military Acquisition Decision Support System (MADSS) will consist of Concept Roadmaps and linked databases augmented with expert systems to assist in setting priorities and deciding among alternatives.",

Prior research on the determinants of leader performance indicates that metacognitive skills, such as problem construction and integration, have a marked impact on people's ability to solve complex, ambiguous problems. In the effort proposed herein, the literature on cognitive processes and cognitive development in adulthood will be used to construct a model describing how metacognitive skills influence (1) the development of viable knowledge structures and (2) effective processing of knowledge in problem solving. This model will then be used to identify potential measures of each of these metacognitive skills, and automated measures of certain crucial skills will be developed. The reliability and validity of these measures will then be established in a pilot study. Additionally, this model will be used to identify interventions that might accelerate skills development. A set of self-paced, computer-interactive training programs will then be constructed, and their influence on effective application of metacognitive skills in problem solving will be assessed.

Some of this wasted energy could be utilized to synthesize exotic materials which have useful commercial applications. In order to utilize this wasted energy to synthesize new and exotic materials, specialty chambers and equipment are needed. This program will review previous efforts to create new material using HELs and other laser synthesis, define the possible methodologies to create exotic new material using HELs, design possible e)cperiments and perform preliminary design for experimental chambers and equipment needed to utilize the waste HEL to synthesize, select materials that have commercial markets. An additional variation is to retrofit existing reaction chamber(s) for scouting experiments to demonstrate the viability of using HELs to synthesize exotic materials including fullerenes and collect data for the design of the equipment that will subsequently be designed and fabricated.",

Such a system is expected to improve the efficacy of oxygen delivery to the patient, maintain metabolic levels with more precision than the manually-controlled system, and provide for automatic weaning of extracorporeal support as patient condition improves. Prolonged extracorporeal life support currently requires continuous supervision in the intensive care unit by a specially-trained technician.

The heart of the technology is the use of polytetrafluoroethylene (TFE .1u pore size) ultrafiltration membrane wound in a spiral design to maximize maximize packing density by selecting proper element materials and leaf lengths. One can engineer a spiral wound ultrafiltration element that will be small and light-weight, yet produce proper volumes of ultraclean fuel across the temperature and engine horsepower ranges the Navy needs. The membrane material, TFE will remove all bacteria, solids greater than .1u and free the entrained water to produce the quality heavy fuels demanded by the close tolerances of the high speed direct fuel injectors intendcd for these engines. Although the spiral wound elements will be operated in dead-end mode, the spiral wound design and the TFE membrane allows them to be cleaned in a cross-flow manner or unwound, wiped off and rerolled for reuse.",

RHIS is a new diagnostic technique combining the three dimensional capabilities of holography, the plase sensitivity of interferometry, and the species selectivity of spectroscopy. An arcjet apparatus capable of generating readily variable plasma conditions with temperatures up to 4500K and gas velocities of up to Mach 4 will provide the Phase I testing environment. In addition to ion composition, the RHIS diagnostic has the potential to measure such parameters as temperaature, pressure, velocity, density, mas flus, and electron density. This proposal outlines work to characterize the feasibility of RHIS as a new diagnostic for high temperature plasmas.

To avoid the presence of potentially harmful objects in the inlet path, the proposed system must have a long range with the transmitter and the receiver remaining outside the specified 12 foot duct. The proposed system includes a laser sheet that can be focused to the required waist dimensions anywhere along the duct. The light scattered by droplets crossing the center of the focused sheet is collected by a receiver that tracks the waist position. Several schemes to locate the center of the laser sheet and avoid Gaussian ambiguity will be evaluated.

THESE TASKS RANGE FROM EVALUATION OF SIMPLE ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS TO THE SOLUTION OF SYSTEMS OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS, AND INCLUDE VIRTUALLY ANY KND OF COMPUTATIONAL TASK. A COMPUTATIONAL NODE GENERALLY HAS THE CAPABILITY OF CARRYING OUT A SINGLE WELL DEFINED COMPUTATIONAL TASK; THEY MAY BECOME MORE COMPLEX HOWEVER, AND IN FACT NODES MAY EVEN INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OTHER NODES. OTHER TYPES OF NODES MAY ACT AS DATA SOURCES (E. G. KEYBOARD OR FILE INPUT OF DATA) OR MAY SIMPLY HAVE THE RESPONSIBIITY OF GENERATING TABULAR OR GRAPHICAL DISPLAYS. USERS MAY INTERACTIVELY DEFINE, TEST, AND INTERCONNECT NODES TO CONSTRUCT MODELS OF ARBITRARY COMPLEXITY. THE MMSCE REPRESENTS AN INNOVATIVE, NEW APPROACH TO SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL OF ALLOWING THE HEALTH SCIENCE RESEARCHER, AND SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS IN GENERAL, TO PERFORM DATA ANALYSIS AND EXPLORE MODEL BEHAVIOR THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE IMPOSSIBLE. THE MMSCE, AS A TOOL FOR SCIENTISTS, IS ANALOGOUS TO THE SPREADSHEET FOR THE BUSINESS PERSON OR THE WORD PROCESSOR FOR THE WRITER.",

        "abstract": "The aim is to evaluate a novel technology for testing the susceptibility of prokaryotes to certain antibiotics. Our goal is to develop rapid antibiotic susceptibility tests for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other pathogens. The technology will rapidly detect growth of resistant bacteria challenged with antibiotics in pure of mixed cultures, using oligonucleotide probes for two RNA targets: ribosomal RNA precursors (pre-rRNA), and mature ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Cellular copy number of pre-rRNA sequences are very sensitive to rifampicin, declining rapidly upon exposure from high to undetectable levels. By probing for these sequences in cells challenged briefly with rifampicin, it will be possible to detect growing (resistant) cells in a single measurement. Mature rRNA has species-specific sequences useful for detection of bacteria in mixed cultures containing other species. Probes for mature rRNA will be combined with probes for pre-rRNA in a rapid, sensitive, easy-to-use assay that simultaneously identifies bacterial species in primary enrichment cultures and determines their susceptibility to rifampicin and other antibiotics. Such a test would predict the outcome of antibiotic treatment much more rapidly and accurately than conventional tests. In Phase I, we will test the feasibility of the concept using a fast-growing, well characterized bacterium, Escherichia coli. Experiments will focus initially on resistance to rifampicin, one of the \"first-line\" antibiotics for treatment of tuberculosis, and then on other antibiotics. In Phase II, we will transfer the technology to the more challenging Mycobacterium tuberculosis system. Ultimately, we will apply the technology to other clinically important microorganisms as well.",

        "abstract": "A common requirement of missile delivery systems is an ECM resistant, all- weather, day/night capability. The all-weather, day/night requirement leads to millimeter waves as a reasonable solution. The current proliferation of ARM devices favors passive rather than active modes. An analytical Model of the passive scenario predicts that atmospheric attenuation is not an important consideration, and essentially equivalent performance can be obtained over the entire spectrum from 30 to 140 GHz. The operational availability of the full millimeter wave spectrum for radiometric solutions to tactical weapon sensor requirements, represents a new dimension of opportunity. Other equally important sensor system implications are predicted by the analytical Model. Many have a direct bearing on capabilities of interest to the Air Force Armament Directorate, Eglin AFB. Verification of Model predictions is an important first step. The Phase I Work Plan addresses both the requirements and methods for verification by direct measurement. Active participation by the research staff of the Armament Directorate, Eglin AFB is needed in order to realize the full potential of this effort, by focusing the direction of this investigation on Air Force missions and their future tactical weapon sensor requirements.",

The proposed effort will extend this single-band monolithic technology to dual-band FPAs. The effort will determine the best dual-band unit cell in either a tandem or adjacent configuration using HgCdTe for the MWIR and either HgCdTe or AlGaAs quantum wells for the LWIR. R/O design will share charge between the unit cell capacitors and columns to increase signal-to-noise but yet maintain a small cell. The effort will plan experiments for processing the R/Os and detectors and for growing and fabricating detectors on GaAs/Si.

Our approach is to formulate initial guidelines, develop and test a set of small-to-medium WAVES/VHDL examples, test the set, and derive confirmed guidelines from the results of this testing. We are able to propose this Phase l example testing due to (1) an existing WAVES/VHDL design environment and (2) a set of examples by which to test the guidelines we develop. Specifically, our objectives are to (1) develop the example set, (2) use the example testing to demonstrate the utility of WAVES/VHDL guidelines and usage practices, and (3) recommend and distribute the guidelines and usage practices. The marriage of WAVES and VHDL in this effective design and test paradigm will be a significant enhancement to design practices across the industry. We will encourage use of, and obtain feedback upon, the guidelines through an organized contact, distribution, and follow-up program with industrial and government users. This will cultivate an acceptance of the guidelines even as they are being formulated, which will continue into the Phase II effort.

This approach can be applied to acoustic, electromagnetic and communication signals to extend recognition/cIassification capabilities beyond traditional linear time/frequency domains and reduce false alarm rates. The proposed techniques\\' utility/povver will be demonstrated by deteiled analytical derivations, computer simulations, and test results on acoustic end radar data representing detection/classification tasks of interest to the Navy. MultiSpec has considerable experience with nonlinear and/or nonstationary analysis of real data in areas of importance for the Navy. UItra-wideband radar is enhanced when converted into a system identification task and higher-order signal analysis tools are used for target characterization. Data from ultra-vvideband radar discrimination experiments using targets of metal, clutter, and radar absorbent materials are shown in terms of bispectra and nonlinear kernels. Theory, simulations, and actual results from underwater acoustic data shovv the achievable with our new techniques for nonstationary analysis of transient signals.",

Enhancements in storage will continue to lag microprocessor advances for years to come. Nanotronics, Inc. has initiated a research effort that promises to change the paradigm in mass storage, thereby enabling up to 100 times improvement in planar surface storage capacity with concurrent increases in data transfer rate. Nanotronics has developed enhanced deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymers that will absorb excitation light energy at a single wavelength and re-emit predetermined multiple wavelengths, all occurring at ambient temperatures. By emitting spectra rather than binary on/off bits, the data word size is increased significantly and parallel access is enabled. Data will be stored in the molecular structure of synthetic DNA, bringing true nanotechnology to science and industry. The diffraction limit of current optical storage systems will be circumvented because data bits per unit area will increase with the number of distinguishable pre-programmed wavelengths. Thus^ wavelength is the third dimension for this optical data storage scheme. Furthermore, a four-dimensional secondary storage scheme may be possible by adding a third spatial dimension that would further multiply the storage density. ^'^",

A major constraint imposed by confromal/internal carriage is a limitation on the maximum stowable fin span of a weapon. Current aircraft such as the F-117 and future aircraft such as the F-22 are designed with internal carriage capability, but current weapons systems such as the Sidewinder and AMRAAM require modifications to meet these carriage requirements. Design or re-design of weapon airframes requires an extensive expenditure of labor and funds. Missile engineers can not simply reduce the span of missile fins without incurring potentially detrimental changes in the aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle. Nielsen Engineering & Research (NEAR) proposes to develop an innovative design tool employing combined numerical optimization/aerodynamic prediction techniques for the optimal aerodynamic design of missile fins with geometric constraints such as those imposed by conformal/internal carriage and constraints set by actuator torque limits. This advanced optimization-based design tool will reduce the development time and costs associated with missile fin design or redesign.",

Besides decreased image tube life, bulkiness, and additional weight, the performance and safety of such systems is considered marginal. Night Vision Corporation (NVC) has developed a unique approach to incorporate symbology within the optical train of a night vision device with much greater potential. We are proposing the insertion of a transparent LCD at the output side of the tabe which can provide a multi-color display. This approach also allows for a relatively simple image fusion of intensified and HUD projected scenes.

The x-ray film and post examination film development are eliminated. The spatial resolution or pixel sizes less than 30 x 30 micron2 is achievable. The detector can have high sensitivity and excellent quantum efficiency which could approach 100% for 15 to 20 keV x-rays reducing the patient dose rate significantly. It has excellent linear response within the wide dynamic range which is expected to be equal to or greater than 1,000, and it has a good potential for large area sensor fabrication. Signal-to-noise ratio greater than 20 can be achieved for detecting 20 keV x-ray photons. Exposure times of equal to or less than 0.6 seconds should be achievable with the current x-ray sources. It could have fast instantaneous imaging capability, which is important for radiotherapy, biopsy, surgery and fine needle aspiration procedures. The mammography system can be designed with stereoscopic imaging capability. Computer based data acquisition allows post examination image processing and enhancement. Phase I involves the design, assembly and testing of a small desktop prototype mammography system and theoretical analysis to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed design.

Currently, no materials and processing technology simultaneously meet all the requirements for practical holographic device applications. It seems advantageous to selectively optimize the promising materials for particular applications. We propose to synthesize high performance photorefractive films of BaTi03, LiNb03, and GaAs by an innovative plasma-enhanced metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (PE-MOCVD) process, with the emphasis on BaTi03 in Phase I. The three material systems are chosen because they have the highest figures of merit (diffraction efficiency, long storage time, and sensitivity, respectively) for different holographic applications. Effective processing technologies will also be developed to substantially improve the weakness of each materials, e.g. increasing the sensitivity of the ferroelectrics by methods of transition-metal doping and chemical reduction; increasing the diffraction efficiency of semiconductor through the growth of quantum well structures. PE-MOCVD is ideal for holographic device fabrication due to its high growth rate, large-area, and low temperature processing capabilities. Moreover, the PE-MOCVD offers the potential for monolithic or hybrid-processing compatibility with OEIC device technology. Phase I addresses the heteroepitaxial growth of optical quality BaTiO3 films for holographic applications.",

THIS PROPOSAL DESCRIBES A TECHNICAL APPROACH WHICH WILL OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS AND ALLOW FABRICATION OF LASERS WITH MODULATION BANDWIDTHS WELL BEYOND 25 GHz. THE APPROACH TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE SMALLER DIMENSIONS OF VERTICAL CAVITY SURFACE EMITTING LASERS (VCSELs) WHICH RESULT IN INCREASED RELAXATION OSCILLATION FREQUENCY AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED DAMPING OF THE RESPONSE. THESE LIMITATIONS IN VCSELs ARE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED OVER THOSE IN IN-PLANE LASERS. A RESONANCE FREQUENCY PER SQUARE ROOT COEFFICIENT OF 7.6 GHz PER SQUARE ROOT MILLIWATT HAS BEEN DETERMINED USING RELATIVE INTENSITY NOISE MEASUREMENTS, AND A MAXIMUM RELAXATION OSCILLATION FREQUENCY OF 71 GHz WAS OBSERVED BY STREAK CAMERA MEASUREMENTS, ON AN 8 MICROMETER SQUARE VCSEL.

        "abstract": "Solicitation AF93-035 requires the development of innovative concepts for increasing the warfighting capabilities of the Air Force command, control, communications and intelligence (C3I) investigation. The proposed effort addresses the establishment of planar (N4) and volume (N5) \"smart\" global (multi-dimensional) optical interconnects for digital optoelectronic computing hardware. The purpose of the program is to define, develop, and map C3I algorithms and related subroutines into 4-dimensional optical interconnects. Once mapped efficiently, these optical interconnect configurations are to be incorporated into 2-dimensional planar holographic optical interconnect (hardware) elements (HOIEs). Ultimately, reconfigurable 3-dimensional volume holographic optical interconnects elements (V-HOIEs) for N5 \"smart\" optical interconnects will be incorporated into the final design. By implementing \"smart\" pixel technology coupled with free space global optical interconnects, two primary objectives will be accomplished. The first objective is to generate algorithms and subroutines for mapping into 2D arrays (32 x 32) of thin planar holographic optical interconnects (HOIE) as well as the HOIE hardware technology required. This HOIE program will be leveraged with current 2-D GaAs DANE (detection, amplification negation and emission) technology. The second objective is to focus on a 3D volume interconnect technology for reprogrammable N5 topologies.",

Displays would be shown in layers so that timing could be analyzed at different levels, from the top-level system processes down to the subroutine level. Processor loading also would be displayed. The collected timing data would be replayed at an operator-selected speed to aid in understanding. Static graphs of cumulative statistics, such as average execution time, would also be provided. In this method, the decoupling of the display of the timing data from its collection would not only permit the replay to be done at a selectable speed, but also would be a key factor in minimizing the effort required to evaluate real-time software performance on different target hardware.",

        "abstract": "Intruder detection using a mobile platform with multiple sensor suites is difficult because of the ever-changing warehouse environments in which the robots operate. Doppler shifts caused by platform motion or intruder motion also add to the problem. ORINCON proposes a novel approach to intruder detection that uses a statistical differencing technique on multiple-sensor-suite digitized snapshots at preprograumied locations in the environment. Image differencing of digitized video camera frames has been used successfully in industry to detect intruders by detecting changes in the background from frame to frame. ORINCON takes this notion a step further. First, during initialization, a robot takes several digitized sensor snapshot measurements along a preprogrammed path and stores the data and the measurement locations. On subsequent path passes, the snapshot measurements-taken at the same locations-are compared to the initialization measurements by differencing. If \"significant\" discrepancies exist, then an intruder detection is determined to have occurred. If not, then the most recent snapshot is stored for the next pass. The main thrust of the proposed work will be to determine what \"significant\" discrepancies are and how they are related to probability of detection and probability of false alarm.",

        "abstract": "A novel class of postaglandin F2-like compounds formed in vitro or in vivo by a free-radical catalyzed noncyclocxygenase mechanism have recently been discovered. For normal humans. Levels of these compounds (called F2-isoprostanes) range from 5-50 pg/ml plasma and 500-3000 pg/ml urinary creatinine, respectively. The in vivo concentration of F2-isoprostances have been shown to increase dramatically in animal models of free-radical induced lipid peroxidation. Although the potential role(s) of isoprostanes in the pathophysiology of human diseases remain to be determined, preliminary evidence strongly suggests that measurement of isoprostane concentrations may have significant diagnostic potential for the assessment of oxidative stress and in specific disorders such as hepatorenal syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and carcinogenesis. Isoprostances have, thus far, been detected by mass spectrometry. However, this is an expensive method that is not well suited for routine clinical determinations. In contrast, immunoassay is an established clinical procedure that is well suited for the detection of small amounts of specific fatty acid derivatives. The ultimate goal is the development of sensitive and specific immunoassays for isoprostanes that will facilitate (a) investigations of the physiologic and pathophysiologic roles of these compounds and (b) clinical assessment of oxidative status.",

Availability of specific antibodies will greatly facilitate studies of polymorphisms, species and tissue distribution of drug metabolizing enzymes, and the role of individual enzymes in the metabolism of endogenous and xenobiotic chemicals. Widespread availability of specific antibodies will overcome current limitations. Some of these limitations include restricted access to antibodies, differences in specificity between preparations, and lack of specificity for many antibodies. We have already developed several goat antibodies directed against rabbit cytochromes P450; antibodies specific for prostaglandin H synthase, including anti-peptide antibodies specific for the recently discovered mitogen inducible PGHS-2, may exhibit a different spectrum of xenobiotic activation than PGHS-1. We are currently developing anti-peptide antibodies specific for mammalian lipoxygenases, which are also implicated in xenobiotic metabolism. However, we are well aware of the primary need for additional antibodies specific for P450 isoforms. We will therefore: (a) acquire available form-specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies by licensing form academic laboratories where possible, (b) to develop a series of anti-peptide antibodies and recombinant protein standards to the major P450 isoforms, and (c) to extensively characterize the specificity and reactivity of these antibodies in standard assays.",

This technique works from the ultraviolet to the millimeter spectral region. It is most applicable in the infrared spectral band for measuring the spectrum of missile and aircraft plums. However, it is also applicable for other purposes such as measuring biological and gas warfare. It can be used in missile seekers, missile warning system, (both tactical and strategic), as a means of identifying non-cooperative targets and also can be used for identifying friend or foe. Pacific Advanced Technology has invented a technique for performing multi-color imaging using staring arrays. This technique not only enables a sensor to measure multi-color, it provides the capability to measure the fine spectral signatures of targets with a resolution of less than 0.01 um in the mid infrared spectral region.

It is this subset of patients that stand to benefit from new therapies designed to neutralize endotoxin such as anti-lipid A monoclonal antibodies (e. g. E5 or HA-1A) and bacterial permeability inducing protein (BPI). Because of the enormous cost of these therapies we plan to develop a simple, sensitive test for early detection of Gram negative bacteremia. Our hypothesis is that conserved regions exist in certain genes of Gram negative bacteria that can serve as targets for rapid and sensitive diagnosis of these lethal pathogens. Preliminary data suggest that there are in fact highly conserved regions that can be used to design PCR primers for detection of small numbers of bacteria. Phase I goals will refine the use of this test by determining the sensitivity and specificity using a large set of clinical bacterial isolates from various body fluids. Evaluation of the test in a field trial in suspected septic patients will be carried out in Phase II. Introduction of this test into clinical practice should save millions of dollars spent on the unnecessary use of new and very expensive therapies for gram negative sepsis.",

It has been shown by a number of researchers that hyperthermia (HT), less than 45 degrees centigrade, has a strong synergistic effect in combination with PDT. This synergism appears to be maximized when the HT is given concurrently with PDT instead of sequentially. It has also been shown that the local hyperthermia condition can be produced by a near infrared laser, Nd:YAG or AlGaAs diodes, through the same delivery systems used for PDT. This has been referred to as Laser Hyperthermia, or LHT. It is our objective to develop an integrated LHT-PDT delivery system with a common computer-based control and monitoring system. The system will allow for use of pre-existing lasers, both HT and PDT, which are delivered to the system via fiberoptic cables. Each laser is to be individually controlled and combined into a single optical delivery fiber. The control system is to be based on a PC compatible computer and will provide active control of the LHT and PDT power levels, treatment intervals, monitoring and display of eight temperatures and four light intensity levels, tissue temperature stabilization, light dosimetry, and display the information in a user friendly manner.

Material selection, fabrication processes, quality control, allowable cyclic stress, dynamic behavior, mounting provisions, alignment processes, radial/axial stiffness, and the establishment and maintenance of radial clearances are reoccurring problems with each new application. The spiral cut diaphragm is the prevalent configuration. The three leg tangential configuration is a recently described alternative with lower peak stress per unit radial stiffness. This improvement does not resolve the design, fabrication, installation, and alignment problems. This project will examine and compare the spiral and tangential flelxure for designing reproducible, highly reliable, long life, radially stiff elements for assembly in integral precision cartridges. The innovative aspect is to develop a metallurgically bonded precision aligned integral bearing cartridge with tight tolerance internal and external mounting diameters. Such cartridges, externally similar to ball bearing cartridges, will greatly simplify the use of these bearings. The metallurgical bonding process will be demonstrated and evaluated.",

Such simulations can support a wide range of functional capabilities in the design, development, and operational life cycle of such spacecraft. Traditional approaches to end-to-end system modeling have produced very large computer programs not conducive to interactive usage. The rapidly evolving capabilities of computer workstations, new system programming environments, and advanced graphics and user interfaces, however, provide a new capacity to integrate hitherto separate computer models operating in different environments into interactive high fidelity system simulations. This project will develop a design and proof-of-concept kernel for an end-to-end simulation of the critical elements of a space-based passive sensor system by applying these new workstation tools and software development techniques.

Local wavefront distortion (deviation from a plane or a sperical wavefront) causes displacement of corresponding elementary images sonstituting an FI of a periodic structure. A simple algorithm is proposed to compute wavefront local tilt from displacement measurement. The WFS has various advantages over other methods. The optical system is extremely simple, can be implemented in any spectral range, and give a clear two-dimensional pattern of inhomogeneties of the aerodynamic field. By selecting the transmittance profile of the elementary object, it is possible to adjust the WFS spatial sampling rate to the medium under investigation. The method can be used for long-aperature analysis and has higher sensitivity than the Hartmann method.

The HPOC concept uses a spinning drum on which up to 1024 distinct gray level encoded reference signals are placed. A light beam emitted by an LED and modulated by the incoming sonar signal is incident upon the drum and picked up by a fiber faceplate which conducts the light signals to a 1024 x 1024 CCD array. To eliminate the correlation DC background and increase the system's dynamic range, the HPOC will incorporate positive and negative CCD detection channels. With the HPOC, ten million parallel correlations can be performed.

        "abstract": "A program for the development of a flow actuator for active control of flow separation on flight surfaces is proposed. The actuators will be used to modulate flow through discrete jets located on the aerodynamic surface. These jets (known as Vortex Generator Jets or VGJ's) produce streamwise and ring vortices which enhance boundary layer mixing and inhibit flow separation. This actuation technique lends itself to the development of a closed-loop active control system for flow separation control on aircraft flight surfaces because of the potential compactness of each actuator element and the simplicity of their operation. The ability to implement the control system only when necessary will allow improved aircraft performance over an extended flight envelope. In the proposed work plan, a flow visualization technique based on laser-induced fluorescence of a molecular flow tracer will be used to study the effects of this actuation technique on a separated flow surface. The influence of modulation frequency and amplitude on the effectiveness of this control scheme will be determined. The experimental results will be used as guidelines for the design of a Phase II prototype actuator for large-scale testing at flight conditions.",

The common pixel registry afforded by the design permits unique spectral information to be extracted from cluttered background and target analysis with sub-pixel spatial resolution. The application effort will address the use of the proven characteristics of the system in the 3 to 5 and 8 to 12 Hm spectral ranges to the signatures extant in tactical battlefield and aircraft scenes, including cruise missile detection. A laboratory effort will address the issues involved in adapting the instrument concept for use in the l to 3 Hm range and to shorter wavelengths. Instrumental configurations are presented that cover both the atmospheric windows at 3 to 5 and 8 to 12 pm. Illustrative estimates of the achievable noise equivalent temperature change (NEAT) of the instrument are presented.",

        "abstract": "IT IS PLANNED TO INVESTIGATE THE APPLICATION OF ACTIVE NITROGEN ENERGY TRANSFER (ANET) FLUORESCENCE EXCITATION TO THE DETECTION OF MERCURY IN EXHAUST STACK EFFLUENTS FROM COAL BURNING POWR PLANTS. THE INNOVATION IS TO APPLY DIELECTRIC-BARRIER DISCHARGE TECHNOLOGY TO GENERATE ACTIVE NITROGEN AT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE. MERCURY FLUORESCENCE AT 253.7 NM WILL BE EXCITED BY THE ACTIVE NITROGEN WHEN SMALL SAMPLES CONTAINING MERCURY AT PPB LEVELS ARE INTRODUCED INTO THE ACTIVE NITROGEN DISCHARGE. ACTIVE NITROGEN EXCITATION OF ATOMIC FLUORESCENCE TENDS TO POPULATE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF STATES SO THAT THE RESULTANT FLUORESCENCE SPECTRUM IS SIMPLE AND EASY TO ANALYZE. THUS, A COMPACT INSTRUMENT OF MODEST RESOLUTION WILL SUFFICE TO DETECT THE FLUORESCENCE. IN THE CASE OF MRCURY DETECTION, AN INTERFERENCE FILTER AND PHOTOTUBE SHOULD BE ADEQUATE. THE BASIC TECHNIQUE IS GENERAL AND HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO ALLOW MULTISPECIES DETECTION AT PPB LEVELS. THE USE OF DIELECTRIC-BARRIERDISCHARGE TECHNOLOGY TO GENERATE THE ACTIVE NITROGEN AFFORDS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A LIGHTWEIGHT INSTRUMENT WITH LOW POWER REQUIREMENTS (A 12 V BATTERY) SO THAT A TRULY PORTABLE INSTRUMENT CAN BE CONSTRUCTED.

THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM WILL USE AN ENTRAINED-FLOW, HIGH TEMPERATURE COAL COMBUSTION FACILITY.

Our approach to this problem is to apply the techniques of image and seismic processing in conjunction with public and commercial image and signal processing packages to develop, on a desk top computer, a multi-dimensional signal processing testbed or tool kit which can be used to enhance desired features in time series data.

THE SENSING ELEMENT IS A SMALL DROP OF A RUBBERY CROSSLINKED HETEROGENEOUS POLYMER ATTACHED TO THE END OF AN OPTICAL FIBER. THE POLYMER CONTAINS FUNCTIOINAL GROUPS, E.G. AMINES, THAT REACT WITH HYDROGEN ION. PROTONATION OF THE AMINE GROUPS INTRODUCES A FIXED CHARGE WHICH CAUSES THE POLYMER TO SWELL DUE TO ELECTROSTATIC REPULSION. BECAUSE SWELLING MOVES THE HETEROGENEITIES IN THE POLYMER FURTHER FROM THE OPTICAL FIBER SURFACE, IT IS ACCOMPANIED BY A DECREASE IN THE QUANTITY OF LIGHT DIFFUSELY REFLECTED BACK INTO THE OPTICAL FIBER AT THE PHASE INTERFACES WITHIN THE POLYMER. REFLECTED INTENSITY SERVES AS A MEASURE OF THE PH OF THE MEDIUM. THE PH SENSOR CAN ALSO SERVE AS THE INTERNAL ELEMENT IN A CARBON DIOXIDE SENSOR. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY CONTACTING THE PH SENSITIVE POLYMER WITH A SOLUTION OF BICARBONATE AND COATING IT WIHT A HYDROPHOBIC CARBON DIOXIDE PERMEABLE MEMBRANE. THE SENSORS OFFER IMPROVED RUGGEDNESS AND STABILITY AT REDUCED COST COMPARED TO OTHER PH SENSING TECHNOLOGIES.

        "abstract": "The recent advent in Personal Communications Networks, PCN, and Cellular communications has demanded low cost ferrite components for the RF front ends operating at 9GHz cellular and 1.8GHz GSM bands. The thrust of Personal communication is now being directed towards otherISM (instrumentation, scientific and Medical) bands which allow unlincensed operation at frequencies of 2.4GHZ, 5.8GHz, and 39 GHZ. Additionally licensed cellular systems are being developed at 28GHz. The theme, and reality, for the success of such system is low cost components which are amenable to production methods for mass manufacture. The 28 GHz and 39 GHz cellular systems will operate in large cities where reflections from large buildings and strucutres will enable long distance inter-city communications using very small antennas. Ferrite components, such as circulators and latching circulators are used in the front-ends of two way communication systems. The requirement of low cost and high performance demand ferrite components in formats that utilize minimum parts, surface or drop in mounting, small size and minimum interference withinterface with other transmission medium. Princeton Microwave Technology, a microwave component manufacturer, and Xtalonix, a microwave ferrite material manufacturer, are proposing to address the low cost manufacture of ferrite components by using novel injection mouldingmethods. The original ferrite components, developed by ETDL, will be prototyped in Phase I using isostatic and hot pressing methods and the ferrite material optimised for high performance. The Phase II plan will then advance the manufacture of the low cost components using state of art injection moulding methods and will directly address the forthcoming communication markets that are fast emerging.",

This is a feasbility study, aimed at establishing the required design parameters (e.g. field strength, and electrode geometry) such that the efficiency enhancement is maximized and the ozone production is minimized. A 500-1000 scfm prototype will be constructed and evaluated for efficiency and pressure drop. The effect of the minimized ozone production on ventilation requirements to meet NIOSH standards for ozone, will also be established by means of a material balance model (Jaisinghani et al. 1989).

        "abstract": "WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW GENERATION OF ACCELERATORS EMPLOYING SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETS FOR NUCLEAR PHYSICS SUCH AS THE CONTINUOUS ELECTRON BEAM ACCELERATOR FACILITY (CEBAF) AND THE RELATIVISTIC HEAVY ION COLLIDER (RHIC), A CORRESPONDING NEED HAS ARISEN FOR A NEW GENERATION OF DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS FOR NONDESTRUCTIVELY MONITORING THE INTENSITY AND POSITION OF THE PARTICLE BEAMS. A SYSTEM THAT REPRESENTS A NEW APPROACH TO THE MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE FOR POSITION AND INTENSITY MONITORING IS PLANNED IN THIS PROJECT. THE OPERATING PRINCIPLE OF THE SYSTEM DIFFERS FROM EXISTING THIN-WIRE PICKOFF ANTENNAS TUNED TO DETECT THE ELECTRIC FIELD FROM THE BEAM IN THAT THE MAGNETIC FIELD FROM THE CURRENT IS MEASURED DIRECTLY IN PICKUP LOOPS. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE USE OF A CLOSED SUPERCONDUCTING LOOP, COUPLED TO A SUPERCONDUCTING QUANTUM INTERFERENCE DEVICE (SQUID). ADVANTAGES OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM INCLUDE A MUCH LOWER LIMIT ON MEASUREMENT THRESHOLD AND DYNAMIC RANGE DUE TO THE EXTREME SENSITIVITY OF SQUIDS FOR MAGNETIC FIELD MEASUREMENTS, AND A GREATER FLEXIBILITY FOR INTEGRATING THE SYSTEM INTO THE BEAM PIPE BECAUSE OF THE SMALL DIMENSIONS OF THE PICKUP LOOPS. PHASE I WILL DETERMINE THE SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE PLANNED SYSTEM AND INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE TECHNIQUE. THE GOAL OF PHASE I RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP A DESIGN FOR A PROTOTYPE BEAM POSITION AND INTENSITY MONITOR FOR USE AT CEBAF. SEVERAL TASKS WILL BE PERFORMED TO TEST EXPERIMENTALLY THE FEASIBILITY OF THE TECHNICAL APPROACH IN PHASE I AND TO CONDUCT AN EXTENDED ANALYSIS OF THE CAPABILITIES OF THE SYSTEM TO PERFORM ITS STATED OBJECTIVES. THE FINAL TASK IN PHASE I WILL BE TO COMPLETE THE DESIGN OF THE SYSTEM TO BE BUILD IN PHASE II. THIS APPROACH RESULTS INA STATE-OF-THE-ART SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES ENHANCED PERFORMANCE IN CRITICAL AREAS OVER EXISTING DEVICES AND AND IS ADAPTABLE TO A WIDE RANGE OF DESIGN PARAMETERS SUCH AS ACTIVE PROBE DIMENSIONS AND MEASUREMENT SENSITIVITY.",

A two-stage baseline system is proposed to accomplish this, consisting of a multisensor processor front-end, which employs dominant-mode prediction (DMP) and polychannel DMP (PC-DMP) to detect, copy, and localize emitters on the basis of their variation in time-frequency support (temporal burstiness and/or bandwidth extent); and a signel-sensor processor back-end, which employs log-likelihood functions (LLFs) and per-survivor-processing (PSP) algorithms to classify and demodulate the dehopped/downconverted emitters provided by the processor front-end. Both stages provide optimal (GLRT) statistics for detection and classification of the emitter waveforms, and provide optimal (ML) estimates of the emitter waveforms under appropriate modelling conditions. In addition, the baseline processor is compatible with channelized digital reconnaissance systems under current development, such as the TACJAM A system, in that they can operate against emitters with bandwidths larger than the frequency channelization of the reconnaissance system, even if that system employs undersampled frequency channelizers that do not allow complete regeneration of the emitter time series",

The length of the resonator will be 1 to 3 mm with a finesse of 100 or higher. This large finesse will make the effective Vpi about 0.1 voltes while using short, low capacitance electrodes. As a result bandwidths will exceed 10 GHz. In addition we will fabricate a reference resonator on the same substrate without electrodes to discriminate against temperature and wavelength fluctuaitons. In Phase I we will fabricate multiple resonators on the same substrate with metallic mirrors. RAMAR has, in the past, fabricated such resonators with a finess of 40. We will measure the bandwidth and voltage sensitivity. We will evaluate the similarity of resonators on a single substrate for using one as a reference.

Effective management techniques and automated tools are needed to help IRM project managers control ADP system design, development, implementation and change processes. Recent advances in Personal Computer (PC) technology provide new tools to control system development projects throughout their life cycle. NAVSEA has invested in these PC tools for its professionals; thus creating the opportunity to integrate the tools to allow IPM project managers to efficiently plan and execute system development projects. During Phase I, RGS will evaluate the IRM project management processes to define methodologies for controlling IRM projects and requirements for automated tools. Criteria will be developed to tailor the methodology and tasks for unique requirements of individual ADP development projects. Our Phase I effort will produce: (1) a requirements document prepared in the format of a Functional Description (FD) to describe the management methodology and use of the automated tools, and (2) a prototype of the automated tools which integrates off-the-shelf software packages for database management, optical imaging and expert systems in a PC environment. The FD will serve as the design document for development of the prototype, which will confirm the viability of the management strategy while demonstrating the usefulness of automated tools.",

We propose to develop and test our technique based on a non-contact, optical, multi-sensor range scanning technique that digitizes the entire surface in less than one second. This device employs \"white light\" pattern projectors and employs no harmful ionizing radiation. This approach allows the digitization of complex surfaces with the use of appropraite sensor (digital cameras and light beam projectors) configuration. Multi-resolution data, depending on the requirement, can be collected for different surfaces simultaneously or separately and integrated together to provide one comprehensive data set describing the body surface.

To meet other, less stringent Air Force requirements, the direct RF generation architecture could be tailored to provide a broad range of tuning bandwidths, settling times, frequency accuracies and spectral purities. By using direct microwave RF generation controlled by a fast, very broadband Phase-Lock Loop (PLL), the system avoids the hardware intensive filtering techniques necessary in traditional upconversion and multiplication schemes and will employ readily available commercial hardware, providing extremely attractive size and cost efficiencies. The proposed system also avoids the phase noise problems of DDS's.

In the last three years, much progress has been made in treating certain elements of the force planning and acquisition problem, specifically in the development and production of a core set of force effectiveness parametrics applicable to conventional warfare in which theater level campaign analyses were performed within the \"Strategy to Task\" as well as the acquisition directives (DoDI 5000.1/.2).

WE PROPOSE TO ESTABLISH GENETIC TRANSFORMATION SYSTEMS (VIA PARTICLE BOMBARDMENT OR THE \"BILISTIC\" PROCESS) FOR A NUMBER OF THE MAJOR FLOWER CROPS GROWN IN THE UNITED STATES. MOLECULAR GENETICS OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY OF CONFERRING TRANSGENE-MEDIATED DISEASE RESISTANCE TO A NUMBER OF COMMERCIALLY-IMPORTANT FLOWER PATHOGENS TO REDUCE BOTH GROWERS'S COSTS (AND THUS INCREASE THEIR COMPETITIVENESS IN THE INTERNATIONALFLOWER MARKETPLACE) AND ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE (THROUGH LESS PESTICIDE USE). IN PHASE I, PARAMETERS FOR THE EFFICIENT AND REPRODUCTIBLE BIOLISTIC TRANSFORMATION OF SEVERAL MAJOR FLOWER CROPS WILL BE ESTABLISHED. THESE PARAMETERS INCLUDE AN EVALUATION OF GENE PROMOTERS, OPTIMIZATION OF GENE DELIVERY, AND EVALUATION OF A SELECTION SYSTEM FOR RECOVERING BOTH DICOTYLEDONOUS AND MONOCOTYLEDONOUS TRANSGENIC FLOWERS. IN PHASE II, THE TRANSGENIC NATURE OF THE REGENERATED FLOWERS WILL BE CONFIRMED, SOME IF WHICH WILL CONTAIN TRANGENES THAT SHOULD CONFER RESISTANCE TO COMMERCIALLY-IMPORTANT PATHOGENS.

Now it is known that these chaotic systems are not just random fluctuations but are tottally deterministic. More importantly they can be controlled by studying the nature of the Chaos and applying small perturbations to the systems parameters.

Vibrational signature measurement with Doppler laser radar has been successfully demonstrated using CO2 lasers.

Recent developments in two micron solid state lasers can allow vibrational signature measurement in a compact, reliable sensor.

The proposed Phase I effort draws on past and on-going activities at SEO to prove the feasibility of target identification, and to develop a preliminary design of a prototype sensor.

The firm presented a candidate clearance control system in this proposal, although the candiate control system should not limit the firm's assessment of other feasible control concepts.

The model innovations sequence is used for the detection decision. In general, HOS-based algorithms offer several advantages over conventional time series methods based on second-order statistics. Higher-order cumulants contain information about the system phase, and thus can be used to model both minimum-phase and non-minimum-phase systems. This allows a larger model class for the modeling of radar return signals. HOS-based algorithms specifically address the cases where the desired signal portion does not exhibit Gaussian statistics, which is the cases in many radar system applications. Additionally, the higher-order cumulants are insensitive to additive Gaussian-distributed noise, such as receiver noise and interference sources. Thus, cumulant-based algorithms offer potential for improved performance in many radar target detection problems.",

IT IS ALSO DESIRABLE TO RESOLVE SIGNALS AND CLUTTER WHICH ARE CLOSELY SPACED IN FREQUENCY AS MIGHT OCCUR WITH SLOWLY MOVING VEHICLES. EXISTING CLUTTER REJECTION TECHNIQUES, WHICH USE WEIGHTED FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM (FFT) PROCESSING, SUFFER FROM DEGRADED FREQUENCY RESOLUTION. A NEW POWERFUL TECHNIQUE OF SPECTRUM ANALYSIS BASED ON STOCHASTIC REALIZATION CONCEPT IS PROPOSED HERE WHICH IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE HIGHER RESOLUTION SO THAT SLOWER-MOVING TARGETS CAN BE CLASSIFIED IN A HIGH CLUTTER ENVIRONMENT. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE RESULTING ALGORITHM WILL BE COMPARED TO THE STANDARD FFT APPROACH. THE PROPOSED STEPS TOWARD THE MAJOR OBJECTIVE ARE (1) MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF THE PROCESS, (2) PERFORM STATE-OF-THE-ART SURVEYS ON KEY RADAR TECHNOLOGY AREA, (3) ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING, AND (4) SURVEY AND EVALUATE CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS. RAYTHEON CO AT WAYLAND, A LEADER IN RADAR TECHNOLOGY, WILL SUBCONTRACT IN THIS EFFORT.",

        "abstract": "The rise of launch clouds to stabilization is forced by an altitude varying distribution of momention and buoyancy (temperature). In most of the plume, the temperature excess over that of the atmosphere is large and the buoyant force accelerates the launch products to \"high\" altitudes. The acceleration is retarded by the exhaust velocity, but augmented strongly by water vapor phase changes and possibly by heat release from residual chemistry. Turbulent diffusion of the buoyancy with or without wind shear and atmospheric temperature gradients stop the flow above the neutral buoyancy level; the flow falls back and the cloud is transported within the prevailing weather. The cloud may be toxic. We develop a first-principle computational capability centered on a proven cloud formation code (PSR/2DSALE). A tailored grid with variable vertical resolution based on specific launch profiles is proposed, and we develop a distributed buoyancy and momentum source function based on the \"ground\" cloud and standard plume flowfield. We plan a test calculation matrix with stable and unstable atmospheres, high and low moisture profiles, and wind shear. We add PSR's multicomponent first-principle microphysics code to account rigorously for particle growth in the plume and cloud. Extension to a Phase II 3-D capability is planned.",

Element suppliers have continued to use a 31 mil thick feed channel spacer, first pioneered by DuPont in the mid 1960\\'s. There is continuing evidence that this mesh spacer configuration is a major contributor to membrane fouling by forming \"dead areas\" of low flow behind the spacer segments which trap the foulants. During cleaning operations, these foulants may be loosened from the membrane surface but cannot be flushed out of the element. The fouling materials remain trapped within the mesh spacer and redeposit on the membrane upon repressurization, thereby obviating the effects of the effects of the cleaning operation.",

Binder and the army ETDL has shown that the RF plasma treatment of capacitor films, electrode foils and wound rolls, can result in significant and in some cases dramatic improvements, in the electrical breakdown strength of certain capacitor films and capacitor rolls. In this investigation we will demonstrate potential commercial applications of the RF plasma treatment that will allow this technology to be licensed by film producers and capacitor manufacturers. In order to identify the commercialization potential of the film surface treatment, a high power hollow cathode RF reactor will be used to reduce the treatment time so that the process can be used to treat webs of film that are moving at production-like speeds. Contact angle, adhesion and ESCA analysis will be done on the surface of the films, to relate the data to the work done by the ETDL and further quantity effects of the O2 and CF4/02 plasmas. Treated films will be metallized with and with out exposure to air, and the self healing characteristics will be studied. Aluminum and tin foils with widths varying from 0.25\" to 6.0\" will be plasma treated and treated in wound capacitors, to determine the relationship of the foil edge treatment to the breakdown strength of the capacitors. Wound rolls will be plasma treated in a box etcher both by mechanical fixuring and by placing the rolls inside a cage that is rotating in the plasma chamber. The latter method will allow large quantities of small capacitors to be treated uniformly at a low enough cost, that will make this process cost effective even for marginal enhancements in the dielectric strength of the parts.",

However, SCR has some disadvantages. For example, SCR is very expensive to install and to operate; it employs catalysts that are easily blinded; it requires ammonia additions that sometime slip through the catalyst beds; it generally performs satisfactorily only at high temperatures. Recently, Sorbtech developed for the Air Force a simple, low-cost alternative to SCR for controlling NOx in exhaust gases produced in jet-engine test cells (JETCs). The development is a two-bed filter that demonstrates attractive removals of not only NOx, but also of CO, small (P-10) particles, SO2, HC1, and other contaminants. The new filter could have many Air Force and civilian applications, in addition to JETCs. The proposed project will explore three of these potential applications (natural-gas boilers, diesel engines, and a waste incinerator) at actual sites at McClellan AFB.",

This spatial monitor will be used in many applications to visualize, and interact with, three dimensional images. In particular, Air Force applications will greatly benefit from this novel human/machine interface.

Weapon firing has been simulated by firing blank rounds and the effect of incoming rounds has been simulated by small explosive charges. Pyrotechnics have the advantage of being the simplest way to create the sound of an explosion, which is difficult to duplicate by other means. Moreover, the pyrotechnic mixture can be compounded to produce the desired levels of flash and smoke. Pyrotechnics also have several disadvantages. Being explosive devices, the charges present storage and handling hazards, and firing the charges carries the risk of igniting accidental fires. Spectra Researc (S*R) proposes to overcome these limitations with a non-pyrotechnic explosion simulator that is compact, reusable, and configurable for a range of effects.

GASMAN uses techniques of wavelength modulation and line-locked absorption detection common to several gallium arsenide-based snesors developed by SSI for automated and unattended operation in the detection of single species in open air. GASMAN incorporates these features, along with a long-path absorption cell, multiple diode-laser sources, and multiplexing techniques. An internal microprocessor system controls experimental sequencing and stores several hours of continuous concentration data with sub-second time resolution. The resulting system is portable, compact, lighweight, and has low power consumption requirements. The objective of this work is to develop a prototype system for deployment in military applications. Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of the GASMAN approach b y monitoring representative toxic gases using a breadboard incorporating three basic elements; line-locked detection, a multiple-pass absorption cell, and multiplexced laser-diodes. Phase Ii development will lead to a working prototype.",

        "abstract": "This program will develop high power diode lasers in compact packages with fiber optic output. The approach will involve design, fabrication, and mounting of single high power CW diode laser array bars and the fiber pigtailing of these bars into completed laser modules. The approach will be to use single array bar packages, thereby avoiding the expensive \"rack and stack\" design. A single 1-cm array bar package will be pigtailed into a 400 micron diameter core fiber, with an expected CW output power in the 10W level. The uniqueness of the proposed approach is that it will utilize Spire's previously developed low cost laser array bar fabrication techniques, and provide for the coupling of these bars into a single fiber delivery system. Spire uses proprietary fluxless vacuum soldering for mounting 1 cm, coated array bars without solder voids, and proposes to use all-refractive optics for efficient fiber coupling. The Phase I effort will result in the delivery of a proof-of-concept fiber-coupled demonstrator emitting at the 10W level. Future Phase II work will be directed at extending this approach into the 50-100W level.",

A SQUID offers new technology for measurement of magnetic flux at low frequencies with unprecedented sensitivity. Its extreme sensitivity at low frequencies can provide an electromagnetic microscope for eddy current NDE of underlying defects and hidden corrosion in airframes. Our measurements with a prototype SQUID microprobe, using niobium technology at 4 K, show that it reliably finds a 1 mm flaw through 6 mm of aluminum, at 88 Hz and a standoff of 4 mm, as well as material loss less than 1% from corrosion under a 2.29 mm thick aluminum plate. The new capability offered by a SQUID microprobe together with advances in fabricating SQUIDs and pickup coils from high-temperature superconductors provides a technological opportunity for developing a hand-held, electromagnetic microscope for evaluating hidden defects in airframes during flight-line operations. Its development requires the combined skills of experts knowledgeable in (1) eddy current NDE of materials, (2) NDE of military and commercial airframes, (3) fabrication of SQUIDs from high-temperature superconductors, and (4) use of SQUIDs for eddy current NDE. To realize the promise of a new capability for inspecting the aging fleets of both military and commercial aircrafat, we propose to lead a development team comprising IBM, Northrop Corporation, Boeing, and SQM Technology, Inc.",

The classical Eaton synthesis to yield cubane 1,4-dicarboxylic acid in five steps involves a key photochemical reaction. The steps before and after the critical 2+2 cycloaddition are standardized and readily scalable. However, this steps alone prevents scale-up. We will develop a non-photochemical method for this step. We propose three chemical alternatives: a) radical cation 2+2 cycloaddition via a radical chain process, b) a cobalt catalyzed 2+2 cyclodimerization and c) a nucleophilic addition-cyclization route. Rapid analysis for the success in non-photochemical reaction of the chemical 2+2 is easily done because the properties of the product are already known. Therefore during the six month period of Phase I we will start a screening of many one-electron oxidants for radical cation formation (route a), exhaustively vary reaction parameters for the cobalt catalyzed cyclodimerization, (route b) and investigate a representative number of nucleophiles capable of triggering the intramolecular cyclization in route c.",

The synthesis depends upon new chemistry which we have discovered for phosphoranes and trifluoromethyl phosphorus compounds. The highly electronegative CF3 mimics an anionic oxygen bond to phosphorus and also stabilizes the phosphorane hapten towards hydrolytic decomposition. This novel hapten represents a closely proximate model for the transition state in organophosphate hydrolytic cleavage and should enable production of a highly effective catalytic antibody for organophosphate neutralization.

Forced Diffusion Thermography(FDT)is an NDE method that uses projected, dynamic patterns of light to thermally excite a specimen structure with an oscillating thermal pattern that is synchronously imaged and processed for the detection of flaws. Thermoelastic Stress Analysis(TSA)is a differential thermography technique capable of nearly real-time measurement of mixed-mode stress intensity factors. Both FDT and TSA use the same dynamic thermography equipment to measure the small temperature fluctuations upon which these techniques are based. FDT and TSA have serveral attributes that will make them superior to other methods for assessing structural integrity in extreme environments.

Removal of these fasteners for routine maintenance often results in galled, seized or broken parts, with accompanying damage to the mating parts and lost maintenance time. This is very costly to the Air Force. Surfaces Research has developed new lubricant technology which promises to solve fastener lubricant problems. In the Phase I program, we will demonstrate improved antiseize fastener lubricant performance using new Surfaces Research lubricant technology. We will elucidate the chemical and metallurgical mechanisms which cause seizing the galling of fasteners in Air Force engines. We will establish the relationships between fastener lubricant performance in engines and in component screening tests.",

        "abstract": "Complexity has been shown to be a valid measure of software maintainability. However, software complexity measures are currently focused on the analysis of completed code. Since an improvement in the design phase of a software product would reduce the overall cost of that software (i.e., identify problems early in the software's life cycle), it only makes sense to develop a metric which addresses software design complexity. The ability to objectively evaluate and measure the design complexity of software would allow a software developer to evaluate and compare competing candidate designs prior to any coding activities. Comparing design early in the software design cycle would then permit an early evaluation of the anticipated maintainability (and quality) of the final software product. The objective of this SBIR activity is to identify appropriate software design complexity methods for an eventual development of an automated tool which identifies and measures software design complexity. With the adherence to emerging standards and interoperability with other Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools, a fully developed Avionics Software Design Complexity Measure (ASDCM) would certainly be a desireable feature of a modern Software Engineering Environment.",

A program of rational drug design to develop non-peptide NPY analogs for intervention in these disorders would be facilitated by a structural model of the NPY binding site. The construction of such a model requires an understanding of the molecular interac- tions between NPY peptide ligands and their receptors. We will generate an interactive molecular model of the NPY receptor/ligand complex. The model will be tested by structurally modifying cloned NPY1 receptors using site-directed mutagenesis, and assessing the impact of these changes on the pharmacology of the receptors when expressed in heterologous cell lines. Results of these mutagenesis experiments will be used to further refine our model of NPY receptors and map their ligand binding sites. The models ability to simulate docking of proposed drug designs with their receptor targets will allow us, in Phase II, to expand our structure function studies of the NPY system and accelerate our design of lead compounds to rapidly develop therapeutically useful non-peptide analogs of NPY.",

This objective will be accomplished in three tasks: (1) review and document previous work to quantify the level of fidelity of rotorcraft/ship landing simulatons, (2) consider the overall task and evaluate the individual factors that make up each component of the simulation task, and (3) develop a proposal to quantify in Phase II the required fidelity of the individual factors that make up each component of the rotorcraft/ship landing task.",

The use of task-tailored designs and extended flight envelopes has resulted in aircraft whose characteristics are on, or beyond, the edges of applicability of the current military standard for flying qualities of piloted airplanes. In addition, while the standard is comprehensive in scope, it is possible that external factors will influence the mission suitability of any aircraft design such that its overall flying qualities may be unacceptable, even if it passes individual criteria. The only final check of this suitability is via testing through a series of demonstration maneuvers. The proposed effort will review current flight testing and research methods to identify a limited set of maneuvers that will serve as a check of an aircraft's overall flying qualities. These maneuvers will be representative of actual flight mission elements and will include expected limits of desired and adequate performance, as required for flying-qualities evaluation. Unlike the single-axis, single-parameter criteria of the military standard, they will assure multi-axis operations.",

In most cases these simulations were within a single facility, with node-to-node distances constrained 300 meters. The use of high-power laser diodes and/or higher-power laser transmitters and receivers to extend node-to-node distance by one or two orders of magnitude (to over 30,000 meters) and the use of satellite communications to extend these distances to geographically significant distances are a natural extension of replicated shared-memory networks.

The Avionics Wind Tunnel (AWT), an ongoing plan to connect several Wright-Patterson AFB facilities within the Flight Dynamics and Avionics Directorates, and potentially other Area B facilities, requires additional capability in order to share U.S. Government classified data in a manner approved by the National Security Agency (NSA).

This technology is based on the development of wavelength-stable semiconductor diode lasers. With the proposed technology the wavelengths of these diode lasers are precisely determined and controlled by a temperature-stable Bragg reflector that provides strongly wavelength-selective reflection. Unlike standard Distributed Bragg Reflection (DBR) lasers, our approach uses a Bragg reflector that is made of a different material than the gain portion of the laser and separated from the gain region. Moreover, our Bragg reflectors are formed from glasses which are chosen for their superior temperature stability. Thus the laser emission wavelength is locked to a predetermined value. With this approach optimized and well-developed diode lasers may be combined with optimized Bragg reflectors. There are numerous applications of this technology. For example, in the communications arena our approach can provide hundreds of non-interfering wavelengths for dense wavelength division multiplexing. The development of this technology will give U.S. industry a lead in semiconductor laser technology that is now dominated by Japan.",

Bore temperatures exceeding the melting point of steel can be easily reached because of the low thermal conductivity of the steel barrel. Barrels comprised of copper/graphite composite materials potentially have an order of magnitude greater thermal conductivity than steel and could significantly decrease bore tempertures. A copper/graphite composite barrel will be designed and analyzed for thermal performance. A manufacturing process for producing these composite barrels using liquid metal infiltration will be investigated. Feasibility will be demonstrated by manufacturing and testing a small barrel.",

As a method to enhance the power levels and efficiency of the engine, the thermal emissivity of the outer anode surface must be substantially enhanced. Ideally, the anode material should be low density, both highly electrically and thermally conductive, and be chemically compatible with the reactive propulsion gases. The proposed research will investigate anode materials fabricated from directionally aligned carbon/carbon (C/C) composite. The inside surfaces of the plenum chamber, constrictor throat, and expansion nozzle will be coated with a layer of conductive tungsten metal to serve as the arc attachment surface and to protect the C/C composite surface will also ensure effective radiation of the heat flux generated by the arcjet plasma.",

Surfaces subjected to aerodynamic heating will also be cooled by recirculating hydrogen through cooling tubes. To date, approaches investigated have not had desired levels of heat transfer. In the Phase I program, two approaches to providing high heat transfer between cooling tubes and the C/C composite will be investigated. In the first, holes machined in the composite will be lined with a refractory metal liner using a proprietary process which provides good bonding between the metal liner and the composite. The process should completely fill any cracks or pores in the C/C composite. In the second approach, metal alloy tubes will be placed in refractory metal lined holes in the C/C composite. The gap between the tubes and the lined holes will be filled with copper or other non-reactive brazing metal. Filling the gap with high-conductivity metal should increase heat transfer to desired levels. Samples will be tested for hydrogen leakage, resistenace to thermal cycling and resistance to high heat fluxes. The data developed in Phase I will lead to the design and operation of a prototype heat exchanger in Phase II.",

Because of current State regulations and pending regulatory changes at the Federal level, careful consideration must be given to disposal of PCP-treated wood products.

        "abstract": "(U) The advent of technology (e.g., GaAs MMIC amplifiers and DRFM devices) has enhanced the development of inexpensive expendable repeater/transponder jammers that can mimic an airborne radar's signal coherently, and modulate it to deceive, confuse or obfuscate the radar/receiver, effectively preventing it from achieving or maintaining track lock-on, thus delaying or precluding missile launch. The proliferation and availability of these inexpensive active expendables throughout the world makes them a viable threat to US airborne intercept (AI) radars. (U) Technology Service Corporation (TSC) proposes to assess two ECCM techniques to counter the effects of ECM signals generated by active expendables during an airborne radar track mode, while minimizing the impact on the radar system. The two techniques--Target Modulated ECCM (TAME) and Multiple Target Angular Resolution (MTAR) complement each other--and together will counter ECM wave forms expected from active expendables in general, and towed decoys in particular. TAME (a TSC-proprietary technique) is primarily effective against coherent repeater signals (false targets or pulloffs), but not against narrowband repeater doppler noise; whereas MTAR is most effective against narrowband repeater doppler noise, as well as against repeater signals in the same resolution cell as the protected target (i.e., prior to pulloff). (U) Phase I study tasks consist of assessing current and postulated future ECM parameters of active expendable jammers, developing the ECCM algorithms, and analyzing the ECCM techniques performance and feasibility. A plan to test the ECCM techniques via simulation during Phase II will be developed during Phase I.",

The production cost per part is higher for single or batch production when compared to mass production. In batch production, the machining time does not account for a large percentage of the total time for designing, planning, and production. Therefore, for cost optimization, it is more important to cut down the planning time by quickly generating a feasible process plan rather that the lengthy generation of an optimized plan. The emphasis is on short turnaround time for immediate prototyping. For mass production it is important to optimize the process plan to minimize the machining time. The proposal objectives are to automate the design and manufacture plan of custom parts by developing a concurrent engineering system with geometrical reasoning engine, for integrated design, part specifications, and process planning.

These can be disposed of by burning using the Open Pad Burning Method which is virtually been abolished by the EPA and alternate mehtods such as the incinerator have been proposed. Current incinerator systems can handle only 0.5 lbs/hr of explosives because they contain to much. Currently extraction mehtodology for demilitarization of propellants and explosives use carcinogenic hydrocarbon solvents, are time consuming, insufficiently sensitive, labor intensive and costly. Besides, bydrocarbon solvents are expensive, require vacuum distillation to remove the solvent from the extracted compounds, and the plant has to explosion proof. A new process, safe to personnel, meeting both OSHA and EPA requirements, using inexpensive solvent, not requiring explosion proof plant would be very useful in the demilitarization of the explosives and save the government considerable amount of money.

Thermacore has successfully designed, fabricated, and tested four FHPCP geometries for four difference aircraft applications. The results, compiled in a report and submitted to the Naval Air Development Center, demonstrated the FHPCP's versatility and capacity for cooling. The report also indicated that substantial progress had been made towards qualifying the FHPCP for aircraft use; however, additional tests were recommended to complete this work. The suspected weakness (and area of needed testing) of the original FHPCP design was performance under adverse high-g loading and adverse elevation. A CPL design features inherently improved performance under these adverse conditions; consequently, the proposed program would use a CPL design to improved the FHPCP's performance and possibly qualify the advanced design for aircraft use. In addition, the program would pursue additional aircraft cooling applications as well as investigate lighter materials of construction.",

The total worldwide market for diagnostic ultrasound is $2 billion annually. Real-time phased array volumetric scanning systems (often called \"4D Ultrasound Systems\") promise an array of enhanced diagnostic capabilities; therefore, they will replace 2D phased array ultrasound as the dominant ultrasound modality. We own the patent (Figure 1) for the only known effective mechanism for implementing our images, i. e., receive mode parallel processing. We will develop a commercial fully featured scalable real time phased array volumetric scanner. The basis for this machine will be the real time phased array volumetric scanner at Duke University (the only known real time volumetric scanner in the world). Phase I of this research is directed toward the design, construction, and testing of a unique phased array receiver system based upon a custom VLSI mixed signal delay line chip. The verification of adequate performance of this system in terms of signal to noise, dynamic range, linearity, signal delay, power consumption, size and cost is essential prior to the design and construction of the complete real time volumetric imaging system.",

        "abstract": "There are four key elements to the successful design and ultimate deployment of an acoustic underwater communications system for IUSS/ASW tactical connectivity. First, the properties and limitations of the undersea environment must be understood and characterized. Second, the communications link design must provide robust and efficient performance in the presence of the highly variable undersea environment. Third, the offered connectivity, data rates, and reliability must provide tactical utility without significant degradation of prime ASW sensor capabilities. Fourth, maximum utilization of existing and planned subsystems already present or planned for installation must be a key element of the overall design, and additional component development, production, and installation cost should be modest, so that the overall system is affordable. The proposed approach incorporates all the above elements. Characteristics of the communication function include bandspreading, multipath resistance, error correction, and higher data rates for links with benign acoustic conditions. The Phase I effort will survey the operational and planned ASW platform and IUSS resources, design and overall acoustic communications system including operational concept and connectivities, model and analyze link performance accounting for the detailed acoustic environment, and design the acoustic transceiver capable of performing as required for the communications system.",

Our impotence in finding and destroying these launchers soon became obvious to us as well as the rest of the world. Later it became apparent that we also lacked the analysis tools needed to investigate and develop effective responses to missile launcher and other Critical Mobile Targets (CMTs). A three-phase program is described here for developing a simulation tool which an be used by the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) to investigate candidate approaches and perform tradeoff studies to develop the requirements for airborne platforms capable of countering mobile missile launchers and other CMTs. The simulation will use the same innovative approach applied by Toyon in support of DARPA's sensor development efforts, but will be structured to focus on the issues relevant to sensor platforms rather than sensors. Phase I, the principal subject of this proposal, will focus on demonstrating the feasibility of creating the desired simulation. Phase II, as a follow-on to Phase I, will proceed with full-scale development of a complete and user-friendly simulation which ASC can use to explore the tradeoffs between various platforms and the relevant parameters for countering CMTs. A final phase, funded by commercial interests, would make further refinements in the simulation, possibly including the creation of new versions which could be hosted on other types of machines of interest to industry.",

        "abstract": "Although the wideband, narrow beam radars at KMR are capable of tracking well-behaved targets during reentry, the radars do not reliably maintain track on targets whose drag profiles deviate significantly from a priori predictions. The objective of this effort is to determine the feasibility of augmenting existing tracking filters for the KMR radars to allow real-time computation, correction, ad prediction of reentry drag experienced by objects in track. The existing KMR track filters attempt to compensate for drag excursions by increasing the process noise when predictions are observed to deviate from the measurements. Rather than simply increase the process noise, our proposed approach is to use the observed deviations between the predicted and observed measurements to modify/improve on our a priori estimate of vehicle drag profile. Our approach can be described as one of using drag as an additional state variable which is estimated in real time using the predictor/corrector processes of Kalman filtering. A digital simulation will be used to refine our new algorithm and to compare its performance with the existing KMR track filters for a wide spectrum of drag profiles. Feasibility of the revised tracker will be evaluated in terms of its ease of implementation in the existing rel-time programs of the KMR radars, and the ability of the existing computing hardware to absorb the additional computational load.",

The software can also analyze the casting process in transient 3D to simulate mold filling. A rapid prototyping method directly creates ceramic molds from the CAD-generated solid model, eliminating intervening steps and part-specific tooling. This increased flexibility allows for rapid design changes, dramatically reducing the cost and lead time involved in casting MMC's. Computer integrated manufacturing incorporating rapid prototyping will establish pressure infiltration casting as a new paradigm for affordable and timely manufacturing of near-net shape metal matrix composites and components. The proposed effort will demonstrate enabling technology by fabricating near-net shape Gr/Al heatsinks for Naval avionics applications.",

        "abstract": "The Air Force is developing an ROD system utilizing a high power laser to neutralize unexploded ordnance. The system is called the Mobile Ordnance Disrupter System (MODS). The current design requires a clear line-of-sight from the vehicle to the ordnance, and thus is ineffective against munitions in depressions, behind obscurations or in buildings. A fiber optic beam delivery system (FOBD) offers an alternative approach in these cases. However, in its present state of development, FOBD is not suitable for MODS, due principally to problems with fiber damage, power loss, and output beam formation. This study will focus on assessing currently available technologies, and identifying additional requirements to overcome these deficiencies, so that a FOBD system for MODS becomes technically and economically feasible. Propagation of high power laser radiation through optical fibers of various types and sizes will be evaluated through mathematical modelling and laboratory experiments. The current state-of-the-art on other components of FOBD will be assessed. Low loss transmission of energy from a 1000 CW Nd:YAG laser through a FOBD system will be demonstrated. Other potential applications of FOBD in the MODS vehicle will be evaluated.",

        "abstract": "UES is proposing a novel vapor synthesis route for producing MMCs in which the matrix alloy will be directly deposited on reinforcing fibers by magnetron sputtering under UHV conditions. A post-deposition consolidation will be used to fabricate MMC's directly from the matrix-containing fibers. This fabrication route offers the following advantages: (a) a very clean environment with excellent impurity control, (b) good repeatability/reproducibility, (c) control of matrix volume fraction, primarily through control of matrix coating thickness, (d) control over chemistry and homogeneity of the deposited matrix, (e) uniform fiber distribution, (f) lower processing temperatures, and (g) flexibility in fiber-matrix interface control/design. The specific objectives of the Phase I effort are: (1) to demonstrate the potential of the sputter deposition process for obtaining highly controlled, uniform, adherent deposits of the titanium aluminide alloy, Ti-22Al-23Nb, on short-length SiC fibers, (2) to demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining MMC's by consolidation of the matrix-containing fibers, (3) to demonstrate proof-of-concept through microstructural studies, thermal cycling and room temperature tensile tests on the fabricated MMC's, (4) to develop a conceptual and engineering design of a reel-to-reel coating system for deposition of matrix alloys on continuous fibers, and (5) provide a comparative cost analysis of the proposed technique in relation to conventional MMC manufacturing processes.",

During this progra, work will focus on hermetic sealing, manufacturing process and fabrication of high rate cathode. Also, assembled cells will be evaluated for electrical performance and safety. U.B.I is uniquely qualified to conduct this program, as we have in place manufacturing process necessary for manufacture of Li/Mn02 batteries and owns a safety-shutdown spearator process. During phase II, U.B.I. will fabricate BA-5590/U cells and assemble them in to a battery, then evaluate battery for electrical performance and prove use of Li/MN02 chemistry and soft pouch packaging material to replace present chemistry.

While the enclosed clinical space of these vehicles is noisy, the helicopter cabin noise is usually loudest. Helicopter noise levels of 100 dB(A) are common while breath sounds (signals) have been measured at 30 dB(A) and frequency ranges are comparable. Improving auscultation in this environment presents unique and complex problems which require unique solutions. The R&D effort demands a comprehensive investigation and understanding of the: (1) auscultation & diagnostic requirements, i.e., patient sound pathology (signals), (2) signal characteristics (frequency, amplitude), (3) noise interference characteristics, (4) method(s) for transmitting signals to the medic with maximum fiderlity. The principal Phase I objective is the design and demonstration of a bread-board model of the Auscultation Sensor & Telemetry Device (ASTD) in a simulated aeromedical evacuation environment (110 dB(A) noise level).

ON-GOING WORK AT VERITAY--SPONSORED BY ARDEC AND OTHERS--SUGGESTS THAT PYROTECHNIC IGNITION MAY HAVE INHERENT VARIABILITY CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE IMPEDING THE ACHIEVEMENT OF REPRODUCIBLE BALLISTICS. TO DEMONSTRATE THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF EXERCISING GREATER CONTROL OVER THE IGNITION SEQUENCE, VERITAY PROPOSES TO CRITICALLY EXAMINE THE IGNITION PERIOD OF RECENT BALLISTIC TEST DATA TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCES OF VARIABILITY AND SUGGEST A MEANS FOR THEIR CONTROL. ELECTRICAL IGNITION SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE ADEQUATE CIRCUITRY FOR CONTROLLING THE IGNITION EVENT WILL BE DEVISED AND DESIGNED, AND AN EXISTING LUMPED--PARAMETER INTERIOR BALLISTIC CODE WILL BE MODIFIED TO MODEL A SLATE OF CANDIDATE IGNITION CONCEPTS FOR THEIR BALLISTIC PERFORMANCE VARIABILITY.",

Alternative approaches to the motor, gearing, and drive electronics, will be evaluated for their own merits as well as the impact on other components. The design we propose will meet the G load requirements by control of load paths, load distribution, and elimination of susceptible components. Versatron's proven experience in control system simulation and design will assure that the system proposed for phase II will meet all of it's performance goals. We have teamed with International Dynamics Corporation (IDC) for expertise in shock hardening. The phase I effort will emphasize design trade studies in the areas of cost, size, shock hardening attributes, motor size and type, electronics architecture, and the method of gear reduction. The result will be a detail design approach that integrates available technology to meet the technical requirements. The selected design will be analyzed in sufficient deatil to allow low risk detail design, fabrication, and testing in phase II.",

In addition, several thousand low bandwidth users can be supported. This approach is an adaptation of existing commercial messaging systems for marine applications. The proposed design uses existing Ku- band resources on a secondary basis. The spread spectrum signal processing provides an efficient method for minimizing the interference between secondary and primary Fixed Satellite Service users.

Cathodes must maintain such stable electron beam output characteristics for > 1 nsec. We propose to meet these requirements in an extremely low cost, robust carbon cathode with a matrix of carbon fiber tufts as the emitting surface. Innovations to improve performance include: cesium iodide coating to reduce plasma gap closure and improve current density uniformity; an intermediate electrode to reduce unwanted plasma production from nearby surfaces and increase total current; increased carbon tuft surface density to produce more uniform current density and reduce explosive plasma production; and a ballast resistor array behind the fibers to prevent hot spots of current/plasma production. Cathodes will be produced utilizing these novel features and tested on a crowbarred Marx for 1-2 nsec pulses. Using a corona bushing to eliminate edge effects, 5-cm radius cathodes will be tested with 4-cm A-K gaps up to the 150-200 kV range. Gap closure rates, current density uniformity, and field stress applied to cathode will be determined, and configuration optimized for meeting target performance goals.",

The IMU sensor cluster design proposed is based upon the inertial silicon sensors produced by Waddan Systems. A pair of the silicon accelerometers are mounted together with their input axes coincident. Each is excited by an equal but opposite velocity normal to the input axes. This velocity has no effect on the acceleration sensed if the pair is put in a pure linear acceleration field, because each senses the same acceleration component. But when it is subjected to an angular rate normal to both the input axis and the velocity vector, the coriolis acceleration experienced by each is equal but opposite. Thus, by taking the sum and difference of the outputs of the devices one can measure both the linear acceleration and the angular rate. A minimum of three such pairs in a sensor cluster would yield a three axis IMU. The objective of the Phase I effort is to design an IMU which is analytically as well as technologically feasible for the 60 mm projectile application.",

It will support multiple missions without additional coding. Customized analysis needs can be met by \"plug-in\" user-developed modules, connection with existing simulations through the standard interface or via data files generated by an external program. Phase I will provide detailed system definition and requirements and will include rapid- prototyping of a module to evaluation two mission utility figures of merit -- response time (applied to the FAS mission) and stationkeeping accuracy (applied to autonomous orbit maintenance).

The Mini-OWLS optical head, developed and patented by Northrop, weighs only 18 grams and can track 6th magnitude stars with an accuracy of 10 arc seconds. The final weight and power of the complete system, estimated at 3 W and less than 0.5 kg, will depend essentially on the microminiaturization of the electronics and the processing algorithm complexity which determines the computational requirements. The recurring sensor cost is expected to be less than 10% of the cost of current units. While the importance of this development will be greatest in interplanetary flight and other applications where weight is critical, it can also help initiate a new generation of small, low- cost, high-accuracy, Earth-orbiting spacecraft. In Phase I, Microcosm will undertake definition of requirements for a general purpose scientific/military/ commercial star tracker, do the system engineering to establish the feasibility of meeting these requirements with the Mini-OWLS technology, and define a programmatic structure for Phase II and Phase III to bring this technology into operational use as rapidly as possible.",

SPEC's PRFS biosensor uses lifetime fluorescence to provide: (1) enhanced senstivity to structural differences associated with various classes and species of bacteria, and (2) a means to reduce fluorescence interference from other bacterial fluorophores. SPEC has shown that lifetime determination by phase and frequency can achieve picosecond resolution. This resolution is sufficient for discriminating between bacterial species and classes. PRFS is based on the physical phenomena occurring when a fluorescent bacteria is excited with sinusoidally modulated light, inducing a phase shifted emission corresponding to the time lag between absorption and fluorescence. These \"phase\" fluorescence parameters are used to generate Excitation Emission Frequency Arrays (EEFAs) for use in detecting, classifying and monitoring concentration changes of potentially dangerous bacterial/biological materials.

Neural networks hold considerable promise to deliver very high performance and powerful new capabilities, as well as compact physical size, low power and high reliability. Such electronic neural networks are very attractive to system developers. To date actual systems incorporating electronic neural networks have been limited (and expensive), due to a lack of flexibility in constructing custom network architectures with the available hardware modules. We propose to develop electronic design synthesis tools for constructing custom integrated circuits that implement application-specific neural networks. These tools will assist the application engineer in selecting between broad classes of analog and digital implementation technologies, architectures, interconnect topologies, interfaces, and permit direct circuit synthesis of manufacturable integrated circuits. The tools would also interface to simulators and development systems, to assist the designer in validating the neural network using experimental and training data. In Phase I, we will prove the tools by FABRICATING demonstration circuits built on existing Tanner Research technology. Our approach will utilize commercial integrated circuit technology; products arising from this R&D can be fabricated reliably and economically by a number of vendors.",

At Tanner Research, image processors are under development that carry out nonlinear filtering for range compression and image enhancement at video rates. The nonlinear filtering intelligently compresses the range without distortion.
