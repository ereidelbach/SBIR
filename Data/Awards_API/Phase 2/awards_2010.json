They have been shown to outperform microprocessors in the important metrics of FLOPS/dollar, FLOPS/Watt, and FLOPS/unit space and have already been applied to a wide range of numerically intense problems.  In Phase I of this project, we demonstrated their potential to enhance complex CFD simulations.  Specifically, using modeling and simulation to predict UAV operation as they interact with Naval vessels in takeoff and landing scenarios; which is important from both a cost-savings and a life-savings standpoint.  By the end of Phase II, we will have a complete solver that allows for the modeling of the dynamic interface (DI) between very large and very small objects as their airwakes interact.  The result will be a tool for the rapid and accurate simulations analysis of UAVs in near-ship environments the we will deploy to NAVAIR to assist in pilot training, operational mission identification, and UAV autopilot development.",

        "abstract": "Modern sensor technology is capable of detecting miniscule changes in an operating environment, and providing a vast supply of precise data regarding potential causes for alarm.  Unfortunately, since many tamper-detection responses involve disabling critical program information, the system designer must establish thresholds that are either set loose enough to not provide an adequate level of security, or are so draconian that the protection becomes a operational liability.  Thus either the tamper detection devices function at crippled levels, or the protected devices suffer from unacceptable failure rates in the field. CATE (Central Anti-Tamper Engine) is effectively a standardized AT decision engine which can be inserted into any number of AT activities to provide an \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d component for monitoring inputs from the various AT sensors.  By using advanced decision engine technology, CATE reduces the risk of false alarms, allowing sensors to be used with stricter response thresholds without risking a compromise of the system while minimizing the device failure rate.  The inputs, their meaning, and their relationships are unique to each AT activity, but the decision engine and supporting tools will be provided as a common platform.  CATE will make powerful decision-making available without exposing root software responsible for creating the network.",

The modeling and simulation effort will focus on multiscale, multiphysics simulations using validated models on high-performance parallel computer platforms. Intermediate scale modeling is crucial to bridging the enormous gap between device-scale models (that are often based on empirical modeling rather than first principles), and atomic-scale models that take into account the underlying discrete nature of matter, but are often difficult to relate to engineering-scale results. Our multiscale approach to modeling and simulation will explicitly address physical features and phenomena at the macro- (device), meso- (aggregate of crystals) and micro- (individual crystal) scales in an integrated fashion.

In Phase I, SA Photonics began development of their ThermoWeb System, which is modular, has the ability to monitor and control component temperatures and utilizes both standard and high thermal conductivity materials minimizing thermal resistance from source to sink.    Within our ThermoWeb design is the thermal control valve which incorporates the advantages of Nanofluids for thermal control.   Data produced during Phase I testing showed the ThermoWeb Nanothermovalve (NTV) works and is a solid baseline for Phase II optimization.  Our NTV is configured to maintain temperatures between components or between components and heat sinks by increasing or decreasing the thermal conductivity within the NTV.  This innovative thermal control design coupled with more traditional temperature monitoring and control electronics, provides a unique and stable system that allows accurate and autonomous thermal control of space based electronics",

(AS&amp;E) will design, fabricate, test and deliver a mobile X-ray Backscatter one-sided imaging system suitable for examining general aviation aircraft for the presence of weapons, contraband or other proscribed items. The system employs a high resolution X-ray Backscatter imaging module mounted on an omni-directional host platform, providing exceptional motion control and versatility for imaging key points on general aviation aircraft, including engines, wings, fuselage, and empennage. The system incorporates collision avoidance to prevent any inadvertent contact with the object being scanned. Real time imagery is displayed to the operator, who controls the system from a co-located graphical user interface. The operator can manipulate and analyze the resulting images using the included software toolkit. The aircraft scanner can be easily moved from location to location within the airport using its own power, or it can be loaded onto a standard flatbed transport for more distant relocations. The system is safe for the operator, the item scanned and the surrounding area. A prototype system, training,\nmanuals and support will be provided within the twelve month program.This program will evaluate the effectiveness and application of an appropriately-configured X-ray Backscatter imager to the screening of general aviation aircraft. It builds on work already in progress at AS&amp;E to miniaturize and improve the resolution of single-sided Xray Backscatter systems.",

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses the key issue in the normalization of software assurance information, how to integrate the vulnerability findings reported by multiple vulnerability detection tools. The normalization will provide normalized, consistent reporting on type of\nidentified weakness (alignment with CWE) as well as normalized, consistent reporting on location and trace of identified weakness within code (source or binary). The project will build upon and extend the results of several recent government-funded programs in the\narea of software assurance. The phase II R&amp;D effort will utilize phase I deliverables and accomplishments to complete the project and deliver (1) an open-standard-based Run Time Tool Output Integration Framework (TOIF) and (2) the integration of several existing open source vulnerability detection tools into this framework. This will mitigate one of the major practical gaps with today`s software assurance tools, the non-overlapping findings of the current tools and will enable cross-examining the vulnerabilities reported by different tools, something that is currently very dependant on human verification and therefore very laborious. This would enable using\nmultiple vulnerability detection tools in a coordinated manner. The anticipated results will be made available to the community (as open source) of tools vendors, leading to further improvements in vulnerability detection tools through normalization of their outputs,\nbetter alignment with existing standards, and better exchanges of software assurance information.",

SRICO proposes significant efficiency improvements to lithium niobate electro-optic modulators that are crucial to achieve practical applications of fiber optic links for microwave transmission and signal processing functions.

While a number of systems have been developed to automatically extract information from text, these systems have suffered from the problem of requiring analysts to manually define and maintain lists of terms and phrases.  What is needed is a tool that can automatically identify new terms and categorize them (person, terrorist, location, weapon, etc.) so that analysts can focus on the job at hand. The Vocabulary \u2013 Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (V-ISR) Phase II project directly solves this problem using advanced machine learning techniques to recognize new vocabulary terms and categorize them within a semantic model called an ontology.  The results of our Phase I project clearly demonstrated that new ontology terms and the contexts that denote them could be \u2018harvested\u2019 from realistic military reports in a timely manner.

        "abstract": "High resolution SAR imaging and Ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radar are of crucial to intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance operations. High resolution SAR imagery are often realized at the expense of wide bandwidth waveform, and to achieve long dwells over a wideband width, often the operating frequency band overlaps with other co-band radars, and it becomes necessary to notch out those interference bands both in the transmit mode and the receive mode. Hence it is necessary to design constant envelope wideband transmit waveforms with spectral notches to null out the co-channel interference while maintaining excellent pulse compression properties to suppress sidelobes. A general solution to this problem is presented in this proposal with flexibility to generate nearly-constant envelope waveforms with significant null depths. Notched transmit waveforms lead to poor range resolution and to compensate that, three new receiver design strategies to suppress the sidelobes are also presented here. If the image scene is sparse, this a-priori information can be used in a fundamental manner by  drawing on recent results on non-linear sparsity based image processing methods. Simulations results verifying the new algorithms, robustness issues and working with primes are other planned activities under this effort.",

The use of M&S becomes more essential as the numbers, capabilities, complex behaviors, and interactions between evolving BMDS elements, configurations, and threats dramatically increase. Currently, exploration of decision variables within a BMDS-level simulation is a manual process lacking an automated method to determine the optimal decision variable values.

Under the proposed Phase II effort, we will develop and evaluate a full-scope SIMON prototype that features the use of evolutionary algorithms to discover optimal parameters of decision variables for BMDS-level simulations. This is complemented by a suite of graphical configuration, analysis, and visualization tools to support the M&S operator.

In Phase II, we propose to fabricate multiple batches of the optimized device targeting the high-voltage and high-frequency required for the converter, demonstrate high-frequency switching with packaged devices. We will focus on commercialization development under privately funded Phase III.",

To meet these requirements, the DAC BOBCAT Team proposes to extend a new suite of algorithms developed that enable current NLP applications to be immediately available across all levels of military intelligence.  We call this approach the Massively Scalable Themes, Entities, and Relationships (MASTER).  In the MASTER approach, we overcome the scalability limitations of current NLP approaches while also enabling the tactical warfighter to focus queries based on discovered context and relations.  The development of the MASTER approach for the tactical warfighter will result in a suite of algorithms that will support all levels of the fight.  The current suite of BOBCAT algorithms, which already advance the state of the art in statistical theme discovery, executes on enterprise platforms at the strategic and operational levels.  The MASTER algorithms will specifically focus on the tactical levels with limited computing footprints and large amounts of open-source data.",

        "abstract": "The real-time implementation of controls in nonlinear systems remains one of the great challenges in applying advanced control technology.  Often, linearization around a set point is the only practical approach, and many controllers implemented in hardware systems are simple PID feedback mechanisms.  To apply Pontryagin\u2019s principle or Bellman\u2019s equation using conventional hardware and algorithms for high dimensional nonlinear systems requires more computing power than is realistic.  The success of linear control theory, especially certainty equivalence and LQG approaches, leads us to hope for additional gains from fully nonlinear controls.  We propose an innovation in computational nonlinear control that offers ground breaking potential for real-time control applications, making fully nonlinear problems solvable with the computational efficiency of linear problems.  The Phase II effort builds on our proof-of-concept Phase I demonstration of an integrated hardware-software solution implementing max-plus arithmetic for efficient solution of nonlinear control problems.  The small-scale problems considered in Phase I will be expanded to include flight control and guidance applications in which nonlinearities present major challenges to system performance.  The prototype system we propose to develop will provide users with a complete solution for developing and implementing real-time nonlinear controls.",

The ePluribus Solver is motivated by the wisdom of the crowds philosophy that proposes that a solution can emerge from a large, diverse group that is superior to a solution formed by a small group. We believe that if society is given a sufficient framework they will be able to collectively address many of the worlds challenges. ePluribus is designed to leverage the viral nature of social networks that causes ideas to spread rapidly and provide incentives to engage individuals in the problem solving process. The framework provides minimalist building-blocks for problem-solving while encouraging the emergence of new problem-solving processes. ePluribus enables users to collaboratively decompose complex problems into manageable components and work on them asynchronously. It then recomposes the components to form a collective solution from the diverse contributions and feedback of many problem-solvers. The fully featured ePluribus framework will manage the complexities of motivating, coordinating and integrating distributed solvers, allowing people to concentrate on what they do best  reason about problems matched to their intuition, skills and experiences.",

CFD models were setup for fuel/oxidizer injection, mixing and the propagation of detonation waves in 2-D and 3-D geometries. Sub-models for flow re-establishment in injectors were developed. A preliminary engine model was tested at UTA to better understand ignition and the generation of CJ-waves. The principal goal of phase-II research will be to create a working CDRE model with favorable and predictable correlations with CFD and analysis. Engine models will be fabricated at PWR and tested at Purdue. Alternate CDRE designs developed at PWR and UTA will be tested during the early part of phase-II.

Such sources are of great interest to the Navy for both anti-submarine warfare and communications at depth and speed, as blue-green light matches the minimum of seawater transmission for a variety of conditions.  In addition, there are military applications in pumping Ti:Sapphire lasers for stable clocks as well as applications for bioinstrumentation, displays, and fundamental research.  We propose to build a green-laser-pumped optical parametric oscillator (OPO).  The oscillator can be used in two modes of operation.  In the first mode, a small fraction of the infrared radiation from the OPO will be fre-quency doubled, sent through an atomic vapor cell, and used to lock the infrared radiation in frequency facilitating its use as a high power source for injection seeding.  In the second mode, a large fraction (~25%) of the infrared radiation will be converted to the blue.  This will yield a tunable blue source that can find applications in detector characterization and basic research.",

More candidate nanofluids and thermal materials will be evaluated, and our effort will be also extended from the heatsink-type heat exchangers into radiator-type heat exchangers as well. Detailed modeling and characterization will be carried out to show the enhance effects of the proposed technology in a vehicle thermal management system as compared to the baseline system. Subscale testing will be conducted first to validate the model and designs,  and select the best design for full scale concept fabrication and test, in which calculations of fuel savings and weight reduction in a vehicle cooling system will be conducted to determine the percent improvement to the vehicle thermal management system. In addition, the applications of nanocoolants for a variety of heat exchangers designs will be evaluated and reliability issues relating to stability of nanofluid along with the integration of heat exchanger into system applications will be also addressed.",

Charles River proposes a system to augment current FMV displays with geographic information and real-time intelligence overlays to provide users with a better understanding of video content in the context of the battlefield. In contrast to most existing techniques that assume approximately planar terrain, our proposed geo-registration algorithm uses both 2D and 3D landmarks extracted from video and reference data to account for mountainous terrain and 3D urban structures. Most existing solutions are also limited to specific equipment configurations and have long processing timelines. Our design instead leverages an open, government off-the-shelf (GOTS) software architecture to provide interoperability among various third party sensors, and is designed for real-time processing. BENEFITS: This system can benefit all ISR platforms within DoD and law enforcement agencies where FMV sensors are used to track or observe targets and accurate geo-location is required. In addition to law enforcement and border patrol, it could also be used for commercial mapping applications, vision-based navigation for robotics, agriculture and environmental studies, and to augment civilian surveying equipment.",

        "abstract": "Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum results in serious illness and, if untreated, often leads to death.  Although a number of candidate vaccines have progressed to clinical trials the efficacy rate of those vaccines was much lower than ideal.  New methods for simultaneous presentation and immune stimulation of malarial antigens are needed in order to rapidly progress promising antigens into efficacious vaccines.  Platforms that present antigen to the immune system in a particulate manner that mimics the structure of a natural pathogen may improve the effectiveness of a vaccine.   Prior work has demonstrated that Vital Probes, Gene-Mediated Inactivated Vaccine (GeMI-Vax) platform in E. coli combined with malaria antigens results in a protective immune response in mouse models of malaria.  The GeMI-Vax production method gently inactivates bacteria that are engineered to express malaria protein antigens.  The resulting particle-based vaccine has inherent adjuvant activity and appropriately presents vaccine antigens and stimulates the immune system.   Phase I SBIR work resulted in successful expression of malaria antigens in E. coli and Shigella.  In Phase II, Shigella-GeMI-Vax expressing malaria antigens will be produced and tested in animal efficacy models.  Demonstration of efficacy will lead to follow-on research and development efforts towards testing in human clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "We propose to adapt angle-only passive ranging methods developed for submarine warfare to the problem of range estimation for missiles using current electro-optical sensor systems in order to provide fire control quality tracking at or near threat burnout to support early intercept.  Three methods will be developed: parallax or triangulation ranging; angle rate ranging; and tracker/filter algorithms.  Parallax ranging is an instantaneous method that uses angle measurements from two physically separated sensors.  The instantaneous rate at which the angle to the target changes over time can be related mathematically to the range to the target.  These methods can also be used to estimate maximum range.  Tracker and filter algorithms use target and sensor platform motion models and sensor measurement error models to calculate a stochastic estimate of the target state.  Real and synthetic data sets will be used to evaluate passive ranging and tracking system performance.",

        "abstract": "The Missile Defense Agency (MDA-DV) is focusing on technology integration to improve the performance of next generation kill vehicles (KV).  MDA recognizes that meeting the evolving agile threat will require synergizing next generation propulsion technologies into the kill vehicle structural backbone.  Simply packaging the largest mass components into a traditional missile structure, as is seen with current fielded KV structures, results in an assembly with redundant structure and excessive mass.  For the Phase I program, San Diego Composites, Inc. teamed with another small business and demonstrated how a solid propulsion system, one that is controllable, throttleable and uses non-toxic fuels, can be integrated into the next generation kill vehicle configuration to reduce redundant structure.  The objective of the Phase II program is to expand the synergistic KV structure approach to not only include the solid propulsion system, but also the batteries, another large mass component in the KV.  A typical KV battery is a right circular cylinder, which is not a volume efficient form factor, especially as the KV gets smaller.  The use of conformal batteries is the key to integrating the batteries into the irregular free space of a compact KV.  In the Phase II program, the integration of solid propulsion components, as well as conformal batteries, will be demonstrated via hardware manufacturing and testing.  The goal at the end of the program is to take the integration of these technologies to a technology readiness level of four.",

        "abstract": "Future performance goals for ballistic missile defense systems necessitate the development of zero-erosion throat materials for boost and tactical solid rocket motors. Increasing demands imposed by advanced solid propellants used in systems such as throttling divert and attitude control systems (TDACS) require zero-erosion materials for pintles and throats capable of surviving ultrahigh temperature thermal, chemical, and mechanical environments. The use of robust materials with broad operational capability leads to simpler and lower cost designs. Current Aerojet TDACS divert valve pintle designs employ a Novoltex silicon carbide (SiC) composite. As the system is upgraded and higher temperatures, pressures, and burn times are required, a refractory ceramic matrix composite (CMC) with a use temperature well beyond that of SiC will be needed. In previous work for DoD and NASA, Ultramet has fabricated a variety of carbon fiber-reinforced refractory CMC engine and airframe components using a rapid and low-cost melt infiltration process. CMCs based on various combinations of SiC, zirconium carbide, and hafnium carbide have been subjected to ultrahigh temperature testing in liquid and solid propellant combustion environments at NASA Glenn Research Center, the Air Force LHMEL facility, and ATK-GASL with surface temperatures as high as 5200\u00b0F. In each case, the material exhibited high structural integrity and virtually no erosion while at a substantially lower density than refractory metals such as tungsten and rhenium. The potential exists to adapt and optimize this technology for fabrication of components used in advanced TDACS under development by Aerojet. In Phase I, Ultramet established the initial feasibility of a melt infiltrated carbon fiber-reinforced zirconium-silicon carbide (Zr Si C) matrix composite for use as a TDACS divert valve pintle that offers substantial use temperature, manufacturing, and cost advantages over conventionally fabricated composites based on SiC. The project combined detailed structural and thermal analysis of the pintle by Materials Research and Design (MR&D), design support and guidance from Aerojet, and advanced composite material development at Ultramet. In Phase II, pintle materials and processing optimization will be expanded, in conjunction with comprehensive thermostructural analysis at MR&D and Aerojet design requirements input. The ultimate Phase II objectives are to demonstrate cost-effective manufacturing of zero-erosion Cf/Zr-Si-C composite divert valve pintles and establish their performance through two stages of hot-fire testing at Aerojet in a 5-inch pressure-controlled end-burning test motor under anticipated SM-3 Block IB and/or Block IIA TDACS operating conditions. Following successful Phase II results, Aerojet intends to rapidly transition to Phase III testing of full-scale pintles under the Block IIA program, quickly bringing the technology to TRL 6.",

The current method for capturing diagnostic and treatment data in the field is the use of a Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) Card (a.k.a. Ranger Card or DA FORM 7656) which more often than not is left blank in the heat of battle.  Hands free, voice recording of critical information at the scene would be a more effective method for capturing data in this situation.    That is if the recording device can withstand the rugged environment, and the voice recording can be made without interference from significant background noise.  Noise sources, like multiple rifle shots and engine or helicopter noise must be actively minimized, so that the recording can be played back without loss of fidelity.   IAI proposes to further develop the phase I portable data recorder design with superior noise canceling capabilities that are tailored to the specific noise environment of the battlefield as well as the unique operator pool of the US Military.",

        "abstract": "Active phased array radars are expensive and solid state power and low noise amplifiers are a major component of that expense. Sharing these amplifiers amongst many antenna elements is a strategy for reducing expense. However, in order to maintain independent phase control, the phase shifter and its attendant insertion loss must then be inserted between the amplifier and the aperture instead of being positioned behind the amplifiers. The phase shifter RF insertion loss then adds to the receiver noise figure and subtracts from the transmitter output which requires the phase shifter to have very low insertion loss (100 billion cycles) compatible with military requirements and RF power handling capacity (10 W) accommodating of many transmitter outputs. It is now possible to integrate these switches on a single substrate along with phase delay and advance networks to create an integrated phase shifter with the required performance parameters.",

Direct measurement of key biomechanical head impact variables from these blasts or impacts in real combat situations has been significantly limited by the measurement, storage and power technologies available in the correct form factor.  Furthermore, traditional approaches of data collection and post-processing are too limited (i.e. not enough memory, too large and expensive) and time consuming to provide clinically relevant information that can be used by medics for treatment decisions.

Due to the high incidence of this infection in military personnel attending the Jungle Warfare School in Panama, trials of doxycycline prophylaxis and therapy were performed on this population by US Army researchers. Soldiers deploying to tropical areas of the world continue to be at risk for leptospirosis. In endemic areas leptospirosis adversely affects operations due to both the morbidity of the soldiers and the difficulty of the differential diagnosis to the medical staff. The proposed immunochromatographic test would be a useful rapid diagnostic assay for the detection of leptospirosis in deployed soldiers with fever. The objective of this topic is to develop an FDA cleared, hand held diagnostic assay which can diagnose infection of virulent Leptospira species within one week after the onset of illness with sufficient sensitivity and specificity. The assay will utilize a lateral flow (dipsticks, with or without plastic housing) chromatography that enables detection of specific IgM and/or IgG antibodies directly from blood or serum samples without processing. The development of a specific IgM detection assay to detect early antibody responses will facilitate the treatment of military personnel presenting with febrile illness. In this Phase II we will complete the selection of acute infection target antigens that detect robust IgM and early IgG responses, and finalize development of a robust field compatible detection system. The reagent and rapid assay development are already at an advanced stage of development. IgM/IgG detection will continue to be optimized and then evaluated in panels of infection confirmed sera to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Lepto Detect assay. The ultimate performance of the assay will be at least 85% as sensitive as, and 95% as specific as current (non-deployable, non-FDA cleared) assays.",

        "abstract": "The Air Force is seeking new technology that will provide the means to accurately measure and monitor turbine inlet gas temperature in gas turbine engines, particularly in advanced engines operating at very high temperatures (>3,100 degree F).  In Phase I of this program, Advanced Fuel Research, Inc. demonstrated that turbine inlet gas temperature can be determined from non-intrusive measurements of the thermal radiation emitted by gases in the turbine inlet region.  A pattern recognition algorithm utilizing a neural network was developed to determine the temperature by monitoring the emission signatures of combustion products in the gas stream, despite the presence of thermal radiation from surrounding hot surfaces.  The technique is entirely passive, and provides a line-of-sight temperature measurement in the turbine inlet region without intrusion into the gas path.  In Phase II, the techniques demonstrated in Phase I will be extended and advanced to yield a deliverable prototype that provides accurate temperature measurements over the full range of temperatures and pressures encountered in advanced gas turbine engines.  During this development project, the Phase II prototype will be field tested on advanced combustion rigs at a private-sector research center and a federal research center. The deliverable system will provide significant benefits to the Air Force during the development testing of advanced engines, yielding engines with higher specific power, lower emissions, and increased efficiency.    BENEFIT:  The project will result in a product that will benefit the military and military aircraft engine industry and also find dual use by benefiting the commercial aircraft engine industry and power generation industry that utilize gas turbine engines.

        "abstract": "AVID has identified and demonstrated significant advantages of smart material aerodynamic actuators for micro air vehicles. The solid-state nature of this flight control actuation scheme allows for scalability to miniature sizes, as well as increases in overall reliability. The general approach to morphing flight control surfaces has been proven through the Phase I results. Aerodynamic predictions based on the experimental deflections have shown superior operation in every aerodynamic performance metric when compared to a servo-driven flapped airfoil design. Bench-top and wind-tunnel experiments show that the technology has the structural strength to support the operational loads, and the actuators can be produced at a reasonable cost. The objective of this project is to advance the smart material actuator system to the point where it can be demonstrated on a representative platform at a size, weight and power that will eliminate those questions as barriers to implementation on current and future micro air weapons and vehicles.  BENEFIT:  The proposed new flight control actuation technology can improve micro-UAVs by eliminating servos, linkages, and moving parts from the micro-air-vehicle. Servos are frequently identified as low reliability and problematic in the field; thus their removal can substantially increase performance and reliability while reducing size, weight and power. The ultimate goal is a solid-state aircraft with no servos, and airframes and control devices that can be stored for long periods of time with high probability of deployment success. The ability to apply this new technology to various air vehicle designs of scales is a key benefit. While the technology developed could be the basis for new vehicle designs, further benefit could be realized through integration with existing micro air vehicles; by re-adapting or re-using current MAV technology. Because this technology has the potential to scale to a variety of sizes, specifically to down to micro or nano scales, the U.S. Air Force, as well as other branches of the U.S. armed forces, could benefit from this UAV solution that does not sacrifice performance. Micro or nano scale UAV technology that enables a MAV to navigate tight city streets could be of potential use to Home Land Security and local law enforcement agencies as well. Additionally, at the conclusion of this effort, we expect to have a validated set of design tools, smart material concepts, fabrication techniques and control electronics designs that our partners Boeing and Honeywell are interested in applying to their systems.",

This phase of TRAMS follows previous efforts to formalize the range baseline of sites, capabilities, customers, and assets at the Eglin Test and Training Center (ETTC). TRAMS brings an innovative approach to range management by: promoting the consolidation of data views and analysis in a single set of tools, applying state-of-the-art visualization technology that is both powerful and inexpensive to acquire \u2013 the basic version of mapping technology is free, providing analysis tools and techniques that provide both horizontal (across organizational boundaries) and vertical (deep inspection) insight into actual and planned usage, and (4) promoting the use of repeatable analysis and proactive communications.  To increase the value of TRAMS, its design is capable of being easily applied to other bases besides the ETTC. Minimizing obsolescence and maximizing reuse are common themes in the commercial world.  TRAMS is designed for both of these capabilities and can handle the test of time. TRAMS will benefit government and contractors that are involved with operating and maintaining our nation\u2019s test/training ranges.   BENEFIT:  Adding Operational Analytics to the TRAMS Range Baseline system will allow the DoD (and its Range Support contractors) to achieve the efficiency improvements and to improve its planning abilities in the same fashion as modern, successful commercial organizations. TRAMS Operational Analytics will provide the ability to visualize information composed of disparate data sources and across multiple organizations. It will also provide the capability to analyze data using this composite information. The cross-domain analysis and inspection will reduce the likelihood of schedule conflicts, will allow Range Operations and Management personnel to minimize waste in regards to personnel, tasks, locations of work, transit times, equipment maintenance, site preparation/reconstitution, and many other potential sources of inefficiencies. Commercial ventures understand that information is their most valuable asset. And that its value grows exponentially as more types of information are combined into a unified, composite system. The composite view of information provided by TRAMS Operational Analytics will create a more sound basis for planning decisions and, therefore, remove the need to leave \u2018play\u2019 or \u2018margin\u2019 in schedules and asset allocation. Reducing the \u2018play\u2019 involved in future planning will allow the government and its commercial partners to maintain and operate our military ranges in a more efficient manner. TRAMS has the potential to be used at most Major Range and Test Facility Bases throughout the US and will benefit the DoD services that control these ranges, the support contractors that assist with operations and maintenance on the ranges, and with the military and contractor companies that design, manufacture, and test equipment.  Furthermore, with the ever-increasing amount of joint-use bases, TRAMS has the potential to also benefit the training missions that often share space and assets in the test environments.",

        "abstract": "Despite continuous improvements in military tactics and technology, casualties still remain. Phase I examined the idea of the \u201cfirst five firefights\u201d to identify if Soldiers have an increased likelihood of becoming a casualty during the initial days of their tour. Research consisted of gathering and compiling Soldier fatality data, conducting interviews (individual and group) with Soldiers and Marines, and building and evaluating human performance models of typical fatality scenarios. We have identified that a Soldier has three particularly vulnerable periods for becoming a combat casualty:  1) within the first two months, 2) during the middle of the tour, and 3) during the last month. Even with current training methods, the Soldiers we interviewed in Phase I expressed concern that training is not sufficiently current or realistic, and there is a strong need for just-in-time training and more up-to-date information to combat ever-changing enemy tactics. This proposal discusses our concept for improving the methods in which Soldiers are informed of changing enemy tactics, Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), Rules of Engagement (ROEs), as well as current day Soldier training through the use of software and hardware collaboration technologies. The result of this work will aim to increase Soldier survivability during conflict.",

        "abstract": "Critical to the success of distributed sensor fusion for IAMD is the ability of each network sensor to correctly associate sensor measurement and attribute data to tracked objects within the air/missile picture. To achieve this, multi-sensor fusion requires sensor registration techniques that ensure network sensor are sufficiently synchronized and spatially aligned. The goal of sensor registration is to reduce the range of uncertainty inherent in a given single radar by considering the \"cross correlations\" that exist between the data on common tracks observed by network sensors. Our approach to sensor registration is to provide geodetically aligned sensor data within a component based distributed architecture using methods that act on geodetic calibration tracks and other fiducial data points common to the distributed sensors to produce location and orientation bias estimates at each sensor. The distributed architecture allows each sensor to compute local biases and apply the computed \u201coffsets\u201d prior to distribution of track data to the tracking network. Sensor registration using simultaneous observation of selected common tracks and fiducial points among distributed sensors has the potential to compute a local sensor registration solution by averaging out the uncorrelated random bias errors that will be present within the ensemble of networked sensors.",

We address two specific gaps: measuring depth of surface breaking cracks; detecting buried/subsurface cracks emanating from manufacturing anomalies. We will advance linear drive eddy current arrays for disbond, delamination, impact damage and manufacturing anomaly imaging in carbon fiber composite blades.  Linear drive eddy current sensor arrays, called MWM-Arrays, overcome limitations of circular coils by enabling substantial induced eddy currents to be formed in the  carbon fibers. In Phase I we successfully demonstrated impact damage and manufacturing anomaly imaging for uniaxial and biaxial fiber composites.

        "abstract": "Laser projectors provide brilliant and reproducible colors and large depth of infinite focus on flat or curved screens without compromising color saturation and brightness. However, lasers bring the speckle problem that manifests as random variation in image intensity resulting from interference of many scattered coherent laser light waves.  Phase II technical objectives are to demonstrate speckle reduction through coherence collapse in a novel display architecture and to prototype a speckle reduced optical subassembly suitable for integration inside the integrated photonics module subsystem.  This new and innovative research and development effort will deliver and test a prototype to confirm that this approach can achieve system level speckle contrast to below 5% and that a viable commercialization path forward exists.  Several existing or potential military applications could benefit from speckle reduction commercialization efforts.  Large laser-based projectors that provide high visual acuity scenes in weapons system simulators would benefit from image quality improvements so that pilots could acquire targets at maximum detection ranges. Additionally, two potential ground force applications include using laser projectors for small unit pre-operation briefings or for Key leader Engagements and using small embedded laser projector in communications or computer systems for warfighter to access downlink streaming content.  BENEFIT:  The anticipated results of this proposed approach enables the Air Force Science and Technology experts within the Research Lab to confirm that a coherence collapse speckle reduction technology can be prototyped in a dynamic laser environment and made practicable for Phase III commercialization efforts. Phase II results will prove that operating the red, green and blue lasers in the state of coherence collapse is a viable technique for speckle contrast reduction below 5%. The technique proposes to reduce speckle noise without employing any moving mechanical parts and requires no additional electronics. Most importantly, this effort will prove that a practical approach towards speckle free laser projector development exists at very small additional cost.",

        "abstract": "Motion blur or smear can limit the performance of digital display systems.  Smear comes from two main display attributes \u2013 their non-zero response time and their finite hold time.    The first effect causes the image from one frame to persist into the subsequent frame, while the second effect ensures that the image generated at the beginning of a frame of video is present up to the very end of that frame, regardless of the speed of response of the device.  The human visual system interprets this persistence with moving imagery as smear. Because of the much smaller market represented by head mounted displays, little effort has been devoted to reducing smear in microdisplays.  A simulator HMD with noticeable smear will cause negative training and will not allow pilots to use their sensors and displays as effectively as they could.  In a fighter cockpit, smear will be the limiting device in a multimillion dollar sensor suite. For our Phase II effort we will concentrate on improving hold-time smear for OLED displays that are critical to a USAF digital night vision HMD being developed by SA Photonics as well as multiple HMDs for training and simulation.   BENEFIT:  The benefits of this Phase II effort will be a reduced smear OLED display for use in multiple military and commercial applications.  Reducing smear in an OLED display will improve sensor imagery thereby ensuring that the microdisplay does not limit the performance of an expensive sensor system.

These flat surfaces produce unwanted retro-reflections.  During Phase I Translume demonstrated a femtosecond-laser based process to fabricate subsurface reticles in the bulk of flat or curved glass substrates.  Subsurface reticles have much lower retroreflection than traditional reticles.  Numerous prototypes were produced.  We showed that we could locally change the index of refraction of the glass, thus creating features that can guide, or diffract light propagating through the glass.  We also created scattering features that block or diffract light.  The intensity of the scattering can be controlled over a large dynamic range.   During Phase II we will employ these manufacturing processes to fabricate low reflectivity, high contrast, aberration-corrected, embedded reticles for the Leupold Mark 4 3.5-10x40mm Rifle Scope, which is used on the M110 7.62mm Semi-Automatic Sniper System (SASS).

        "abstract": "Hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN)-based monopropellants promise many improvements over monopropellant hydrazine and bipropellant nitrogen tetroxide/monomethyl hydrazine (NTO/MMH). But before HAN-based monopropellants can be commercialized, a reliable ignition system must be implemented. In this Phase II project Ultramet, working with American Pacific Corporation (AMPAC) In-Space Propulsion, will develop an ignition system for HAN-based monopropellants based on a monolithic open-cell foam catalyst bed that will be a non-sintering drop-in replacement for granular catalyst beds. As demonstrated in Phase I, several benefits are afforded by resistively heating the foam bed. Less electrical energy is used to heat the catalyst bed because the heat is generated within the bed, so surrounding hardware such as the combustion chamber is heated less. The ramp rate to operating temperature is very fast: less than 2 seconds to reach over 1100\u00b0C. The high preheat temperature realized by heating the foam directly enables reliable ignition with fast lightoff time. And, operating the resistance heater during propellant flow offers a performance advantage. In a 1- to 2-lbf class thruster, an additional 7 seconds of specific impulse is possible. In Phase II, laboratory testing will demonstrate the ability of the foam-based ignition system to transfer thermal energy to a stream of flowing propellant under a range of conditions, such as bed volume and flow rate at various power levels. The temperature and heat capacity of the liquid used for this laboratory simulation will be approximately that of AF-315e monopropellant in a satellite on orbit. After selecting the foam based on material type, pore size, and density, attention will be turned to designing the foam resistojet by incorporating electrode attachments and provisions for electrical feedthrough into the chamber. The iridium or platinum-iridium alloy wire electrodes will be attached to the foam by plasma spraying or chemical vapor deposition bonding with iridium metal. Electrical feedthrough will be accomplished by incorporating a thin spacer between AMPAC\u2019s existing injector and combustion chamber through which the insulated current-carrying wires will run axially. The overall goal of the project will be to further develop the foam igniter and, working with AMPAC, test it in several ways. Initial hot-fire testing will be performed on a monolithic piece of foam coated with iridium. A conventional bed heater will be used (no resistojet function) and testing performed in standard fashion as if granular catalyst were being used. Subsequent testing will be performed in the form of an electrothermal thruster, in which current is applied to foam occupying the full bed length. The final test will be a hybrid approach using a thin disk of foam just downstream of the injector and the remainder of the bed filled with granular catalyst. The specific impulse increase afforded by the foam-based electrothermal thruster will be characterized. In all tests, the goal will be to demonstrate restart capability after one hour of testing time. The project seeks to advance the state of the art in AF-315e ignition and may be leveraged in Spiral 2 efforts under AMPAC\u2019s Multi-Mode Propulsion System (MMPS) program.",

To date, several sensors covering different spectral ranges are used for this purpose. Next generation imaging systems require single sensor that can detect multiple spectral bands (350 to 2500 nm of wavelengths) and could be used for multiple imaging. Using of single sensor having multifunctional capability can make the system unusually small, light and low-power requirement. Today\u2019s image sensors are designed to work either in visible or in near infrared region. None of those can provide broad spectral response near UV to shortwave infrared (SWIR). A goal in Phase-II program is to carry on research and development of proposed multispectral image sensor array (both Linear and 2-dimensional)  having higher quantum efficiency > 80% over entire spectral ranges, for showing its benefits over conventional image sensor. Banpil will demonstrate: (a) modeling and simulation of the proposed image sensor and also nano-scaled image sensor as the risk mitigate, (b) design and fabrication of proposed image sensor, and (c) demonstrate broad spectral ranges from near UV to SWIR in Phase-II. Recognizing the vast application potential of Banpil\u2019s image sensors, several industrial partners have expressed strong interest in commercializing this technology. During  Phase II, Banpil will work with several leading image sensor companies who expressed strong interest on proposed multispectral image sensors, as a part of commercialization of the image sensor technology.",

Site managers must integrate heterogeneous technical information with stakeholder values and expert judgment. Current tools available do not explicitly incorporate decision analysis methods to support decision-making in complex environments, stakeholder opinions or economic information. Separating these components makes it difficult to consider and communicate the factors involved in decision-making. A comprehensive, decision-support platform is required to seamlessly integrate these many factors and estimate their effects. Aptima is developing the PLatform for ANalyzing Environmental Tradeoffs (PLANET) software system to combine rich, data-driven environmental model outputs with dynamic stakeholder opinions and multi-criteria analysis and decision-support tools necessary for rigorous consideration and communication of environmental management decisions. PLANET will allow users to input data from many sources; elicit stakeholder opinion over time; perform analysis required to evaluate environmental risks and anticipated outcomes of intervention alternatives; import, view and manipulate shape files from advanced geo-statistical analysis; and view and interact with results and data through trade-off information shown on graphical displays and a GIS component.

        "abstract": "The U. S. Air Force has identified a need to develop innovative technologies that will enable miniaturization of micro air vehicles (MAV), and future micro air weapons (MAW), to allow these platforms to be sufficiently compact to accommodate diverse deployment scenarios.  Smaller airframes necessarily require that airframe components be miniaturized to provide adequate volume for mission payloads.  In particular, the Air Force has earmarked flight control actuation devices as critical components requiring miniaturization. The conventional approach for control surface deflection in small air vehicle has involved the use of analog or digital servos.  The Phase I program demonstrated that piezo-electric actuators could replace conventional servos and provide comparable control and manuverability during radio-controlled flight.  The objective of the Phase II effort is to transition from an RC prototype aircraft to a fully autonomous, bird-size, piezo-equipped tactical MAV that exhibits payload and weight benefits relative to conventional servos, while providing the optimum control authority to precisely maneuver the air vehicle.  BENEFIT:  There are numerous non-military applications of the peizo-actuated control surface technology that will be logical by-products of the military applications.  Camera-equipped MAVs have great potential for surveillance and monitoring tasks in areas either too remote or too dangerous to send human scouts.  MAVs will enable a number of important missions, including chemical/radiation spill monitoring, forest-fire reconnaissance, visual monitoring of volcanic activity, surveys of natural disaster areas, and even inexpensive traffic and accident monitoring.  Additional on-board sensors can further augment MAV mission profiles to include, for example, airborne chemical analysis. Also, RC models may be the most intriguing commercial application for piezo-actuated control surfaces.  RC enthusiasts are always looking for the next \u201cgadget\u201d for their gas-powered and electric planes.  Today\u2019s electric flight packs generally include a pair a servos, an ESC, and an RC receiver and crystal.  It is quite conceivable that future flight packs could include a pair of piezo-electric actuators and a small DC boost circuit, along with the ESC and receiver.",

Advanced turbulence modeling features such as scalar fluctuation modeling, compressibility and baroclinic torque corrections, and relizable k-e; extensions will be incorporated in an adaptive strategy to provide a unified turbulence model suited for application over the missile body, base region, and plume.

The technology is innovative in that it uses a data-driven modeling methodology which has generic application to both high and low bandwidth signals and is capable of detecting subtle changes in signals resulting from calibration or sensor drift issues. This approach is highly scalable (not limited to the number of sensors) so it can be applied across any ship system and readily supports the condition-based maintenance (CBM) and mission readiness philosophies of the US Navy. Specific signal processing and data-driven modeling techniques will be developed for this purpose. The software modules will utilize open-systems protocols to support integration into Navy systems such as ICAS, MELS and the I/E-PARS reporting system. The signal health software module will focus on early Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) of faulty and corrupted data, with reporting functions. The module will be capable of real-time sensor fault detection (wired or wireless) and recovery from sensor faults using the signal\u2019s predicted value until the sensor is repaired or replaced.

The package will employ modified CRACK3D code and use VCCT with 10-noded tetrahedral elements to determine fatigue crack tip parameters (e.g. dK1, dK2, etc.) for fatigue cracks undergoing (a) mixed mode, in-phase fatigue conditions and/or (b) out-of-phase fatigue conditions, performing research that compares experimental evidence to computational predictions.  To simplify the computational overhead, a computational model database with multiple selected flaw geometries and specimen configurations (e.g., corner crack from hole in tension) will be developed and a graphical user interface developed to efficiently convert model data into CRACK3D format for rapid analysis capability of scaled geometric configurations.  BENEFIT:  Automated scaling of models in the database will increase productivity of aerospace engineering personnel by simplifying the process of (a) building a FE model with cracks in several sizes and configures, (b) automating extraction of information necessary for decision making and (c) extending the concepts not only to uniaxial fatigue but to mixed mode fatigue conditions and even out-of-phase fatigue so that such conditions can be evaluated when necessary. It is expected that initial commercialization will be focused on the USAF and other DoD agencies requiring the use of the specific specimen geometries developed during Phase  Additional commercialization will focus on specific structural areas where fatigue crack growth simulations are required on a consistent basis and the need is highest (e.g., tier 1 suppliers). Since the modules developed during this phase will reduce the cost of man power required for conducting crack growth simulations and minimize the requirement on engineer\u2019s knowledge for correct use of the our simulation tool, expansion into these areas is consistent with the capabilities of the Phase II software.",

Harnesses and connectors are subject to operational concerns such as wire crosses, insulation damage due to thermal or vibration effects, and limited mate/de-mate cycles for connectors.  Design considerations such as minimum harness bend radii, separation forces required for connectors, and securing harnesses to withstand vibration add to the development and qualification costs.

        "abstract": "21st Century Technologies (21CT) proposes SHARP, a planning capability for dynamic resource management in work scope optimization for High Velocity Maintenance (HVM). SHARP is based on past 21CT efforts in dynamic and optimal resource allocation, using our ATO-Stream technologies.  The ATO-Stream technologies solve planning problems similar to those encountered in work scope optimization, strategic logistics and prognostic logistics, all needs in HVM. The generic planning capability is made possible in the way that ATO-Stream was architected from the start \u2013 with an adaptable architecture to solve resource allocation problems in domains other than just ATO planning. Dynamic resource management is accomplished with algorithms that immediately account for and continuously re-plan to address changes in the environment. Both the planning architecture and the resource management algorithms serve as the engine for ATO-Stream, which we refer to as X-Stream. X-Stream has now been used in various environments and will serve as an ideal foundation for the SHARP effort by modeling all the relevant information that needs resource management: e.g. equipment, resources, requirements, repair methods, time and schedules. The X-stream framework will then provide the capability to continuously update schedules and plans in real time and adapt to a changing environment.   BENEFIT:  SHARP provides an effects-based perspective of planning and scheduling logistics. It will account for loss of institutional knowledge by fusing knowledge from existing expert systems, automatically account for disruptions in the supply chain, such as unscheduled maintenance, and improve forecasting accuracy for scheduling and parts availability, leading to additional tactical and strategic benefits. Tactical Benefit \u2013 Aircraft availability increases, while average time and effort for repairs decrease. Strategic Benefit \u2013 Savings in time, energy and cost. SHARP produces efficient work optimization that bunches up energy intensive tasks, schedules for symbiotic tasks, or time slot scheduling for lower power rates.",

To this end, PEO SUB requires technology initiatives that contribute to the goal of controlling multiple sensors using a common open architecture solution thereby contributing to volume-based cost reduction, mast consolidation and the resulting cost reduction. A key to this initiative is the development of an isolation layer between the inboard systems and the outboard sensors. Thereby enabling the Navy to quickly and efficiently substitute alternative masts based on need. In addition, operation and maintenance costs reduction will be fostered. Improved abilities to efficiently manage mast spares including masts from alternate suppliers is a high priority need. The engineering development models (EDM) resulting from this Phase II SBIR will be used to demonstrate an approach to common mast control. This effort will significantly reduce overall cost of ownership for all applicable classes and supports the Reduced Total Ownership Cost (RTOC) initiative.",

A TTS system converts written text into spoken language. There are numerous commercial TTS systems; however, most systems do not allow for speed control of the output speech. In the simulation-based virtual training system, TTS systems are used to generate the voice of the virtual role-players. The ability to control the speaking speed of TTS output without sacrificing intelligibility will support a range of fast operational and training scenarios for Aviation Training Systems. Phase I was focused on the feasibility study of developing a variable speed speech synthesis technology. This proposal is a continuous effort toward Phase II, where the main goal is to develop a working prototype to enable realistic and adjustable speed control of synthetic speech that is intelligible enough to support a range of fast pace operational and training scenarios.

        "abstract": "The objective of Phase II R&D concerns micro air vehicles (MAVs). These MAVs are typically used for remote, surreptitious surveillance using video links.  Under Phase I, AetherMachines Inc. has developed and test flown a MAV employing many new features which extend MAV capabilities and mission duration significantly. First, it has a very unique \u2018insect like\u2019 topology which enables great maneuverability, gives the ability to perch on a power line or tree limb, allows the MAV to land and crawl terrestrially, permits aiming and discharge an offensive payload. The MAV design is also equipped with specialty scavenging circuitry which allows it to collect energy from sources including the sun and power lines. Coupled with its ability to perch, this scavenging capability gives greatly extended loiter missions, without the need for circling or hovering flight, making it highly unobtrusive and useful as a rapidly deployable video link or feed. The MAV\u2019s video link is augmented with a GPS on screen display overlay to provide positional, altitude, and velocity information to the operator. The video link can also be used with virtual reality type goggles for a complete FPV (first person view) while flying or perched.   BENEFIT:  Anticipated benefits of Phase II R&D result from the production of commercial grade MAV prototypes and scavenging circuits developed from the Phase I feasibility prototype. These commercial grade prototypes represent a rapidly deployable video source that provides surveillance for extended periods in support of objectives for military, law enforcement, media and entertainment, R&D organizations such as colleges and universities, commercial entities such as power and gas pipeline companies, and to the general radio control hobby community. These prototypes can be demonstrated and marketed to prospective customers and used to attract Phase III investors. Specific MAV subsystems and features, such as power scavenging circuits, insect like flight control algorithms, video and R/C links, and carbon fiber/foam and carbon fiber balsa construction materials and techniques can be marketed separately, or used to enable new commercial products.",

        "abstract": "This effort continues the development of \"OrthopterNets\" -- a novel approach applying mobile ad hoc network (MANET) communications networks for the transfer of intelligent information via insect calls (e.g., cricket calls). Insects will be equipped with embedded MEMS transceivers that pick up modulated calling sounds from nearby insects. Once the information in a call is extracted by the transceiver, the information code is applied to an electromechanical device on board the insect that modulates the insect calls, thereby retransmitting the information to another insect, and so on. The modulation mechanism, among other methods, affects the sound producing movements (stridulation) of an insect''''s wings. Human or machine-based detectors would demodulate and extract the transmitted information. Work leverages existing MEMS technologies already deployed in insect species by the team and elsewhere. Phase II will draw on our Phase I findings to implement OrthopterNet prototypes by applying MEMS devices,  a special-purpose ad hoc networking protocol, and off-the shelf electronic components.

Although these methods are based on rigorous integral or partial differential equation formulations, they cannot presently solve electrically large problems of EM radiation pattern and coupling prediction associated with antennas on aircraft at higher frequencies (S/X/Ku/Ka bands). On the other hand, asymptotic high frequency (HF) methods, whose accuracy increases with frequency, such as the physical optics (PO) method and its modifications based on the physical theory of diffraction (PTD), require an integration of the surface currents over the lit portion of the platform, so they also do not scale with frequency. At those frequencies uniform geometrical theory of diffraction (UTD) is very efficient and provides a physical picture for antenna radiation mechanisms and EM interactions with the aircraft platform in terms of rays at high frequencies. However, simulation of the platform using UTD so far is accomplished using a combination of canonical objects, limiting the use of codes based on UTD for complex structures such as fight aircraft etc. Applied EM along with its team members successfully demonstrated during Phase II application of UTD for faceted CAD geometries. Applied EM developed an advanced tool, uCAST based on UTD applicable to CAD geometries along with an interface to commercial tools.

        "abstract": "The pressing need for high-fidelity transient, nonlinear, viscous, fluid-structure simulations arises in the solution of many important engineering problems. These include not only the design of high-performance aircraft where flutter, limit cycle oscillation, and buffeting remain the most important considerations, but also new emerging applications such as the aeroelastic tailoring of front and rear wings of racing cars, the control of flow-induced noise in various military and commercial systems, and the design of biomedical micro devices. All of these complex systems contain some form of gap-generating surfaces whose modeling challenges current viscous fluid-structure simulation technologies. During Phase I of this research project, an order-of-accuracy-preserving arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian computational framework was developed for enabling the computation of unsteady viscous flows past dynamic aeroelastic systems with opening and closing gaps. The feasibility of this new computational framework was also demonstrated. Hence, Phase II of this research project will focus on tightly integrating this new capability in the AERO Suite of Codes deployed at the Edwards Air Force Base, and maturing the application of the resulting new computational technology to the viscous fluid-structure simulation of real-world complex systems containing challenging gap-generating surfaces.   BENEFIT:  The anticipated success of this research and development effort will not only extend the range of applications of ALE codes in general, and the AERO Suite of Codes deployed at the Edwards Air Force Base in particular, to viscous applications with arbitrary control surface deflections, but also to the unsteady analysis of flows past supersonic air intakes with movable flaps or plugs, and  the aeroelastic analysis of turbines and rotorcraft. Hence, the success of this effort  will boost the potential for commercialization of the AERO Suite of Codes by expanding its range of applications.",

Daylight Solutions plans to develop a compact mid-IR quantum cascade laser (QCL) source that is suitable for optical communications and high-power applications, has broad tunability for spectroscopic applications, and is highly manufacturable in a Telecom package.  The Phase I effort consisted of proof-of-principle demonstrations of a mid-IR QCL that can be assembled in a reliable way in a compact package, has good frequency selectivity, and is wavelength tunable over a limited range with a movable MEMS grating.  Building on the technical success of the Phase I program, the objectives of the Phase II effort are to a) redesign the optical layout for improved beam characteristics and thermal load capacity, b) simplify the repeatable construction of these devices through robotic placement of components, and c) incorporate new MEMS tuning elements for frequency selective feedback over a significantly broader tuning range.  The successful completion of the Phase II program will provide the necessary stepping stones to Phase III.

The proposed Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems will be specifically designed to detect damages in multi-layered structural components (up to five layers) under harsh environmental condition. A robust damage detection algorithm using frequency sweep scheme, innovative actuation pattern and wave feature extraction will be developed to \u2018see\u2019 corrosion damage in the order of few hundredth of an inch. The proposed system is integrated with a portable hardware device (on-board sensors/connector and off-board plug and play system with data analyzer).

The proposed work is based on historical and current operational and maintenance data available in a number of disparate databases. Data mining techniques will be applied to operational data and depot level maintenance records obtained from these databases. These techniques will make it possible to forecast future maintenance needs and assess different variability in overhaul workflow. Workflow models will be used to implement an interface to allow interchangeability of such models and develop optimization capabilities that take into account all aspects of workflow problems. Using the data mining results, work package and workflow optimization in the face of limited resources, short timelines and increasing requirements will be implemented. Shop floor managers will be able to use the work package optimization tool with their own custom workflow models to investigate different \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios and work around contingencies as they arise. Specifically the core innovations of the proposed work include: 1) a data mining module for analyzing historical data; 1) an interface to \u201cplug-n-play\u201d proprietary workflow models; and 3) a work package optimization module that provides decision support for proactive maintenance planning, contingency management, and capacity planning.  BENEFIT:  This framework for work package optimization technology will help existing and future Air Force and DoD programs reach improved fleet readiness objectives and total ownership cost initiatives. The technology will play an important role in providing the war fighter with significant combat advantage by maximizing asset availability and reducing maintenance down-time. The software will take full advantage of the large amounts of maintenance data available in multiple disparate databases. It will also be able to benefit from and provide added value to High Velocity Maintenance (HVM) initiatives that are gaining traction at US Air Force Air logistics Centers (ALC) and widely used in the industry. The objectives will be achieved through the development of a framework for workflow and work package optimization leveraging data from multiple databases. The data will be mined for interesting patterns and trends which in-turn will provide inputs to workflow models and enable work package optimization. Because effective military operations hinge on the ability to quickly and accurately perform maintenance tasks, there exist numerous potential military applications for the proposed work package optimization tool in all branches of the U.S. DoD. The development effort will include an interface to \u201cplug-n-play\u201d workflow models instead of being restricted to one or a few specific ones thus allowing the user to drop in the appropriate model that represents their workflow of interest. Given the adaptable nature of the core analysis and optimization techniques proposed, the developed approach could easily be adapted for a variety of commercial applications.

The first quality measurement is often done well after all processing is complete.  Unfortunately, the composition/quality of these explosives can vary significantly due to metering errors, process variations, and delivery blockages.  Even a small variation in the mix composition can severely impact the performance, reliability, and safety of the explosive.  This initiative would apply unique, ultrasonic-sensing technology to monitor the quality of explosives manufacturing.    Ultrasound sensors can be completely isolated from the explosives, making it low power and safe for operators.  Ultrasound can be used to continually monitor the composition, contaminants and load quality of explosives.  The proposed effort would provide key quality measurements at an early stage rather than after the process is finished.  For example, if significant variations in composition are detected during batch processing, adjustments to feed rates or mass balances could be changed to ensure final product quality.  Phase II will pursue advanced development of an ultrasound probe for process monitoring of explosives manufacturing.  The probe will be proved out at an Army Ammunition Plant and will be available for commercialization to both military and private sector companies.",

        "abstract": "To-date, the realization of VTOL personal air vehicles capable of executing agile missions has largely been limited by the availability of high T/W, low fuel-consumption propulsion systems with minimal noise and IR signatures. Metis Design proposes the development of an innovative, high T/W, low-TSFC turbofan in the 200-1,000 lbf thrust-class for a variety of air-vehicle applications. The proposed concept uses a novel means for coupling a high-speed turbojet core with a low-speed fan spool so as to realize a high bypass ratio turbofan (and hence, low-TSFC) in a light-weight, low-cost manner without the use of a mechanical coupling or gearbox. The critical aspects of this coupling have already been demonstrated as part of a previous DARPA-funded effort; the proposed Phase II effort therefore seeks to adapt the engine and demonstrate critical high-risk elements of the proposed technology.  The Phase II effort will also demonstrate how the warm exhaust from a small turbofan engine can be used to power an all composite liftfan with a high thrust-to-weight ratio that makes it suitable for PAV application.",

        "abstract": "Automated object recognition is an important and challenging problem. The technology is crucial for a number of Army applications including video surveillance, Automatic Target Recognition and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. While feature-based or template matching-based classification algorithms are used in certain Army applications, it has been observed that their classification accuracy depends on the quality of the training dataset. Often the lack of a representative set of training images severely affects performance. Moreover, the algorithms generally perform poorly when the object is occluded. Each of these methods addresses certain aspects of recognition while ignoring others. In phase I of this project, an innovative psychologically-inspired approach in which Geon-theory and Feature-based recognition algorithms are integrated together to provide a comprehensive solution to robust object recognition was successfully explored.

Such a nitrogen polymer will be a highly attractive material for a range of defense and civilian applications. Polymeric-nitrogen will provide high-energy density due to the difference between single nitrogen bonds in the polymer and triple bonds in molecular nitrogen. The objective of the proposed Phase II effort will be to optimize and scale-up by modeling and experiments the down-selected synthetic approach, which will involve a combination of electrochemical and plasma-polymerization processes demonstrated in Phase I. The plasma process will use nitrogen mixed with argon as precursor and carbon nanotube sheets electrochemically functionalized with polymeric-nitrogen clusters as substrates. Plasma polymerization and electrochemical deposition are widely used in industry and are therefore expected to be scalable and cost-effective.  Polymeric-nitrogen stabilized on carbon nanotubes will have the potential for extensive military applications as an insensitive energetic that is extremely stable until initiated at temperatures above 300oC as initially demonstrated by differential thermal calorimetry. Commercial entities would find use for the polymer as a precursor for producing highly bioavailable drugs and for nitrogen-cluster doped carbon nanotubes as an efficient fuel cell catalyst/support system.",

The STS-Probe Toolbox provides access to critical WF and PF traffic on multiple processors and the interaction between these processors along with near real-time data visualizations for efficient and accurate host and target side debugging. This enables rapid resolution of radio performance and standards compliance issues resulting in a decreased development schedule.

        "abstract": "Maintaining the health of fluid systems has always been critical to preventing problems and keeping Air Force equipment at a high state of readiness and availability. Current fluid quality practices in most applications still rely heavily on off-line analysis to screen for oil quality, debris, and contaminations. While off-line laboratory analysis may be the most accurate means to identify oil properties and degradations, it tends to be slow, labor intensive, expensive, and perhaps surprisingly, rife with opportunity for contamination or operator errors.There is an opportunity to improve aircraft system availability by installing on-line fluid quality monitoring systems.  In this program, two opportunities will be addressed. Hydraulic system mules are used by ground crew to power onboard hydraulic system when aircraft are on the ground. These systems often power multiple systems on a single aircraft and are often moved between aircraft. A custom sensor package will be developed and deployed to continuously monitor hydraulic oil health. Second, Impact Technologies has developed a novel fluid quality sensor targeting lubricating oils. This phase of the program will prove the feasibility of utilizing this proprietary sensor onboard C-130 aircraft by demonstrating its performance on a T-56 engine/gearbox test cell.    BENEFIT:  Lubrication and hydraulic oil contamination and breakdown can lead to performance degradation or failure in many systems. While experts\u2019 estimates on the percentage of all mechanical failures that are lubricant related vary between 30 and 80%, all of these estimates are unacceptably high when even a single failure can have catastrophic consequences. Maintaining proper oil health is especially challenging in military equipment expected to perform at and sometimes beyond their design limits in a broad range of environmental conditions. Poor oil health can stem from a number of natural sources such as water ingress, insufficient cooling, dirt/silica ingress, and additive depletion as well as more anomalous sources such as improper/infrequent servicing and mechanical failure (cracked seals, metallic debris).  Because maintaining proper oil health is critical to safe operation of mechanical systems, and because conventional schedule-based maintenance intervals and oil sampling routines still allow for significant contamination and degradation to occur, an in-situ, on-line monitoring mechanism is required. There are numerous benefits of an online approach including:  \u2022 Detection of improper servicing alerting maintainers and operators when a non standard lubricant is detected.  \u2022 General improvement in hydraulic fluid systems maintenance enabling the eventual implementations of Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) practices.  \u2022 General improvement in lubrication maintenance enabling reductions in total cost of ownership and safety of flight.  \u2022 Improved data availability enabling depot and AF-wide variability analysis.  \u2022 Provide monitoring between fluid sampling periods decreasing the opportunity for missed detections caused by sudden changes in fluid conditions.  \u2022 Provide time, platform and fluid type correlated data allowing for detailed root cause analysis.  \u2022 Rapid and accurate detection of fluid contaminants reducing the potential damage to aircraft and increased flight safety.  \u2022 Trigger lubrication system maintenance actions reducing oil sampling and oil change frequency.",

The centerpiece of Phase II is the primary set of process workflows which provide for the accomplishment of Supply Chain Management (SCM) mission objectives.  This will be achieved through the use of normalization techniques; a common methodology in data integration and fusion. It will also employ strict semantic rules and symbology standards which will alleviate ambiguity and enforce consistency across processes and organizations. The framework will be scalable through the employment of \"process modules\" which can be combined to address large-scale or complex processes. The framework will also employ extensibility mechanisms, based on commercial and web-based protocols. This will ensure compliance, if necessary, with Net-Centric guidance and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) requirements. All efforts under Phase II will be focused on Reverse Engineering, and the prototype Engineering Decision Support System (EDSS) will include support for reverse engineering of mechanical parts. This exemplary workflow was selected due to its high degree of complexity and its high level of criticality to parts supply deficiencies. Development of a solution framework for a complex, critical process will demonstrate its extensibility to simpler processes.

By taking advantage of multipath propagations, MIMO can provide orders of magnitude improved performance in terms of range, power consumption, and data throughput in NLOS multipath rich environments. Application of MIMO to JTRS based waveforms could provide significant performance enhancements. Silvus will modify its MIMO radios to operate in the JTRS frequency and quantify the benefits after a series of in depth field trials.",

        "abstract": "There is a growing interest in employing modeling and simulation technology as a low-cost substitute to live Air-Traffic Control (ATC) exercises. One popular approach is to replace human role-players with computer-generated forces (CGFs). Here, the trainer must encode the behaviors of CGFs participating in each exercise. This task requires modeling expertise, which the trainer likely lacks, and familiarity with the various types of simulations and CGF platforms that exercises could support. At run-time, this burden shifts to the simulation operators responsible for real-time control of the CGFs. Operators must be familiar with both the nature and capabilities of these platforms, and of the simulation, so that they can properly issue tasking. Soar Technology has designed a system to help ease the burden on both the scenario developer and run-time operators of ATC and related simulation exercises. For the trainer, we have designed the Tiger Board \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an intuitive user interface customized for the composition of behavior models for ATC simulation exercises. These models connect to SoarTech\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Universal Controller, which will allow constructed models to operate in a variety of popular simulation platforms. We propose to implement this system during Phase II, and integrate it into an existing ATC training environment.",

The LADAR is an extension of SPEC LADAR family, operating at 1550nm, making use of communications fiber optic components, minimizing cost, development time and size.  The receiver utilizes SPEC\u2019s pipeline processing LADAR receiver, capturing waveforms of the first three objects in range per pixel, with range accuracy to 3mm.  The LADAR allows all weather operation with 5km range in all but heavy thunderstorm (4km) and fog (twice the visual range).  The LADAR architecture features a fiber laser and optically amplified receiver achieving 6/1 s/n on single photon detects.  A dual Fresnel style prism director allows large area search, small area scan or FOR tracking modes.  The total LADAR package is 3.5 inches diameter by 8 inches long, with power under 100 watts, dominated by laser pump power.  LADAR image processing will be handled by HyperX matrix processor, a fabric of 100 processors on a chip, clock by clock reconfigurable, having power per flop 1/10 competitive units.  The LADAR will be capable of classifying, guiding the round to the target, and discrimination of targets.  Last pixel processing allows locating targets under heavy foliage and camouflage nets.  BENEFIT:  The use of an imaging LADAR for guided smart munitions allows good weather performance, excellent discrimination and tracking accuracy and the ability to defeat objects hidden under heavy foliage or camouflage nets. The same LADAR is ideally suited for helicopter brown out viewing and UAV collision avoidance applications.",

        "abstract": "A 24-month SBIR Phase II Project titled&quot;Weapons Effects FRMs for Small Munitions on Urban Reinforced Concrete Walls/Slabs.&quot;The stated objective of this solicitation topic is to develop High-Fidelity Physics-Based (HFPB) Fast-Running Models (FRMs) for simulating the effects of small weapons in urban structures and materials.  This proposal covers RC walls and slabs while an accompanying proposal covers masonry walls.  The main focus of this project is to develop FRMs to predict secondary debris generated when small cased munitions detonated at impact or at partial penetration on urban walls.  First we propose to validate the selected HFPB modeling approach by comparing its predictions with experiments conducted by JLF over several years.  Then, we will exercise the validated HFPB tool in a parameter space to generate virtual data to develop and calibrate our FRMs.  In this Phase II, we proposed to develop FRMs to predict (a) hole size, (b) residual capacity index, (c) debris mass, (d) correlated debris mass-velocity distribution for RC walls.   BENEFIT:  In recent years, the US military finds itself more and more involved in urban warfare.  In urban warfare or MOUT armed forces have to exhibit caution so that their actions will not harm civilians and friendly forces in the area.  These precautions exclude the use of large weapons and therefore the military is extremely interested in the use of more precise small weapons.  These small weapons are often used to breach urban walls and can be inert projectiles or explosive projectiles (cased weapons) that a) detonate upon impact or b) set for a delayed detonation during partial penetration in order to maximize damage.  The physics of the inert or explosive impacts and the resulting breakup and debris generation of these munitions are very complex and validated numerical methods do not yet exist.  Therefore, there is a need to develop validated small munitions models capable of determining the consequences of their use in order to assist military planners and soldiers in the field. The HFPB models that can simulate the complex phenomena involved in the impact of an inert/explosive ammunitions require vast computer resources and skilled personnel to setup and run the models; this is not suitable for military planners and commanders who need quick answers or to perform&quot;what-if&quot;studies.  Therefore, it is necessary to develop FRMs that capture the essence of the HFPB simulations and run very quickly.  The FRMs also need to provide information to the analysts/planners on their predictive accuracy (confidence in the results) given the inherent uncertainties in the modeling process.  For example, commanders might like to know what munitions to use and where to impact a wall of a particular construction material (e.g., concrete) in order to breach the wall and create a hole that will enable a soldier into a building.  They might also like to know the how injurious the debris thrown from the wall breach will be to occupants or to critical assets.  The fast-running debris throw models  developed in this project will support these kinds of decisions.",

        "abstract": "Vescent Photonics proposes to develop, design and build new scanning based micro-ladar sensors with unprecedented cost and size, weight, and power (SWAP), thereby enabling ladar deployment on previously inaccessible platforms (SUAS, micro-munitions, etc.).   This tremendous reduction in SWaP and cost is enabled by replacing expensive, heavy and power consumptive mechanics with Vescent\u2019s proprietary chip-scale non-mechanical laser scanner.  The Vescent EO scanner provides previously unrealizable performance such as sub-millisecond scanning, full 2-D operation with only three control electrodes, and a remarkably wide field of view (270 degrees demonstrated).  In this phase II we will demonstrate larger aperture EO scanning, which will enable utilizing the EO scanner for the return optical path, and demonstrate micro-LADAR operation at 1550 nm.  To both mitigate risks and to explore alternate micro-ladar system architectures, we will pursue two parallel development paths.  For the first path, we will develop a micro-ladar system with an EO scanned laser launch and a segmented APD or PIN \u201cstaring\u201d sense array.  For the second path, we will develop a micro-ladar system with both an EO scanned laser launch and an EO scanned ladar return.  In this phase II we will design, build, and deliver a low SWaP micro-ladar prototype system.   BENEFIT:  The ultra-compact steerable LADAR concept and hardware developed in this program has a wide range of relatively near-term and potentially low-cost military (tactical, theater and strategic) and other (surveillance/homeland security) applications. Tactical and surveillance adaptations would be the largest potential near-term markets.  We believe that the ultra-compact steerable laser rangefinder approach could be readily and cost effectively adapted to fielding of compact laser radars, coded covert (free-space-optics) line-of-sight communications capabilities and serve as high-accuracy optical trackers for engaging tactical (rockets, mortars and artillery-RAM) targets; RAMs are currently major threats to the US and its allies in the context of theater and urban warfare. Outside of the military deployment, our ultra-compact SAA LADAR system can be instrumental in future Autonomous (Adaptive) Cruise Control systems for the automobile industry.  Robotic, autonomous disaster zone LADAR mapping and navigation could also directly benefit from this development research effort.  Ad-hoc free-space optical communication networks are also another potential application.",

(Mayflower) proposes a Topology Management technology, the Prioritized Unbalanced Traffic Total Yield (PUTTY), to meet the Navy objective, namely, to develop advanced approaches for readily deployable Topology Management algorithms that address the complexity of mobile Ad Hoc Mesh Communication Networks constructed of directional antennas, and demonstrate its ability to optimize total network carrying capacity in a tactical ad hoc environment with unbalanced traffic. The proposed PUTTY topology management includes (1) network monitoring and analysis algorithms, and (2) network topology optimization algorithms. These two categories of topology management algorithms are applied repeatedly to dynamically optimize the network topology. Low complexity of the algorithms ensures that the proposed topology management is able to manage networks with hundreds of heterogeneous nodes. The PUTTY technology, which has been proven feasible in the Phase I study for the Navy application, has enormous potential for military and commercial applications. Mayflower will develop a prototype PUTTY system in Phase II, and demonstrate its capabilities and performance on a heterogeneous radio test bed. Mayflower will also work with the prime contractor selected to develop the Mobile Networking Hi-band (MNH) Increment 2 waveform to transition PUTTY topology management to the MNH Increment 2 waveform.",

        "abstract": "The protection of CPI from unwanted transfer is necessary to ensure a tactical advantage over our adversaries. Various powered sensor response techniques have been developed for AT systems.  These systems require a means to be constantly powered for long periods of time. A downed or stored weapon system may need protection for many years removed from a primary power source.  Energy storage technologies such as batteries and capacitors are insufficient for these AT systems due to their limited capacity.    A tradeoff between sensor measurement frequency and battery capacity requires that either less sensors are used or that the frequency at which the sensors are measured is reduced.  This leads to a less effective AT system.   To solve this challenging problem, Mid\u00e9 is developing reliable smart materials based AT sensors.  These sensors require no power and scavenge mechanical energy from the intrusion event to \u201cturn on\u201d the powered AT system.  Additionally, the output of the smart material sensors is directly correlated to the intensity of the tamper event.  The more energy that is provided to the smart sensor, the more energy the sensor will deliver.  This output will allow the AT system to tailor its response to the tamper event.",

Cryogenic cooling of diode lasers can provide great benefit to performance arising from the dramatic reduction in the threshold current and the increase in the diode\u2019s slope efficiency.  A penalty is paid in a large increase in the diode voltage, limiting the power conversion at cryogenic temperatures.  During the Phase 1, nLight demonstrated a diode laser of novel epitaxy design (specifically targeting cryogenic operation) which greatly mitigated the voltage rise.  The diode laser demonstrated >70% power conversion efficiency and was, to the best of our knowledge, the highest reported efficiency to date for an InP-based laser diode.  During the proposed Phase 2 program, this approach will be optimized through a series of statistically designed and physically motivated development campaigns.  Reliability and manufacturability will be designed in from the start.  At the end of the program, high-power (>500W rated), high-efficiency (>75% rated) arrays of the 1532-nm prototype laser diodes will be delivered to the Army Research Laboratory for use in solid state pumping experiments.",

In previous work, Fetch Technologies developed and successfully commercialized a system for creating \u201ctransformation pipelines\u201d.   In a transformation pipeline, a new source (with its own unique schema) can be \u201cdropped\u201d into the pipeline, and as long as the sources\u2019 data schema satisfies some very general constraints on the type of data present, then the pipeline will successfully normalize data from that source.  Our objective is to design the next generation of this system, called AutoTrans, that will minimize the human effort necessary build a robust transformation pipeline. In particular, through the use of machine learning techniques, AutoTrans system will make it easier and more automatic to configure and modify a series of transformations.   It will result in pipelines sequence that are robust even when the sequence of transformations is potentially incomplete or there is uncertainty in the data.  BENEFIT:  The aim of this project is to create a transformation system that minimizes the human effort necessary to aggregate data from multiple heterogeneous systems. Currently, integrating information from multiple domains and applications is technically challenging.  Using existing transformation design systems is difficult because the transformations generally have to be designed by knowledgeable programmers. They are often one-to-one mappings, which must be modified or redesigned when a new data source needs to be integrated.  Our approach represents an advance for data aggregation problems, because it allows one to implement a data pipeline that can normalize data from a wide variety of sources without reprogramming.   The new AutoTrans technology represents the next generation of this approach.  It will markedly decrease the human time and the skill-level required to develop and maintain these powerful pipelines. This in turn will produce a qualitative difference in how broadly this technology can be applied in commercial and military systems.",

To gain access to MUOS satellite resources, users must submit satellite access requests (SARs) via the U.S. military\u2019s SIPRNET to reserve resources before use. However users don\u2019t always have access to SIPRNET, and the approval process takes considerable time. To address this challenge, this effort will develop a Quick Planner, implemented in software, that runs on a PC laptop and/or PDA that provides a \u201cpre-qualifying\u201d evaluation of a user-specified SAR that is within 80% of optimal in 15 minutes. The pre-qualification provides the user with informative graphical feedback for a specified SAR as to what factors impact its acceptability given the current state of the MUOS traffic load, allowing the user to make modifications to the candidate SAR to improve its likelihood of being approved. The process will save MUOS users time by allowing them to \u201ctune\u201d a SAR for maximum likelihood of success before actually submitting the SAR to the SIPRNET for approval.",

The techniques under discussion cover an area of detection and classification that is currently un-attainable with the current system. Previous tests regarding forward scatter detection had not been able to establish acceptable False Alarm Rates (FAR) at a sufficiently high Probability of Detection (PD) to warrant further development. However, newer developments using an array of co-located pressure and pressure gradient (i.e. velocity) sensors with appropriate signal processing, showed potential as an undersea target detection and classification mechanism.

The Phase I program successfully demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing advanced modeling techniques to predict the onset and propagation of surface fatigue in gearing, including a rigorous analysis of misalignment, mixed-elastohydrodynamic lubrication, and damage accumulation in the material. Phase II will build on this success by applying these models to a complete gearbox, including a comprehensive graphical user interface for model construction and analysis control.

        "abstract": "ES3 has completed a SBIR Phase I effort of a feasibility study for the research and development of Nano-composite High Velocity Oxygen Fueled (HVOF) coatings for replacement of hard chrome plating on high-strength steel landing gear components.  The Phase I work focused on finding an HVOF coating that will be more resistant to spallation when subjected to high-bending stress loads on landing gear components, verses the current HVOF coating of Tungsten Carbide Cobalt (WC-Co) and Tungsten Carbide Cobalt Chrome (WC-Co-Cr) coatings.  4 Nano-composites were deemed suitable for both overhauled landing gear components as well as newly-manufactured components.  These candidates are proposed to begin Phase II testing for qualification and implementation.  BENEFIT:  Research conducted for chrome plating replacement with HVOF Nano-composite coatings on HSS material, such as 300M (280-300 KSI) are primarily used on Landing Gear components.   Benefits will be similar for all aircraft and engine usage for replacement of chrome plating where spallation concerns for high stresses, especially under bending occur where current wear and corrosion protection needs exist.   HVOF Nano-composite coatings meeting the original equipment requirements for fatigue, bending stress, wear and corrosion properties have several advantages over chrome plating.   While providing a higher quality finish for components, improved process times and environmental safety improvements are also evident.  The following demonstrate benefits ES3 expects from use of HVOF nanosteel coatings in lieu of chrome plating based on both industry and in-house research: \u2022 Improved wear resistance  \u2022 Improved corrosion resistance \u2022 Increased fatigue life \u2022 Improved thermal properties  (i.e. grinding burn resistance) \u2022 Improved rework allowance for sealing high pressure nitrogen (no mud cracking) \u2022 Improved repair coating thickness \u2022 Eliminated hydrogen embrittlement \u2022 Improved process time \u2022 Increased service life \u2022 Improved environmental concerns \u2022 Utilize same grinding wheel as HSS substrate for machining \u2022 Reduced spallation \u2022 Reduced cost of nanosteel powders compared to common HVOF WC-Co and WC-Co-Cr powders",

Important military applications that benefit from MLLs include high ENOB Analog to Digital converters (ADCs), encryption, LIDAR, high speed communications, and optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR). The key hurdles for the practical deployment of MLLs in these application spaces are the small size and low weight requirements. Most MLLs come in either optical table top variants, or fiber variants, that require huge amounts of electrical power, and occupy several cubic feet of space and are adversely impacted by a typical military environment.

This effort will advance the technical readiness level of an innovative family of igniters for rocket combustion devices.  These igniters will exceed current reliability standards, reduce ignition system overhead, and provide system-level benefits by minimizing weight, decreasing power requirements, and improving serviceability.  This highly-reliable, non-toxic ignition system is designed for use with LOX-hydrocarbon rocket engines, as well as other rocket engine cycle components such as preburners and gas generators.  During Phase II, the SYREN igniters will be used to ignite several LOX-HC combustion devices ranging in thrust levels from 100 lbf to 50k lbf.    BENEFIT:  The end product of this research and development program will have application for a range of military and commercial launch systems, satellite propulsion and station-keeping, as well as potential aerial warfare and tactical surface applications.  Additionally, the SYREN technology could readily be developed and deployed as small thrusters for micro- and nano-satellite propulsion, or DACS thrusters on larger spacecraft.  The acoustic resonance igniter also has potential monopropellant applications.  NASA may also find use for this technology in the support of reusable launch vehicles and upper stages as well as for in-space propulsion where the simplicity and reliability of the acoustic igniter offers the greatest benefits.  Commercial satellite providers would also find this technology attractive for reducing the propulsion system weight and improving performance.  The potential market for acoustic igniters and related technologies could be quite large.  Application focus areas include military, space, and industrial users.  During the Phase II activities, ORBITEC personnel will work to develop a detailed commercialization plan that involves the major propulsion companies.  Three specific commercial avenues are anticipated during Phase II: 1) providing acoustic igniters for use with a Government sponsored hydrocarbon thrust chamber and ox-rich preburner; 2) developing this technology for use with ORBITEC\u2019s LOX-hydrocarbon rocket engines; 3) pairing the SYREN with a cryogenic RCS motor.",

The application of composite materials in aerospace and automobile as structural materials is expanding primarily because its properties match high strength steel alloys with large savings in weight. Although there are many advantages in the use of these composites, there are many issues in the fatigue life, corrosion and other mechanical properties that need to be considered in the use of these composites in corrosive environments. One solution to address the corrosion and environmental issues is the use of proper coating systems for the final composite product.

A processing string was developed for real or simulated data, and will accept individual sensor data or multiplexed DIFAR data. Results indicate there is sufficient vertical extent of the forward-scattered field in which a phase shift is detectable for a single DIFAR. An experiment was described to test the performance of the detection process in an ocean environment. This proposal continues this effort to prepare for and conduct a data acquisition sea test and conduct analysis on the data with recommendations for the development of an appropriate system.",

        "abstract": "This Phase II project proposes to improve the fatigue life and power transmission capabilities of carburized gears by enhancing crack initiation resistance through cavitation peening. Cavitation peening is a low cost surface enhancement process that induces high magnitude residual stresses on a surface by sweeping an ultra-high pressure jet over the surface to be peened so that cavitation bubbles form and collapse on the workpiece. The shock of the collapsing bubbles causes the formation of beneficial residual compressive stresses. The process is further enhanced by combining it with shot peening. Phase I work showed that the combined process could generate 228,000 psi residual compressive stresses on the surface of carburized steels, even in simulated gear root radii. These beneficial stresses are at least 50% higher than can be achieved by conventional shot peening, and the induced stresses were shown to be stable, resisting exposure to stress cycling and high temperature. Phase II work will continue to optimize the combined process and demonstrate the benefits with coupon fatigue testing, single tooth bend tests and full gear testing.

        "abstract": "A 24-month SBIR Phase II Project titled \u201cWeapons Effects FRMs for Small Munitions on Urban Masonry Walls\u201d is proposed. The stated objective of this solicitation topic is to develop High-Fidelity Physics-Based (HFPB) Fast-Running Models (FRMs) for simulating the effects of small weapons in urban structures and materials.  This proposal covers masonry walls while an accompanying proposal covers RC walls.  The main focus of this project is to develop FRMs to predict secondary debris generated when small cased munitions detonated at impact or at partial penetration on urban walls.  However, we plan to extend the previously developed ACMUWall and ABRKWall FRM to the load parameter range expected from small munitions detonating away from the wall. First we propose to validate the selected HFPB modeling approach by comparing its predictions with experiments conducted by JLF over several years.  Then, we will exercise the validated HFPB tool in a parameter space to generate virtual data to develop and calibrate our FRMs.  In this Phase II, we proposed to develop FRMs to predict (a) hole size, (b) residual capacity index, (c) debris mass, (d) correlated debris mass-velocity distribution for masonry walls.   BENEFIT:  In recent years, the US military finds itself more and more involved in urban warfare.  In urban warfare or MOUT armed forces have to exhibit caution so that their actions will not harm civilians and friendly forces in the area.  These precautions exclude the use of large weapons and therefore the military is extremely interested in the use of more precise small weapons.  These small weapons are often used to breach urban walls and can be inert projectiles or explosive projectiles (cased weapons) that a) detonate upon impact or b) set for a delayed detonation during partial penetration in order to maximize damage.  The physics of the inert or explosive impacts and the resulting breakup and debris generation of these munitions are very complex and validated numerical methods do not yet exist.  Therefore, there is a need to develop validated small munitions models capable of determining the consequences of their use in order to assist military planners and soldiers in the field. The HFPB models that can simulate the complex phenomena involved in the impact of an inert/explosive ammunitions require vast computer resources and skilled personnel to setup and run the models; this is not suitable for military planners and commanders who need quick answers or to perform \u201cwhat-if\u201d studies.  Therefore, it is necessary to develop FRMs that capture the essence of the HFPB simulations and run very quickly.  The FRMs also need to provide information to the analysts/planners on their predictive accuracy (confidence in the results) given the inherent uncertainties in the modeling process.  For example, commanders might like to know what munitions to use and where to impact a wall of a particular construction material (e.g., concrete) in order to breach the wall and create a hole that will enable a soldier into a building.  They might also like to know the how injurious the debris thrown from the wall breach will be to occupants or to critical assets.  The fast-running debris throw models  developed in this project will support these kinds of decisions.",

To achieve widespread adoption of SCE systems, low-cost and rugged cryocoolers and associated drives are needed. Creare is developing a universal Tactical Cryocooler Drive (TCD) to address this need. Our TCD provides dual, independent drives, which can be customized for each application with only software changes. During Phase I, we demonstrated feasibility with a comprehensive design study and prototype demonstration. We demonstrated a hardware topology that was able to simultaneously and independently drive dual cryocooler compressors with input power as high as 270 W and efficiencies as high as 96%. We demonstrated a 20 KHz Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) control strategy which results in minimal ripple currents. We established a design path which will enable power levels up to 1,500 W per channel. We demonstrated thermal control, where we were able to maintain temperature at 66 K in the presence of thermal loads as high as 2.5 W.

        "abstract": "Temperature control has been a major concern during High Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) processing since it was originally utilized in the aerospace industry. Typically, temperature must not exceed 300oF to prevent heat damage/ tempering of the substrates on steel alloys, and even lower temperature requirements for aluminum and titanium alloys. These problems have prevented USAF depots from usage of HVOF coatings in many cases on aluminum and titanium components not only due to application temperature concerns, but for cost concerns as well. Shop air cooling has traditionally been the most widely utilized temperature control cooling medium when applying HVOF coatings to aircraft components such as airframe, engine/propeller, and landing gear components, because it is readily available in the shop environment. However, in many cases shop air has proven to be inadequate for controlling substrate temperatures during HVOF application. As a result, longer off-part dwell times to allow for component cooling has become a common practice \u2013 an exercise that results in significant powder and gas consumptions \u2013 both of which cost money. Additionally, the traditional temperature measuring control has been a continuous reading single point infrared gun aimed at a single location on the component being sprayed. Even though this is a widely accepted method in the HVOF community, it\u2019s only good for measuring localized areas. Consequently, inaccuracies will results as component temperature will vary along the length of the component, particularly for parts with complex geometries. This compounds the temperature issues and makes optimization of temperature control even more difficult. In Phase I of this effort, Engineering & Software System Solutions, Inc. (ES3) conducted a feasibility study to develop/evaluate alternate coolants/delivery systems, liquid/gas nitrogen and liquid/gas carbon dioxide, and advanced temperature monitoring systems to optimize temperature control. Results identified that both liquid nitrogen and carbon dioxide coolant delivery and temperature monitoring system combinations will significantly reduce off-part dwell time and material (powder & gas) consumption; thereby increasing HVOF production throughput. Phase II will conduct a demonstration/validation of a coolant and temperature monitoring system on a typical 4340 low strength steel alloy component coated with HVOF WC-Co-Cr at Robins AFB; and testing will investigate the coolants\u2019 affect on fatigue and coating integrity of HVOF WC-Co-Cr coated coupons to ensure the coolant process does not affect USAF 200626772 performance requirements for usage with the HVOF coated aircraft component applications. Optional testing will be made available for validation and qualification for usage at DoD repair depots covering typical HVOF coatings and substrates.   BENEFIT:  ES3 anticipates the results of Phase II work will qualify and validate the usage of the Alternate Coolant System & Temperature Monitoring System for typical low strength, low alloy steel components qualified for HVOF WC-Co-Cr application. ES3 anticipates the following benefits from Phase II testing: \u2022 A novel cooling process for HVOF coating applications \u2022 Specifications for a Multi-location Temperature Monitoring System \u2022 Eliminate extended off-part dwell time for cooling \u2022 Reduce process time \u2022 Reduce powder and fuel costs \u2022 Environmentally friendly process",

        "abstract": "When the internal diameter (ID) of an aluminum alloy landing gear outer cylinder bore is damaged or worn there is currently very little that can be done to facilitate a repair.  The main cause for early condemnation of aluminum alloy outer cylinders is excessive wear on the bore.  The aerospace industry condemns many aluminum strut outer cylinders at a high cost.  The cost to the USAF due to early condemnations is approximately $3M per year.   Hard anodize is a repair method often used to repair cylinder bores but if not done correctly will cause premature condemnations and has restorative thickness limitations.  A coating repair for aluminum alloys, which builds up thickness and can be ground or machined to size, similar to chrome plating or High Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) coatings used to repair steel landing gear components, would be of great value to the United States Air Force (USAF).  The coating would have to seal against hydraulic fluid as well as high pressure nitrogen and not spall at high loads.  A dimensional restoration repair method of aluminum landing gear component bores would result in a considerable cost savings to the USAF as well as the Aerospace Industry as a whole.  Rotary Plasma coating systems have the ability to apply thick (up to 0.030 inch per side) aluminum alloy coatings to the ID of outer cylinder bores.  This will allow a greater range of damaged conditions to pre machined and then coated.  These coatings can then be machined back to original dimensions and anodized to serviceable condition.  In addition, Rotary Plasma coating systems have the ability to apply many coating chemistries other than pure aluminum.  This provides the opportunity to apply hard, wear resistant coatings to landing gear bores, thus removing the need to anodize the surface after final machine.  BENEFIT:  Research conducted to develop Rotary Plasma Coating systems, which can restore IDs of worn or damaged land gear aluminum outer cylinders, focuses on military applications; however, benefits will be similar for all commercial & military landing gear that need IDs restored to original dimensions.    ES3 expects the following benefits from Rotary Plasma System restoring the Inner Dimension of landing gear outer cylinders based on both industry and in-house research:    \u2022 Outer cylinders with worn or damage IDs can be restored to serviceable condition  \u2022 Increased supportability of aluminum landing gear parts for USAF and commercial industry  \u2022 Reduction in ownership cost for the USAF and commercial industry  \u2022 Rotary Plasma has the ability to apply hard material chemistries thus eliminating the need to anodize after final machine",

The Phase I technology was designed to use waveform diversity for effective implementation of fire control and engagement capabilities to defeat multiple attacks from any direction. Force protection against low-cost, ballistic threats imposes resource management challenges for a Fire Control Radar (FCR) that is charged with tracking and directing fire to negate these threats. An FCR is required to support several functions such as search, track, weapon assignment, target engagement, impact point prediction, and launch point estimation. The proposed PRA radar technology reduces radar resources required to deal with these functions through the implementation of three (or more) distributed phased arrays to provide enhanced multipath mitigation and improved accuracy over conventional radar architectures. The distributed aperture radar can implement both command guidance and a unique semi-active guidance concept in a single radar design without adding significant cost to a missile interceptor. The semi-active guidance technology integrates elements of command guidance and semi-active guidance to address saturated threat attacks without significantly impacting cost and radar resources.",

A portable, lightweight, robust inspection system powered by an user-friendly, automated software system, with remote scanning capability, could improve the current field inspection challenges faced today. OKOS Solutions proposes an advanced inspection capability that has the potential to provide significant improvement in composite and metallic damage detection in the Field/Depot level environment through patented \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lensing\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of the acoustic signal. This capability provides for a significant increase in the depth of field scanned, in a single scan in materials; along with increase in the resolution of the return information. The technology could potentially remove the inherent issues with multiple scanning and errors associated with repositioning, as the single DeepVue multi-zone scan would have a single reference with all \u00e2\u20ac\u0153layers\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of the scans within one data base. The developed OKOS software technology is designed to effectively \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peel\u00e2\u20ac\u009d away the layers within a single scan, within the scanned volume of material, and be fully automated. Operator set-up and knowledge are minimized for an effective inspection.",

Current maintenance and inspection techniques for in-service structures are labor-intensive and time-consuming.  Acellent Technologies proposes to develop an accurate, reliable integrated system for detection, prediction and mitigation of aging and manufacturing related hazards in civilian and military aircraft.  The objective of the proposed program will be to provide the U.S. Air Force with a Portable Active Damage Inspection (PADI) system for detection and quantification of degradation in aircraft structures due to stress corrosion cracking (SCC).  This information can then be transferred to the OEM''s predictive models to provide predictions of remaining strength and life, thereby facilitating the development of maintenance strategies to mitigate the effects of the degradation on the aircraft safety and reliability.  BENEFIT:  Once developed and commercialized, the system will provide airline owners and maintenance personnel with real-time reliable information about the condition of the structures while in service.  Such knowledge will lead to increased safety of operation, improved reliability of the structures and reduced maintenance cost through system automation.

        "abstract": "The goal of this SBIR Phase II proposal is to develop a web-based platform that (1) hosts a collection of micro games for cybersecurity awareness and training; (2) simplifies the development of micro games by maximizing re-use of functionality; (3) helps administrators manage and deploy micro games; and (4) helps analysts assess readiness through a suite of tools for analytics. In Phase I, we explored this design space, developing the requirements for this platform as well as several interface prototypes. We also developed an interactive prototype of a new micro game named Anti-Phishing Phyllis. For Phase II, we will refine Anti-Phishing Phyllis and prepare it for commercial use. We will also develop a robust version of the platform for micro games. Our team is comprised of three computer science faculty from Carnegie Mellon University who co-founded Wombat Security Technologies to commercialize their research in anti-phishing. Part of this research was in developing fun and effective training to protect people from phishing scams, the most successful of which has been a game played over 100,000 people with scientific results demonstrating its effectiveness. As of this writing, the game has been licensed for use by several hundred thousand users.  BENEFIT:  Organizations often do not have the time to choose between a variety of training options, or deal with the integration and deployment overhead associated with individual training modules. A training platform that facilitates the development and deployment of compelling training games reduces this hassle for organizations, thereby making cyber security training more cost effective.  In addition, our work will offer five additional benefits. First, it will make it easier for end-users to educate themselves through a variety of games for security training and assess how they are doing. Second, it will make it simpler for developers to deploy security training games, by providing support for common features. Third, our platform will provide a single centralized location for administrators, rather than having to manage and configure each game individually. Fourth, our platform will make it easier for analysts to assess how an organization is doing with regards to security training and retention. Fifth, our platform, coupled with a large set of games for security training, will lead to better and more effective security training for individuals, thus leading to better overall preparedness for an organization. Our existing anti-phishing game is in use across a broad variety of organizations, including those in finance (e.g. Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, TD Ameritrade, Banca Popolare di Sondrio), government (e.g. US Department of State, US Department of Energy, BBB, Florida Department of Transportation), schools (e.g. Carnegie Mellon University, University of Buffalo, Dalhousie University), health care (e.g. Children Hospital Los Angeles), ISPs (e.g. Portugal Telecom), and others (e.g. Booz Allen Hamilton, Transplace, CERT Japan). However, the cost of developing a single game remains high, and the cost of deploying individual games may deter organizations from acquiring a comprehensive suite of cyber security awareness and training solutions. Through the new platform we propose to develop and validate under the proposed SBIR grant, we expect to significantly reduce the development and deployment costs and time associated with the introduction of new games. With cyber security threats continuing to evolve quite rapidly, this is critical if one is to ensure that training material remains current and accessible to a broad range of organizations rather to the select few who can afford the necessary investments today.",

Multipath due to the structure (platform on which the GPS receiver is mounted) scattering can degrade the accuracy of GPS measurements (code and carrier phase) by tens of centimeters. For an airborne platform, reflection or diffraction of the satellite signal from wings, tail, stabilizers or any other large appendage of the aircraft fuselage leads to signal multipath, and these multipath cause biases in code and carrier phase measurements. During Phase I, we studied the performance of two novel adaptive weighting algorithms in the presence of platform generated multipaths. The adaptive weighting algorithms are designed for GPS anti-jam antennas (CRPAs) to null the interfering signals without distorting the satellite signals. During Phase II, we will investigate the performance of the two weighting algorithms in simultaneous nulling of the interfering signals and mitigation of the platform generated multipath using realistic platforms of interest to the Navy. The two weighting algorithms use the knowledge of the in situ antenna manifolds to minimize the distortion of the satellite signals. The sensitivity of the two algorithms to errors in antenna manifold will also be investigated.",

        "abstract": "The Phase II program has two broad technical objectives. The first objective involves developing a new class of very high-energy density reactive multiphase blast explosives (RMBX). The second objective involves testing these new RMBX compositions with innovative warhead concepts designed to produce different damage mechanisms, such as: a well-defined lethality radius with no or minimal fragments; or blast plus high fidelity control over the fragment footprint. The Phase I results demonstrated that: (1) the RMBX composition has the potential of providing both enhanced blast and thermal impulse kill mechanisms with a corresponding controlled lethality radius; and (2) the RMBX can be used for a forward focused fragment warhead concept. Our RMBX is also a potential fill for a reactive case or liner between the case and conventional HE because of the efficient coupling between the RMBX and reacting particles within the case. Finally, our RMBX is an potential alternative fill for the FLM due to its coupling efficiency between the energetic and embedded inert particles, improved overall blast performance based upon improved coupling at the target of the blast wave and embedded particles and sustained thermal impulse. These attributes should provide precise prosecution of targets in urban terrains.  BENEFIT:  Examples of dual-use commercial applications for the proposed research include: (1) low collateral damage explosive defeat of IEDs and VBIEDs for domestic bomb squads; (2) novel energetic materials and initiation mechanisms for down-hole perforation operations in the oil production industry; and (3) more efficient and controlled collateral effects for explosive demolition operations.",

The Mission Analysis is defined by the weapon requirements and weapon use scenario. Performance requirements are identified so that the explosive, penetrator, target vulnerability, and guidance candidates can establish a viable set of subsystems that can be consolidated for use in the SBIR. To identify the requirements and subsystems, FSTI has several tools that have been successfully used on penetrator programs involving the BLU-109, Small Diameter Bomb and others. These programs will be used to aid in the requirements and subsystem definitions. FSTI developed the Weapon Analysis Model, Rocket Motor Basic Sizing programs and the Mission Analysis Diagram. These programs enable us to efficiently reduce the times of conducting the work. The weapon optimization can also be included in the weapon design requirements. Additionally, the experience FSTI has in developing unique designs for meeting insensitive munitions requirements will be an asset in developing a sound approach for this weapon.The goal is to be ready to demonstrate the design for confidence in the Boosted Penetrator Technologies.  BENEFIT:  The Boosted Penetrator Insensitive Munition study could be applied to the use of a rocket motors in space studies where rocket motors are used to launch space hardware. The release mechanisms that are temperature sensitive have application to safety systems in buildings where fire may be a potential concern. These release rings work in the opposite direction to the conventional release rings. Snap rings normally release by expanding where the ones used in the rocket motors and warheads contract and release the device for protection. Buildings that are built on very hard surfaces depend on oil well drilling techniques to make holes in the hard surface. It is a process which takes time. The boosted penetrator would allow for a penetration into the hard surface to be done in a fraction of the time for drilling. Anchors into these same surfaces are difficult and the penetration techniques may offer a faster way to anchor a building to the hard surface.",

To address this risk, Gloyer-Taylor Laboratories LLC (GTL) has created the Universal Combustion Device Stability (UCDS\u2122) process.  UCDS employs a tightly integrated analysis of all forms of disturbances, acoustic, vortical, and entropic waves, superimposed on the quasi-steady mean flow of combustion products.  This tool provides the means to calculate the complex combustion stability characteristics of rocket engines.  GTL proposes to validate the robustness of the UCDS tool by analyzing five benchmark cases and comparing the results to test data.  Sensitivity analyses will be used to extract key insight into the impact of mechanisms, phenomena and parameters on system stability.  As part of this effort, physical or computational experiments will be designed and performed to examine high priority features. Successful completion of the proposed Phase II validation effort will replace the uncertainty and high cost of rocket development by a rigorous design methodology based on true understanding of engine oscillatory dynamics.

The panel is pointed using a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCanfield Joint\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 gimbal, which can provide full hemispherical pointing to maximize orbit-average power generation. The design provides secure restraint of the panels prior to release from the P-POD, and the gimbal itself is used to initiate the panel deployment, eliminating the need for a separate release actuator. The panel fold-out sequence is mechanically staged to ensure reliable deployment without inter-panel collisions. During the Phase I effort, we fabricated and tested proof-of-concept prototypes of all key mechanical components of the proposed design, enabling the full panel to be developed in Phase II at low risk. The proposed CubeSat Deployable Array will prove exceptionally high power-per-mass capabilities on the order of 20 W/kg, and will enable the SMDC and other organizations to conduct flight mission that use the low-cost CubeSat platform to achieve demanding operational and tech-demo missions.",

To realize the potential benefits of this diverse capability, it is necessary to extend the ability of assignment and planning algorithms and decision theory. We propose to implement a broadly applicable solution that builds upon the general framework of SAT-based reasoning and our specialized Salt, Alef, and REASON technologies for rendering constrained optimization problems to that model. This effort will build upon our existing distributed SAT-solving technology with well-founded extensions to improve support for (1) allocation optimization in the context of global inventory management, (2) constraint groups typical to battle-management problems, and (3) information reuse across iterative refinement or repair. The resulting technology will preserve our existing capability to reason about the most difficult aspects of battle management including complex availability, coordination, deconfliction, and mutual-exclusion constraints and holistic measures of fitness. The resulting technology will also be fully adapted to operating, if necessary, in a heterogeneous, geographically distributed (net-centric) computing environment. In this effort, we are partnering with Lockheed Martin Maritime Systems & Sensors (MS2) who has an interest in transitioning our core SAT-based technology into their speculative Command, Control, Battle Management, & Communications (C2BMC) solution portfolio.",

This toolset will use existing measurements of engine and C&A components (or LRUs, discover (or mine) cases, relationships, and modeling evidences from the performance, the usage, and the maintenance data of the LRUs, focus on ground-based, non-real time applications and be applicable to all types of accessory components, and readily applicable to flight control components. The objective of the proposed Phase II project is to demonstrate the ability of generating more timely and accurate maintenance recommendations through the use of the analytical tools designed in Phase I. The three analytical tools to be demonstrated are: the reliability anomaly detector (RAD), the competing risks tool (CRT), and the probabilistic learning tool (PLT). The demonstration will use a combination of actual and simulated engine and maintenance data in a relevant operating environment. Actual data will be drawn from the F414 MDW, and simulated data will be created to form a certain desired test cases. The relevant operating environment will be similar to the execution and user environment of the Navy/GE maintenance program.

We have developed several Bayesian classifiers, to which we will apply label acquisition and label confidence techniques. Additionally, we will extend the in situ learning framework to include multi-task learning. Previously collected sensing data are often available from different sensors or environments. Not all data are related, however the potential exists to share information between related tasks and exploit the contextual information of previous tasks. The current in situ learning process is inherently myopic; the algorithm identifies the single most-informative data sample. The ability to select multiple samples without relearning the classifier can increase computational efficiency and maximize analyst workload. Based on the theory of submodular functions, non-myopic in situ learning techniques for subset selection will be developed and integrated into the Bayesian framework. Finally, new statistical embedding technology will be investigated that allows an analyst to synthesize data for training and to augment the label acquisition process. A low-dimensional embedded space may be visualized, and any location on the manifold can be recreated in the original high-dimensional space.",

        "abstract": "In answer to the need for an increased heat-flux calibration capability, Streamline Automation  (SA) proposes a novel calorimeter calibration system including a data reduction methodology and its implementation and demonstration in a high heat-flux calibration unit, powered by an electrical discharge. The new calibration system: enables calibration at heat flux levels specific to high-enthalpy hypersonic flows, returns all the necessary information required to recover the classic step response of the calorimeter, and features a built-in means for correcting gauge output due to a zero intrinsic integrated energy deficiency. These characteristic make possible operation at a fraction of total heat flux required by classical step response calibration systems and help preserve calorimeter integrity during the calibration process. In Phase I SA has demonstrated the feasibility of the concept and has performed the calibration of a null point calorimeter. Phase II activities will include: the design and fabrication of the calibration system for flux levels up to 30kW/cm2 and test duration of up to half a second, a full system characterization, and system optimization for enhanced lifetime. At the conclusion of Phase II SA will deliver and demonstrate a fully featured system to the Air Force.  BENEFIT:  Hypersonic transport vehicles powered by air-breathing scramjet engines are beginning to come into focus as the quick-response space launchers and super-swift, far-ranging missiles of the future.  Future development programs will require unique ground testing capabilities, such as supersonic and hypersonic wind tunnels, and sophisticated instrumentation to provide flow and thermodynamic data.  Currently, the calorimeter calibration systems available to the DOD do not provide heat flux levels as high as those the calorimeters experience during testing in arc-jet heated facilities.  The proposed calorimeter calibration system will enable calibration to be performed in an environment more closely approximating the operational environment (e.g. hypersonic flight, reentry etc.), thus providing a greater degree of confidence in the measured data during testing, and improving test operations. Commercially, a high heat flux calorimeter calibration system would benefit the gas turbine engine manufacturing industry, arc-jet heated, and gas-fired furnace facilities as well as organizations such as NASA, ESA and other propulsion oriented research institutions.",

Critical performance requirements for non-structural, fiberglass barrier ply materials that are cured onto military flight hardware include: low and high temperature resistance, hot-wet exposure resistance, fluid resistance, and good adhesion properties to the base composite substrate. A high level of interaction will be needed between the composite parts fabricator, formulated resin/prepreg material supplier, and the UV/LED lamp system provider for the successful transition of low-energy cure into production.

        "abstract": "For applications like tactical laser weapons which involve imaging or transmitting energy via lasers over long paths near the ground, the cumulative atmospheric turbulence effects exceed what conventional adaptive optics technologies can handle. To compensate for moderate to severe deep turbulence effects OPC has developed a new technique called Green\u2019s Function Inversion (GFI). GFI can be used to characterize the transmission path between a high energy laser (HEL) and a target. Once the path is well characterized, the HEL beam can be adjusted to form a very high quality beam at any position. Even very high Greenwood frequencies can be accommodated using a ripple update. It is especially useful with conformal fiber laser arrays as a HEL source. During Phase I, we will perform a detailed wave-optic simulation of the GFI technique to demonstrate its performance under AF engagement conditions, with the sample scenario as a starting point. The ability to generate a target image suitable for aimpoint selection and maintenance will be shown and the ability to place a high quality hit spot on the designated aimpoint evaluated including point ahead offsets. Finally, a prototype flight design will be generated and a lab experiment laid out for Phase II.     BENEFITS:  GFI beam control is well suited to phasing and correcting a conformal array of HEL fiber lasers through turbulence. Besides the air-to-air engagements, the technique also applies well to air-to-ground and ground-to-air scenarios, as well as applications such as imaging and aim point maintenance through long horizontal paths. The speckle processing used in GFI is well suited to HEL diagnostics in that an image of the hit spot can be produced in real-time. NGST is our strategic partner in this effort which provides an excellent pathway for technology insertion.",

        "abstract": "Aircraft structure, engine, propeller and landing gear systems utilize high and low strength steel, cad-plated threaded components and fasteners throughout its structure.  Threaded components and fasteners manufactured from these alloys require sacrificial protective coatings due to the corrosive environment.  Cadmium has traditionally been the preferred coating for such threaded components and fasteners due to its many desirable functional qualities.  In addition to corrosion protection, cadmium also provides excellent lubricity characteristics; however, cadmium is a toxic metal and known carcinogen that poses environmental and occupational safety and health risks throughout the life cycle of the plated parts.  In Phase I feasibility studies for this project, ES3 confirmed that the Low Hydrogen Embrittlement alkaline Zn-Ni coating, IZ-C17+ with IZ-264 tri-chromate post treatment met or exceeded typical cad plating with post hex-chromate treatment results in lubricity and corrosion testing.  Additionally, production features, such as tank chemistry and barrel/rack plating techniques were researched for utilization in a DoD depot or commercial production environment. Phase II testing will validate the zinc-nickel IZ-C17+ with IZ-264 post treatment process in comparison to LHE cad utilizing industry accepted requirements for threaded fasteners / components for process installation, corrosion, thickness, fatigue, adhesion and hydrogen embrittlement testing.  Phase II testing will be conducted on threaded fasteners for LSS and HSS with the barrel plating technique, as well as threaded components for rack plating technique.  Upon successfully completing testing, a process specification will be developed for the USAF that can be utilized within the industry.

IVD chambers are size limited.  o Eliminate Hydrogen Re-Embrittlement risks after exposure to aqueous cleaners. o Increased lubricity factors over IVD.

        "abstract": "Autonomous Data Fusion is an essential technology to support the non-traditional surveillance systems that employ small autonomous systems communicating with each other \u2013 forming a distributed sensor network. Based on the Phase I achievements, Impact Technologies in collaboration with Wright State University, Virginia Tech and Northrop Grumman, proposes to further develop, mature and demonstrate with field trials a mobile-agent-based decentralized data fusion system that fuses the data from sensors deployed on unmanned vehicles into an integrated ISR information system on the combat ships. The proposed data fusion architecture is a three-level system which performs data processing and fusion at Node, Group, and System levels, respectively. The system has a number of advantages over conventional solutions: 1) communication bandwidth requirement and energy consumption are reduced by sending light-weight mobile-agents instead of sending data between the nodes; 2) progressive decision accuracy is achieved as the mobile-agents traverse the network performing Bayesian data fusion on the nodes; 3) real-time requirements are fulfilled by the Anytime algorithm design; 4) improved reliability; and 5) high scalability. Thorough and extensive experimental tests and field trials will be carried out on heterogeneous USVs to validate the developed technologies and facilitate the technology transition.",

        "abstract": "This Phase II will demonstrate practical, low cost, and adaptable field inspections for small cracks (less than 0.03 in.) at fastener holes that cannot be reliably inspected with other available or emerging NDT methods.  Pressing U.S. Air Force needs include structural features with no access for conventional inspections and other unsolved buried layer cracking problems. In Phase I, a JENTEK MWM\u00ae-Rosette with \u201cpillars\u201d (a thin, eddy current fatigue crack gage exhibiting enhanced durability) was successfully demonstrated as a smart washer (mounted under a fastener nut in a fatigue test representing a USAF second layer crack detection need).  The biggest remaining obstacle to implementation is a lack of defined requirements for embedded damage gages.  The Phase II objectives are to (1) develop a USAF acceptable embedded sensor performance verification/validation methodology, (2) demonstrate POD curve generation with performance exceeding requirements, (3) demonstrate durability exceeding requirements and pass environmental/fuel exposure qualifications, and (4) enhance packaging/cabling/installation tooling, and complete subcomponent testing. The MWM-Rosette solution is simple, practical, and matured to a level that makes this SBIR highly likely to succeed.  In a tight budget climate, such lower cost and practical solutions must be transitioned to reduce maintenance costs and ensure platform availability.   BENEFIT:  If this Phase II is successful, the Air Force will finally have a low cost, mass producible, and practical solution to the need for small crack detection in buried layers \u2013 by mounting MWM-Rosettes under fasteners (heads, nuts, washers, Hi-Lok collars, FTI/ForceTec retainers, or between skin/structural layers) at one or many inaccessible locations.  The benefits are (i) avoiding extended time in depot for inspections, e.g. to gain access to a fuel tank and to remove fasteners, (ii) preventing costly part replacements by detecting cracks small enough, in the field, to enable over-sizing of holes and life extension, and (iii) enabling more frequent, low cost, field inspections if damage tolerance requirements shift to lower crack detection sizes.  This is mostly a U.S. military and FMS need for fighter aircraft and rotorcraft.  Commercialization of this technology is highly likely, once a clear performance validation procedure (including POD studies) is accepted by the ASIP community, and once specific applications are unequivocally solved.",

Energy harvesting used with advanced, micro-power wireless sensing electronics, enables the realization of truly autonomous sensing and recording.   The objective of this SBIR is to develop a comprehensive and networked health management capability that can be embedded directly into a rotorcraft component.  This Phase II SBIR effort includes development and demonstration of embedded energy harvesting radio frequency identification (EH-RFID) nodes with capabilities of unique identification, performance monitoring, on board storage of component usage history, and remaining useful life. One of the unique aspects of this Phase II SBIR proposal is that the EH-RFID sensor nodes will be designed to consume very little energy.  This facilitates continuous operation using highly miniaturized energy harvesters.  This approach greatly reduces the barriers to embedded sensor installation.  EH-RFIDs shall be compatible with existing wireless sensor data aggregators (WSDAs), which feature an open architecture interface to HUMS boxes.  However, EH-RFID nodes will also be designed to perform autonomously on aircraft which may not have an installed HUMS system.",

        "abstract": "The AEDC Engine Test Facility (ETF) has more than 20 test cells that can be used for testing prototype propulsion systems and components.  The testing of propulsion systems requires significant data acquisition capabilities, with one test utilizing more than 4200 channels of instrumentation, including 700 thermocouples.  In response to the sheer set-up challenge, AEDC has developed the concept of Snap-In/Snap-Out sensors \u2013 in which each sensor is close-coupled to electronics sufficient to control the sensor and convert analog output to digital data that is transmitted over a network for recording and processing.  Streamline Automation has demonstrated feasibility during Phase 1 by designing, fabricating, and testing a bench-top prototype. This project will focus on designing, fabricating, and testing a prototype Miniaturized Thermocouple Scanner based on the system requirements.  BENEFIT:  According to a recent report by Frost & Sullivan, the market for LXI-enabled, networkable test and measurement equipment is expected to grow at an annual rate of 24.2% through 2012.  The market was estimated at $220 million in sales in 2007, and could grow to $650 million annually by 2012.  This is in contrast to the general purpose instrumentation market, which is expected to grow 3-4% annually.  This trend is encouraging, and shows the relatively rapid movement in the industry toward smart sensors.  To a great extent, the market reflects the fact that there are clear and significant cost savings to be gained by adopting smart sensors.  AEDC''s engine testing application involves the use of many sensors that are installed in the test cell for a short period of time.  The set-up time for installing and wiring these sensors directly impacts test schedules.  Additionally, current practice involves manually tracking the locations of thermocouples using spreadsheets that are prone to error and that may create problems downstream during data analysis.  The use of smart transducers will alleviate both of these problems.  The installation of smart thermocouples will make test set-up easier by minimizing the amount of wiring that is installed and run in the test cell.  Proper use of the TEDS will enable transducer location data to be stored along with other parameters.  The location information can then be carried along with the recorded data to ease the interpretation of test results.",

Overall, an explosive pulsed power system is required to be able to drive an RF source.  This eventually will include prime power, the generator, and a pulse forming circuit.  While the design and test of a explosive generator that does not produce debris was the main focus of the Phase I effort, we proposed and worked toward bringing along the energy storage capacitor as well.  In Phase II, we will continue this parallel development. For the explosive generator, the requirements are extremely challenging.  These may be summarized as four separate requirements to be satisfied within one design. 1. The system must be able to power an HPM source, implying the generation of 10\u2019s to 100\u2019s of joules of energy. 2. It must be compact enough to fit within a 3\u201d diameter and 24\u201d long enclosure and be capable of G hardening for the anticipated missions. 3. The system must be low mass to satisfy the needs of the small smart communicating kill vehicles, such as the Multiple Kill Vehicle (MKV). 4.

We propose to develop a set of software modules called PAWS (Propulsion Kinetics for Alternate Wavelength Signatures) and integrate them into existing MDA signature tools to extend their applicability to alternative bands. PAWS modules will consist of chemical rate, spectral bandmodel, and other chemical databases, and post-processing software. The PAWS approach anchors innovative kinetic modeling of detailed signature mechanisms to high-level computations and flight and laboratory observations. In Phase I we successfully demonstrated the approach by developing prototype PAWS modules, integrating them into the MDA SOCRATES-P/FLITES signature codes, and validating them against field data in the long-wave infrared (LWIR). In Phase II, PAWS will be extended to model signatures from 0.4-14 microns for a large set of propulsion systems and flow regimes. Phase II will upgrade SOCRATES-P/FLITES spectral and kinetic databases and underlying physics accordingly. These upgraded signature codes will be validated against a wide range of field data.",

One of the primary candidate material systems for manufacturing components in the exhaust structure is a polymer-derived matrix composite that uses a silicon carbide based fiber reinforcement. These CMC components can be complex shapes that require very precise dimensional tolerances. Deviations from as-molded and machined dimensions resulting from thermal excursions during processing can result in rejected parts. The aim of this program is to further develop and implement a modified processing scheme that will eliminate this particular problem. In order to achieve this goal, this program will focus on the thermal conditioning of the fiber reinforcement. Precise control of the thermal history of the reinforcement will result in improved dimensional stability. As a provider of interface coatings used in this type of ceramic composite, we will also investigate the effects of this thermal conditioning on the interface coating. The inclusion of this optimized process step is expected to both reduce the manufacturing cost (as a result of higher yield) and improve the lifetime of CMC components",

        "abstract": "Ceramic hybrid bearings have many excellent performance characteristics such as heat resistance, extended life, light weight, lower thermal expansion, electrical non-conductance, and thus become the top choice of rolling bearings for the F135 and F136 engines for the new generation Joint Striker Fighter F-35.  The main concern in using ceramic materials for bearing applications is their reliability, because small defects in the ceramic (silicon nitride) ball can cause catastrophic failure of the bearing and are particularly prejudicial when they are located close to the surface.  The existing techniques, however, can not simultaneously satisfy the requirements regarding the inspection cost, speed, resolution, and defect location (surface and subsurface).  In this proposal, Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) is developing an innovative Surface Wave Acoustic Microscopy (SWAM) inspection system for rapid inspection of small defects on the surface or subsurface of silicon nitride balls.  BENEFIT:  The SWAM prototype that can provide rapid inspection of small defects in a ceramic ball could be the first standalone product.  Hybrid bearings using silicon nitride balls as the rolling elements have been identified as the top choice for the next generation of high performance engines.  The proposed technology has potential to meet the needs for 100% inspection of bearing balls in a rapid and cost effective manner. Therefore, the commercialization potential of this technique is huge.",

        "abstract": "Use of the microwave spectral region (10,000-100 micron) for DoD applications is largely unexplored, but offers significant advantages.  For example, early detection of missile launches is key for missile defense.  However, detecting launches using airborne and space-based sensors under all illumination and weather conditions is extremely challenging.  The microwave region offers excellent cloud penetration and is not subject to solar illumination effects.  A key reason for the lack of exploration of microwave sensing applications is the lack of a microwave plume signature model. Spectral Sciences, Inc. will address this need through an innovative microwave plume radiative-transfer model.  In Phase I, we developed a prototype microwave/far-IR version of the DoD standard plume code, SPURC, and used it to perform a feasibility study of space-based microwave remote sensing of missile launches. In Phase II, we will finalize development of SPURC, integrate the microwave/far-IR approach into the widely used DoD scenario simulation model FLITES, extend the potential range of applications to other problems of military and commercial interest (e.g., chemical agent detection, atmospheric moisture profiling, hazardous chemical releases from factory smokestacks), and analyze plume field and laboratory flame data of microwave emissions.  BENEFIT:  The end product will be SPURC-MT (Microwave Terahertz), an accurate end-to-end model of plume signatures in the 30 GHz to 12THz (10,000 to 25 micron)  spectral region.   The software models will include all necessary parameter inputs and algorithmic capabilities to perform both internal combustion chamber, far-field plume simulations, and many other applications involving gas releases.  The microwave to terahertz electro-optical regions encompass many potential applications, including combustion monitoring, trace gas species detection, investigation of interstellar media, and control of industrial chemical processes.   Recent development of sources and detectors in this region has spurred great interest in this domain. The commercial value of SPURC-MT will be its ability to model the performance of the many sensor concepts being proposed and evaluated.    SPURC-MT will be packaged as stand-alone code and as a set of add-on modules with well designed interfaces allowing easy integration into our own and other third party scenario simulation and analysis software.",

        "abstract": "Accuray bases this proposal on an X-ray generator, model DX500K, designed, built, and delivered to a major contractor in December 2008 as part of the DNDO-CAARS program. Accuray`s DX500K operates at single or dual energy modes of 6 MeV and 9 MeV and interleaves between 6 MeV and 9 MeV at 400 Hz. The pulse to pulse jitter is negligible -- a major performance factor in high Z detection. The system operates in X-band making DX500K compact in size and weight. The strong progress of 6/9 MeV interleaved radiation as a means to detect high Z threat materials renders it a natural starting point for development of a 3/6/9 MeV interleaf system so that a single machine can accomplish multiple detection objectives in cargo inspection. We propose to use the DX500K as foundation to design a new system with energies 3, 6, and 9 MeV in single and interleaf modes. The repetition rate will be 800 Hz minimum with dose rates given in the technical proposal. Accuray has extensive experience in X-band accelerators. Our primary business in medical accelerators augments development of other applications via engineering, facilities and infrastructure and can easily transition to volume production.",

The Phase I research has shown that a viscous vortex particle method (VVPM) can provide a first-principle-based solution to the challenging rotor wake problem. Applying VVPM for wake vorticity transportation, while using a modern near body CFD solver for resolving vorticity sources of the rotor blades or fuselage will render an effective hybrid aerodynamic solution in support of comprehensive rotorcraft analysis. This Phase II SBIR will fully develop and implement the coupled VVPM/CFD/CSD solution for an accurate prediction of the rotor wake vorticity variation and the rotor airloads calculation. The proposed SBIR research emphasizes the fundamental rotorcraft wake dynamics modeling and resulting airloads prediction accuracy. The development will address the integration of the state-of-the-art VVPM with a modern  rotorcraft comprehensive analysis program, such as RCAS, in support of rotorcraft research, design, and engineering applications.

The unique approach proposed here uses electric power to drive a brushless ring motor and fan inside a duct. The ring motor is scalable and requires no gearing, linkages, or hot-gas plumbing. The low disk loading compared to turbojets and turbofans minimizes the amount of debris kicked up during operation, yet all rotating blades are enclosed inside a duct eliminating the safety hazard of exposed blades. With the advancements being made in specific power and efficiencies both in power electronics and electric motors, these powerplants have become a viable heavy lift option for VTOL applications.

        "abstract": "We propose to develop stand-alone computational modules for seamlessly extending the validity of continuum CFD codes into transitional and rarefied flow regimes. The modules will be designed for implementation in to existing legacy codes for use in the characterization of high altitude plume flows. The approach is based on a novel, regularized set of Navier-Stokes equations (RNS) that is extended to account for kinetic effects (intermediate Knudsen number, fluctuations) in the continuum approximation. RNS has several important features not found in classical NS equations that are of direct relevance in high altitude plume flows: (a) Natural accounting of both continuum and rarefied gas flow regimes; and (b) Kolmogorov-scale field fluctuations resulting from a mathematical model that accounts for turbulent diffusion in a natural manner that allows direct simulation of phenomena such as laminar-turbulent transition and wall slip effects. Phase I has completed the development of stand-alone, computational module prototypes incorporating a simplified version of the RNS approach. The modules were connected to a characteristics-based high order compressible flow code with particle transport capabilities, and an unstructured finite-element code, and were successfully exercised and evaluated for a model problem that contained features of both continuum and rarefied flows. Phase II will complete the development of the modules, provide a detailed comparison to Navier-Stokes results for low and high altitude flow regimes, identify the parameter region where the approach is advised, and provide connections to plume signatures sponsored and managed by the MDA/DES modeling and simulation effort.",

Additionally, two full-scale thermal management system (TMS) designs were completed. In Phase II, a full-scale TMS will be fabricated according to a design completed in Phase I. The prototype will be experimentally evaluated through numerous rounds of thermal and environmental testing. At the completion of the Phase II effort, Mainstream will deliver a compact, lightweight thermal management system that has proven to be a reliable solution.

In the Phase 1 study various CubeSat payloads were studied for utility.  Various missions were identified as high payoff demonstrations for on orbit experiments.  Conventionally orbital experiments would be tied to primary missions and were required to operate on a non interfere basis with primary payloads.  This restriction constrained the types and complexity of many experiments.  Recent advancements in Cube Satellites have produced the ideal platform for hosting complex experiments that normally would be constrained by a primary payload on a larger space craft. The Cube Satellites operate independently of other vehicles and provide a platform specifically tailored to the flight experiment.  The Phase 2 effort will produce a payload module that will perform a multi-functional encrypted communications mission.

For these reasons we propose to develop a prototype SERS sensor unit for underwater explosives detection in a configuration consistent with the size, power, and other specifications required to allow utilization with the Navy HULS and DHINS programs. In order to provide the optimum sensitivity for trace explosive detection we plan to utilize an integrated gold nanosurface SERS detector, a design based on the Company''s proprietary SERS chip technology.

Carburizing alloys available today may also provide benefits in thermal resistance, ballistic performance, and stress-corrosion cracking resistance; meaning a technology upgrade holds promise for both weight reduction and performance enhancement. QuesTek\u2019s Materials by Design\u00ae technology has been used to design Ferrium\u00ae C61, which has a high-strength / high-toughness core to allow for weight reduction or increased power density of components compared to that of 9310.

During the Phaes I Base program, the feasibility of a 15-25% reduction in weight was demonstrated. This alloy may represent a substantial weight-savings opportunity for the main rotor shaft on the CH-47 without requiring significant changes in the production process of the component. Other materials technologies using high strength steels may require weld zones, and titanium-based solutions would necessarily increase the design envelope and would likely not be backwards compatible with previous designs.

Synapse specifically targets the networking aspects of JMPS collaboration to enhance JMPS network capabilities and effectiveness. It is designed as an independent add-on product that will integrate seamlessly into existing and future JMPS software releases. Synapse will decrease the Navy''s time-to-plan and increase sortie rates, thus optimizing air group performance and increasing warfighter effectiveness. ATC will transition the Synapse software product developed by this SBIR effort into the US Navy fleet and accomplish initial operational capability for the product by the end of 2012.",

Currently, there is an urgent requirement to address this challenge for two essential RF capabilities: communications and electronic warfare (EW). Communications systems tend to operate at relatively low power levels, and with relatively high sensitivities for both transmit and receive functions. EW systems have comparable sensitivity requirements in their receive modes, but often require very high power levels in their transmit modes to perform their intended function. Because of the mutual sensitivities of the two systems, their simultaneous operation in the necessarily-close proximity afforded by typical US Army ground vehicles is a significant challenge that is not being adequately addressed in current systems. In the proposed Phase II effort, FIRST RF will continue investigation of the isolation techniques demonstrated during Phase I, including options exploiting interaction properties in the spatial, temporal, and spectral domains.

The great success of the highly pipelined sequential processor has now become a hindrance to the efficient scalability for the evolutionary escape route of cookie-cutter chip multi-processor (CMP) designs. RISC instruction sets exist because they are easy to decode and pipeline, but they have relatively low information density and operate on similarly primitive data types. If we look at the codes these CPUs are running, they are largely object-oriented languages. The lesson learned in the software world is that programmer productivity is relatively constant number of lines of code per day, whether assembly language or a much higher-level of abstraction in a modern object-based language. The information density and expressivity of the object-oriented language is much greater, as is the computational effort induced by each object method invocation. This is a good thing and should be emulated by hardware designers. We propose a package of several novel hardware-assisted object-based techniques to increase the value of our limited processor-to-network interfaces and the generally useful scalability of future CMP designs.",

        "abstract": "UARS (Unexploded ordnance Asset RFID System) is a secure, active radio frequency identification (RFID) system that when equipped to munitions provides a method for underground geolocation in the event that munitions do not explode.  Additionally UARS provides a method for authenticated wireless inventory of munitions in storage.   UARS is comprised of rugged, long-life, queriable RFID tags that are adhered to the outside of ordnance, such as the Mk82 500lb. bomb, forward of the tail kit.  The system\u2019s reader can be mounted on a UAV, carried on the ground by explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) personnel or unmanned vehicle/robot, or be used cooperatively in the ground and onboard air assets via a built in long-range wireless mesh network.  UARS utilizes modern RF technology that is proven to work while buried underground and is specifically tuned to provide a safe stand-off range to EOD personnel. Phase II of the UARS program aims to produce MIL-STD certified external tags for munitions tracking that are commercially ready for DoD adoption.  Based on extensive modeling and simulation in Phase I, ARES believes UARS will provide a superior RF performance, the lowest design risk, and delivery schedule that quickly equips EOD personnel with this cost saving technology.    BENEFIT:  Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) clearing continues to pose an expensive and dangerous proposition for U.S. and Allied forces, civilian populations, and environmental cleanup efforts around the world.  While the EPA estimates that UXO cleanup in the U.S. will cost roughly $14 billion overall, a single recent cleanup operation on Kaho''olawe Island Hawaii cost the Navy $330M.  For the same estimated cost of the Kaho\u2019olawe cleanup, the U.S. government could switch to UARS based technology and tag every single air dropped munition for the next 50 years while reducing lost lives and injuries. Opportunity cost savings at ranges equipped with UARS could amount to as much as $120,000 per day.  The commercialization of UARS technology will not only impact CONUS test-range operations, but will also benefit overseas soldiers advancing across pre-bombed battlefields, reducing the time to clear the field and the risk to coalition soldiers.    Additionally, the specific RFID tags being designed for UARS possess additional characteristics that make them an ideal candidate for future government tagging technology.  Their secure authentication protocol, long battery life, and long above-ground range makes them ideal for add-on equipment inventory applications or locating key assets during disaster recovery operations.  An example of this includes quick identification of sensitive assets in buried rubble, such as an embassy bombing or downed aircraft.",

        "abstract": "Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) contaminated areas range from military training facilities here at home to the battlefield located in foreign lands, this UXO poses threats to both civilian and military personnel alike. To help Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams locate and extract UXO, Williams-Pyro, Inc., is developing the Dynamic Remote Ordnance Identification and Detection (DROID) system, which comprises rugged, secure, and low-power active RFID tags and portable tag readers. Tags are affixed to ordnance before deployment and the tag reader, which supports UAV, handheld, or wheeled vehicle deployment, is flown/driven in a search pattern to locate the ordnance. Specialized algorithms use data collected from the tag reader to accurately determine the location of the UXO from ranges of up to 100 meters while the ordnance is buried up to 10 feet in the ground. The key technologies being developed during this effort include a survivable tagging technology and ordnance attachment method for the MK-80 series bombs to survive the extreme impact forces, accurate UXO location algorithms, and UXO location logging software. In Phase I, we proved the feasibility of this technology, and in Phase II we plan to create a rugged prototype and evaluate its performance in a realistic environment.  BENEFIT:  The issue with existing technologies is they employ sensors that must cover nearly every square inch of land. In addition, studies indicate that as few as 10% of UXO located using methods based on magnetic technology are actually UXO and not false readings. Williams-Pyro\u2019s proposed technology will greatly improve the speed and accuracy at which an area can be cleared of UXO while offering significant cost reduction. Our long-range tagging technology will allow much larger regions to be searched in much shorter times. Using our tag-based technology, where a tag is attached to the bomb body and remains with the bomb, false detections are nearly, if not completely, eliminated. This technology is also applicable to training facilities for clearing live or intentionally inert bombs dropped during training exercises. More area will be searched in the same time and at lower cost, speeding remediation and making it safer for people living near these areas as well as protecting the environment. Additional military applications include locating land mines and retrieving unattended ground sensors. Commercial use of this technology may include locating buried utilities components, such as pipes and valves.",

This effort will result in the development of a SOA decision-support tool suite based on the Human Systems Integration (HSI) integration framework successfully developed during Phase I. For Phase II Base period, we propose to identify high-level SOA requirements and then establish an HSE SOA network for development and testing. Once completed, Sonalysts will identify the specific requirements for implementation of an initial HSE Business Service within the Lighthouse. During the Option periods, we propose to extend the prototype Lighthouse functionality with additional HSE Business Services and if feasible, establish SOA connectivity with industry, the Navy, or both.",

        "abstract": "ELINT systems are often limited in bandwidth because the Nyquist criterion restricts the sampled bandwidth to one half of the maximum sampling rate of the A/D converter. While A/D converter technology has improved over the last several years, it is still not sufficient for many wideband applications. Compressive sensing (CS) is a revolutionary concept recently proposed that allows for wider bandwidths to be processed using sampling rates less than the Nyquist rate when the sampled signals are sparse. Radar signals, such as those detected by an ELINT receiver typically meet such requirements for sparseness. GIRD Systems proposes to develop a hardware prototype of a new compressive sensing method that was developed in Phase I and is optimized for ELINT receivers that detect radar signals. By selecting an appropriate basis function set, we can deliver a system that meets performance expectations while still capable of being implemented in hardware.",

        "abstract": "Aircraft use thin-walled high-strength tubing for hydraulic systems. As wall thickness is reduced to save weight, the ability of the tubing to withstand flaws, induced either in manufacturing or in service, becomes critical. High performance aircraft use titanium alloys to save weight and provide high system pressure capability. Using higher operating pressures allows actuators to be smaller and hence lighter, saving weight. However, these thin walled tubes are very susceptible to outside diameter damage in particular where even very shallow marks, 0.004\u201d deep, have been shown to suffer substantial fatigue life reduction. The proposed solution is to make the tubing more tolerant of flaws by inducing deep residual compressive stresses using a new surface treatment process, cavitation peening. This project will develop the methods and tooling to adapt the cavitation peening technology so that it can be applied to tubing outside and inside diameters to generate high magnitude, deep and stable residual stresses. This low cost technology will add no weight to the aircraft while improving reliability and flaw tolerance. Phase I has demonstrated the benefits of the technology, improving the fatigue life of damaged tubing by a factor of 20.",

It is apparent that silicon power semiconductor devices are fundamentally unable to simultaneously achieve high-voltage, high-current, and low-loss performance.

Efforts are underway to develop compact RRDI ladar seekers to test against objective decoys and targets. These programs face many technical challenges, and their success hinges on parallel developments in advanced compact, high-power, near diffraction limited coherent solid-state lasers. Aret\u00e9 Associates proposes a highly innovative monolithic amplifier configuration that eliminates major technical barriers associated with legacy approaches. This novel approach enables high average power scaling of the objective advanced discrimination ladar transmitter waveform in a compact and rugged package that is compatible with the requirements of the delivery platform. The proposed amplifier architecture elegantly solves traditional efficiency roadblocks by minimizing parasitic losses due to amplified spontaneous emission, excited state absorption, indirect optical pumping, and laser diode thermal management. The use of advanced ultra-transparent ceramic composite materials enables power scaling to objective average powers of 500 W without levying harsh penalties on the packaging weight and volume. Aret\u00e9 will develop a brass-board prototype Advanced Ladar Transmitter for integration and testing in Aret\u00e9\u2019s long-range Coded Aperture Ladar (CAL) system.

This flask can then be monitored to provide updated information on structural integrity and remaining life assessment. BENEFITS: There are a number of commercial and government applications that could benefit from the embedded strain sensing technology developed in this program. Luna will look for additional pressure vessel applications with partner SCI and applications in other critical composite systems including areas such as wind turbines, and naval, aerospace and civil infrastructure applications. The improved system ruggedness and sensing capability developed in this program will continue to open new potential applications for Luna\u2019s optical sensing technology.",

        "abstract": "Rechargeable lithium batteries with improved safety/abuse tolerance and high energy densities are needed for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), aircraft, soldier power and other Air Force platforms.  Current lithium-ion batteries utilize flammable organic solvent-based electrolytes which result in safety hazards, particularly during abuse/overcharge conditions. In addition, current lithium-ion batteries have relatively low energy densities due to the limited charge storage capacity of current anodes and cathodes.  Lynntech is currently developing advanced solid-state lithium batteries based on a highly conductive solid inorganic electrolyte and advanced, high capacity electrodes. The highly conductive solid electrolyte can provide solid-state batteries with significantly improved safety/abuse tolerance compared with current Li-ion batteries.  The development of high capacity electrodes can provide solid-state batteries with improved energy densities compared with current Li-ion batteries.   During the Phase II project, Lynntech will optimize battery fabrication and performance and determine the cycle life, energy and power density, temperature capabilities, and safety/abuse tolerance of prototype solid-state lithium batteries. The Phase II project will also develop designs and processes to produce scaled-up solid-state lithium batteries. The advanced solid-state batteries can provide improved safety/abuse tolerance, high energy density energy storage/delivery systems for a variety of Air Force/DoD platforms, including UAVs, soldier power, and other applications.  BENEFIT:  The proposed solid-state lithium batteries can provide improved rechargeable batteries for numerous Air Force/DoD platforms, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), soldier power, aircraft power, munitions, and other applications.  The specific advantages of the solid-state batteries are improved safety/abuse tolerance, high energy density, and improved temperature capabilities. Specific benefits for DoD include improved safety, extended duration missions, reduced carry weight for soldiers, and reduced costs. In addition to military applications, the batteries also have numerous private sector applications (dual-use). Private sector applications include electric and hybrid electric vehicles, auxiliary power units, and consumer electronic devices (cellular phones, laptop computers, etc.).",

        "abstract": "A flexible hose and drogue system typically employed in aircraft refueling operations has proved reliable except when excessive forces are induced on the receiving aircraft\u2019s refueling probe, invoking a break-away design feature and potentially creating FOD. A new approach is required to eliminate this break-away design feature, thus avoiding FOD and potential significant damage to the aircraft. This requires development of an innovative probe design that can withstand the high loads caused from a hose whip condition and will not break-away, due to the introduction of a high strength and flexible component into the probe mast. Design concepts have been developed and examined through a number of dynamic performance analyses for typical operational scenarios to demonstrate feasibility.

        "abstract": "Although solid rocket motors (SRM) are ideally suited to many propulsion applications, their lack of controllability restricts their mission flexibility. Following ignition of an SRM\u2019s propellant grain, combustion continues until all propellant is consumed. Controllability of the motor\u2019s thrust profile can provide improved missile performance and multi-role capability. One approach to gaining controllability is to use a pulse motor configuration, in which multiple solid propellant grains, physically separated by a barrier, are ignited individually, and burn independently, thereby providing multiple, discreet thrust pulses. Past development programs have proven technologies capable of providing thrust management but have not entered service mainly due to reduced propellant mass fraction and resulting loss in total impulse. A need exists for advanced materials and processes to overcome these performance losses and provide pulse motor thrust management payoffs at affordable cost and with high reliability and safety. Cornerstone Research Group Inc.

Using that knowledge, innovative reliability analysis techniques will calculate component reliabilities using tracked life usage indicators and maintenance information. These techniques are well suited to addressing the competing risk problem as we deal with multiple failure modes and the right-censoring problem, as components are maintained before they fail. Once fleet-wide in-service component reliability is calculated, it will be trended and tracked. Users will be notified of any significant deviations in reliability early on. An opportunistic maintenance/component matching optimization module will also use in-service reliability to make recommendations on warranted maintenance and component replacement selection. Specifically the core innovations of the proposed work include: 1) a knowledge discovery module that processes maintenance records, trends reliability and detects outliers; 2) an in-service component reliability analysis module based on historical maintenance records; and 3) an opportunistic maintenance/component matching optimization module that would maximize the expected time on wing.",

        "abstract": "Solid propellant controllable systems are now being successfully applied to the SM3 DACS and are rapidly becoming a cornerstone in enabling missile defense systems to target and destroy threats. Despite the  low mass fraction, low thruster performance,  limited operating time, and the high cost of not gas valves, the highly desirable features of storability, safety and insensitivity make solid propulsion desirable.  As a result, it is the goal of industry to discover new technologies to improve controllable solid systems\u2019 performance and cost while maintaining the storability, safety and insensitivity advantages. To address this need Valley Tech Systems has conceptualized a controllable solid system that increases system performance and mass fractions while replacing commonly used complex nozzles by simpler and lighter valves.  The new system is enabled with the use of Electric Solid Propellant (ESP) combined with Valley Tech Systems\u2019 Propellant Control Algorithm (P-Con). This system uses an electric controller to directly ignite extinguish and proportionally vary the propellant burn rate and thrust. The result is a new controllable propulsion architecture that greatly improves high altitude and exo-atmospheric system performance while reducing weight and cost. Additionally, long duration operation capability is enabled due to on-demand ignition and extinguishment of the ESP. During the Phase II SBIR numerous tests are planned to demonstrate the critical control aspects of ignition, extinguishment and throttling of an ESP propellant grain using the P-Con control system.",

        "abstract": "The authors establish a novel metrology system capable of determining the pose of a robotically-mounted End of Arm Tool (EOAT) in Six Degrees of Freedom (6-DOF) to a capability better than True Position (TP) 0.010 in.  The metrology system consists of low-cost, modular components in the form of motorized gimbals that steer laser beams onto robot-affixed, photosensitive chips typical of those found in digital cameras.  The system was conceived to provide real-time pose information of an EOAT to better than True Position (TP) 0.0035 in. at the Tool Center Point (TCP).  The system is scalable, deployable, and affordable, making it a viable candidate for guiding machines, particularly articulated arm robots, to aerospace tolerances over large volumes.  Monte Carlo simulations, which propagate error through the system out to the EOAT, have shown the ability to determine the TCP to no worse than TP 0.002 in. over the volume of an F-35 Lightning II Wing Box robotic drilling system.  Manufacturing Readiness Level 5 (MRL-5) testing of the system in a less than optimal environment showed it capable of determining the TCP to TP 0.0119 in. when compared to a laser tracker device.  The current system updates the EOAT pose at 10 Hz.  Significant improvement in both speed and accuracy will be achieved with minimal engineering changes to the system components, along with better mounting hardware and a more manufacturing-caliber test environment.  It is intended that such a system will enable further penetration of Commercial, Off-the-Shelf (COTS) articulated arm robots into applications that previously required Numerically Controlled (NC) gantry machines, resulting in either less expensive systems or systems that provide significant span time reduction for approximately the same cost.  In addition, the system could also be used to retrofit NC machines so that they achieve higher accuracies; to align large structures such as fuselages and wings during aerospace assembly; and to serve as a tool that enables ''birth certificate'' modeling of enhanced accuracy robots.  BENEFIT:  As mentioned previously, VRSI will be using a laser tracker as the benchmark for the novel guidance technology.  The main points of comparison include cost, accuracy, speed, reliability, and scalability. With regard to cost, a typical laser tracker solution for robot guidance is ~ $210k not including integration services.  This includes the laser tracker ($120k), optical corner cube clusters that need to be attached to the EOAT ($15k per EOAT), twenty additional Spherically Mounted Retroreflectors (SMRs) required as fixed work cell ''fiducials'' ($1k ea, for $20k + $10k for support tooling), laser tracker mounting hardware ($10k if stationary tracker at a single position), and controls software ($30k).  Of course a spare tracker would add another $120k. VRSI''s AARG solution comes in at ~ $197k for hardware and software.  This includes four Beacons (one arc second accuracy at $25k ea, for $100k), eight Active Targets attached to the EOAT ($1.5k ea, for $12k per EOAT), twenty additional Active Targets required as fixed work cell ''fiducials'' ($1.25k ea, for $25k + $10k for support tooling), Beacon mounting hardware ($20k), and controls software ($30k).  A spare Beacon would add another $25k.  So although the upfront cost is not necessarily compelling, it becomes more so when spare parts are considered ($330k versus $222k). Keeping with the one arc second accurate Beacons, computer simulations have shown that VRSI''s AARG system should perform as accurately as a laser tracker in determining the position of the EOAT TCP, at around TP 0.0035 in.  This comparison takes into consideration published laser tracker accuracies in conjunction with the typical geometry between the EOAT corner cube cluster targets and the TCP.  If greater accuracies are desired, a half arc second Beacon is currently available for $45k ea, pushing the system cost from $197k to $277k, but allowing the TCP to be determined to an accuracy of TP 0.002 in. The AARG system currently generates the 6-DOF pose of the EOAT at 10 Hz.  Our experience with laser trackers shows a typical pose acquisition time of eight seconds.  Assuming that each of the F-35 Wing Box holes will require two EOAT pose measurements (initial measurement, then validation measurement following a corrective offset), this comes to a guidance reduction of just under four hours per Wing Box surface (2 measurements x 950 fasteners x 7.5 sec/fastener = 237.5 min) if a single robot is being used to drill.  This advantage is lessened as more robots are added to the drilling cell, as the other robots may be busy drilling while one is being guided. Concerning reliability, laser trackers are reasonably robust.  However, as VRSI currently owns five laser trackers and has used them for years, it is not uncommon for a laser tracker to need emergency service once per year.  The Beacons that VRSI has employed in Phase I come directly from the field of land surveying, and are designed for outdoor conditions involving high humidity and temperature variations (arctic versions are available), commonly being used in mining and construction applications.  Since thousands of them are in use across the world, it is safe to consider them as being MRL-10 devices. The modularity of the AARG solution combined with the lower component cost per line of sight affords it an advantage over laser trackers when it comes to scalability.  VRSI has also outlined procedures for ''plug and play'' swapping of defective Beacons and Active Targets, and would like to validate these methods as part of a Phase II effort.",

In a successful Phase I SBIR effort, ATA began the development of a 5\u201d space qualified, fast steering mirror (SQ_FSM) by demonstrating a breadboard version of a radiation hardened, high accuracy position sensor; ATA also began developing and analyzing an innovative mechanical design that addresses thermal management and residual reaction torque, which are critical in a space environment. This Phase II proposal will advance the SQ_FSM Optical Unit design to CDR level, develop innovative radiation hardened position sensor and actuator designs, and design, build and test an SQ_FSM Engineering Development Unit (EDU) suitable for laboratory performance verification.",

Using a miniaturized DNA sequencing format the device will enable DNA-based identification of individuals as well as determination of family relationships (kinship) between individuals. The system will be implemented using Advanced Liquid Logic`s proprietary Digital Microfluidics technology, which is based on the use of electrical fields to precisely and programmably manipulate liquid droplets within a selfcontained cartridge. Complex analytical procedures can be flexibly implemented as a sequence of computer-controlled droplet operations without the use of pumps or valves. Both the instrument and the disposable cartridge can be made extremely inexpensively to provide a low cost per test with minimal infrastructural investment.\nIn the Phase I project, Advanced Liquid Logic was tasked with developing detailed product requirements, evaluating the proposed technological approach and performing preliminary design and conception of the proposed product. Based on the Phase I studies, a Phase II project is proposed in which a working prototype will be delivered for evaluation by DHS. Following completion of the Phase II project a Phase III product development effort will be launched to deliver a commercial rapid DNA testing product that meets DHS's requirements.\n",

However, the chrome electro deposition process generates hazardous waste and the DoD has been moving to eliminate its use. Liners made from Tantalum-Tungsten (Ta-W) alloys have been shown to be an acceptable substitute. These alloys have a high melting temperature, are more erosion resistant then chromium and will potentially increase the service life of gun barrels. Conventional manufacturing techniques used to date have not been able to consistently produce parts within acceptable drawing tolerances or without degradation to the integrity of the clad surface.

        "abstract": "The overall goal of the Phase II effort is to develop the novel ultra-rapid chemical mechanical finishing (UCMF) process for SiC mirror manufacturing, and commercialize this process in collaboration with existing vendors using existing equipment infrastructure. Unlike glass and metallic systems, the high hardness and chemical inertness of SiC currently limit the finishing of SiC mirrors to mechanical polishing processes that rely on diamond based slurries. Such processes are characterized by low removal rates and large sub-surface damage that results in multiple step finishing processes. The UCMF technology uses chemical assisted polishing process that rapidly removes SiC by chemically reacting with the surfaces, thereby resulting in ultra- smooth surface finish, and significantly reduced sub-surface damage. The UCMF process has the potential to reduce the processing times and decrease the number of finishing steps, thereby resulting in significant cost and time savings. Sinmat estimates that the successful integration of its UCMF process by existing vendors will result in 50% to 80% savings in SiC mirror finishing processes based on the enhanced removal rates and decrease in processing steps. Sinmat estimates that this project will reach TRL 6/7 levels by the completion of the Phase II program.",

        "abstract": "Under this Phase II effort, the A2-T2 team will build upon the success of our Phase I project to further extend pre-shot standoff detection of snipers and potential snipers. The system is based on the existing Photo-Automatic-Linking-System for facial detection and recognition with added capabilities specifically directed at sniper detection to create PALS for Sniper Detection (PALS-SD). PALS-SD is a multi-modal camera-based system that employs electro-optics, range finding, and new classes of eye-safe lasers to detect sniper signatures, to include detection of eyes, faces, rifle scopes, binoculars, and other indicators of surveillance. The system is designed to support the required range of up to 600 meters. A key to the concept is our 360-degree high rate screening module, which quickly scans the environs of the transport vehicle to identify potential snipers. Once the signature of a potential sniper is detected, the powerful long-range optics examine the target area for confirmation of the presence of a sniper. The proposed effort represents a progressive advancement of the concept through modeling and simulations, through laboratory testing, and into field-testing through realistic battlespace scenarios, resulting in an advanced concept for preproduction prototyping. The system will be supported with advanced software for command and control and imaging analytics for high rejection of false alarms. Under our modular concept, PALS-SD lends itself to vehicle transport as well as eventual deployment on robotic platforms and potentially warfighter-borne configurations. This modular approach further facilitates integration of PALS-SD with other force protection tools, such as acoustic sniper detection systems and automatic sighting of both lethal and nonlethal weapons.",

        "abstract": "Military and Law Enforcement groups are increasingly relying on unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) to perform life-threatening tasks such as urban reconnaissance operations in and around buildings and other structures. The seemingly simply task of having the UGV open doors and entering rooms is a crucial element of this mission. However, the ability of currently fielded UGVs to open doors is time-consuming for some vehicles and, due to mechanical and control limitations, nearly impossible for others. Although some expert operators may be able to use currently fielded UGVs to open doors, the task typically requires careful, fully-committed attention and a great deal of skill, which increases user fatigue, total mission duration, and time-on-target. This SBIR effort aims to design a sophisticated end-effector for opening a wide variety of doorknob shapes and styles that can be used with currently fielded and next generation mobile manipulator robotic platforms. The end-effector is designed to be a modular tool that can be used with RE2\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existing modular and tool-interchange technology. This Phase II effort will also develop the sensing and coordinated control algorithms to allow an operator to simply position the UGV in front of a door, initiate the door opening procedure, and then let the robot do the rest by autonomously opening the door and passing through the doorway.

        "abstract": "The operating conditions of air-breathing propulsion engines demand designs that include cooling by the fuel and use of lightweight materials that withstand extreme heat fluxes under oxidizing conditions.  Currently there are no means to non-invasively measure the fuel temperature with the required temporal and spatial resolution.  It is important to monitor and maintain the maximum fuel temperature below critical levels in order to prevent coking.  For ground-based experiments, real-time fuel temperature measurements can be used to relax safety constraints, thereby allowing for higher speed flow and longer length experiments. Furthermore, experience, information, and instrumentation developed as the result of ground-based experiments can form the basis for in-flight test capability.  Flight hardened test capability can be incorporated as part of a control strategy that would enhance overall combustor efficiency by balancing fuel flow rates with combustor wall temperature to yield the most optimum operating conditions. In this program we apply the ultrasonic thermometry in 2 areas; 1) fuel temperature measurements in the manifold region and 2) fuel temperature in one of the combustor cooling passages.  As a by-product of cooling passage measurement we will also measure heat flux and surface temperature of material between the combustion inner chamber and cooling channel.    BENEFIT:  Ultrasonic thermometry offers unique capabilities to hypersonic vehicle development.  Improved thermal transport measurement methods speed development, improve understanding, and enhance our ability to validate analytical models and hardware for numerous propulsion and aeroshell applications.  The non-intrusive nature of the method is particularly attractive for hostile environment encountered in hypersonic flight.  The immediate market for this technology is primarily in military applications where there is a need for improved thermal transfer measurement tools to drive the development and evaluation of hypersonic materials and components.   In addition to the applications in hypersonic vehicle and propulsion systems, the ultrasonic temperature sensor technology has applications in the areas of space lift, space platform, combustion research, and missiles.  There is also a potential commercial market in areas where thermal transport data is needed in relatively inaccessible regions such as combustion chambers, reactors and in some glass molding operations.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this Air Force SBIR Phase II proposal is to optimize and develop an environmentally friendly replacement for the carcinogenic hexavalent chromium based conversion coatings on AMS 4434 Magnesium and Zinc-Nickel plated AISI 4130 and 4340 steel substrates. The proposed research is a continuation to the successful studies conducted during the Phase I stage of establishing the feasibility of a new trivalent chromium based conversion coating for the aforementioned alloys. The proposed conversion coating is a formulation of trivalent chromium, zirconium and an organic inhibitor in proportions found to offer effective corrosion protection and paint adhesion properties. Design and optimization of an efficient surface activation with the effective pretreatment of the surface for the deposition of reliable conversion coating shall be investigated. Corrosion resistance, coating adherence, multi-layer coating systems, simulated depot-level maintenance procedures including stripping/rework and their effects on the fatigue and corrosion resistance shall be investigated. The end result of the proposed research would be a complete environmentally green Trivalent Chromium based Conversion Coating process and product system as a performance and cost effective replacement for the carcinogenic Hexavalent Chromium Conversion Coatings on AMS 4434 Magnesium and Zinc-Nickel plated AISI 4130 and 4340 steel parts.  BENEFIT:  Magnesium alloys are used in military applications as helicopter gearbox casings, transmission casings, inline skates and some other high strength-low weight required applications. Kruger flaps, reverse thrust manifolds and control wheels found on many commercial aircrafts such as Boeing 727, 737 are sand-cast out of AZ92A alloy. The longest living aircraft B-52 Stratofortress brake calipers are manufactured out of AZ92A-T6. In spite of its high strength-to-weight ratio, magnesium alloys suffer from high corrosion rate coupled with complicated and expensive pretreatment routines. However, looking at the increasing trend of magnesium alloy usage in Military, Aerospace, Automotive sectors, METALAST believes a breakthrough in developing a successful replacement of hexvalent coatings would find widespread usage and demand. Cadmium plating of steel is another carcinogenic corrosion inhibition system restricted in many military applications. Zn-Ni plating, as a sacrificial layer, was found to be a suitable and economical alternative for various steel applications including fasteners, bolts and rivets. In the wake of recent EPA, OSHA and DoD directives for the replacement or limitation of the typical hexavalent conversion coating, there is a huge demand and need for an environmentally green yet potentially effective conversion coating system. Existing alternatives haven\u2019t been either economical or potentially superior.  METALAST International has often understood this need and demand from metal finishing industry. Hence, METALAST envisions the need and plans to utilize this opportunity through SBIR to develop an efficient replacement. Developing an environmentally green conversion coating will not only negate the health hazards but also increase the lifetime of both magnesium and Zn-Ni plated steel parts, the parts adjoined, subsequently reducing the high maintenance costs.",

        "abstract": "Determining the scattering properties of small boats on a rough sea surface is a problem of high importance to the Navy. Due to the conducting nature of the surrounding water, the scattering signature of the boat cannot be determined just from a geometrical model in vacuum, but requires the simulation of its environment as well. The resulting simulations require large amounts of memory and computing time and innovation is required to accelerate these simulations. During the Phase I, we demonstrated that graphics processing units (GPUs) can be used to accelerate a key algorithm for electromagnetic scattering simulations, a parallel out-of-core dense solver, by at least an order of magnitude. Based on inferred scaling laws we expect this speedup to be maintained for systems beyond 1,000,000 unknowns. The Phase II project will be split into a base and an option period. The goal of the Phase II base period is to incorporate the GPU accelerated solver into the widely used electromagnetic modeling code WIPL-D. In addition, we will investigate GPU acceleration of the matrix-fill part. In the Phase II Option period we will then investigate the suitability of GPUs to accelerate a more approximate method, the fast multipole method.",

        "abstract": "We propose to create a discrimination engine for the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) based on the concept of manifold learning algorithms.  Manifold learning algorithms have come to prominence within the computer vision community as a type of feature extraction algorithm which does not require specific features to be learned a priori.  High dimensional sensor data is input to these algorithms which find a lower dimensional representation of the same data, illustrating differences between potential target types.  The algorithm can explore regions of the data space for which there are no feature extraction algorithms.  We propose to apply these algorithms to high resolution range profiles of target features and embed these results in a novel inference engine to create an on-line discrimination system.  Our team consists of staff who have contributed to the development of a prototype system based on these algorithms, as well as radar engineers who can build complex simulated data modeling real objects.

The program is divided into a baseline and two options. In the baseline program we will develop a continuous-wave laser operating at a wavelength of 2.1 microns with a power of approximately 120 watts. In the option programs, the 2.1-micron laser will be converted to pulsed operation; it will then be utilized as the pump for an optical parametric oscillator to generate mid-IR radiation around a wavelength of 4 micron. The development of this 4-micron source, which will represent a factor-of-10 increase in high-repetition-rate, pulsed mid-IR power over the current state of the art, is applicable to improved jamming of missile seekers that sense radiation of this wavelength. Such IR-seeking missiles, also known as \u201cheat-seeking\u201d missiles, have for many years posed a grave threat to both military and commercial aircraft.

        "abstract": "In a conventional phased array radar (PAR), analog beamforming networks reduce the entire array into a few combined beams (e.g., sum beam, difference beams) at X-band. Next generation PAR will use a hybrid approach, forming many subarray beams in analog, and then performing a second-stage of beamforming digitally. In analog beamforming systems, only a few DREX modules are needed for the entire radar (one for each beam). For a next-generation hybrid radar, a DREX module is needed for each subarray. Since this could mean hundreds of DREX modules might be required in a complete system, this puts pressure on cost, size, weight, and power (CSWAP) of the DREX module and subsystem. Azure Summit Technology has teamed with a production supplier of miniature RF COTS to develop a reduced CSWAP DREX product for NGR. We will leverage technologies from commercial wireless and telecom markets and RF systems design and DSP systems engineering expertise.  In Phase I we determined that a 1 GHz DREX is feasible within the $20k/20W/20in3 targets, and a 2 GHz DREX is feasible at modest additional cost.  In Phase II, we will prototype the DREX in a small phased array, complete with Digital Beamforming (DBF).",

Accurate, unobtrusive methods for continuous calibration of large phased arrays produce savings during fabrication by relaxing the tight requirements on mounting structures and temperature stable RF components.  In some field environments where the full array is assembled for the first time on site, factory calibration is not practical, and these approaches offer accurate means for system verification. FIRST RF proposes a set of novel calibration methods that are unobtrusive to system architecture and operations, while providing accurate, fast, and continuous calibration of the phased array in the field.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II program proposal will apply an innovative method of prognostic-enabling an electronic board in a modular countermeasures computer (MCC) for an Air Force Electronic Warfare (EW) system.  The ability to detect impending failures in complex electronics systems supports condition-based maintenance (CBM) programs to reduce maintenance costs and increase operational readiness of advanced EW systems.  The innovative method detects degradation in digital systems, such as those used in EW systems, by using an advanced power draw correlation technique, which uses a non-intrusive pseudo-random sequence (PRS) of digital bits and comparing that input to the resulting ordinary digital noise on the input power bus of a digital-based system. If the digital system is operating within its specifications, there will be a high-correlation between the input PRS sequence and the power supply noise; but if the digital system is degraded, the degree of correlation is reduced, with the degree of non-correlation increasing as degradation increases.  The completed SBIR Phase II program will include a test bed to demonstrate a prototype suitable for use in a laboratory environment. This prototype will be an excellent platform for subsequent evaluation, testing and integration to a specific EW system platform.

RadiaBeam Technologies proposes the development of an inexpensive, handportable accelerator to replace radionuclide radiography devices. The accelerator, which we term the MicroLinac, is based on X-band RF linac technology developed at SLAC, and is powered by a commercially available inexpensive RF source. The entire system would weigh less than 25 lbs and could be sold in the future for less than $30k. Such a device will offer a competitive, commercially viable and, most importantly, much safer radiation source for industrial and medical radiography and well logging applications, thus simultaneously promoting technological advancement and public safety.",

The penalty-and-response capability will include support for processing binary applications offline as well as dynamically at run time. To facilitate integration with deployed systems, a tamper response packaging tool will allow the application developer to identify CPI within the binary, and then to tailor the specific responses that will occur during an attack / tamper.

While portable, the device can be \"docked\" with a rehabilitation tool to provide feedback during a physical and cognitive therapy session. While it is docked, any additional sensing that is available via the rehabilitation tool can be utilized by the virtual therapist to sense affect and for feedback. Furthermore, the therapist can be presented on the screen of the rehabilitation tool (rather than the smart phone) during the session. Progress can be monitored and recorded in a secure web data management system that is SCORM-compliant and used to adjust the affective state estimation and feedback from PATRICIA.",

As a part of our approach, the Securboration Team offers the following: (1) Highly-qualified Team with extensive experience in semantic interoperability, ontological reasoning, agent frameworks, schema matching, data transformation, and data cleansing technologies. (2) Direct alignment to Government application applied to USTRANSCOM\u2019s Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), as indicated by the Support letters from USTRANSCOM in Section 5 of this proposal (3) Viable commercialization opportunity by integrating SOAMS technology directly into CDM\u2019s MARVEL AES commercial release. Our approach uses a domain model that facilitates a top-down approach to the matching and translation problem by allowing schema alignment based on meaning to semantically match schema and then use syntactical methods for further matching and transformation.  BENEFIT:  Our partnership with Dr. Pohl and CDM will enable SOAMS to be developed with an eye towards integration possibilities with CDM\u2019s MARVEL AES commercial product. The synergies are excellent between the two, which is a basis for the long term teaming arrangements. Additionally, SOAMS has broad capability to support SOA component vendors, particularly as a product that facilitates SOA implementations.

These batteries achieve long shelf life by storing the liquid electrolyte separately in a reservoir.  Upon activation, the electrolyte is rapidly injected into the battery cells, most often using a pyrotechnic gas generator.  The design of the system and the diagnosis of performance problems are challenging for several reasons; one key complication is the feedback of the hydraulic design of the battery on the pressure driving the electrolyte reservoir\u2019s piston and the pressure-dependent gas generation rate.  These challenges are made more difficult because no analytical tools are currently available to assist battery engineers.  The trial-and-error procedure now used to develop these batteries greatly increases the time and expense necessary to qualify a new design and to deal with problems encountered in service.  To address this need, Erigo proposes to develop a comprehensive, easy-to-use computer model that simulates the pyrotechnic gas generator and the battery itself in an integrated fashion.

Radar cross section (RCS) can vary sensitively with small changes in the various parameters, applying standard interpolation techniques to obtain the required resolution becomes impractical.  Under the SBIR Phase I contract HQ0006-09-C-7150,  HyPerComp has made significant strides in advancing the state of the art in physics-based computational electromagnetics (CEM) in the following areas: 1) high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin (DG)-based algorithms, 2) uncertainty estimation based on a chaos polynomial expansion procedure, 3) a reduced order-basis method (RBM) for greatly minimizing  the computational burden of generating large data domes, and 4) exploiting the advances in graphic processing unit (GPU) computing for dramatic speed-ups in computation over conventional central processing unit (CPU) type computing.

        "abstract": "Hot structures fabricated from ceramic composite materials are an attractive design option for components of future high-speed aircraft and propulsion systems to reduce weight and increase performance. However, available ceramic composite components fabricated from laminated fiber preforms can suffer from inadequate interlaminar tensile strength, thereby increasing their vulnerability to delamination when subjected to high thru-thickness thermal gradients, acoustic/high cycle fatigue, impact damage, and/or normal loads. The ability to intelligently design components to avoid premature interlaminar failures requires a fundamental understanding of the interlaminar properties of the material; not only at ambient temperatures, but more importantly, at elevated temperatures. Although there are Industry standards for Interlaminar Shear strength (ILS) testing of ceramic composites, no such consensus exists for Interlaminar Tension (ILT) strength testing - particularly at elevated temperatures. Under Phase I, the feasibility of an innovative test method for characterizing the elevated temperature ILT strength properties of ceramic composites was successfully demonstrated. The test method enables using small, flat material samples of representative thickness (~0.125-in) and was shown to correlate well with that obtained by flatwise tension testing of epoxy-bonded circular samples consistent with the ASTM standard (C-1468) at ambient temperature. The objective of this Phase II program is to optimize the test sample geometry and test method to suit a variety of different available ceramic composite systems (e.g., CVI, MI, PIP, etc.). This effort will culminate into the development and verification of an industry acceptable ASTM Test Standard for elevated ILT testing of ceramic composites.",

        "abstract": "Military aerospace structures require that a fiberglass galvanic corrosion isolation layer be used between any graphite composite parts in contact with aluminum. Adding a layer of fiberglass prepreg onto the aluminum-mating side of the composite laminate is a simple way to meet this requirement. Rapid curing resins and prepreg initiated using UltraViolet (UV) or Light Emitting Diode (LED) energy are currently being developed by Renegade to eliminate expensive and time-consuming vacuum-bag cure. The goal of this program is to demonstrate and deliver a low-energy cure equipment system that can be used to quick-cure epoxy-fiberglass prepreg and to restore the galvanic barrier on military aircraft, while minimizing floor space and maximizing worker safety. This technology will be able to quickly apply a galvanic barrier layer to a wide variety of complex composite shapes and sizes without tailoring the cure parameters for each part. Interaction will be needed between the composite parts fabricator, formulated resin/prepreg supplier, and the UV/LED lamp system provider for the successful transition of low-energy cure into production. The lamp system must be designed to minimize the shadow areas and provide uniform and stable spectral output at energy wavelengths that are consistent with the requirements of the resin/prepreg.",

        "abstract": "Designers of modern, high speed electrical power generation machinery have had great success in increasing the overall system efficiency of these machines over the past few decades. These increases in efficiency are extremely important for applications in modern tactical aircraft, where any losses ultimately heat the fuel. As machine power levels increase to meet aircraft  system demands, fuel temperature limits can lead to undesirable tradeoffs. One power loss mechanism that designers have not significantly reduced is windage losses. During Phase I, Xdot Engineering and Analysis analytically showed the feasibility of a new approach for reducing windage losses. During the Phase II effort, Xdot will optimize this approach and demonstrate optimized implementations in a full scale test rig at relevant speeds. The optimization effort will be performed using a CFD analysis that will be validated with new experimental windage loss data generated during the Phase II effort. The experimental portion of the project will be performed using a new windage loss test rig designed specifically to provide accurate rotor windage loss measurements at speeds of up to 60,000 RPM with full scale test hardware.   BENEFIT:  The proposed Phase II effort will end with the demonstration of an optimized windage loss reduction technology suitable for use in a variety of high speed, electrical rotating machinery. This new windage loss reduction technology will help these machines meet increasingly challenging efficiency and total system power loss targets. The new Xdot technology does not increase system weight, is expected to have a reasonable integration cost, and is applicable to both induction and permanent magnet machines, including secondary or auxiliary power units, as well as main propulsion engine driven starter/generators. It also offer synergistic benefits with regards to rotor cooling. The effort to achieving this end goal will also include the generation of a high quality database of experimental windage loss measurements that is not currently available in the open literature, as well as a new validated design tool/module to help future machinery designers evaluate windage losses in this class of machinery. The initial commercial application of the new windage loss reduction technology is expected to be a commercial direct-drive compressor currently under development by a large original equipment manufacturer. A range of other commercial applications, including other high speed compressors, and waste heat energy recovery turbine generators are also being considered. Opportunities to apply the technology to electrical starting and generating machinery of specific Air Force interest will also continue to be pursued.",

In parallel, models associated with the atomization and evaporation phenomenon will be assembled and evaluated for their ability to predict the measured behavior.  Where possible, these models will be improved so that they can better capture the effect of fuel type on the characteristics which are key to performance of spray based systems.  The assembled package of improved models will be standalone or integratable into CFD environments.

Importantly, this good performance is achieved at 70% less volume and 72% less weight than current Navy cooling coils, as well as at a lower cost. Given the good results to date, a Phase II effort is proposed to develop and manufacture prototype versions of the concept and test them at two scales over a range of design and operating conditions to prove the performance under simulated field conditions. In addition, analysis and test data will be used to demonstrate the scalability of the design.

In this project, Creare is developing a new approach for characterizing ear canal and pinna geometry for prescribing custom earplugs. Our completely digital approach provides accurate and repeatable anatomic measurement for improved earplug fit, while also reducing the logistics burden currently associated with physical silicone ear impressions. During Phase I, we demonstrated that our technique measures ear anatomy very accurately (mean error less than 0.1 mm). In addition, our non-invasive approach has high repeatability and eliminates the operator and procedure variability that is typical of physical impressions. During Phase II, we aim to develop methods for balancing trade-offs among earplug comfort, fit, and performance, based on an individual\u2019s anatomy and validated through human subject testing. Our digital technique also supports development of a database for managing, archiving, retrieving, and transmitting aural anatomy data; studying variations in anatomy across a population and the resulting impact on earplug design and effectiveness; and quantifying changes in aural anatomy that occur over time.",

Estimators based on conventional filtering technologies have now reached a certain level of sophistication, beyond which little additional performance improvements appear feasible. Phase I project developed a new approach for target state estimation which was shown to outperform existing algorithms. A realistic seeker model with non-Gaussian noise and a nonlinear dynamic model capable of reproducing a wide variety of ballistic missile motions observed in practice, were employed in the work. Feasibility of real-time operation of the target state estimation algorithm on a high-performance computing platform was then demonstrated. Phase II work will scale-up the target state estimator including all the model and algorithm refinements. A real-time hardware implementation suitable for assessment in hardware/software-in-the-loop simulation will be created. User interfaces will be provided to help tune the estimator to accommodate actual sensor noise characteristics. Under a subcontract with a major airframe integrator, the estimator performance will be evaluated in Monte Carlo simulations and hardware/software-in-the-loop simulations.

Ideally the camera would have a suitable means for blocking solar stray light and glints, and it would not have any moving parts.  The baseline camera must be versatile enough to transition to other satellites for a variety of purposes.  The following applications would be ideally suited for this type of camera system:  star tracker navigation, satellite near field monitoring for docking and refueling, space debris tracking, intelligence gathering.     The Spectral Imaging Laboratory proposes the development of a high definition artificial compound eye (ACE) derived from natural arthropod compound eyes.  Arthropod compound eyes can acquire wide angle images with zero distortion and an infinite depth of field (all objects are in focus at all ranges).  Video cameras with these characteristics would benefit by eliminating the need for gimbals and focus mechanisms, thereby reducing volume, mass, and potential failure points.     The high definition ACE relies on curved (3D) glass lens arrays.  The purpose of this project is to develop the ability to mold 3D glass lens arrays with sufficiently high surface quality to enable high resolution imaging.  BENEFIT:  This research will result in the ability to mold high quality 3D double sided lens arrays suitable for high resolution imaging.  This capability will enable the development of a distortion free, high definition panoramic camera that does not require focus adjustment.  The optics fabrication is based on a hot press molded, curved lens array technology that is ideally suited for low cost, high volume production.  The principal application is a new type of star tracker that can view to within 5 degrees of the sun.  Other commercial applications include robotic and autonomous wide area surveillance.  Robots will benefit from the wide field of view, infinite depth of field attribute by using it to navigate more reliably through rugged terrain.  The optics will enable real time navigation for autonomous flying robots that use the optical flow field to navigate.

        "abstract": "Sponsored by NAVAIR, Accudyne Systems completed a Phase 1 SBIR program, developing an equipment and process concept for cost-effective fabrication of composite rotary wing main rotor blade spars. The CH-53K spar was the study focus. The recommended work cell concept combines automated tape placement, woven fabric placement, and pick and place of 45\u00b0 parallelograms to layup plies, then debulk and place packs for two spars fabricated in tandem. All composite material placement, vacuum bag material application, pack-to-tool debulking, and spar revolution is automated. This Phase 2 program develops the stations on the work cell machinery encompassing the material lay-up portion of the proposed work cell, and then demonstrates them for inclusion in a follow-on full design. Special attention will be paid to placing at rates high enough to allow fabrication of 200 spars per year (4 per week). In Phase 2, Accudyne proposes to complete a Requirements Document to detail requirements learned from NAVAIR, Sikorsky, and Hexcel. Then, Accudyne proposes to develop equipment and the process to demonstrate: 1) unidirectional tape placement into plies and on-line debulking to packs, 2) woven fabric placement into plies and on-line debulking to packs 3) bias parallelogram cut, pick, and place and debulking, 4) cutting of unidirectional tape, woven fabric, and bias parallelograms, and 5) a technical trade study encompassing throughput, tolerances, debulking, quality control, machine maintenance, risks, and final implementation. A final report describing the process, equipment, and trade study will conclude Phase 2. The Phase 2-Option program enhances bias ply placement to considerably accelerate spar fabrication. The enhancement is a 3-axis CNC-controlled ultrasonic knife to complete articulate cuts in the bias parallelograms that comprise the bias plies. The noteworthy benefit is that net shape bias packs can be fabricated with the wide ply down with no further cutting. It is intended that the Phase 2-Option run in concert with Phase 2 for maximum synergy.",

        "abstract": "Advances in superconducting technology over the past few years have resulted in High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) systems onboard Navy ships. HTS based systems can lower costs dramatically by lowering system weight and power consumption. These HTS systems, however, require efficient, maintenance-free and cost-effective cooling. Depending on ship class and HTS systems, 40 cryocoolers may be necessary on a single ship, which can result in a significant cost impact and a maintenance liability. The current Gifford-McMahon commercial cryocooler delivers 200 W of heat lift at 50\u00baK; however, it uses about 7.5 kW and has a maintenance cycle of 10,000 hours. Infinia Corporation completed development of a Phase I practical design concept for a fully integrated, low cost, Free piston Stirling Cryocooler (FSC) system that provides in excess of 400 W useful cooling capacity at a cold end temperature of 50\u00baK, more than doubling the efficiency of current systems while consuming only 7 kW, and also providing a maintenance-free life of 100,000 hours.",

        "abstract": "Given the complexity of current military operations, a critical need exists for tools to objectively and reliably assess warfighter situation awareness (SA), particularly in the challenging environments of network centric warfare. The ability to validly quantify warfighter SA offers significant flexibility and diagnosticity to researchers and provides a means by which to evaluate the utility of system designs, training methods, support structures, and task environments to effectively support warfighter SA. Accordingly, our overall goal for this Army SBIR project is to design and develop our Metrics of Global Assessment and Situation Awareness (MEGA SA) system to enable researchers to objectively measure and analyze both individual and team SA in real-time across a variety of Army command and control (C2) system evaluations. Rather than rely on a single technique or metric, we adopt a multi-faceted approach to SA measurement to increase the sensitivity and diagnosticity of the overall assessment and create a more robust and flexible tool for research and field applications. The product of this Phase II research will be an easy-to-use menu-based tool for real-time SA analysis of individuals and teams, applicable to a broad range of military and non-military domains.",

        "abstract": "The objective of the proposed Phase-II research effort is to build and deliver a hyperspectral sensor to perform velocity, temperature, pressure, and H2O concentration measurements at the end of a detonation tube and the exhaust of a detonation-powered turbine at a rate of 50 kHz.  These measurements will help quantify the efficiencies of detonation-powered devices.  High-speed measurements of temperature, H2O mole fraction, pressure, and velocity will allow determination of the enthalpy and mass-flux in-and-out of the detonation-powered devices.  We have successfully demonstrated this approach during the Phase-I research effort.  In the phase II effort, one-piece, all-silica fiber-collimators suitable for measurements in the detonation environment along multiple lines-of-sight will also be designed, delivered, and demonstrated in a suitable test rig in consultation with AFRL scientists.  Despite using absorption spectroscopy for determining the temperature, pressure, and H2O concentration, the hyperspectral technology is fundamentally different from typical diode laser-based absorption sensors and has many advantages, specifically: monitoring many spectral features over a wide spectral range at very high speeds (~ 50 kHz) and thereby providing more accurate measurements of more parameters than a typical diode-laser strategy.  The proposed hyperspectral sensor system offers flexible coverage of such a broad spectral range that it is automatically suitable for virtually all applications within 5 psia to 1000 psia for a temperature range of 270K to 3000K.  BENEFIT:  Development of compact sensor systems for measuring temperature, pressure, and velocity at a rate of 50 kHz will enable engine manufacturers to investigate the performance of PDEs and detonation-powered devices and will also provide valuable high-bandwidth data to the numerical modeler.  This sensor system will also help studying the ignition and flame growth phenomena and monitor the combustion processes and relevant dynamic phenomena at realistic operating conditions for the first time.  This capability is particularly critical for the design and modeling of advanced, detonation-powered or ultra-compact, low-emission, gas turbine engines and for development of real-time combustion-control strategies.  This technology will yield significant payoffs in military and commercial aviation as well as land- and sea-based power generation, and has broad impacts for on-board sensing and control.  Other high-speed gasdynamic research as in shock tubes and explosion studies are poised to benefit as well.  Beyond gasdynamic measurements, the sensing approach has applicability in microscopy and in biological imaging.  For example, the hyperspectral sources developed in this effort could supplant swept-sources currently used for 4-D optical coherence tomography, offering new imaging capabilities such as greater ranging depth.  Also, with minor modifications, the sensor system might become important in pulsed magnetic fields research as well as homeland security applications such as imaging of hazardous gases.",

As a result of the incurred performance degradation, vehicle crews will often have to operate their vehicles without communications or with limited communications, which has a serious negative effect on net-centric operations which are pivotal for modern US and allied force C4ISR efforts. Ultimately, the performance degradation can result in decreased operational effectiveness and increased casualties. The objective of this effort is to develop Cognitive Solutions that addresses the performance degradation currently observed during simultaneous operation.",

        "abstract": "A new generation of bio-inspired adhesives is under development for controlling the face-seal leakage in respirator masks. While conventional pressure-sensitive adhesives rely on liquid-like fluidity under pressure to adapt to surface roughness, biological adhesion mechanisms employed by gecko, spider and insects rely upon the compliance of a fibrillar array to accommodate surface roughness for magnifying molecular-scale contacts. The fibrillar nature of biological adhesives distinguishes them from conventional pressure-sensitive adhesives in terms of adhesion to wet surfaces via capillary action, self-cleaning, stability under repeated use and in severe conditions, the ability to accommodate facial hair, dirt and skin irregularities, and removability. Bio-inspired adhesives, however, cannot match some key qualities of pressure-sensitive adhesives, including ductility and energy absorption capacity (reliability and immunity to excess size effect), density of the interface (sealing qualities), and accommodation of local (sub-micron-scale) roughness (adhesion capacity). Our approach makes complementary use of patterned bio-inspired adhesives and highly stable variations of pressure-sensitive adhesives to combine their corresponding advantages in a new generation of bio-inspired adhesives. The integrated theoretical/experimental work of Phase I project verified the balanced qualities and the commercial promise of the new bio-inspired adhesives. The proposed Phase II project will build upon the Phase I accomplishments towards full development and optimization of the new bio-inspired adhesives, their integration into the peripheral seal of full-facepiece respirator masks, thorough evaluation of the corresponding benefits to the face-seal leak resistance of respirators, and assessment of the commercial potential of the technology in application to respirator masks and also in other fields of application.",

        "abstract": "Appliqu\u00e9 coating, as paint replacement on aircraft surfaces, offers significant environmental benefits as well as performance and cost advantages. Pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are critical components of appliqu\u00e9 coatings; improvements in the thermal stability, chemical resistance and removability of PSAs are needed before appliqu\u00e9 films can realize their full potential as aircraft paint-replacement coatings. PSAs require a liquid-like flow under pressure to establish contact, and a high energy dissipation capacity for peel resistance. The need to balance these two features limits the thermal stability and chemical/weathering resistance of today\u2019s PSAs. We have employed nanostructuring and hybridization principles to overcome this obstacle. Nanostructured PSAs employ the tremendous specific surface area and the nano-scale spacing of nanomaterials to realize improvements in energy dissipation, cohesive qualities, thermal stability, barrier attributes and chemical/weathering resistance. Hybrid pressure sensitive adhesives make complementary use of different PSA constituents, which retain their distinct qualities within a stabilized hybrid system, to meet demanding performance requirements at competitive cost. The Phase I project developed a cost-competitive class of hybrid/nanostructured PSAs which are stable over a broad temperature range, provide high levels of chemical/weathering resistance, and exhibit desired removability after aging for use with appliqu\u00e9 coatings on exterior aircraft surfaces. The proposed Phase II (and Phase II Option) efforts will develop scaled-up processing and control capabilities for high-volume, low-cost production of hybrid/nanostructured PSAs, their transition to appliqu\u00e9 films, and thorough characterization of the end product for use on aircraft surfaces.",

Current methods (launching balloons with meteorological packages) cannot measure atmospheric conditions along actual projectile flight paths.

The LIDAR system developed by Michigan Aerospace Corporation employs a Direct Detection Doppler Wind Lidar (D3WL) and allows near real-time measurement of atmospheric parameters (wind, pressure, temperature) along the ballistic arc. These LIDAR systems operate in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum at 355nm for eye safety and minimal observability. Michigan Aerospace Corp. is uniquely positioned to develop the Concept Demonstrator LIDAR Artillery Meteorology System (LAMS) due to its extensive experience in the development and fielding of LIDAR and related systems for use in extreme environments (air, near-space, space, ground and marine). The technology developed at Michigan Aerospace Corporation offers significant advantages over the current state-of-the-art and is highly capable of meeting the requirements of the Marine Corps. The capability made possible through this instrument is applicable to areas such as atmospheric mitigation for snipers, long-range gunnery and precision landing zones for manned and unmanned aircraft.",

        "abstract": "MDA missile systems employ solid rocket motors and divert and attitude control systems (DACS) to propel and guide kinetic energy weapons.  These systems create hot, high pressure gases that impose high heat loads on surrounding metal structures and electronic controls.  Exist-ing designs use ablative insulators (e.g. EPDM) and monolithic ceramics (e.g. NZP) to limit the temperatures in surrounding components.  While these materials offer attractive low thermal dif-fusivities, they also exhibit poor high temperature strengths and toughness that have resulted in unanticipated failures during ground testing.  Clearly these insulators must be improved if MDA systems are to improve their reliability.  Several possibilities exist for improved high temperature structural insulators including ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) and high strength ceramic foams.  CMC solutions include various combinations of rayon-based carbon, Nicalon, and Nextel fibers with matrix materials that include CVI SiC, PIP SiC, and sol-gel oxides.  The CMCs can employ needled or conti-nuous fiber preforms.  High strength ceramic insulators include ceramic micro-balloons imbedded in a ceramic matrix.  In addition to improved materials it may be possible to modify existing designs to limit the operational stresses.  Design modifications may include layered materials tailored to the thermal environment, segmented insulators to limit thermal stresses, and the ex-ploitation of contact resistance and tortuous heat paths.   The Materials Research & Design (MR&D) Phase I design and analysis results indicated that a C/SiC composite that uses a low density SiC matrix can reduce the temperature at the pin-tle attachment from about 600\u00b0F to less than 300\u00b0F.  Based on this MR&D procured needled Lyocell performs that are presently being processed as low density C/SiC composites.  Addition-ally, MR&D supported Powdermet\u2019s Phase I SBIR program that examined several of their ce-ramic-based Synfoams as potential structural insulators.  MR&D\u2019s analysis of TDACS insulator made with Powdermet materials showed thermal performance that was nearly equivalent to NZP coupled with comfortably positive structural margins.  Based on these results, MR&D is propos-ing an integrated Phase II program that will continue the development of low density C/SiC and ceramic-based Synfoam insulators for TDACS components.  The Phase II program will be un-dertaken by a working group that includes MR&D, American Structural Needling (ASNC), All-comp, and Powdermet.  In the Phase II program, MR&D will perform the design and analysis tasks, coordinate the fabrication and characterization effort, down select the materials and de-signs, manage the program, and prepare the reports.  Allcomp, ASNC, and Powdermet will fa-bricate insulators that include needled C/SiC composites and ceramic-based foams.  Additionally the Phase II program will be closely coordinated with other TDACS material development pro-grams underway at Ultramet and Matech; and with complimentary material characterization ef-forts at Southern Research Institute.",

In this effort CFDRC will complete test and evaluation of a larger RAT coupled to a Honeywell COTS generator. This effort will culminate in the generation of at least 60 KW at 25,000 feet at the desired EA-18G flight speed of 220 kcas. All T&E will be completed prior to the conclusion of impending prime contractor (Raytheon, ITT/Boeing, Northrop Grumman, and BAE) Technology Maturation efforts. A comprehensive map (Mach number from .25 - .90 and 0-30,000 feet) of the ductwork/RAT/generator performance at all projected EA-18G NGJ flight conditions will be validated within the confines of a TRL 5-6 pod configuration. In order to assist the Navy in assuring NGJ pod power does not become a discriminator technology during the prototype pod flight demonstration efforts all of the technology developed here will be made accessible to each NGJ program competitor. CFDRC has negotiated an agreement with Honeywell that insures our final RAT based NGJ prime power generation unit will rapidly transition through flight certification efforts with no manufacturability and maintainability risk.",

        "abstract": "Robotic sample acquisition is essentially grasping.  Multi-finger robot sample grasping devices are controlled to securely pick up samples.  Equations have been developed to provide optimal grasps for perfectly modeled objects, but grasping unmodeled objects like a random sample on planetary surfaces is an open research problem. Approaches to grasping unmodeled objects use various sensors, such as cameras, distributed pressure sensors, and strain gages, to characterize the object and the quality of a grasp. That information is then used to initiate or improve the grasp. A major source of difficulty in robotic grasping, therefore, is the sensing of object parameters and grasp quality. Humans combine the high information content of vision, several types of haptic/tactile sensors in the fingers (300 sensors per square centimeter), and a sophisticated learning process to grasp unknown objects. In comparison, current robotic graspers rely on a much more limited set of sensors, particularly for measuring tactile properties. \n\nThis proposal focuses on an algorithm for improving grasp quality using several types of tactile information as well as the robotic grasper that can provide such information so that remote sample acquisition devices can perform as well as human sample gatherers",

        "abstract": "This proposal is in response to the US Air Force solicitation in regard to the development of compact, low weight magnetic refrigerators that can provide hundreds of watts of cooling with efficiency greater than 50%, and can operate at high temperatures. Development of such systems would allow for a more local, and more efficient, cooling process. This multi-phase research and development program proposes to construct a magnetic refrigerator prototype able to provide hundreds of watts of cooling power in the temperature range of 120 \u2013 180 oC. The technical tasks in Phase II include (1) Development and optimization of magnetocaloric materials with Curie points in the temperature range of 120 - 180 oC and magnetic entropy change larger than 3.5 J/kg\u2022K, preferably larger than 4 J/kg\u2022K; (2) Design of a Magnetic Refrigeration Demonstration Device (MRDD); (3) Construction of the MRDD; and (4) Testing of the MRDD and an optimized theoretical design of a high-temperature magnetic refrigerator prototype.   BENEFIT:  The primary initial market opportunity for these magnetocaloric refrigeration systems will be for aircraft and other military systems where localized cooling at high temperatures is required.  These would be aircraft and helicopters platforms, land based systems and possibly naval vessels, where access to cooling systems or cold heat sinks is not available.  The electric aircraft demands more local cooling of electrical and hybrid hydraulic-electric actuators. Magnetocaloric refrigeration can operate in any orientation and can provide cooling in locations where jet engine air cooling may not be available while showing very little heat signature. In addition, power systems and electronics systems could benefit from localized cooling provided by the magnetic refrigeration\u2019s system. Commercial applications of these systems would include down-hole oil well drilling and data logging equipment and instrumentation where temperatures are in excess of 100 oC; this is a result of the very deep reserves being pursued aggressively due to the elevated demand and high oil prices which will last for the foreseeable future.",

Building upon the alpha version of the software developed as a part of the Phase I SBIR, the proposed software will allow crewmembers and/or personnel watching video footage to periodically document salient crewmember behaviors which will then be used to identify behavioral patterns. When a behavioral pattern is identified and deemed important to investigate, users would be able to review all collected data. Furthermore, this software includes an integrated feedback module that offers automated reports based on identified behavioral patterns. Flight surgeons can create a knowledge base of feedback based on specific attributes or behavioral patterns, and the software will then generate automated feedback reports based upon identified attributes or behavioral patterns.

ZnS is frequently the material of choice for durable LWIR windows and domes, though it is weak and soft compared to its MWIR counterparts. Surmet\u2019s approach to improve the durability of ZnS is through the application of a durable bonded cladding. During the Phase I program, Surmet was able to successfully produce transparent (both in the LWIR and at 1.06\u00b5m) a-Si coatings up to ~ 150 microns thick.  However, coating deposition rates and optical quality of the resulting film were an issue.   This Phase II will demonstrate and develop protectively cladded ZnS domes with adequate transmission at 1.06 micron and in LWIR region, and improved resistance to impact/erosion/abrasion. Surmet will focus on refining the process for fabricating thick amorphous-Si as a durable cladding material. This will involve modifying our proprietary plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition (PA-CVD) coating process to deposit a-Si silicon at high coating rates, without  compromising integrity of the film. Films will be tested for adhesion, abrasion, and rain erosion properties.  At the conclusion of this program, Surmet will produce prototype ZnS dome with an outer protective a-Si cladding.",

        "abstract": "The Department of Defense (DOD) would benefit from a persistent mobile power generating capability to support global deployments, remote basing, and disaster relief. Eliminating the need for fuel transport over long distance, a towable floating wind turbine could provide a persistent power source. The most robust configuration for this concept is an unmoored free-floating design. Such a mobile free-floating wind turbine platform could represent a significant benefit to DOD operations, but also has associated technical challenges. The main challenges include platform stability, seakeeping, transport, convertibility, and dynamic positioning. Of these challenges, the most difficult is stationkeeping, as wind turbine power generation is necessarily accompanied by large aerodynamic drag. Use of standard propulsion to overcome this drag for stationkeeping can result in a net power loss under a range of conditions. To overcome this paradox we have designed a stationkeeping wind turbine platform concept which uses novel wave-driven passive propulsors. The Phase I effort evaluated and refined the propulsor design through simulation and analysis. Continuing effort in Phase II will experimentally test the passive propulsion stationkeeping, both on the component level and as an integrated wind turbine platform prototype.",

        "abstract": "Emerging new military high-performance aircraft and most current fighter aircraft generate community noise footprints that are in many cases 10 times or larger in size than current transport commercial aircraft. These higher levels lead to community annoyance, expensive and restrictive noise mitigation, and restriction of operations. Noise reduction technologies have been developed and employed on commercial aircraft engines giving significant reductions in community noise. However, few, if any, of these technologies have direct application to military high-performance jet engines. DoD is funding research to develop advanced modeling tools for community noise exposure and for noise reduction techniques. These tools are being developed to improve the military\u2019s capabilities to assess and to potentially reduce its operational noise. However, for these tools to achieve their full potential, a system needs to be developed to optimize operational flight procedures that reduce community noise exposure while minimizing nonstandard flight procedures. This optimization system will provide the most cost effective near-term solution for jet noise reduction for the military that can be applied to any military aircraft at any airfield for relatively small incremental costs. The initial localized noise reduction expected from operational modifications is expected to be approximately 3 to 6 dB DNL.",

        "abstract": "Better Information Assurance (IA) training methods can significantly improve the security of the DoD\u2019s network-centric environment. Existing IA training employs ineffective \u201ctell-and-test\u201d instructional methods, which do not adequately engage students and, more importantly, fail to address the evolving nature of new IA threats. To address the need for better and more adaptive training, we designed a framework\u2014under a Phase I effort\u2014for the development and deployment of Evolvable Microgames for Information Assurance Training (EMIAT). Based on our successful Phase I, we propose a full-scope development effort focused on four components. To ensure that learning objectives comprehensively address emerging IA threats, we will develop an ontology-based curriculum that supports evolvability (i.e., is user-extensible by USAF trainers and IA experts). This evolvable curriculum will be integrated with an intuitive framework for rapidly authoring new microgames. The framework will include graphical development tools for constructing microgame interfaces and logic and templates for rapidly building microgames to address emerging threats. We will iteratively employ this framework to construct and evaluate educational microgames, producing tools for improving IA training while enhancing the framework\u2019s viability. Finally, we will build a web-based distribution environment for deploying microgames and providing a motivating social community for microgame-based training.   BENEFIT:  The IA training microgames developed in this effort will provide an immediate and tangible benefit to warfighters throughout the DoD by educating them in the IA skills they need to \u201cfight through\u201d in a contested cyber environment, providing them with the means of defending themselves, and creating another layer of security beyond that currently provided by the AFNOC and sister organizations throughout the DoD. Additionally, the EMIAT framework will provide the tools needed to adapt IA training to emerging IA threats, thereby enhancing the capability to address these threats before they become significant security leaks. These benefits could be extended to a wide range of Government and commercial domains that rely on networked computing, including many daily business activities. This broader application of EMIAT is possible because the generic EMIAT framework provides intuitive tools for rapidly authoring and delivering engaging and educational evolvable microgames for corporate education, training, and proficiency maintenance.",

Therefore the driving force for damage accumulation can be correlated with functionals that depend on models based on small strain theory. The problem is to identify the functionals that reliably correlate predicted and observed damage accumulation events.

A promising approach to reduce the effects of these uncertainties and enhance threat object discrimination is the use of 3-D object imaging techniques using all of the features and signature data provided from the network of distributed sensors. An integrated robust fusion process can enhance discrimination by considering the \"cross correlations\" that exist between data from multiple, geographically diverse networked sensors.

The safe functioning of crew and instruments and survivability require effective radiation protection. There is also the desire to reduce the weight of parts in Space missions. In Phase I, Materials Modification Inc. developed a series of novel multifunctional composites using a proprietary high-hydrogen epoxy incorporating boron and carbon fiber layers with enhanced radiation shielding, structural, thermal and electrical properties compared with high density polyethylene (HDPE). Radiation shielding of B/C composites against high-energy neutrons were measured. The boron composites had approximately the same shielding effectiveness as HDPE and aluminum for the energetic neutrons. This is remarkable since the multifunctional properties of these hybrid boron/carbon fiber composites offer so much more than the overall properties of HDPE or Al, especially in the area of lightweight structural applications for aerospace. In Phase II, a series of composite laminates with a range of %B will be fabricated using unidirectional boron fiber and unidirectional carbon fiber in a non-autoclave process.  Mechanical properties of the most promising composite compositions, including lamina and laminate properties at cryo temperature, RT, and elevated temperature will be determined. Radiation shielding studies with energetic charged particles such as, protons, heavy ions, and neutrons that would simulate conditions encountered in space will be performed. By the end of the Phase II, we would have manufactured and tested several compositions that provide optimum radiation shielding. We plan to address specific NASA mission requirements with our partners Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin who have expressed great interest in the results of the Phase I effort.",

        "abstract": "A 24 month SBIR Phase II Project is proposed to develop weapons effects fast-running models (FRMs) for reinforced concrete walls and floor/ceiling slabs in hardened bunker-type structures.  The objective is to develop High-Fidelity Physics-Based (HFPB) fast-running models (FRMs) for simulating the effects of air-delivered weapons on heavily reinforced concrete walls and floor/ceiling slabs.  The hardened structure FRM will include walls and floor/ceiling slabs for bunkers constructed of normal to ultra high-strength concrete (UHSC), realistic bunker layouts, and current and future weapons ranging from the Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) to the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP).  FRMs are also required for predicting breach/spall and secondary debris-projection, i.e. debris throw.  The secondary debris models will be used to extend the load parameter spaces for non-charge room wall/slabs.  BENEFIT:  The ability to model high-strength concrete is important for new hardened structures that will use HSC to combat the effects of new \u201cbunker busting\u201d weapons.  The expansion of ARCWall to include weapons ranging up to the MOP, along with the incorporation of HSC in ARCWall will benefit the Air Force by enabling the assessment of damage to new bunker construction subjected to new weapons of the foreseeable future.  MOP-type weapons will likely affect more than just the charge room in a typical bunker.  The new version of ARCWall will model hallways and outer rooms of a typical bunker. The proposed innovation for modeling concrete damage will enable the direct modeling of holes in breached walls so that the venting of gasses from one room to another can be more accurately modeled.  Stochastic debris cloud models will allow the stochastic modeling of individual fragment clouds where the mass, and velocity components of the individual fragments are properly correlated, based on HFPB modeling.",

Lynntech proposes the development of a low-power, hand-held array-based sensor that incorporates structural nanofeatures and tailored surface chemistries, capable of responding to specific and complex VOC inputs and identifying VOC signatures. During the Phase I project, Lynntech developed and tested an array-based sensor and successfully detected targeted VOCs.

During Phase I of this DARPA DSO program, NanoSonic has modeled and synthetically engineered flexible, radioprotective garments using an elegant, layer-by-layer, design to yield Thoraeus-like filter architectures with well defined gradients of multiple high z elements.  The shape memory polymer (SMP) constituent within the textiles mitigates cracking to prevent harmful energy foraging apertures and exhibits durable radiation resistance upon reconfiguration; a property that few, if any, flexible materials exhibit.  Active breathability has also been demonstrated via introduction of tailored size nanopores within the thermoresponsive SMP.

Fully electronic concepts are proposed that operate without the need of batteries or external power sources by generating their required electrical energy. The proposed electronics circuitry and logics would then provide the desired S/A functionalities as well as certain other fuzing functionalities. The concepts are particularly safe since their electronics circuitry and logics have no available power prior to the weapon release. The project involves extensive dynamics and structural modeling and simulation and prototype development and testing to validate the developed models and determine the performance of each device.  The proposed concepts are particularly suitable for miniaturization and low-cost production since they can be manufactured using well established mass fabrication techniques and equipment.

The system will generate 10,000 spectra per second over the 7-14 &#61549;m spectral range at 8 cm-1 spectral resolution; the NESR is projected at 4\u00d710-9 W/(cm2\u2022ster\u2022cm-1) over a 100 &#61549;s integration time.  The key to the system is a resonant scanner driven by a high speed actuator such as a piezo-electric transducer.  The benefit of the resonant scanning is significantly reduced drive power requirements, since the actuator must only replace the losses due to damping within the system.  The second key aspect is a multi-pass, reciprocating interferometer configuration which greatly reduces the physical stroke length required for a given spectral resolution.  Our configuration results in two reflections off the reciprocating scanning mirror at a 45\u00b0 angle of incidence; the result is a 5.7\u00d7 reduction in the required stroke length relative to the standard Michelson interferometer configuration.  The overall solution will offer an unprecedented combination of high spectral acquisition rate and sensitivity, making it an ideal tool for the further development of thermal luminescent detection of chemical warfare agents and toxic industrial chemicals on surfaces.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this work is to provide guidance to explosive formulators and facilitate the development of improved penetrator explosives. Because of the complexity of these materials, it is difficult to relate parameters controllable during formulation to desirable properties in the final product. Formulation variations are limited to modifying the individual constituents in a formulation, their ratios, and the processing methods used, such as mixing and casting techniques. Most commonly, varying a single formulation parameter results in the variation of multiple mesoscale characteristics. It is well established that the mesoscale characteristics of energetic materials are responsible for energy localization and generating damage, \u201chot spots\u201d and/or bulk reaction. The major impediment to understanding the influence of formulation parameters on explosive sensitivity is that formulation parameters are rarely synonymous with mesoscale characteristics. This is an ideal scenario for contributions via numerical simulation, where the mesoscale characteristics can be individually varied. Isolating the effects of a mesoscale characteristic allows its individual effect on sensitivity to be determined, as well as its relative importance to other mesoscale characteristics, allowing the relevant, irrelevant, and competing consequences of a formulation modification to be identified and evaluated.  Similarly, the paramount considerations in developing a new formulation may be identified.  BENEFIT:  Various formulation variations and their mesoscale effects will be investigated and ranked in order of their importance in penetrator explosive sensitivity. The modeling of energetic constituents and their interactions will be improved and validated.  Numerical experiments will be designed to elucidate statistically significant mesoscale effects on bulk response, hot spot distributions, and sensitivity. A suite of experimental results will be generated to characterize bulk and mesoscale response of these materials and validate simulations. WMI will use a two-pronged approach to address the needs of customers who desire to utilize mesoscale simulations to guide the formulation of energetic materials. The first approach is to perform proprietary research and development services. Such R&D services are especially attractive to customers with no current in-house simulation capabilities, yet wishing to fully benefit from the utility and power of mesoscale modeling. The second approach is to release for sale parameterizations of the material and interfacial models developed. This effort targets customers with simulation experience and tools, but who are in need of more sophisticated modeling approaches.",

        "abstract": "Selection of appropriate hearing protection devices (HPDs), such as earplugs and earmuffs, is important in mitigating noise-induced hearing loss among military personnel. The standard method of measuring the noise attenuation performances of HPDs is based on a psychoacoustic method involving human subjects, which is time-consuming, costly and inherently variable. It also cannot be used to measure the performance of earplugs with special acoustic features such as non-linear venting and active noise reduction, which are increasingly relevant for military use. An alternative is a physical measurement using a test fixture which has the advantage of being repeatable and efficient. However, conventional test fixtures are designed for the evaluation of earmuff-type HPDs and can be inaccurate for earplug-type HPDs. ATI is developing an advanced hearing protection evaluation system (HPES) which can assess a wider range of HPDs including earplugs. HPES is essentially a simulated human head with sufficient acousto-mechanical emulations for accurate evaluation of a variety of HPDs. The fixture is designed with the capability to accurately measure earplug attenuations, large microphone dynamic range and ability to take into account the bone conduction effect. This Phase II SBIR research will further refine the Phase I HPES design and develop a pre-production prototype.",

        "abstract": "Decision support tools for target identification and alert generation depend upon the classification of static and moving objects. Existing methods for object classification rely primarily on static information available in single-frame images. The data from long-range video surveillance assets are usually not sufficient to distinguish the objects from one another, and even if high-resolution data were available, the visual features alone would not allow determination of the intent or purpose of the objects that are of high interest to military intelligence analysis. Persistent video surveillance is a source of motion and temporal activity data that promises to enable automated object intent classification. Aptima proposes to develop the VISION decision support system to automatically recognize the intents and functions of potentially interdependent static and moving objects. The data currently acquired by video exploitation technologies (object detection, tracking and motion analysis, for example) will be inputs to VISION. VISION technology will be based on high-performance, empirically validated probabilistic vision-based activity recognition and temporal-relational pattern matching algorithms developed by the Aptima team.",

In Phase I, we demonstrated the proof of this concept by developing core technologies that included i) Bernoulli variable based statistical target detection by jointly modeling spatio-temporal properties of scene background and sensor geometry, ii) deferred inference data association framework for interacting targets, iii) efficient algorithms for optimizing the data association problem, iv) modeling target interactions and grouping behavior for tracking, and v) a forensic video analysis tool for proof of concept. The Phase II effort will be focused towards refinement, advancement, and integration of these enabling technologies and will include development of new algorithms to handle the issues identified during Phase I, development of an integrated detection and tracking system, transitioning of technology and prototyping, and detailed quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the system and its components.",

Prototype performance as a direct-touch device was evaluated through formal testing on human subjects, while its efficacy as a vibro-tactile device was demonstrated qualitatively in the laboratory. The array is sufficiently thin for integration into clothing, the electronic hardware is small and battery-powered, and the system is of reasonable cost.

Fasteners are often conversion-coated, primed, and sealed with an electrically conductive hot melt material.

In order to reduce manufacturing costs, a new hot melt material is needed that is less expensive, has a shorter application process, and greater in service durability.  To address the need for an improved fastener fill material with the combination of excellent mechanical properties and conductivity, Luna Innovations is developing an electrically conductive hot melt adhesive by combining unique conductive fillers with novel hot melt adhesives.

The proposed system is particularly intended to reduce reliance on GPS updates for localization and navigation purposes by exploiting various underwater environment cues.

The envisioned application of the proposed system is in local navigation of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) that needs to stay underwater for long time periods. In such a scenario, a AUV not having the benefit of frequent GPS updates could nevertheless be required to station-hold within a pre-specified region or perform tasks requiring navigation within the region.

Structural integrity and high insulation behavior have been demonstrated when used in combination with a non-ablating, coated carbon/carbon or ceramic matrix composite outer shell. In Phase I, Ultramet demonstrated the initial feasibility of a foam-reinforced hybrid ablator/aerogel insulator thermal protection system (TPS) in which a portion of the thickness (front face) of a low thermal conductivity structural foam was infiltrated with an ablative material and the remainder of the thickness (back face) was filled with the high temperature aerogel insulator.

The three-dimensionally interconnected foam reinforcement is anticipated to provide increased char retention relative to alternative fiber and honeycomb reinforcements.

Once productized, the functional and operational goals for the sensor are to 1) Measure the surface temperature of the Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Thermal Barrier Coatings (YSZ TBC\u2019s) typically applied to turbine blades in the hot section of the gas turbine engines, 2) Measure temperature at specific locations on the surface of the combustor liner to determine both radial and circumferential temperature variations (pattern factor). Thin film passive wireless sensors will be arrayed in an annular ring around the combustor to determine pattern factor in an effort to sense the uniformity of combustion downstream from the fuel injectors, and 3) Measure heat flux across the section thickness of thermal barrier coatings by pairing the proposed wireless temperature sensor (for the surface temperature measurement of TBC\u2019s) with a similar wireless temperature sensor being developed under another program. The combination of that sensor and the sensor being developed under this SBIR program will allow the measurement of heat flux across the TBC and open the possibility of TBC health monitoring.",

The system combines ambient-stable, long-shelf-life affinity agent assays with a handheld microfluidic gel electrophoresis affinity assay quantification technology.  The system is easy to use, compatible with operation in microgravity, and designed to permit simultaneous quantification of 32 or more biomarkers from a single astronaut sample. \n\nPhase 1 of this project demonstrated that a thioaptamer assay used in the microfluidic instrument can quantify a specific biomarker in serum in the low nanomolar range. AM also successfully identified novel affinity agents to bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and demonstrated their use to detect BAP using the microfluidic instrument.  Phase 2 will expand the number of ambient stable affinity agents and demonstrate a TDS prototype to NASA.  AM anticipates that the TDS at the end of Phase 2 will be at TRL 4 to 5.

The proposed detection technology leverages changes in optical transmission through a surface due to molecular binding (e.g., antibody-antigen binding).  Antibodies specific to the white blood cell surface protein markers (antigens) are pre-coated on the sensor surface to recognize specific white blood cell types with inherently high specificity and sensitivity.  In Phase I we developed surface chemistry and demonstrated surface chemistry sensitivity and specificity for total white blood cells and two lymphocyte subtypes (B-cells, CD4+ T-cells).  During phase II we will develop a functional prototype of the OILWBCS-MEMS device to demonstrate that end-to-end operations from sample-in to signal-out produces clinically relevant results.

With this system a user will be able to plan an aircraft flight track and determine the probability of detection of the vehicle along that flight track. The program will take into consideration the terrain and 4D weather conditions, the source characteristics of the vehicle, and the ambient background noise levels. The sound propagation will be calculated with a user selectable algorithm. The interchangeable nature of the system design will allow for easy future upgrades.

        "abstract": "A probabilistic ATR framework is proposed to exploit coincident multi-aspect radar and EO video data for target detection, tracking, and classification/identification.  The mathematical framework is constituted by four principal components with a particular focus on exploitation of 3D information from radar scattering: 1) extraction of features indicative of shape and structure from radar waveforms, 2) tracking of targets from coincident EO and radar data to estimate target-sensor pose, 3) estimation of 3D target representations from radar data, and 4) development of pattern recognition algorithms to provide target classification and identification. This framework will exploit all sources of information in the EO/radar data.   The probabilistic framework supports rigorous characterization of the uncertainty associated with each component as well as propagation to subsequent dependent components.  This uncertainty is ultimately captured in the target classification and identification results.  The products from the proposed research offer the potential for significant further improvements in target ID performance for realistic operational environments.  SIG will collaborate with AFRL to identify the appropriate measured data sets to demonstrate and evaluate the framework.  Potential data sets include the AFRL Layered Sensing collect (Angel Fire EO with GOTCHA SAR) and/or Bluegrass data (Constant Hawk EO with JSTARS GMTI).

This project is innovative in combining semantic web technologies with automated assistive technologies to aid users in finding relationships among incidents. The semantic indexing provided by the use of incident reporting language permits more sophisticated search of archives.  During Phase I we defined a semantic language for incident reporting in XML and designed a technology approach for authoring and utilizing incident reports represented in this language.

This effort has the potential to have large impact, because software complexity remains the major impediment to more rapid transition of the numerous research results on WSNs to mainstream users.    In Phase I, we demonstrated the ability to port Version 3 of the MF to third party hardware and, in Phase II, we will port Version 4 to our own hardware.  Our experience has engendered confidence that the MF is at least as open, as powerful, and as portable, as Java or Dalvik, and that creating motes and mote-scale systems based on the MF has a potentially large market impact.

        "abstract": "This project addresses the need to develop a high power, continuous duty (or \u201ccontinuous wave\u201d, CW) underwater acoustic transducer. We believe that the Phase I program has established an important contribution to the heat analysis and evaluation of acoustic transducers. This aspect of transducer design has become more important with the advent of new continuous wave sonar systems and also with signal crystal transducers with their currently higher dissipation factors. We plan to not only extend the Phase I analytical model, but upgrade the FEA 2-D to a 3-D model and extend our modeling efforts to evaluate partial arrays or other transducers designs, including PZT and single crystal rings and Tonpilz transducers. The ProE FEA program model for thermal analysis will be extended to an ANSYS model allowing the electro mechanical model to be used directly as a thermal model without the need to rebuild the model. In addition to the analytical and FEA modeling as well as transducer evaluation of current models, new transducer designs with mitigated heat rise will be implemented.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this research effort is to develop a 3-D tomographic reconstruction strategy along with user-friendly software for providing spatially and temporally resolved temperature and H2O concentration data cubes in augmentor flow fields at rate of 50 kHz.  This strategy model will be validated in a laboratory turbulent flame and demonstrated in the augmentor test-rig at Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) using an existing 30-beam \u201cTime-Division Multiplexing (TDM)\u201d laser system.  High-speed, three dimensional data will be enabled by efficient use of hyperspectral radiation, and will capture the dominant spatial and temporal instability modes in the augmentor along with their interaction and spatio-temporal evolution.  The 3D tomographic model we are developing is very unique due to its ability to deal with large number of grid points or unknowns without a priori knowledge of the flow field.  A key attribute of the proposed solution is the use of advanced hyperspectral sources (rather than diode lasers) to monitor H2O absorption features.  Measurements in the laboratory flames will pave the way for designing the optimum beam configuration for the implementation of this 3D tomographic system in an augmentor test stand located at WPAFB.  BENEFIT:  Development of a 3D tomographic reconstruction model along with compact, hyperspectral imaging sensor system that provides high temporal and moderate spatial resolution will enable engine manufacturers to monitor the combustion processes and relevant dynamic phenomena at realistic operating conditions for the first time.  This capability is particularly critical for the design and modeling of advanced, ultra-compact, low-emission, gas turbine engines and for development of real-time combustion-control strategies. This technology will yield significant payoffs in military and commercial aviation as well as land- and sea-based power generation and propulsion.  The tomographic gas thermometry strategies developed are expected to find numerous applications in fundamental and applied fluid dunamics, heat transfer, and multiphase flow problems.  The hyperspectral source that will be used in this research effort will also have broad impacts in remote sensing, microscopy, biological imaging, and other applications that require high-speed such as pulsed magnetic fields research.  With minor modifications, the sensor system might become important for high-speed swept-source optical coherence tomography imaging, thus opening the door to new imaging capabilities.",

Under Phase II we will develop and demonstrate a beta tool, the ZP-150BTM, which will have features beyond those available on the alpha tool. Specifically, the ZP-150BTM will have: (1) exposure-dose monitoring and correction of exposure-dose errors; (2) enhanced throughput by virtue of multiple spatial-light modulators, variable spot size, and improved spatial-light modulation; (3) higher-speed computation via a graphics processing unit (GPU); and (4) revisions to support these added functionalities.

LumArray\u2019s maskless lithograpy systems are compatible with both mask making and direct writing on substrates.

        "abstract": "The monitoring of multiple UAV video sources is challenging, in part, due to the poor quality of the video received.  Significant video degrading is caused by clouds, haze, and dust in the atmosphere; jitter and blurring from the UAV platform motion; and low video resolution due to sensor characteristics and high altitude flying. Higher quality video would alleviate much of the challenge for the operator, increasing the likelihood that they will detect and identify targets and increase their confidence in the presence and type of targets.  Improving the quality of video would also increase the autonomous detection and tracking capabilities that support the operator\u2019s ability to interpret the images and make timely decisions. 21st Century Systems, Incorporated is excited to continue to apply our extensive video analytics expertise in developing Video20/20, an innovative real-time EO/IR video-enhancement toolset.   Video20/20 is a set of software tools that provide real-time quality video with higher resolution and contrast enhancement making it easier to detect and distinguish enemy activities in video collected from UAV platforms.  And, with an SBIR commercialization rating second-to-none, we are just the company to deliver this capability to the warfighter.     BENEFIT:  There is an immediate need for this video enhancement capability in all branches of the DoD. Unmanned Systems technology has been revolutionized during the current OIF and OEF conflicts, and we can expect to see even more of them in future conflicts. UAVs have performed thousands of ISR missions (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) in support of ongoing operations. They have greatly expanded the level of real-time intelligence available to the warfighter.  Despite the many recent advances in Unmanned Systems technology, there are many technical challenges yet to overcome. The limitation of the value of any ISR platform is the ability of a human operator to interpret actionable intelligence from the video stream. Soldiers, Airmen, and Image Analysts are currently hampered by video that is often low-quality and difficult to interpret. By developing a tool that can improve image quality, we can greatly improve the tactical value of every Micro and Small UAV in service.  Our system will enable a next-generation capability for UAV operation. It will allow an operator to interpret data from a single UAV much more easily, with less fatigue and eyestrain, and provide greater situational awareness than existing systems. It will also allow the same operator to more easily monitor multiple UAV video streams and be able to interpret and act on them with minimal effort. By cleaning up the imagery, the operator will be able to maintain a much greater understanding of the ground situation with less effort on their part. Video enhancement tools are a key piece to achieving object detection and tracking. For example, in Iraq, a national curfew is in place in the evening prohibiting civilians from being out. Many of the IED\u2019s are emplaced in the dark after the curfew. Having auto detection and tracking of humans would enable the warfighter to use multiple UAV\u2019s in patrolling an area and alert on any people that are detected after curfew. One operator could monitor multiple UAV video streams and be able to interpret and act on them with minimal effort. This would minimize the manpower requirements and maximize the detection of curfew violators enabling strict enforcement of the curfew and, as a result, saving lives.",

This high level of external compression will cause traditional hose systems to collapse and fail.  A solution is desired that can deliver the required flexibility and withstand the high levels of compression.

        "abstract": "An important consideration of long duration space flight operations is interpersonal dynamics that effect crew cohesion and performance. Flight surgeons have stated the need for unobtrusive monitoring to help detect if crews are having difficulties with coping with long duration spaceflight environments. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a set of applied technologies that can monitor crew health and cohesiveness in an unobtrusive manner and identify potential abnormalities for feedback to astronauts and flight surgeons for further investigation.\nThe new Constellation vehicles will have thousands of procedures represented in XML, which facilitates automatic translation. Our approach is to determine nominal performance metrics during training and then compare that against data acquired during actual missions. Deviations between the nominal and current performance can be flagged for additional attention. Since crew members can perform upwards of hundreds of procedures a week, there will be substantial data with which to assess crew behavior and performance. Social interactions are also a significant factor in team cohesion and performance and we plan to establish, and then compare against, social norms using Sociometric Badges and communications (spoken and text) analysis.\nDuring Phase I research, we determined those objectives measures that are acquirable in an unobtrusive manner directly and via tractable processing and have a high likelihood of providing flight surgeons with the information they can use to best assess crew cohesion, performance, and mental state. In Phase II, we will develop and then evolve a prototype ABCAT system by iterating through a cycle of gathering test data in experiments, evaluating its effectiveness with feedback from project personnel and NASA flight surgeons, and refining or redesigning aspects of the system to improve performance.",

The resulting power would enable the use of more electronic devices and/or reduce fuel consumption and its associated costs and logistical burdens. Large power plants frequently use bottoming cycles, but smaller generators rarely include them. The primary reason is that the bottoming systems would be relatively large and inefficient for the low heat source temperatures and low power capacities associated with mobile generators. Fundamental thermodynamic limits, scaling penalties, and manufacturing constraints are the greatest obstacles. To accommodate these limitations, Creare has focused intense effort on the development of miniature turbomachines, advanced heat exchangers, and small thermodynamic systems for nearly 30 years. For this project, we are developing a turbo-Rankine system that can be used as either a bottoming cycle or a standalone generator. The resulting system will have very high power density and efficiency.

We will develop nanowire GRIN coatings for IR optics and, in particular, germanium windows.

By applying nanowires in carefully tailored layers, we will not only form a graded index of refraction structure to reduce reflection  but also form a protective layer, but also.  Each successive layer of nanowires will be less dense than the previous layers, thus effectively decreasing the index of refraction with each layer, gradually reducing the index of refraction from that of the underlying substrate to that of air. We will explore novel methods for producing Si and Ge nanowire GRINs and will scale up the process. In addition multifunctional coatings will be demonstrated, such as a durable antireflective coating that also provides EMI shielding.

Development of a unique new layout and circuit design methodology for complete protections against both single and multiple single event errors with a minimal circuit and layout overhead. 2. Development, and integration with fundamental design flow technology (physical design and verification) of a new, breakthrough simulation and design automation tool-suite for support of radhard-by-design (RHBD). This tool-suite provides accurate information about cross-sections as a function of cell layout, circuit, and placement, for single- and multiple- node single-event upsets and transients. The software also provides support for total-dose, and prompt dose, analysis and hardening. The results in phase 1 of this project have been extraordinary; The performance and radiation hardness of the new layout methodology has been experimentally verified, with spectacular results. The radhard simulation and design automation tool-suite has been further developed and key concepts to strengthen the integration and application in physical design and verification have been developed. Furthermore, the simulation technology has, in numerous applications, proven very accurate and enormously useful.",

The objective of the Phase 2 project is the development of new physics and modeling capabilities within the Analyst/MICHELLE design system that enables virtual prototyping and optimization of microwave tube components involving high-brightness beams. The Phase 2 work will build upon prototype extensions to the secondary emission and impact ionization models developed during the successful Phase 1 project. The emission and ionization models in MICHELLE will be modified in the Phase 2 project based upon the Phase 1 studies.

        "abstract": "There is no Sense and Avoid (SAA) solution for small UAS such as Scan Eagle, Raven, or BATMAV, which represent by far the greatest number of UAS.  Equipping small UAS with SAA capability is problematic, mainly due to the very small size, weight and power (SWAP) resources available.  The SAA system must compete for critical SWAP resources with fuel and payload sensors.  Small, low-power EO and sensors do exist, but these typically have much lower resolution and sensitivity as well as analog-only video outputs, which seriously degrades their utility for intruder detection and processing.  Additionally, EO sensors have no capability at night, except against illuminated aircraft; this may be fine for civil airspace operation, but is problematic for Air Force SUAS which train and operate almost exclusively with covert aircraft.  Defense Engineering Corporation (DEC) has devised an innovative solution for this challenging problem based on state of the art sensor and algorithm technology.  The Defense Advance Research Agency (DARPA) is developing the Micro-Sensing for Imaging (MISI), a high-sensitivity, high-resolution, infrared imaging device weighing less than 20 grams.  The DEC team will embed intruder detection and avoidance algorithms directly into a sensor derived from MISI to create an effective SAA solution for small UAS.",

For the military, this problem is especially acute because the warfighters\u2019 duties include dangerous equipment and a need for 24-hour operational readiness.  The current navy submarine berth light is inadequate and often detrimental for circadian management.  Like many fixtures, the control is limited to \u2018dumb\u2019 on/off of the white light.  The white light does not accomplish the circadian resetting avoidance that amber light does, while darkness does not provide any illumination for near-sleep or relaxing activities in the berth.  The white light does not maximize circadian resetting upon waking as much of the energy is circadian spectrally ineffective and the brightness is often overwhelming, while darkness is obviously even less effective.  The full on or full off does not provide smooth transitions between states, and the lamp cannot turn itself on/off independently after being programmed to do so by the user.  The technical problem being addressed is how best to use a berth light to positively impact navy submariners\u2019 circadian cycles.",

        "abstract": "Trace detection usually requires a vapor concentrator that collects dilute analytes from a vapor sample and delivers them at a higher concentration to the detector.  Conventional vapor concentrators tend to use either cryogenics, where vapors are concentrated on a cooled surface and then desorbed via flash heating, or sorbent technology, such as zeolites, where vapors are absorbed before flash-heat desorption.  For humid vapor streams, cryogenic vapor concentrators can cause unacceptable condensation of water.  Many sorbent-based vapor concentrators have the disadvantage of long cycle times and sometimes require desorption temperatures high enough to fragment heat-sensitive compounds.  Triton Systems is developing a non-cryogenic, small-form-factor vapor concentrator that is able to selectively adsorb polar and non-polar analytes from a vapor sample.  Customization for selective concentration of more specific classes of analytes is also possible.  Fast desorption of the concentrated analyte is near instantaneous and the process is highly repeatable.  The method avoids lengthy diffusion, enabling short cycle times.  This Phase II program will culminate in a prototype tested with multiple CWA simulants and interferents.  Miniaturized designs will be made to ensure easy coupling of the unit to any benchtop trace detector, as well as integration with some handheld detectors.",

        "abstract": "In the tactical environment, e-mail, chat, and file transfer, along with other bandwidth-intensive applications, are critical for the completion of missions, intelligence gathering, and the safety of the warfighter. Data must often be rapidly downgraded between different levels of security, but the Cross Domain Solution (CDS) products needed to do so are too cumbersome for airborne use and require a human-in-the-loop. This results in heavy dependence on satellite communications (SATCOM), which quickly overwhelms available channels. A Space, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constrained and automated airborne CDS is needed to add this additional capacity. In Phase I, SOLUTE determined this solution could be built and proposed designs for a Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) based platform. In Phase II, SOLUTE has teamed with several industry leading companies to build a prototype system. The Team will define use cases, finalize the architecture, integrate and test the system, and demonstrate a prototype. SOLUTE will also define migration plans for future high assurance use. The Team will additionally perform a Certification and Accreditation (C&A) assessment and complete the documentation necessary to allow utilization of the prototype in future DoD exercises and trials.  BENEFIT:  The impact of this technology will be immediate once it is implemented, saving potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in DoD SATCOM spending by making greater use of existing airborne tactical communications assets. MILS is already in use throughout both DoD and commercial aviation as a widely accepted method for system consolidation of mission critical tasks.  There are several airborne networking initiatives underway throughout the DoD requiring a SWaP constrained CDS, including the Air Force Objective Gateway, Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), Navy Communications AirBorne Layer Expansion (CABLE), Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS), and the Tactical Mobile (TacMobile) communications program. Multi-level communications and downgrading is especially critical in Joint, Coalition, and even limited civilian applications in warfare, as well as Homeland Security and Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief. With a small enough footprint, this technology can also make a significant impact in information downgrading within the $6.8 billon DoD Software Defined Radio (SDR) market.  Additional opportunities exist within other Government and commercial SDR markets, as well as financial services, healthcare, utilities, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and data center business sectors where high uptime and separation of sensitive data is critical to business operations.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this Phase II will be a full scale demonstration of an acoustic metamaterial cloak on a UUV-like vehicle. The design will be based on the Cummer-Schurig cylindrical solution for a perfect 2-D cloak surrounding a rigid cylindrical object. The first effort will be a theoretical task in conjunction with KSU to evaluate important issues related to the abstract nature of the Cummer-Schurig solution, which calls for infinite mass density and stiffness boundary conditions and purely real dynamic quantities (i.e., no losses). The type of resonant dynamical element to be used in the design to create the anisotropic mass densities required will be selected. Two major candidates identified in Phase I are resonant masses requiring voids encapsulated by high rigidity structures (e.g. shells) and a system of shaped inclusions embedded directly in an elastomer matrix. Laboratory experiments guided by co-evolving analytical and numerical models will be performed to demonstrate the required dynamical behavior for each treatment layer, to be followed by fabrication and testing larger cloak layer samples to assure that properties are maintained with scale up. Finally, a full scale demonstration will be conducted with a suitable vehicle or stand-in structure.",

        "abstract": "High speed air breathing engines can deliver payloads with vehicles that are smaller and lighter than rocket powered vehicles.  Unfortunately, ignition and flame holding in scramjet engines has proven to be difficult, particularly with cold hardware and low-volatility fuels such as JP-7.  Although methods to improve ignition and flame holding have been evaluated, improvements are still needed.   A very effective way to improve scramjet performance would be to catalytically decompose nitrous oxide into a very hot, about 2500\u00b0F, mixture of oxygen and nitrogen which could be used either in a pilot ignition flame or in a barbotage fuel injector.  Unfortunately, traditional catalysts cannot withstand this temperature without losing their activity very rapidly.  However, Reaction Systems has developed thermally stable catalysts that have high initial activity and will remain active after exposure to these extreme temperatures.  In Phase I, we showed that our catalysts met the criteria for this application and we produced conceptual designs of an N2O storage and delivery system and a counter flow catalytic heat exchanger/reactor.  The overall objective of the Phase II project is to advance the technology to the point that we can demonstrate the effectiveness of N2O decomposition on a scramjet ground test engine.     BENEFIT:  The most immediate application of our catalyst technology would be to improve the performance of engines that power high speed, short flight duration vehicles.  An effective ignition or fuel atomization system would greatly improve ignition reliability, flame stability, and overall performance.   An effective N2O decomposition system could be used to provide breathing air for a variety of applications including firefighting and diving potentially reducing weight, providing increased maneuverability, and larger air inventories.  In addition thermally stable catalysts needed for this application could also find use in the power generation industry where a catalyst could reduce NOX emissions by permitting operation under very lean conditions which reduces combustion temperature.",

Each of the units proposed will be 8.5\u201d long and less than 4\u201d diameter. The heating system provides 300W of heat via 35\u00b0C water to the tube suit in 1.7\u00b0C ambient ocean water while consuming only 110W of electrical power. The cooling unit will provide 250W of cooling via 20\u00b0C water in 38\u00b0C ambient ocean water, consuming only 80W of electrical power.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II proposal is to prototype an innovative optically foveal vision system that can readily advance the existing military night vision goggles (NVG) to the next high performance level, enhancing the US military capabilities in the night and/or the low-light-level environments. With the foveal imaging technology, high resolution and wide field-of-view (FOV) is achieved simultaneously in both the objective and eyepiece assembles through the wavefront compensation by a passive spatial light modulator (SLM). Such performance represents ultimately 2X wider FOV (reaching >80o) and ~50% higher resolution (reaching ~1.72 cycles/mrad), in the center of view to match human eye resolution of 20/20 vision, as compared to the currently fielded PVS-14/15 NVGs having 40o FOV and average 1.15 (1.0~1.3) cycles/mrad resolution. Without the foveal technology, a NVG\u0081@is prohibited from obtaining both wide FOV and high resolution at the same time. The resulted foveated NVG (F-NVG) has wider detectable area and longer detectable distance, which enhances off-axis detectivity and adds peripheral vision, eliminates the aggressive head scanning and thus minimizes the possible disorientation, neck strain, and fatigue, which ensures the more success of the military operations. This novel F-NVG is a compact size, light weight, and low cost device.",

        "abstract": "This project will develop an automated handheld/portable optical measurement system for determining the opacity of nearby smoke plumes. It will provide a real time ascertainment of EPA clean air act requirements at DoD installations within the CONUS. It will be usable by minimally trained personnel and can be used from any angle except directly into the sun. Unlike traditional human observations, because it contains a self-contained eye safe laser source, the system can be used day or night and it can be automated. Today, significant funds are spent training human \"smoke observers\" to perform EPA Method 9 observations at DoD installations. This process is fraught with simple human error as well as psychological disincentives ranging from tedium to guilt from penalizing the contracting organization and potentially forcing an inconvenient shutdown of a base''s steam heating plant to non-compliance.  The system consists of a small eye safe lidar and digital camera, and a portable lidar and image processing computer. It is man-portable and can run from battery power. Measurements can either be made continuously, at specific times throughout a work day, or via a scanner at pre-determined geographical coordinates/angles providing observations of multiple nearby plumes.   BENEFIT:  Automated opacity systems will effectively take the human out of the loop, allowing personnel to be deployed in more value added tasks. Removal of subjectivity from the manual observations will eliminate personal bias. The devices will also enable the creation of a permanent digital record of an industrial site''s point source air pollution. Increasing the frequency of such environmental opacity measurements will go a long way to both reducing operational training cost for smoke observers, as well as improve the trust between EPA and every agency it is charged with regulating.",

Automatically detecting and classifying targets of interest meets the challenge of reduced manning and workloads required for passive anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and torpedo detection, classification and localization (TDCL). The signal processing technology is comprised of a system architecture and a suite of algorithms which have the potential to provide a robust, automatic detection, classification and localization system for torpedoes. The Phase II effort is focused on finalizing and prototyping the automated data exploitation architecture based on the design concepts developed in Phase I. Both the SQQ-89(V)15 Combat System and Torpedo Warning System (TWS) programs require TDCL capability to detect, classify, and localize threat torpedoes with sufficient range and accuracy to support effective countermeasure engagement. Both systems require high probability of target classification with very low false alert rate. Testing to date has indicated a specific need to reduce automated false alert rate while maintaining current probability of correct classification. The tasks included in this Phase II address the false alert rate issue in several areas: improved spectral classification, improved target state estimation to support spatial and kinematic classification, and improved multi-target tracking.",

One key hindrance to ensuring readiness is discrete part procurement.

Several suppliers do not provide bids because, it requires them to expend considerable time to develop 3D models from these drawings, and often that the drawings are un-readable.

        "abstract": "Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading source of morbidity in U.S. soldiers in Iraq.  Each year 1.5 million Americans sustain a TBI and there are 5.3 million people with a permanent TBI-related disability in the U.S.  Videogames have been shown to increase TBI patient cognitive ability, memory and recall.  The purpose of this proposal is to meld clinical strategies used in treating TBI patients with intrinsically motivating video games.  A computerized intervention that incorporates both state-of-the-art gaming technology and state-of-the-art cognitive and motor rehabilitation strategies has the potential to be efficacious, cost-effective, and highly-motivating for a generation of patients who are habitual users of computerized games as a source of entertainment.  The Phase I study developed a videogame that demonstrated the process of incorporating clinical and entertainment requirements into a videogame.  This Phase II study will validate videogame performance and effectiveness through clinical testing with TBI patients and continue the development of videogames for TBI treatment through intense iterative interaction between TBI treatment clinicians and professional game designers.  This collaboration utilizes the latest software development tools to define detail game design requirements and uses a storyboard process to generate game scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Reliable sample preparation from a variety of complex matrices remains one of the most challenging problems facing biological detection in the field. This is especially true for isolation of nucleic acids from an environmental or clinical sample. A clean nucleic acid sample, free from contaminating materials such as cell debris, dirt and inhibitory chemicals, is required to ensure the robust performance of any given molecular-based detection system.  There exists a technology gap for a simple, one-step sample preparation device that will result in a clean nucleic acid sample ready for further biological analysis. Luminex Corporation proposes to develop a completely automated nucleic acid sample preparation module that is rugged, rapid, and easy to use.  This device will accept a liquid or swab sample (clinical or environmental), process the sample, and result in an extracted purified nucleic acid sample ready for further analysis.

        "abstract": "Certain lanthanide halides have significantly higher light output than NaI:Tl, the comparison standard for scintillators, plus other important properties, including fast decay times and excellent proportionality. Unfortunately, lanthanide halides grown by traditional melt processes have high production costs and limited availability. Crystals are usually limited to about 5 cm x 5 cm, right cylinder, and current growth techniques produce non-uniform dopant distributions (causing light output variation within the crystal, degrading energy resolution) and tend to produce asymmetric crystal structures (which tend to induce cracking). Even if these problems could be overcome for current fabrication methods, resulting material costs would be extraordinarily high. We therefore propose a rapid, alternate method to fabricate very thick, large area lanthanide halide slabs, in volume, at an order of magnitude reduced cost. This technique also allows formation of unconventional compositions that may further enhance scintillation properties\u2014impossible using existing technologies. The Phase I research successfully demonstrated the feasibility of our novel growth technique, and our results exceeded expectations in many respects. The goal of Phase II is to extend the Phase I research to produce the large volume material, while achieving bright emission and excellent energy resolution, and commence efforts necessary for technology commercialization.",

        "abstract": "Numerous gases may be ionized and accelerated in Hall Effect Thrusters.  Among all the candidates, condensable bismuth has significant advantages including easy storability, higher thrust to power and higher efficiency.  However, bismuth accumulation could adversely impact solar arrays, sensors, and other devices.  This problem appears solvable by proper shielding, but that needs to be demonstrated.  Therefore, Busek proposes to characterize in detail both the near and far field plumes produced by our existing experimental bismuth Hall thrusters and also characterize bismuth-surface interactions by measuring sticking and accommodation coefficients and deposition rates for numerous spacecraft materials.  The goal is to use this dataset to construct and validate a bismuth plume-spacecraft interaction model.  Busek will use a variety of instruments.  Our subcontractor, PlasmaSolutions, will deliver an improved version of its Phase I overhang probe, as well as a compact optical interferometer, and will assist Busek in characterizing the plume, including determining the ratio of molecular to atomic bismuth.  Additionally, an ExB probe and an ElectroStatic Analyzer will be purchased from Plasma Controls.  The data obtained will quantify the problem and also enable accurate numerical plume/spacecraft interaction models, leading to a possible near-term flight demonstration.  BENEFIT:  The data that result from the Phase I and II efforts will allow condensable propellant thruster to be integrated with critical DoD spacecraft, enhancing spacecraft mobility.   Bismuth thrusters represent a major advance because the peak T/P may be much higher than possible with xenon propellant.  Today, typical high performance xenon HET\u2019s generate 50 to 75 mN/kW of input power at an Isp between 1,000 and 3,000 sec, providing better thrust/power performance than any other electric propulsion system.  A 10-kW class Bismuth thruster could have 1.3 to 1.5X better thrust/power and also higher efficiency than available from existing xenon HET\u2019s.   The proposed Phase II program will measure the plumes produced by laboratory model thrusters, and much of the data generated will feed back into the designs. More importantly, the data collected in the Phase II program will enable accurate numerical plume/spacecraft interaction models, leading to the potential use of a bismuth thruster on a near-term, high power, orbit raising mission such as DARPA\u2019s Fast Access Spacecraft Testbed (FAST).  Commercial applications include orbit maintenance and orbit raising of ComSats and other satellites.  The high available thrust/power would significantly decrease the lag time between launch and operational status.  High power bismuth thrusters could also be used for interplanetary missions. Bismuth also makes sense from an environmental standpoint; like xenon, bismuth is non-toxic, but bismuth is abundant while xenon, which has many terrestrial applications, is scarce.",

CRG has determined that using stimuli that are unique to an ejection will be more reliable and faster than using acceleration. Optimum environmental stimuli were determined in Phase I that when used in combination are unique only to an ejection, and are an ideal way to differentiate an ejection from ACM. This system, in line with a lightweight microactuator release, will provide a reliable, compact solution. CRG\u2019s smart system will be self-contained, requiring no aircraft modification and operating from its own long-life battery. It uses a combination of stimuli and ejection event features to minimize false positive releases.

CRG\u2019s system will also be designed for compatibility with the range of relevant fielded helmets and night vision goggles (NVG), such as the HGU-55/P and MACH, used with NVG by ITT Night Vision.

        "abstract": "Miniaturization of propulsion systems for nanosats presents unique challenges which, to date, have rendered such small spacecraft unable to have significant orbit change/control and attitude control capabilities. Under a Phase II SBIR, Flight Work Inc. conducted the preliminary design of a pump-fed micropropulsion system and demonstrated the potential of the technology by developing and characterizing a low cost micro-pump for HAN-based propellants (TRL of 4). The system has a dry mass less than 1 kg (for 4 kg of propellant), uses less than 25 W of power, and generates more than 3.4 N of thrust at a predicted ISP greater than 240 s. The introduction of the pump in the system allows eliminating relatively heavy valves, regulators and lines while using plastic tanks for propellant storage. Under the Phase II effort, Flight Works proposes to refine the propulsion system design and develop a prototype of the system. Also included in the work plan is the development of a pump for hydrazine monopropellant, a pump which will then be integrated into a complete micropropulsion system and static fire tested in a vacuum chamber. This demonstration will pave the way towards an in-flight application of the technology onboard nanosats and microsats.  BENEFIT:  Whether used with hydrazine, HAN-based propellants or in bipropellant mode (MMH/NTO), the technology is particularly relevant for nanosat and microsat missions requiring high propellant mass fractions. It can also be an enabler of future missions where it might be more cost effective to send a fleet of nanosats rather than a single, larger, highly reliable \u2013and expensive\u2013 spacecraft. In all these applications, eliminating several hard-to-miniaturize components (such as high pressure valves, tanks and regulators) reduces system cost and mass, while also allowing for more compact and lighter propellant tanks. As such, the technology is not only applicable to all DoD very small spacecraft programs with significant mission &#8710;V, but it also enables the more demanding ones of these missions as long as the thrust requirements can be matched with the power available on the spacecraft. In summary, applications include all small spacecraft and small landers (where the pump provides a simple throttling mechanism). The technology could also be applied to large spacecraft attitude control systems by reducing storage tank and feed-line mass.",

The design problem confronted was the need to store either the ROSAM gun system or LRAD nonlethal defense system in the smallest possible out of the way location, then automatically deploy the system in as short a time as possible with a mount design that allows the defense systems to operate at desired performance levels. Due to differences among the mooring station layouts, unique deployment mechanisms were required for each location. Proposed Phase II work would continue the gun mount design maturation based on current DDG 1000 mooring station floor plans. The Navy will be asked to down-select the design scenario it prefers at each station so KaZaK can perform a detailed broad-based design program that defines specific mount characteristics, materials of construction and performance estimates for prototype manufacture. A representative prototype will be built and included in a Navy live fire test that will collect performance data for creating mature designs for ship deployment in Phase III.",

        "abstract": "Approximately 6.5 million Americans and 30% of returning veterans live with traumatic brain injury (TBI) associated disabilities. The cost of caring for and rehabilitating these wounded veterans has been estimated at $35 billion. Additionally, neuroscientists and rehabilitation experts suggest that recovery from brain injury involves a highly intense practice schedule, that is often more costly than one can afford. Thus scientists and entrepreneurs are compelled to find lower cost interventions that can adjunct rehabilitation efforts, thereby increasing practice time. A staggering, yet important statistic indicates that 65% of all households play computer/video games, indicating a high level of enjoyment. Perhaps these tools can be used to harness the motivation needed to compel users with TBI to perform many hours of tedious training; ultimately leading to increased life satisfaction and return to work/duty. In this application, we will describe the initial playable prototype of a low cost video game, built using Unity Game Engine.

        "abstract": "Laser eye protection is important due to the availability of laser sources (continuous and pulsed) over a broad range of wavelengths. The military uses many laser systems (e.g., training devices, range finders, target designators, communications devices) that emit potentially eye damaging radiation.  Because personnel risk exposure to these devices, a growing need exists for eye protection at a variety of wavelengths for both CW and pulsed sources.  The objective of this proposal is to develop laser eye protection coatings using transparent metallo-dielectric multilayer stacks.  These stacks provide a high transparency window in the visible spectrum but block both UV and IR light.  The coatings have sufficient optical density to protect the eye from damage by IR laser radiation threats.  In the Phase I effort we built and tested stacks on both rigid and flexible substrates to provide LEP technology for a wide variety of applications.  The Phase II work will integrate these materials into polycarbonate visors.  Test samples will undergo extensive optical and physical testing by Revision Eyewear to demonstrate that these visors meet the ballistic, optical and quality standards required by the military.  We will deliver test visors incorporating the proposed technology with supporting performance data to the customer.     BENEFIT:  This LEP technology solution will create a passive barrier that protects against both continuous wave (CW) and pulsed laser emissions, will be compatible with incorporation into a polycarbonate visor during molding, and not be angularly dependent.  Because of dramatically increased use of military laser systems The U.S. Air Force, Army, and Navy all have requirements for increased requirements for LEP for personnel.

The SIGINT payload will support a rich set of mission plans, allowing the operator to specify bands of interest, revisit rates, signals of interest, and signals not of interest.  The demonstrations will test the ability of the payload to detect, characterize, and associate signal intercepts as well as geolocate emitters.  Demonstrations will be staged, beginning with a laboratory demo, advancing to a ground-based demo, then an airborne demo in a large aircraft, and finally a demonstration with one or more simultaneous SUAVs.  A map-based display will be used to show the true emitter positions, estimated positions, and confidence ellipses.

        "abstract": "The advancement of aeropropulsion technologies has placed increasing demand on the structural and thermal capabilities of high speed aeroengines. One solution to absorbing the high heat loads generated during chemical reactions is to use endothermic fuels in the cooling loops of these engines. At the temperatures and pressures likely to be encountered in the thermal management system of high speed aeroengines, the cooling medium will become supercritical in addition to undergoing thermal cracking and pyrolysis reaction. Advanced computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models coupled with fuel degradation chemistry are required to simulate the impact of fuel degradation in high speed aircraft cooling systems. This proposal involves the development a design tool for predicting the thermal stability of hydrocarbon fuels used in the cooling loops of high speed aircrafts, rockets and SCRAMJETs.  In Phase I of this effort Combustion Science & Engineering (CSE) successfully demonstrated a reduced kinetic modeling strategy for jet fuels to predict the formation of gas, liquid and solid phase products as well as endothermic heat capacity at supercritical conditions.  In Phase II CSE will further improve upon the models already developed and incorporate these in commercial CFD codes.   BENEFIT:  The product developed in this work will be a useful tool for supersonic and hypersonic vehicle design applications for the US Air Force.  Furthermore, an important product from this project will be the development of a robust tool to be used in optimizing the design of thermal management for military and commercial flight vehicles.  This product will give the design engineer much more freedom to test new designs operating with different fuels at wider range of operating temperatures and pressures.  Discussions with engine design teams indicate that the capabilities of this project will greatly enhance current design tools in use by equipment manufacturers.  Also the market for this product will include aircraft designers and manufacturers for both military and civilian aircraft.  The use of this tool will significantly reduce development costs by eliminating some design iterations and hardware testing, which is quite expensive and time-consuming.  This tool will be applicable to any system in an aircraft engine that utilizes fuel for thermal management of the aircraft.  However, the capability to model chemistry-dependent processes, which is the focus of this work, is important to a variety of devices.  This capability is potentially useful to other combustion systems, such as used in boilers or furnaces.  These systems have traditionally been operated in a diffusion flame mode, but as the emission regulations have tightened, these systems are changing to more advanced combustion systems.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this proposal is to develop inspection techniques that standardize both the inspection process and any defect data captured as part of the inspection.  The Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC) current processes are manual, paper based solutions that vary greatly based on the background and expertise of the person performing the inspection.  Developing a reliable, repeatable inspection process both reduces the inspection time (flow days) and improves the quality of the final product.  Unlike many other depot processes, inspections require that the personnel be well versed in all areas of the system.  This represents a huge training challenge that will also be addressed as part of the research.  To address the unique needs of the MRO environment, we propose to develop an inspection management system that can be quickly and easily customized to handle the many different inspection types.  It will simplify the current inspections and serve as a knowledge management aid to reduce training.  The standardized data collection techniques will enable detailed root cause and trend analysis as well as correlation analysis to forecast issues before they become critical and impact the system.  BENEFIT:  By standardizing the inspection processes and defect data captured, our tools will minimize inspection time while improving the overall quality of the product.  Our tools will also reduce training time and provide the inspector all necessary technical material at the point of inspection.  The standardized defect data will eliminate the extensive data mining currently required, and enable detailed root cause and trend analysis.  This will allow issues to be identified early in the cycle and minimize the impact on the overall system.  This toolset has wide appeal and can be used throughout the DoD and private sector.",

Registration is based upon Mutual Information, a more efficient and robust technique than traditional feature-based methods. Reference imagery and live imagery are utilized as needed to refine the estimate of the sensor position and attitude in the geo-registration solution. The algorithm automatically and adaptively performs the required computations to maintain the desired level of accuracy. Moving ground targets are automatically detected using an algorithm based on Optical Flow; it is ideally suited to separate object motion from perspective-generated scene motion, greatly reducing false alarms. Tracks are formed in geo-registered coordinates using an Associative Tracker, enabling tracking of irregularly moving or intermittently visible targets and fusion of target information from multiple sources.  A process manager schedules images for processing based on the ancillary information taken along with the imagery and the processing resources available - thus, effective performance of the software is maintained even when processing power is reduced.  The efficiency, flexibility, and adaptability of our processing stream lends well to implementation in a variety of computing environments.

A successful Phase II FOLD-UAS demonstration provides a significant risk reduction of the airborne ISR & T portion of the PUMA program. It also positions the PUMA program to demonstrate a UAS-based system as soon as the airborne laser designator is available. Major areas where risk is reduced by the FOLD-UAS Phase II program includes the following: \u2022 Demonstration of the ability to locate ground-based laser designator \u2022 Demonstration of the ability to search for target and lock on target \u2022 Demonstration of the line-of-sight stability while locked and in \u201cDesignator Mode\u201d \u2022 Validation of the Size, weight and power required for the FOLD-UAS system Aret\u00e9 Associates\u2019 approach to the challenging CONOPS of the FOLD-UAS/PUMA system is to leverage Aret\u00e9\u2019s Mini-Scan Mirror (MSM) Technology. The MSM is a fast scanning mirror technology that replaces the large, heavy, power hungry, and costly gimbals. By manipulating a low mass mirror as opposed to the entire sensor and designator system, a higher imaging performance, more reliable, lighter, smaller, and cost effective solution can be developed. There are other added benefits to this approach which include the ability to rapidly reposition the fast scan mirror to any position within the field-of-regard (FOR) between image frames at a rate exceeding 30Hz. This allows the system to simultaneously image different locations within the FOR as well as provide a unique solution to the challenges of acquiring the spot being designated by the ground forces. With the MSM, the entire FOR can be searched far more quickly than by a traditional gimbal (> 10x). Additionally when the system is operated in ISR mode the operator can trade frame rate for search area. Given a typical camera system operating at 30Hz, the operator could be presented with the following options: \u2022 A single 30Hz video stream. \u2022 Multiple video streams at a reduced frame rate (frame rate = 30Hz/number of vide streams). This is truly unique feature that can allow the operator to track multiple targets simultaneously anywhere in the FOR. \u2022 Generation of a mosaic image stream that is updated at a nominal 1 Hz that represents 30 different looks stitched together",

Despite the enhanced wavelength coverage, the GaSb/InAs type-II Strained Layer Superlattice (SLS) detector still exhibits relatively high surface leakage current and its associated noises. With an industrially proven nano-material, we propose the nano-passivation of GaSb/InAs SLS and photodetector. The proposed solid-state nano-passivation technology is completely compatible with array integration. The resulting focal plane array (FPA) will have 15 micron or smaller pixel pitch, targeted 99.9% operable pixels, and 90% fill factor for greater than 50% external quantum efficiency. With minimized surface dark current, the SLS noise mechanisms will no longer be dominated by surface dark current at 77K. The nano-passivation layer will also have high device lifetime. Based on the proven feasibility of nano-passivation to minimize pixel dark current during Phase I, in Phase II we will design, fabricate and demonstrate a prototype large format reduced pixel pitch SLS FPA imager, which will be delivered to DoD Labs for evaluation and demonstration. During Phase III, we will manufacture and market the proposed camera to defense contractors for incorporation into military systems and for our own infrared spectroscopy products.",

        "abstract": "From the perspective of performance, reliability, and cost, the most practical photodetector available today with single photon sensitivity between 1.0 and 1.6 \u00ecm is the InGaAs/InP single photon avalanche diode (SPAD).  However, even the best InP-based SPADs generally have photon counting rates limited to less than 10 MHz.  For applications ranging from quantum information science to covert short-wave infrared imaging, single photon detectors with much faster counting rates in the range of 100 MHz \u2013 1 GHz will be essential.  A primary shortcoming of conventional SPADs is the positive feedback inherent in their avalanche dynamics and performance degradation associated with it.  We propose to radically improve upon these structures by monolithically integrating negative feedback elements to create negative feedback avalanche diodes (NFADs) with self-limiting avalanches exhibiting highly deterministic gain values.  Self-limited avalanches will greatly reduce latency problems caused by afterpulsing, offering the potential for repetition rates exceeding 100 MHz, and highly deterministic gains will provide much lower excess noise.  NFAD device operation will also be greatly simplified relative to SPADs since NFADs can be operated with just a simple dc bias.  Based on work done in Phase I, we have defined two design concepts for incorporating negative feedback using InP-based active elements, and in Phase II we will monolithically integrated these elements with our existing state-of-the-art SPAD structures.   The multiplexing of multiple active NFADs into matrix formats will allow us to increase of photon counting rates beyond 1 GHz and to achieve photon number resolution.",

However, the limited shelf-life of bottled bleach (3-6 months) and the hazardous nature of concentrated hypochlorite solutions place significant logistical burdens on military operations in terms of its transportation and storage. Functioning as a direct replacement for bottled bleach, we proposed in Phase I the development of a batch electro-chlorination system that produces a mixed oxidant bleach replacement (i.e. a 5.0 wt% sodium hypochlorite solution). Our electrolysis approach is highly advantageous since high purity table salt, water and electricity are the only consumables. The breadboard devices developed in Phase I were designed primarily to show the technical feasibility of our electrolysis process, and only limited emphasis was placed on addressing the actual usability of the envisaged electro-chlorinator. Consequently, Phase II will be predominately targeted towards the overall design of the on-site electro-chlorinator from a functionality and usability perspective.

        "abstract": "JRM Technologies proposes to develop a high-performance physics-based algorithm for prediction of urban scene EO/NIR light levels, as seen from arbitrary vantage points. The algorithms will start with the complicated geometry of buildings, roads, etc., to perform a Monte-Carlo radiance calculation for the scene, yielding a global solution which can subsequently be sampled from arbitrary viewpoints with very little additional computation. These calculated scene radiances will then provide the basis for predicting target contrast signatures and expected systems performance. Atmospheric parameters will be extracted (automatically) from MODTRAN\u00c2\u00ae calculations. The surface albedo model for scene elements will allow user selection from the JRM library of surface materials. We will develop a module to develop detection statistics based on multiple LOS calculations of target contrast signatures. These statistics will be based on a user-requested ensemble of sensor-target viewing geometries. Scene elements and our parameterization trade-offs for them will be evaluated using the MCScene Monte Carlo model. In addition we will obtain scene data from a DARPA program (or elsewhere) for a realistic validation case. Thus, the delivered model will be operational for the urban environment, have interfaces for TAWS, and be validated against realistic field data.",

        "abstract": "Current methods of growing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) of specific chirality yield mixtures of single-walled CNTs (SWNTs) with different structures and electronic properties, and methods to separate nanotubes by their electronic properties remain expensive and small-scale. Accordingly, synthesis today entails high capital and operating costs. A process is proposed that sidesteps the most difficult problems in SWNT nucleation thermodynamics, by performing re-growth from cloned mono-chiral SWNT hosts, vertically embedded in Master Templates. The objective of the Phase II SBIR effort is to demonstrate reproducible fabrication of SWNT Master Templates, to demonstrate accelerated growth of seeded SWNTs on the reusable template, and to demonstrate methods for harvesting SWNTs from the template, preserving it for reuse. This opens the possibility to establish amplified SWNT growth chemistries, and provides the opportunity to repeatedly grow nanotubes with only the desired chiral conformation, in principle to unlimited lengths. The CAPTOR process provides the degree of process flexibility necessary to scale the reaction to high-volume, low-cost production using standard chemical industry capital equipment, such as fluidic reactor beds.",

        "abstract": "With an aging aircraft fleet and an ongoing period of combat, the USAF must look more to ground based simulation to supplement flight training. Objective measures are needed, however, to insure that a training environment with limitations in force cueing adequately transfers back to flight. Systems Technology, Inc. proposes to leverage the significant past research with a flight-centered approach to produce effective qualitative and quantitative measures of simulator force cueing fidelity as it relates to tactical aircraft flight training that will be incorporated into the Real-Flight software toolbox. To validate the proposed approach, a prototype version of the software will be created and assessed via flight test and piloted simulation evaluations. Real-Flight will feature a complete set of task performance, pilot-vehicle system, psychophysiological, and qualitative (i.e., pilot ratings and comments) metrics. Flight test evaluations will be conducted using the Calspan Learjet In-Flight Simulator to provide a direct measure of how well various simulator force cueing components aid in replicating tactical aircraft training scenarios. A minimum of three simulator configurations will be used: fixed-base; limited motion-base to approximate a dynamic seat; and full motion-base. The same set of test pilot participants will support both the flight and simulator activities.   BENEFIT:  This proposed program will lead to a Real-Flight software tool box that will provide a means to assess simulator force cueing fidelity as it relates to tactical flight training. STI expects that Real-Flight and related derivatives will find application throughout the DoD as a means to assess the effectiveness of dynamic flight simulation and force cueing in fixed-wing, rotorcraft, and ground vehicle training simulators. The assessment methods and metrics may also be used in the training simulator procurement process to ensure maximum return on investment in terms of training effectiveness versus procurement cost. A tool such as Real-Flight would also be a useful assessment tool for the FAA, the airlines, and the commercial training simulator manufacturers. For the manufacturers, the assessment metrics and methodologies underlying Real-Flight will be useful as design guidelines.",

Due to the improved uniformity of the fiber coating, the interphase thickness can be reduced, increasing the flexibility of the fabric and ease of handling. In Phase II, we will fabricate a CMC plate from coated fabric and measure the composite strength to verify toughening. We will optimize the deposition processes and will perform more extensive materials testing. We will formulate a computational model of our reactor and provide a conceptual design for a commercial-scale system to coat full bolts of fabric.

One of the major limiting factors in micro gyros\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 performance is due to the electronic noise; micro gyros are typically a few millimeters in size, and the signals produced require significant amplification. ISC proposes development of the Frequency Modulate Micro Gyro (FM Gyro).

A micro gyro element that generates FM signals would provide a new way to combat the electronic noise issue. In the Phase I, a baseline FM Gyro design has been developed.

        "abstract": "Decentralization and heterogeneity have dominated the development and deployment of space assets and accompanying command and control (C2) infrastructures.  As a consequence, information requirements for robust Space Situational Awareness (SSA) are highly distributed. The mission threads common for SSA are complex and often require expert insight from several agencies, sophisticated systems and tools under multiple commands, and the most current data that may be held by intelligence agencies, public research interests, and commercial owner/operators. Thus, it can often be difficult to have the right data at the right time for the right operator.  These challenges provide Aptima, with the support of Omitron, the opportunity to demonstrate an innovative, agent-based approach to enhance the collaboration among the various agency producers and consumers of space information.  Our proposed approach, titled Space Collaboration via an Agent Network (SCAN), enables proxy agents to represent each of the stakeholder agencies for space.  The agent-based approach is uniquely capable of addressing the collaboration challenges from both the technical and organizational perspectives. The SCAN agent network will facilitate collaboration by identifying opportunities to collaborate, as well as optimizing the processes given the mission context.    BENEFIT:  The SCAN project presents a pro-active agent-based approach to collaboration that results in the optimization of organizational interactions for Space Situational Awareness.  The SCAN proxy agents will represent each potential collaborator continuously to all, for persistent and enduring collaboration. By configuring and constraining agent actions, users will be provided with an automatic system to track, ensure privacy, and maintain security during collaboration. The addition of computational experiments using the SCAN agent based system will allow for the identification of bottlenecks, constraints, effects of current organizational constraints and estimation of the quantifiable benefits to the SCAN approach.  For example, one could test the effects of new collaboration policies or pose threat events and see the instant lockdown of collaboration. The SCAN approach will result in better collaboration for SSA because it will leverage Aptima\u2019s background Team Science and Collaboration Technology.  Aptima is a leader in developing and improving Sociotechnical Systems.  The SCAN approach is focused on identifying collaboration barriers in the space community and addressing them by building on existing agent systems and human-agent collaboration expertise. Aptima\u2019s focus on transition to and constant engagement with the operational users will result in immediate applicability of SCAN to address current and near-term Space Domain Challenges, such as the FLTCs and Space Tasking Order.  Our project partner, Omitron,  provides extensive experience in analysis and operational approaches to Space Situational Awareness, Space Surveillance and Space Control, and modeling and simulation of the Space Surveillance Network.  Aptima, with the support of Omitron, will develop targeted Use Cases that identify the users that can benefit the most from SCAN. In addition, the Aptima team will meet and collaborate with these users to maintain the feasibility and usefulness of SCAN in order ensure its operational transition.

Once a mission thread or business process is created by a human or by the ABMA, it can be transmitted to the agents to configure an arbitrary system on the fly. As each step of the process is completed the next agent in sequence will be activated by agent peer to peer communications. FNEPs can be formed manually or under the auspices of an ABMA.

Capacitors that provide efficient filtering at high frequencies (up to 100 kHz) with reduced size and increased temperature tolerance are considered essential to advancing hybrid electric technology for the Army. In response to this need, TPL has developed a novel capacitor film technology that meets the need for DC filter capacitors with reduced size and improved operational capability.

The improvement over the state of the art in reliability (in particular SEU tolerance) and power efficiency derive from the use of a novel asynchronous technology. The devices will be able to operate over a wide range of power supply voltage, including deep subthreshold voltage, providing at least an order of magnitude reduction in power consumption. The devices will also be entirely robust to transient errors---soft errors caused by radiation or internal noise. They will also be tolerant to the severe timing variations caused by TID, subthreshold operation, and parameter variations in advanced CMOS technology. The products will be targeted in priority for embedded systems markets where the requirement of low power and robustness and reliability are essential. The first markets will be space and automotive electronics. The systems designed will be compared against conventional clocked versions of the same or equivalent sytems to fully quantify the advantages of the proposed approach. The two main components of the products envisioned will be memory and processor combined in a microcontroller unit (MCU). The choice of the processor architecture (essentially its instruction set) will be an important part of the Phase II project.    BENEFIT:  The rapidly increasing use of computer systems in embedded systems and in different forms of hostile environments has created a demand for rugged, noise-tolerant systems that are also energy efficient and high-performance. It is expected that the rad-hard ultra-low-power designs produced under this project (microcontrollers and memory) will find applications in numerous systems, both Government and commercial.

        "abstract": "Despite excellent recent progress in path planning, current state-of-the-art planners are still incapable of operating robustly in environments that are both cluttered and highly dynamic. The challenge is two-fold. First, predicting the trajectories of dynamic obstacles (i.e., cars, humans, aircraft) is very noisy. As a result, to achieve robust execution, perception modules need to provide a richer representation of predictions while planning modules need to account for the uncertainty in the predictions. Second, planning with dynamic obstacles is computationally complex because it requires adding time as an additional dimension while paths in dynamic environments need to be constantly re-computed. In Phase I, we have developed a novel path planner that addresses these challenges. It includes a novel representation of dynamic obstacles that can be used to generate safe paths efficiently and is general enough for use with different sensor suites. The planner also uses a novel data structure - time-bounded lattice. The lattice can be used efficiently with our previously developed re-planning algorithms suitable for constant re-planning. In Phase II, we propose to extend the planner to support planning for UAVs, transition it into the DPI real-time control software and demonstrate its performance on real test flights of DPI helicopters.",

        "abstract": "Impact Technologies, in collaboration with our engine OEM partners, is proposing to develop, test, and validate a very high frequency vibration-based engine accessory health management system that is capable of predicting current and future health while deployed on embedded hardware. Phase I achievements included the successful development and validation of various novel joint time frequency analysis (JTFA) techniques on multiple engine datasets, identification of appropriate prognostic approaches, and deployment on prototype hardware. When applied to VHF vibration data, the novel JTFA approaches were shown to provide better detection horizons and false alarm rates than conventional approaches during both steady state and transient operation. Phase II activities will focus on the optimum design and development of the analysis modules into a fully tested and mature embeddable software suite that can be transitioned to embedded hardware or licensed as standalone software. An actual prototype system will be fielded at our collaborators test facilities to test the software in real time on actual engine accessory data. Our product vision targets both smart accessories capable of autonomous self health assessment as well as a more traditional centralized PHM approach.   BENEFIT:  The successful design, development and prototyping of the proposed VAHMP software will benefit the military and commercial market by providing critical PHM coverage on crucial and often over looked engine accessories. These innovations can be used in combination or independently to fulfill current gaps in engine accessory diagnostic technology. For example, the integrated package can be used to provide a comprehensive PHM system coverage to an entire aircraft. Or, individual accessory specific modules can be embedded into the accessory in a distributed smart accessory-type product. This system can be packaged for test cell, pass off, or on-board implementation (as computational technology continues to improve). In addition, the proposed embedded system can be sold as a standalone industrial monitor, because of the widespread use of pumps, motors, and generators in almost every industry. Furthermore, the portions of the proposed approach can be implemented in legacy systems to provide improved detection and fault isolation capability. Ultimately, this program will close the gap between gas turbine engine PHM and accessory PHM technologies. Development and implementation of a comprehensive VAHMP approach will provide many benefits, including: correlation of very high frequency vibration events to failures, reduced maintenance and repair costs, and increased reliability of the monitored asset. Furthermore, the work will contain generic elements that can be transitioned to a broad range of other applications without additional sensors. The VAHMP could also be implemented in a wide range of civilian/commercial applications. These include commercial aircraft, power plants (in particular wind turbines), utilities, transportation, and petrochemical industries where reliability is essential to sustain production and repair times and periods need to be minimized.",

        "abstract": "The DoD spends over $1 Billion annually on disability payments attributed to hearing loss, yet this can be prevented. Research shows that with proper hearing protection a 19% reduction in hearing loss cases can be expected. Custom ear plugs force the user to wear the devices correctly and to retain hearing protection during activity, thus eliminating improper seating issues as the primary cause of DoD hearing loss cases. Realization of custom ear plugs within the DoD has been slow because current manual/physical ear impression technology is difficult to implement on a large scale therefore a new means of acquiring ear impressions is required. A non-contact digital ear imaging/fabrication device is proposed here which would reduce DoD disability payments by a projected $190 Million per year.",

One of the most promising application areas of MIMO radar is to develop MIMO radar based smart electronic bumpers to overcome rotorcraft brownout challenges that can cause major landing mishaps. MIMO radar based electronic bumpers offer the advantages of enhanced resolution and sensitivity, lightweight, compact, and low cost RF sensing, which is urgently needed for the detection and tracking of obstacles and hazards during rotorcraft brownout approaching and landing. The main concentration of our proposed research is on the development of MIMO radar based smart electronic bumpers. Our goal is to provide \u201csee-through\u201d MIMO radar based sensing systems that are capable of down-looking three-dimensional (3-D) imaging for obstacle (e.g., wire, pole, building) detection, forward-, backward-, and side-looking hazard (e.g., pole) detections, drift detection and velocity estimation, and altitude and ground slope determination.

Features extracted from this analysis are classified by Ensembles of Decision Trees, which provide robust identification as well as known/unknown detection. Feature vectors of unknown emitters are added to the library and additional examples of known emitters are added to supplement the higher-order statistics of those clusters in feature space. Phase II will focus on extending these capabilities and implementing the PerSEIve platform for adaptive signal processing, envisioned as an enabling framework for development, comparison and combination of algorithms to achieve high accuracy and allow for rapid processing of huge amounts of data for validation.

        "abstract": "Standard filament light bulbs are being replaced by light emitting diode (LED) technology at a rapid pace in areas as diverse as automotive and commercial / residential lighting.  LED\u2019s provide relatively high efficiency in a compact device but the major selling point is the extended life span, reducing and often eliminating the need to replace burned out light bulbs. Standard filament bulbs used in aviation are often short-lived, due to vibration and temperature extremes. Frequent replacement is required, and the fixtures are often difficult to access, increasing the effective cost of the replacement far beyond the cost of the bulb alone. An LED replacement for the bulb used in the Air Force wing tip navigation and position light assembly would provide vastly superior vibration resistance and long life.  To this end, Nanohmics has developed a drop-in LED replacement for the M6363/3-2 reflector SC bayonet mount bulb used in these wingtip lighting assemblies. The Nanohmics LED replacement has the same physical dimensions as well as comparable light output and angular intensity while using less electrical power.  The bulb works from the electrical power specifications already present in the targeted aircraft and in the same bright/dim modes that current incandescent does.    BENEFIT:  The replacement of the incandescent bulbs, which are used for many aircraft applications, with LEDs promises to yield a large cost savings through decreased maintenance and parts costs.  The use of innovative thermal management strategies which eliminate the need to replace the existing fixture will also translate into a cost savings and remove a major barrier to implementation.  Since many of these bulbs are employed in signaling and safety applications, the implantation of a longer lived bulb will also increase the safety factor of the application.  These benefits extend beyond the military and into commercial as well as civil aviation applications.",

        "abstract": "Course of action (COA) analysis, especially adversary reaction prediction, that occurs during the Joint Operation Planning Process/Joint Air Estimate Process (JOPP/JAEP) has benefited by applying advanced computing algorithms. Typically though, algorithms have been narrowly applied to solve niche issues within broader JOPP/JAEP tasks. The concept of hybrid architectures seeks to provide a more holistic approach. With hybrid architectures, tasks are decomposed into subtasks that are assigned an algorithm suitable to performing that subtask. Hybrid architectures may be constructed from a variety of algorithms, and typically multiple algorithms can be applied to a general classification of problem. However, although the classification may be similar, the problem constraints imposed by the current situation in which decisions must be made vary greatly. To address these challenges, Securboration is teaming with artificial intelligence expert Dr. Eugene Santos from Dartmouth College to develop the Virtual Hybrid Architecture Computing System or VHACS. In Phase I of this effort, the Securboration Team will develop the VHACS prototype that determines appropriate algorithms to satisfy given subtasks within the current operational environment and then composes them into a specification that it invokes for a distributed execution. VHACS combines the benefits of traditional hybrid architectures with the reach, flexibility, and reusability of netcentric concepts.  BENEFIT:  VHACS presents a series of interesting initial commercialization opportunities that will be explored, and subsequently refined, over the course of this research. The approaches taken in VHACS to automate hybrid execution through distributed discovery and composition and applying the results to solve complex problems have utility to a variety of commercial applications. The four most prominent include: 1) Logistics \u2013 algorithms that focus on optimization can be combined with other algorithms to understand the propagating cascading effects that logistics contributes to, 2) Gaming \u2013 algorithms and techniques developed for VHACS can be embedded into gaming engines (including military) to incorporate a more dynamic/realistic behavior based on \u2018composite\u2019 algorithms. Especially with distributed gaming approaches, VHACS can dynamically alter the algorithms that comprise the executable hybrid architecture package to modify the behavior of virtual entities etc., 3) World Banking \u2013 VHACS can invoke hybrid algorithms to understand how regional behaviors rapidly change based on perceptions of U.S. actions taken, VHACS could be used to understand regional stability issues that are of great concern to the world banking community, 4) Strategic Business Analysis \u2013there is a very close analogy between understanding an enemy, his likely courses of action and developing a plan to defeat him to that of understanding a business competitor, his likely aggressive business actions and developing a strategic business plan to dominate in a discrete business domain. It is clear that this research could significantly improve, or perhaps even supplant, current business analysis and planning techniques such as SWOT analysis.",

Experiments conducted so far did not produce the needed three dimensional profiles to model phenomena such as turbulence anisotropy and inhomogeneity, variations of inner-scale and outer-scale of turbulence, and strong departures from Gaussian statistics.   During the first phase of this SBIR project, Optical Physics Company (OPC) demonstrated the feasibility of its approach for 3D turbulence measurement through analysis, simulation and laboratory demonstration.  A laboratory experiment optically scaled to match a 28 km range from airplane to ground was assembled.  Ability to obtain high resolution turbulence profiles in three dimensions in air-to-ground and air-to-air scenarios has been verified. The overall maturity of the technology now stands at TRL 4.    During Phase II a complete 3D turbulence profiling system will be demonstrated outdoors across a 100-500 m horizontal path using an eye-safe 1.55 micron laser.  The demonstration conditions shall be scaled to match an airborne turbulence profiling system scenario in order to predict the performance of a flight system with high fidelity and tested over a broad range of imaging conditions day and night.   BENEFIT:  The 3D Turbulence Sensor has been developed to provide a major leap in our understanding of turbulence phenomena and how to model them analytically.  The system is critically important to the success of current and future lasercom and tactical HEL systems by enabling them to predict and optimize performance to a much higher accuracy.  In Phase III, a flight ready transmitter and sensor can be assembled to verify correct operation in an inexpensive flight test.  The transmitter module would be mounted on a modified jet aircraft, which would fly and illuminate a ground-based receiver.  Not only would end-to-end operation be verified, but 3D turbulence data for 10 km of atmosphere would be available for the first time.",

Even though the sensing elements are distributed throughout the turbine engine, the electronic interfaces and the related software are located at the FADEC which increases its computational load. To offload and distribute the signal conditioning, diagnostics, prognostics, and health management functions included in the FADEC, smart high temperature electronics are required that are capable of withstanding the harsh environments at the remote sensor locations.  To accomplish this goal, Orbital Research proposes to augment its existing high temperature electronic circuits to include Fault Tolerance, Built-In-Testing, and efficient protocol and prognostic capabilities.  These proposed high temperature smart sensor nodes will consist of the following:  One or more ASIC chips and high temperature capacitors, resistors and pcb substrates.  The Phase I effort identified design changes to its high temperature electronic circuits and showed feasibility of producing a standardized smart interface for a distributed control architecture capable of  communicating to the propulsion system controller.  In Phase II, Orbital will design, fabricate and perform qualification testing of the smart sensor nodes on engine test stands for a distributed control architecture.  BENEFIT:  Orbital Research\u2019s role in commercialization will be the identification, design, and development of the enabling high temperature processor and packaging.  Orbital will continue to develop and revise the technology for upgrades as demanded for alternative military and civilian applications.  Applications include advanced engine and flight controls, unmanned aerial vehicles, and directed energy systems, military control units, actuators, and more-electric systems.  Projected civilian applications for the developed control technology include commercial aircraft, ground-based power generation, oil industry, and harsh industrial processing applications.

Recordings in military operational environments are subject to numerous types of noise and artifact that contaminate the signal of interest. These artifacts can be attributed to external interfering sources, cross-contaminating physiologic signals, or be the consequence of significant subject motion. The intensity of this interference can overwhelm standard recording and noise and artifact reduction techniques, compromising the quality of data. In this SBIR research project, Quantum Applied Science & Research, (QUASAR), Inc. aims to build upon its Phase I work to develop an intelligent Sensor Artifact and Noise Reduction Algorithms (SANoRA) system. This system will consists of advanced multimodal biosensors integrated with computational algorithms for noise and artifact reduction. SANoRA incorporates prior knowledge of artifacts with auxiliary sensor information and physiological data, to (a) automatically detect the presence of artifacts, (b) classify these using a taxonomy of known types, and (c) apply appropriate reduction algorithms. The benefits of SANoRA include improvement in the accuracy of cognitive and physiological status monitoring under mobile conditions, through real time mitigation of a wide spectrum of interference present in operational military environments",

Higher temperature rocket motor case resins have been identified as a technology that is capable of delivering the improved performance that next generation boosters demand.  Optimizing the thermal performance of the case using resins with higher temperature capability than epoxy materials affords the designer the ability to reduce the external and internal insulation mass and volume.  The mass saved by the higher operating temperature case will provide increased propellant mass fraction.  Additionally, replacing the inert volume with propellant will achieve even higher performance.  The objectives of this Phase II SBIR include demonstrating the mass fraction improvement of the rocket motor subsystem using advanced materials, including domestic graphite fibers, higher temperature resins and innovative internal insulation.  Performance will be measured with subscale rocket motor case testing through live firings.

        "abstract": "The objective of the proposed effort is to demonstrate the feasibility of the scalable 3D display technology by Zebra Imaging to produce realistic auto-viewable 3D images for Air Force mission applications related to air, space and cyberspace. A display producing such holographic images provides intuitive visualization of three-dimensional (3D) data and scene information from a wide range of data sources. Zebra\u2019s technology provides rapid, interactive viewing of all types of 3D data, converting 3D scene data into a spatial image that occupies a 3D image volume, much like the holographic images produced by traditional hardcopy optical holograms. Animations and interactive content are displayed as bright true-3D images, viewed automatically, with no special viewing apparatus or glasses, with full parallax for proper 3D perspective from every viewer position. The core technology combines custom (and off-the-shelf) components to control the amount and direction of emitted light-field. As will be shown in the Phase 1 effort, it provides accurate, unencumbered, scalable and updatable presentation of critical data for multiple users. It will provide the scalable, auto-viewable display to depict multi sensor and other information and associated data, allowing real-time multi-user interactivity.   BENEFIT:  By producing spatial images with holographic realism, Zebra 3D displays are a valuable visualization tool. The display can be integrated with existing applications to facilitate communication of intelligence for team-based training, battle space management, mission planning and rehearsal, and interpretation of real-time data. This technology is suitable for a wide spectrum of Department of Defense (DoD) applications, ideally those that include graphically-intense applications. The 3D display will accurately and intuitively present complex real-world data to facilitate rapid discernment and clear communication of intelligence to support planning, decision making and mission execution. It will satisfy an immediate and growing need in a broad swath of sectors in the military, for operation mission planning and reconnaissance. As the number and sophistication level of sensors in the military theater increase, potentially critical data can lose utility without a means for rapid discernment and contextualization. Most of this data is co-located, visual, and occupies a three-dimensional volume in the modern battlespace.  Current display technologies that claim to provide \u201c3D images\u201d fall short when visualizing this kind of data: they lack depth cues and therefore accuracy; many are not practical for multiple users; most are not scalable.",

Reynolds number effects, which are relatively limited for thin airfoil fighter configurations, are much more pronounced for the thick airfoil transport configurations, and complicate the utilization of static and dynamic data in this region. With little or no validation data for these aircraft, application of the wind tunnel test data is historically problematic. This effort will establish a process for collecting and integrating wind tunnel data for use in a high fidelity flight models capable of providing representative flight behavior through stall and beyond for transport configurations. This effort will require the development of testing hardware and methods as well as Re correction methods to enable the direct integration of the collected data.

To maintain our military dominance, the US Air Force is pursuing Space Situation Awareness (SSA) and Defensive Counterspace (DCS) techniques that identify and characterize space-infrastructure attacks and the associated estimation and prediction of adversary intent and capabilities. For example, AFRL\u2019s Space Vehicles Directorate is applying data fusion theory to automated threat detection and characterization in the SAFIRE program. As part of this team, Charles River Analytics is developing a situation assessment data fusion component that identifies relationships and situation state across space abnormality event tracks. However, SAFIRE currently cannot infer the intent behind identified anomalies. We propose to extend SAFIRE\u2019s fusion engine with a Multi-Int System for Space Situation Awareness (MInt4SSA) that can infer intent through additional types of intelligence information. MInt4SSA demonstrates methods to extract relevant information from new intelligence data sources and to extend our existing Level 2 fusion components to use this information to improve SSA. For Phase II, we propose to develop additional components to include reasoning capabilities and a standalone capability to provide a context-handling service to other fusion processes.   BENEFIT:  We see direct application of the proposed effort to the development of decision aiding systems to enhance SSA and support counterspace operations.

A major upgrade involves the extension of scalar fluctuation models calibrated for fuel/air mixing to treat transpiration and thus predict near-wall variations of Prandtl and Schmidt numbers for varied injected species. New high speed transpiration data sets to support validation have been obtained and will be incorporated into an automated validation tool and analyzed. This data encompasses both fundamental cases (flat plate environment/no combustion) as well as more complex cases with shock/BL interactions and combustion of injected H2. Impact of transpiration on realistic scramjet flows will be assessed using available data sets for full-scale rectangular and inward-turning scramjet propulsive flowpaths, tested at hypersonic flight conditions without transpiration. New data sets for these propulsive flowpaths with transpiration will be obtained during the course of this program (in an independent effort) and they will be analyzed with the upgraded turbulence models. In addition, thermal balance modeling will be addressed and available models that can readily be integrated with the CFD codes and transpiration models utilized will be evaluated.",

        "abstract": "3D human behavior and shape analysis from monocular video imagery is an enabling technology for recognizing abnormal behavior and threat monitoring in military and law enforcement applications. The problem is challenging owing to (i) complexity of surveillance environment, (ii) high dimensionality of human pose space; (ii) lack of depth information; and (iii) large variability in human body shape, clothing and imaging conditions. We propose a robust framework that combines discriminative and generative approaches for inferring 3D pose and anthropometric characteristics of a person. In order to deal with loss of depth information and resolve ambiguities, we use a combination of techniques based on learned dynamical priors, biomechanical characterization of human pose and multi-hypothesis tracking. Each of the techniques aims to constrain the pose search to find the most optimal pose and shape that best describes the person in the image. The system is fully automatic and has modular architecture to support extensibility and facilitate transition to operational deployment. Preliminary results in Phase I validate the feasibility of this approach. Phase II work will involve an effort to refine and optimize the framework to achieve near real-time processing and to enhance the system robustness to support complex poses and varied environments.  BENEFIT:  The proposed work addresses the technical challenges of human pose and shape estimation in video imagery. It will enable us to detect human activities and to identify suspicious and hostile human behaviors for military and law enforcement applications. The technology has wide ranging applications beyond intelligent surveillance system, including:  a) Improved human computer interaction \u2013 The framework will facilitate development of more accurate vision-based systems to recognize different gestures and motion in 3D.

        "abstract": "Single objective optimization in physical layer design (maximizing rate or maximizing reliability) can potentially reduce overall network throughput. The major challenge here is to find a way to achieve a stable and reliable link without sacrificing the available channel capacity.   Superposition coding with two rates allows the transmitter to superimpose a high rate and a low rate massages with different protection criteria against channel error. This naturally allows the physical layer designer to follow a multi-objective optimization strategy by providing a stable and reliable link in low rate portion of the signal and a high capacity link in high data rate portion of the signal.  In fact, by using superposition coding, packets with high priority and network control packets can be encoded within the reliable portion of the superimposed signal while the less sensitive, more error tolerant data such as multimedia packets can be sent through high data rate portion of the signal.   Building on the success of our Phase I results, in Phase II of this project we plan to build superposition coding transceiver on an FPGA and design a network MAC and routing protocol that exploits the superposition coding physical layer in high dynamic SNR environment.   BENEFIT:  The first planned product from the proposed effort will include: 1) FPGA based superposition coding transceivers; 2) superposition-aware MAC and routing protocols that take advantage of the benefits from superposition coding; and 3) a comprehensive wireless evaluation environment that can integrate simulation, hardware emulator, and hardware-in-the-loop capabilities. Put together, they form a generic toolset prototype for military as well as researchers in the networking community to investigate how to leverage superposition coding (and other related physical layer technologies) in providing more reliable wireless networking solutions, which is of critical importance for dynamic wireless networks such as Airborne Networks.",

        "abstract": "The frequency spectrum of interest for hydrophones used in Naval tactical systems, ocean surveillance systems, or for environmental monitoring is continuing to expand, due to increased interest in passively detecting third-world submarines, biologics, etc. as well as increased interest in multistatic active sonars. LewTech is proposing that our Phase II effort will be based on the on the Phase I hydrophone development using relaxor single-crystal piezoelectric materials rather than the traditionally-used polycrystalline lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) piezoceramic materials. This type of hydrophone can be designed to increase the sensitivity and bandwidth and reduce the self-noise, due to the improved electromechanical coupling factors, dielectric constant, and the loss tangent. The overall objective is to establish an improved design for the fat line towed array, using single-crystal ceramics, and demonstrate improvements in sensitivity, self-noise, and bandwidth capabilities over the conventional PZT configuration. Phase II will fabricate prototype single crystal hydrophones and perform in-water testing and compare the results to as counterpart PZT hydrophone. LewTech has formed a strong team with a major Navy system manufacturer, UnderSea Sensor Systems, Inc. (USSI), a wholly-owned company of Ultra Electronics, to support the design and development of a practical, cost effective sensor(s) utilizing relaxor single-crystal ceramics.",

In addition to the binary classification of native and nonnative speakers developed in Phase I, we will implement and evaluate several new methods to recognize possible native languages or dialects of nonnative speakers (a minimum of 5 languages). Recognition of non-native speakers is a multi-class recognition problem. Each accent or dialect will be considered as one class. We will collect a database of multiple dialects of a selected language, and then conduct research on the database. Our research will cover all existing approaches plus new algorithms developed in Phase I and II. The proposed system will be tested in both clean and noisy environments and its superior results will be validated by plugging it into a downstream speech recognition or machine language translation system. By the end of Phase II, we will provide the Army a working system to test. We will also provide detailed test plans, procedures, results and design documentation. Furthermore, we will deliver a matured non-native speaker recognition system, which can be used alone or in combination with speech recognition systems, machine translation systems, etc.",

The sensor integrates into a single unit: 1) a deep UV laser based, Rayleigh (R), resonance Raman (RR), native fluorescence (NF), and phosphorescence decay (PD) sensor capable of rapid detection and classification of trace concentrations of particulate materials such as bacterial spores and cells and dissolved chemical, biological, and explosives (CBE) hazards, and 2) a hybrid Differential Mobility Spectrometer (DMS) with two dual Ion Mobility Spectrometers (IMS2) for measuring a wide array of organic and inorganic compounds directly in the water column. This combination of detection methods in a single, hand-held, reagentless sensor provides a broad, overlapping, and confirming range of information about underwater CBE hazards. The sensor suite is rapidly trainable to new threats and hazards.

In Phase I, Ridgetop Group demonstrated the feasibility through rigorous analysis and simulations, and now in Phase II, we will design and develop a prototype system.  Air Force missions often require leading-edge semiconductor processes to achieve the Integrated Circuit (IC) performance targets sought in critical space applications. These processes require an effective tool to allow Engineers to design and deploy these ICs more rapidly. The significance of this innovation is that, for the first time, a portable and user-programmable reliability evaluation system (PROChek) for nanotechnology CMOS processes will be available for the space microelectronics design community. The system can be used for cost-effective and fast qualification of the intrinsic reliability of CMOS processes that are candidates for the fabrication of microelectronics on satellite missions. The system uses low-cost Multiproject Wafer (MPW) shuttle runs for the reliability characterization.   BENEFIT:  In addition to the space electronics community, design applications with low volume production requirements or rapid time-to-market objectives will benefit from this innovation. The tool will provide quick and deterministic assessment of the intrinsic reliability of the 65 nm (and smaller) process runs. Semiconductor fabrication companies do not normally provide design companies results from their internal reliability tests. Hence these customers have no idea of the degree of reliability of the processes they are using. To overcome this, Ridgetop\u2019s tool (PROChek) will provide a reliability assessment of advanced processes at just the cost of an MPW run and the tool. This will be a fraction of the combined cost of purchasing a mask set for a production run, and developing a test procedure that is comparable to our fully automated programmable test system.",

Great effort is being expended to increase ISR data gathering capabilities, with a goal of persistent and pervasive coverage of the operations space. However, tools capable of flexibly and effectively extracting actionable information from this deluge of data have lagged behind. To address this problem, SYTRONICS proposes to develop the Multi-agent Analysis System for ISR Filtering and Fusion (MASIFF). MASIFF will employ a cloud-based distributed network of services or intelligent software agent-components to create a service-oriented architecture (SOA) for the filtering, fusion, and analysis of ISR data. Sophisticated filter, fusion, and analysis components will be developed to process information acquired from existing ISR stovepipe applications, Worldwide Web, and cloud via Machine-Machine Interface (MMI) components. Workflow will be visually programmed to create modifiable, reusable systems. MASIFF analysis results will be displayed on a cognitively-designed Human-System Interface (HSI) which enhances situation awareness and understanding. Output will be redirectable back to legacy and other intelligence systems via services or agents. MASIFF technology may also be applicable in domains outside of the traditional military ISR, such as Missile Defense and Homeland Security.",

To address this need, we propose to design and demonstrate a VIsual Representation Toolkit for Integrated, Goal-Oriented awareness (VIRTIGO). This VIRTIGO visualization toolkit will support the adaptable presentation of display interfaces that seamlessly integrate network health and status information and meta-information with other traditional AOC information resources and activities across air, space, and cyber domains. Two key components characterize our approach. First, to enhance situation awareness, we will use Ecological Interface Design methods to develop a set of display mechanisms that perceptually and cognitively integrate critical blue and red network health and status information with traditional AOC information resources. Second, to support the dynamic integration and rendering of heterogeneous information resources within these structures, we will develop a network visualization ontology that maps heterogeneous AOC data sets onto information models suitable for role- and task-tailorable representation across a variety of visual display mechanisms. We will assess the effectiveness of our approach in supporting goal-oriented awareness by leveraging existing in-house, COTS, and GOTS components to rapidly design, prototype, and evaluate promising VIRTIGO visualization concepts in a spiral design and implementation effort.   BENEFIT:  We expect the fully developed VIRTIGO visualization toolkit to have immediate and tangible benefits across both government and commercial applications. Government applications include the development of battlespace visualization technologies that will improve warfighters\u2019 decision-making response time and provide enhanced flexibility for mission planning by revealing affordances for leveraging, disrupting, or enhancing network connectivity.

One of the key practical issues with HTS machines and other shipboard HTS systems is the support equipment required to accommodate the required cryogenic operating temperature (~30 to 50 K). In particular, cryogenic refrigeration is problematic for HTS machines since available cryocoolers are bulky and cannot be mounted on the shaft, requiring the use of problematic cryogenic slip couplings. In Phase I, we evaluated the potential of Creare\u2019s reverse-Brayton cryocooler technology to meet the need for cooling in large HTS machines and other shipboard HTS applications. We developed a system design and several conceptual layouts for integrating a reverse-Brayton cryocooler with a rotating HTS machine. We identified a number of advantages provided by the reverse-Brayton cryocooler including the ability to mount the cryocooler on the shaft of an HTS machine, the ability to eliminate separate cryogenic circulator(s), compactness, and extremely high reliability.

Through the use of native IP, Innoflight will introduce seamless networked communications through space vehicle links, ground stations, the mission operations center and end users.  Our proposed solution includes a powerful link encoder, IP/HDLC, Type 1 HAIPE encryption, Gbps speeds and a routing function \u2013 all implemented on a single space vehicle subsystem appliance.   This effort will transform multiple spacecraft into networked vehicles which have high performance, secure, networkable communications to each other and through to the ground segment user.   Our efforts will advance the transformation of tactical spacecraft by supporting net-centric operations and rapid integration of PnP spacecraft consistent with the satellite data model approach.  It will also unleash the capability to host and serve many applications on one vehicle consistent with modern systems.  Last, it will enable mission designers to operate over any IP network (Internet, SIPRNet, Classified WANs) as a black core without the need for specialized dedicated, bandwidth sensitive transport infrastructure.  BENEFIT:  Anticipated benefits of the SBIR Phase II include: 1) Seamless space networked communications (end-to-end) with HAIPE security, 2) Lower cost mission operations, ground stations and communications infrastructure, 3) Rapid spacecraft development and integration, 4) DoD Type 1 plug-n-play enabled space and ground appliances for operations over a black core 4) Multi-protocol spacecraft applications, and 5) The use of established IP networks for distributed net-centric operations. The customers for this technology include every branch of the military (and their supporting research and development agencies and institutions) since each one provides systems or relies on systems that communicate from space.  To increase the market size, our technology extends very well to UAV systems as they require high reliability, highly autonomous communication links along with network centric operations within the theater and from space.  A UAV can simply be enabled as a node in a secure network (similar to the remote tracking station) and be equipped with the communications appliance to receive critical data or information from a satellite above.   The fact that our proposed technology is founded on open standards and plug-n-play will open our commercialization capabilities significantly as numerous DoD agencies and NASA ARC are looking to AFRL\u2019s SPA efforts to drive down the cost and increase the responsiveness of space missions.  Our primary target is the DoD small satellite (most notably, CubeSats) and Operationally Responsive Space (e.g., TACSAT) market which includes research, development and demonstration programs from DARPA, MDA, AFRL, SMC, and NRO.  CubeSats have a lot to gain from this technology due to the fact that a cluster, swarm or tight formation of CubeSats is basically mandatory in order to qualify as a significant DoD mission.  It is expected that these CubeSats form a network to enable sensor collaboration, autonomous reconfiguration, shared computing and a host of other capabilities enabled in a network centric architecture.  Similarly, DARPA''s F6 program will gain from this technology.  The emergence of these missions and ORS\u2019s staunch support of open standards and plug-n-play indicates the awareness that National Security objectives can be met through low-earth orbiting small spacecraft and more responsive missions.   NASA''s Constellation Program, is another prominent customer for this technology especially the ability to establish robust long distance networking capabilities for lunar systems including the implementation of IPsec \u2013 potentially with the need for NSA certified HAIPE solutions. Last, but certainly not least when it comes to commercialization potential, future net-centric space secure communications demonstrate a significant and emerging demand for a Type 1 IP-based space solution.  The space communicatons network of 2020 will rely on IP-based HAIPE enabled systems much like the ones that Innoflight proposes to demonstrate in this effort.",

        "abstract": "The ability to perform rapid, highly sensitive and selective detection of a complex Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) signature profiles is important for applications ranging from acute situational health and safety assessment to suspect/target identification. Commercial gas sensors employ a number of different transduction mechanisms depending on the nature and reactivity of the gas and include systems based on optical, electrical and mass detection. Recent advances in gas sensor technology have provided even more sensitivity and are poised to increase the sensor specificity in analysis of complex VOC profiles in compact, low-cost formats. Ultimately, a VOC detection platform must be compact and amenable to analysis of a range of targets (selectivity), provide accurate point exposure sensing limit detection and produce reliable analysis with low false alarm rates. The ability to multiplex high sensitivity and selectivity in a robust, rechargeable, harsh environment will provide the Air Force with a tool to meet the goal of complex VOC profiling for positive or negative identification of suspects/persons of interest and other airborne screening applications. To this end, Nanohmics proposes to continue the development of a novel detection device that meets the requirements for high sensitivity and high selectivity analysis of complex VOC profiles. The core of the technology is an array of independently-addressable, chemoresistive sensors that have robust nanotraces fabricated using a novel technique. This technique eliminates the limitations of scale and response inhomogeneities of vapor grown semiconducting nanowires and carbon nanotubes.  BENEFIT:  Numerous instruments have been developed to automate the process of gas analysis.  Optical systems are often too bulky, and such direct electrical systems that rely on chemoresistive changes to semiconductor materials have shown great promise in commercial gas sensors. Nanohmics proposed use an emerging semiconductor fabrication technique is ideal for manufacturing sensor arrays.  Our goal is to be the first to market such a technique and thus enable the necessary sensor platform for screening sensitization compounds and ultimately use in odorprint detection.  The process will enable multiplex gas sensors to be scale to the commercial level. A compact, affordable sensor device tailored for the covert analysis of complex VOC profiles for suspect identification with the ability to perform all aspects of sample collection, multiplex detection, and complex signature analysis using modest-density arrays will be a compelling tool for the Air Force.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this SBIR Phase II effort is to design, fabricate, test and deliver environmentally compliant conformal wideband, efficient antenna assemblies with well controlled radiation patterns that can be readily and covertly integrated into vehicle CREW and airborne communication systems.  In Phase I Pharad developed and successfully demonstrated improved conformal wideband antenna technology for tactical vehicle systems.  Our prototype operates efficiently from VHF to S-band, is less than 3&#8243; in height and can be seamlessly integrated with the host platform with a significant reduction in visual signature.  Our high performing conformal antenna technology is equally beneficial to wideband communications links on airborne platforms, reducing the number of apertures and aerodynamic drag.  During Phase II we will identify target integration platforms and establish the primary electromagnetic and environmental requirements for the new radiators.  We will undertake extensive electromagnetic and mechanical modeling and subsequently develop environmentally compliant prototype antennas that can withstand the environmental operating conditions.  These prototypes will undergo rigorous electromagnetic and environmental testing.  At the conclusion of this Phase II program, we will deliver two unique antenna assemblies to the Air Force; one for a tactical ground platform CREW system and one for an airborne communications system.  BENEFIT:  The innovative high performing conformal wideband antenna technology that will be developed as part of this program will find immediate application for mounting on US military tactical vehicles and integration with vehicle CREW systems.  Having smaller vehicle antennas with performance similar to larger whip antennas will be of great benefit and the elimination of large vehicle antennas will allow for more covert operation of CREW systems.  The new antenna technology will be equally beneficial to wideband communications links, such as conformally mounted JTRS antennas on aircraft and UAVs.  In addition to military CREW and communications applications, our new conformal wideband antennas will find application in commercial wireless communication systems.  Antenna technology which is wideband and inherently neutral to wireless applications, enables wireless communications service providers to add additional wireless services at a minor cost.",

        "abstract": "The threats to U.S. national security are rapidly changing and geographically diffuse.  It is a fact of life that intelligence analysts are often forced to shift rapidly from one topic to the next. Increasingly, Intelligence Community professionals need to quickly assimilate social, economic, and cultural information about a region.  This information is often detailed in open sources. The problem, however, is that intelligence professionals are inundated with massive volumes of open source data without clear understanding of which sources are most relevant or reliable. The Radiance-SAIC team has designed a system architecture which targets technologies designed to increase the effectiveness of OSINT collection for GEOINT products.  The proposed system will attempt to direct intelligence analysts to a more decisively relevant set of open source search results and provide quicker access to the most difficult targets.  It will also offer tools which help the user make the determination of relevancy faster and with more confidence; Tools which will be designed to automatically geoenable unstructured text and exploit foreign language sources more effectively. Additionally, the system will attempt to improve upon collection and dissemination methodologies by improving the means by which intelligence professionals store, archive, retrieve, and share useful pieces of intelligence.   BENEFIT:  The proposed Geospatial Open Source Intelligence Tool will have a direct impact on the major intelligence agencies within the DoD as well as the intelligence organizations of the four military services.  It has been designed to create efficiencies in the processes of collecting information from publicly available sources and analyzing it to produce actionable intelligence.   The tool will also have utility within federal and state agencies outside of the DoD where open source information is collected to evaluate and respond to threats on homeland security, disease propagation, energy infrastructure vulnerabilities, fiscal and monetary policies, and illegal narcotics trade.   Commercial markets may also find value in data mining capabilities designed to distill information about competitors'' capabilities or executive characteristics or to provide historical, current, and predictive views of business operations.",

Recently, the interdiction challenge has increased with the advent of the self-propelled semi-submersible (SPSS) vehicle as a craft of choice for illegal drug trafficking on the open seas. Of an estimated 85 SPSS that operated in this region in 2008, only 15 were seized. US SOUTHCOM, the U.S. Coast Guard, and national law enforcement agencies consider the SPSS a serious threat to regional security. To address this threat, this program will design, implement, and deploy the Intelligent Mobile Sensor Barrier (IMSB) system, a persistent, at-sea surveillance system to autonomously detect, monitor and support interdiction of SPSSs. The IMSB Sensor Array will consist of multiple, heterogeneous, networked, long-endurance autonomous USVs with mounted sensors, coordinated to responsively execute the assigned mission. The proposed work is the first phase of a 3 phase program to deploy 12 IMSB nodes in an operationally relevant environment in 24 months. The program will be primed by Scientific Systems Company.

Our goal for Phase II is successful X-band testing of a prototype PARCA tile with approximately 10,000 pixels and actuators. PARCA is a phased array technology that operates under software control to be pointing-agile, frequency-agile, polarization-agile, low profile, and affordable. One COTM concept uses a PARCA panel that is mechanically pointed for slow gross pointing and electronically pointed via software for fast fine pointing. Another COTM concept uses multiple PARCA panels to provide all-sky coverage.   BENEFIT:  The initial market for a PARCA-COTM system is substantial, as the market for military satcom systems is large both in the U.S. and with allied militaries. However, the PARCA technology will also be compelling in other military applications than need a thin, flat-plate array that provides agility in frequency, gain, steering, and polarization.",

To support visual learning of first-aid skills, we executed a Phase I effort to design Pictorial Representations of Medical Procedures to Train for Effective Recall (PROMPTER). Based on this successful proof-of-concept effort, we propose a development and evaluation effort focused on four major components. First, we will design an intuitive, standardized symbology for the individual first-aid task and subtasks that comprise the complex emergency first-aid skills of the Soldiers Manual of Common Tasks, Warrior Skills, Level 1 (STP 21-1-SMCT). Second, we will incorporate sets of these first-aid symbols within a pictorial mnemonic framework to visually represent each of the seventeen procedures in STP-21-SMCT. Third, we will design and demonstrate adaptive, microgame-based training methods that leverage these pictorial mnemonic training materials. These microgames will present tasks and challenges relevant to procedural skill acquisition and retention, using engaging game play mechanisms that are continually tailored to individual Soldiers evolving training needs. Fourth, we will conduct formal evaluations to assess both the usability of PROMPTER visual training materials as well as their effectiveness in enhancing procedural skill acquisition and retention over time.",

A mission and sensor trade study will rely heavily on available simulation programs to predict performance outcome.  The satellite would be located strategically in Geo-orbit to monitor the location and activity of all satellites in the zone of interest. Proposed is very high resolution three dimensional imaging data of satellites in the detection zone of the GEO-COPS satellite so that, not only tracking of satellite location is possible but, satellite change detection can be achieved if the satellite rotates, divides, or takes some action of interest to the US Air Force.  BENEFIT:  The Phase II program will define and analytically validate dual mode sensor technology for Geo-COPS.  The initial application for this dual mode sensor is for the Geo-COPS application.  This system could be used for border surveillance and protection, infrastructure protection, port security and other Homeland Security needs. Another important and critical application for this dual mode concept is for Sense and Avoid (SAS) for unmanned aircraft so they can be authorized for operation in the National Air Space (NAS).  The field-of-view requirements for SAS are similar to those for Geo-COPS, requiring long range radar and EO sensors for high reliable detection and wide angle coverage ahead of the aircraft.",

In this effort we implement and test a fast back projection algorithm as well as our modified polar format based algorithm on a large scale parallel processing system. Testing thus far has shown that both of our approaches can dramatically reduce the number of processors required to form continuous video SAR sequences for very large scenes.  BENEFIT:  This research will allow real-time production of very large synthetic aperture radar movies. The algorithm facilitates fast production of very large images; however, it may also be used to reduce the computational resources required for any existing airborne radar system. These existing radar systems may be used for anything from terrain mapping and border patrol to site monitoring for counter terrorism.",

        "abstract": "Ground-based space surveillance (GSS) is crucial to Space Situational Awareness (SSA). The limiting factor in GSS performance is atmospheric turbulence. Recent advances in CCDs enable practical implementation of \u201cLucky Shot\u201d concept, making possible occasional detection of a clear image, and allowing for near diffraction-limited performance for terrestrial telescopes. Due to the rapid motion of space vehicles, lucky imaging must be adapted for use in SSA. In response, we propose the Coherent Lucky Imaging Monitoring Awareness Tracking and Evaluation (CLIMATE) system which employs MetroLaser\u2019s proprietary target-in-the-loop optical phase conjugation (TIL-OPC) to generate coherent glints on targets and independently measure the Strehl Ratio of the optical path at a very high speed. The CLIMATE system will employ the TIL-OPC technology to perform both anisoplanatic and isoplanatic lucky imaging. In the case of isoplanatic imaging, high-speed Strehl ratio measurements will be used to automatically cull and register the imagery, reducing processing and storage by an order of magnitude. In Phase I of this program we performed initial analysis of the proposed CLIMATE design and proved its perspective performance. During Phase II, we will design, integrate and verify the brassboard version of the CLIMATE module, culminating with its demonstration in an environment relevant to SSA.  BENEFIT:  Given that atmospheric turbulence is a limiting factor in nearly all long-distance terrestrial and airborne imaging, the CLIMATE system will be indispensable for a broad variety of applications. Initially, MetroLaser will focus on use with remote sensing and use at proving grounds for tracking and observation of test vehicles.",

Phase I work conclusively demonstrated PASS feasibility through design, assembly, and testing of a TRL-4 prototype. Specifically, overall system architecture, system prototype design (software/hardware), and documents for Phase II (System Development Schedule, Assessment of Technical Risk, and Test Plan) were developed. The Phase I prototype demonstrated reliable data protection on removable storage media, unprecedented accuracy in person authentication, policy management, strong encryption using biometrics, and system operability when no connection to the network is available. These capabilities support Army applications requiring warfighters to securely share sensitive information via mobile computers and removable storage media. In Phase II, POC will finalize the development of enterprise-scale system design (TRL-6) suitable for transition to the U.S. Military Entrance Processing Command in Phase III.

The objectives of this Phase II project include the optimization of individual formulation components in the development of a fully formulated system suitable for a more complete evaluation according to the major appearance and physical property requirements of aerospace primer specification MIL-PRD-23377 and aerospace topcoat specification MIL-PRE-85285. A commercial objective of this work is the development of a product that meets design specifications for aerospace primer or combined primer/topcoat without requiring the use of a hazardous component such as hexavalent chromium. This proprietary hybrid UV coating system provides immediate cure when exposed to UV light along with a secondary cure mechanism. It has a suitable rate of cure in the absence of UV light to dry overspray to reduce the possibility of contamination from spray painting operations and to dry material in shadow areas where the coating may not be exposed to sufficient UV energy for typical UV cure. An important aspect of this technology is to significantly reduce exposure of workers and communities to hexavalent chromium, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and hazardous air pollutant (HAP) materials. Phase I research demonstrated feasibility and provided sufficient groundwork for Phase II development of the technology. Light Curable Coatings is a technology leader for solvent-free environmentally compliant coating systems, which include proprietary technology for rapidly cured heavily pigmented coatings with UV light, including low gloss camouflage color UV coating systems. The described chromium-free corrosion-resistant \n\nhybrid UV coating system is proprietary to Light Curable Coatings.  \n\n\n\nAnticipated benefits of the proposed approach include dramatically improved environmental friendliness, economics, and productivity capabilities. Because this hybrid resin system contains safer components, application in confined and occupied spaces should be possible without the hazards presented by conventional materials. Environmental savings apply not \n\nonly in production, but also throughout and beyond the operational lifecycle of industrial parts and vehicles by reducing environmental risks associated with maintenance, storage, and disposal. This research offers a significant positive societal impact in terms of better quality of life for industrial workers and for citizens through safer workplaces and a cleaner environment.",

Grease emissions from one underfired charbroiler are approximately 2.15 MT/yr. This large, installed base requires a retrofit implementation approach with new emissions control technology. Conventional technologies are either too capital intensive to install, too costly to operate and maintain, or have inefficient overall filtration performance.\n\nA new cost-effective, high-efficiency emission control system was developed that integrates a novel self-cleaning inertial filter (already commercialized for metalworking oil mist elimination) with a proprietary water mist evaporative cooler for VOC condensation and a clean-in-place (CIP) continuous grease removal system for long-term unattended operation. Technology attributes and benefits include:  compactness, ease of maintenance and service, enhanced worker and customer safety, reduced capital and operational costs, elimination of contaminated media disposal in landfills, and long service life.\n\nThe project objective is to demonstrate that a full-scale self-cleaning aerosol grease filtration system with integrated blower, evaporative cooler, and CIP components can cost-effectively reduce both PM and VOC grease emissions by at least 70 percent.\n\nA full-sized pre-commercial prototype will be tested extensively to compare grease PM removal efficiencies with competitive technologies and demonstrate grease VOC removal with H2O mist evaporative cooling. Integrated spray nozzles in the prototype that periodically spray a commercial degreaser will allow intermittent and continuous operation without grease build-up.\n\nAchieving grease emissions reductions of approximately 70 percent nationally would decrease pollution by more than 483,105 MT/yr, significantly reducing smog in major urban areas.\n\nAll Phase I project technical objectives were achieved, establishing full-scale PM removal efficiencies of more than 99 percent, significantly better than current technologies (sub-scale VOC removal efficiencies were approximately 42% via evaporative cooling, resulting in more than 70% reduction in total grease emissions). \n\nInnovaTech anticipates that full-scale combined PM and VOC grease removal efficiencies will exceed 70 percent, establishing the highest performance standard in the market. Retrofit/installation and operating costs will be minimized for affordable and sustained technology implementation. Integrated CIP will lower routine service and maintenance costs.\n\nEconomies will be gained in long-term sustainable process efficiencies; reduced operation, maintenance, and disposal costs; decreased filter cleaning and replacement downtime; enhanced worker (OSHA and NIOSH) safety; environmental friendliness; and greater compliance with EPA PM2.5 emission requirements.\n\nAlthough the potential U.S. restaurant grease emission control market is worth more than $2B, the technology also can improve emission compliance of industrial process gas streams including:  agriculture (pesticides), power generation, transportation, construction and mining, petrochemicals, and so on.",

        "abstract": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in its publication Technology News and Trends in 2009 featured the Navy's work that saved 6 years and $3 million delineating chlorinated solvent plumes in soil and groundwater. The Navy used EPA's TRIAD process, which incorporates systematic planning, field analytics, and dynamic work strategies, during its hazardous waste site investigation. A direct sampling ion trap mass spectrometer was used to transport pollutants from depth to the surface for analysis. Although excellent data were obtained, the technology cannot collect and analyze semivolatile organics (SVOCs).\n\nOnly Ion Signature Technology, Inc. (IST) has developed technology to collect VOCs and SVOCs at depth and transport the sample to the surface for analysis without organics adsorbing or condensing in the transfer line. In Phase I, IST found new material to develop a high temperature membrane inlet probe (MIP). When the MIP is at 300\u00b0C, organics efficiently desorb and extract from soil and at 100\u00b0C, collect from groundwater without bringing soil or groundwater to the surface for analysis. In addition, two new freeze traps and a new transfer line gas flow system were designed and tested, which met their respective specifications as established in the objectives.\n\nThe goal of this Phase II SBIR is to integrate all of the disparate technologies into a turnkey system so that end users can \"sniff\" EPA method 8260 VOCs and 8270 SVOCs as the MIP is advanced into the subsurface at the rate of 2 cm/sec. The thermal extraction and detection system (TEDS) will incorporate electron capture and photoionization sensors to provide real-time, in situ chemical detection of pollutants. Once sensor responses exceed baseline signals, the MIP will stop automatically, with gas flow switching from the sensors to the freeze trap so that pollutants can be concentrated and quantified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). All analyses will be made online, at discrete depths, and recorded electronically for upload into site conceptual models. When combined with geological and hydrogeological data, conceptual models emerge that depict the location and rate of movement of subsurface pollutants. TEDS fits squarely within EPA's mission and importantly, EPA's TRIAD process. The objective is to provide defensible data to better manage site investigations and cleanups. EPA has shown that when projects employ the TRIAD process, which encompasses systemic planning, dynamic work strategies, and real-time chemical measurements, remediation costs are reduced.",

        "abstract": "In the United States, several high profile outbreaks of waterborne illness during the past 15 years have highlighted the need for a solution to drinking water contamination. Several recent studies suggest that approximately 20 percent of surface and ground source waters in the United States are contaminated with viruses. There are very few data on virus occurrence in drinking water, however, which is mainly attributed to the absence of efficient methodologies that enable concentration and detection of viruses from water samples. Most current methods are labor or time intensive, expensive, or impractical. Therefore, there is an acute need for the development of concentration and detection technologies that enable efficient assay of viruses in water samples, and these methods should be designed to be conducted directly in the field. Scientific Methods, Inc. (SMI) has designed a concentration device that can capture viruses from large amounts of water. The device completely eliminates the need for a secondary concentration step and also increases the speed of concentration. \n\n\n\nThe objective of this Phase II SBIR project is the development of an integrated detection method that includes capture of human enteric viruses as well as coliphages from large volumes of water followed by detection of the viruses by multiple real-time, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). During the Phase II period SMI plans to develop a multiple isothermal RT-PCR assay so that both the viral capture and detection steps can be completed directly in the field. Also, in-field sampling of ground and surface water sources will be conducted, and the ability of the integrated capture and detection method to assay for the presence of viruses in these waters will be demonstrated. It is expected that water testing companies, research laboratories, municipalities, and government agencies will make use of the capture and concentration device, either in combination with their own downstream detection assays or with the isothermal-based RT-PCR assay that will be created during Phase II.",

Scale-up of this new catalyst will have the greatest impact on commercialization because it will enable biodiesel to be made from inexpensive feedstocks like yellow grease, rendered fats, and other low quality fats and oils. Very recently, continuing its research beyond Phase I, Down to Earth Energy developed a novel base functionalized biochar from peanut hulls that is efficient for catalytic transesterification (100% conversion in 3 hours at 65\u00b0C). The use of a base catalyst will greatly reduce amounts of waste pollutants that are generated compared to current methodology that uses sodium or potassium hydroxide and generates more pollutants than biodiesel product.\n\n\n\nFirst year activities will focus on: (1) optimizing production of the acid and base catalysts, (2) optimizing recovery and reuse of the acid and base catalysts, and (3) the design and development of pilot-scale, continuous-flow catalyst test beds. Scale-up research and commercialization activities will occur concurrently with the optimization of production and reuse of the two chars, and will involve reactor design specifications for batched slurry and continuous fixed-bed configurations; the effect of free fatty acid concentration, temperature, flow rate, and particle size on kinetics and reaction rates; and determination of optimal char volumes at practical industrial flow rates. Char production and engineering partnerships also will be formalized and production of the acid catalyst using a gaseous functionalization reagent will be evaluated in place of the current liquid phase production methods.",

Unfortunately, the current technology for generating HPV requires 35 weight percent hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a precursor, which is dangerous and cumbersome to transport and is classified by the Department of Transportation (DOT) as both a Class 5.1 Hazard (oxidizer) and a Class 8 Hazard (corrosive). While the 35 weight percent H2O2 normally is stable, if the temperature becomes elevated or the container becomes contaminated it can quickly decompose, releasing large amounts of oxygen.\n\n\n\nTDA Research, Inc. (TDA) is developing a compact portable system that will generate liquid H2O2 onsite, eliminating all problems related to its transport and storage. The portable system will require only water, air, and electricity (resources that are readily available at any application site) and will not generate any hazardous by-products for which disposal is difficult.\n\n\n\nIn the Phase I project, TDA demonstrated the technical feasibility of using nanocatalysts in a microreactor for direct synthesis of H2O2. The catalysts developed in Phase I showed a very high activity and selectivity for H2O2 synthesis. In Phase II, TDA will build and test a prototype microreactor unit for H2O2 synthesis.\n\n\n\nThis system will enable onsite H2O2 generation of a 35 weight percent solution that can be used to decontaminate the interiors of vehicles and buildings. H2O2 is a strong, nonpolluting oxidizing agent, with broad applications in pulp/paper bleaching, water/waste and effluent treatment, chemical synthesis, textile bleaching, mining/metallurgy, electronics (semiconductors), and propulsion.  It also is finding increased use in maintaining safe hospital interiors. The system and the materials developed in this work also will provide cost-effective H2O2 to the U.S. chemical and manufacturing industries.",

        "abstract": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules stipulate that corrective action be taken for drinking water distribution systems that exceed the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for total trihalomethanes (TTHMs), 80 &mu;g/L. Currently, real-time or even periodic monitoring of drinking water is not economically feasible. Available methods use gas chromatography and are expensive and plagued with long delay times between sample collection and results. Laboratory analysis requires sample collection, packaging and shipping, tracking and recordkeeping, and disposal of samples. A sensor allowing rapid response, real-time measurement of TTHM concentrations in water systems would be ideal for identifying contaminant \"hot spots\" and allowing system operators to implement mitigation strategies and monitor changes.\n\n\n\nA team including the principal investigator developed such a sensor in the 1990s--the RCI sensor. This sensor was fabricated from a mixture of rare-earth elements sintered in a silica matrix, a procedure very similar to that used for the heated metal oxide sensor (HMOS). Unlike HMOSs, this RCI sensor was extremely sensitive to chlorinated organic vapors and not at all sensitive to hydrocarbons. The sensor was very effective but relatively large and expensive. The goal of this project is to develop and demonstrate feasibility of a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) version of this sensor, a prototype analyzer, and simple analytical method that can measure TTHM at concentrations below the EPA-regulated level of 80 &mu;g/L in water. The MEMS approach will yield a modern sensor with a tiny economical footprint and high performance.\n\n\n\nKWJ recently has developed a MEMS platform on which multiple classes of chemical sensors can be fabricated, including the RCI sensor, and there is opportunity to leverage this work with this SBIR project. In Phase I of this SBIR project, KWJ developed a MEMS planar sensor chip with the rare-earth sensory coating and demonstrated that it is responsive to THMs at low ppb levels. In Phase II, KWJ will integrate the sensor into an analyzer and develop a method for effective monitoring of TTHMs in drinking water that will save significant time and materials and provide a new field capability for environmental protection.\n\n\n\nIn Phase I, KWJ fabricated and tested a MEMS planar version of the sensor, demonstrating the ability to detect less than 5ppbv CHCl3, less than 15ppbv CHBr3 in gas phase, and less than 10 and 20 &mu;g/L, respectively, in water without pre-concentration. The Phase II research effort will focus on optimizing the sensor and sampler design. KWJ will build, instrument, develop, and validate a simple sensor-method with a target of less than 1 &mu;g/L for all THM species. The resulting analyzer will make analytical quality monitoring of drinking water for TTHMs possible virtually anywhere, at any time, on-the-spot, and at low cost. Additional applications made possible will include pool and spa as well as industrial water and groundwater monitoring.",

        "abstract": "In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that carbon dioxide (CO2) is a pollutant under the federal Clean Air Act. The ruling allows the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate CO2 emissions. Such regulation will entail monitoring a wide variety of pollution sources, including automobile exhaust systems, industrial emission sources, and carbon sequestration sites. With presently available technologies, EPA personnel will need to perform on-site scans of possible pollution locations by tediously sampling emitted gases with point-source gas-intake measurement devices. This makes it difficult or impossible for EPA personnel to identify or quantify critical CO2 pollution sources such as smokestacks/vents or unknown leaks in large search areas. No technology currently exists that can measure and pinpoint (to within a few meters) the location of elevated CO2 concentrations from a distance.\n\n\n\nTo address this need, Bridger Photonics, Inc. (Bridger) proposes to develop an inexpensive, rugged, and compact sensor with high-range resolution (meter-level) for on-site CO2 monitoring and spatial mapping from a distance. The proposed technology will enable EPA personnel simply to aim the sensor toward a distant industrial emission stack, for example, to measure the emitted CO2 concentration, the distance to the source, and the spatial extent of the plume. The sensor also could be used to spatially scan CO2 sequestration or industrial sites for leaks and could provide precise three-dimensional coordinate mappings of the emission source.\n\n\n\nThe proposed device is based on an innovative laser source and a differential detection technique developed during the Phase I effort that were shown to be ideally suited to detect CO2. The Phase II objectives are to:  (1) optimize the performance of the laser system, (2) construct a compact optical receiver for detecting atmospheric light detection and ranging (LIDAR) returns, (3) demonstrate the system performance and capabilities for detecting artificial CO2 plumes in atmosphere, and (4) design a preliminary prototype device. Additionally, in the Phase II Commercialization and Verification Options, Bridger will construct, test, and verify a device prototype.\n\n\n\nBridger's propriety differential detection technique and rugged, compact laser will provide distinct competitive advantages in the CO2 sensor market. The recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling combined with an emerging international effort to reduce CO2 emissions established a growing market demand for including future carbon sequestration monitoring markets. Bridger estimates a potential $50 million U.S. market for this hand-held CO2 sensor.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing volatility of petroleum and natural gas resources, small coal-fired boilers have become increasingly more attractive for steam and power generation in several industries. This switch to small-scale, coal-fired plants is expected to continue, and increases the need for clean coal utilization technology. The U.S. Energy Policy Act includes support for a clean coal technology initiative focusing on the environmental challenges of using coal. While initial efforts focused on addressing acid rain, more recent efforts focus on addressing the potential health risks of particulate matter (PM).\n\n\n\nA key technology for removing PM from flue gases generated by coal-fired power plants is the electrostatic precipitator (ESP). ESPs operate with an efficiency of 90 to 99 percent for the removal of mercury and fly ash from the flue gas stream. ESPs work by applying an electric voltage to an electrode, which in turn applies a charge to the PM entrained in the gas flow; the charged PM then is collected on a large plate with the opposite voltage. The collection surface and electrodes are made from metal, are extremely heavy with a high installed cost, are easily corroded, and have a limited service life unless very expensive alloys are used.\n\n\n\nTo address these issues associated with using metallic ESP components, Applied Sciences, Inc., working closely with Ohio University, investigated the use of inexpensive carbon nanofibers (CNF) to enhance the capture efficiencies of ESPs. The joint effort focused on producing polymeric, composite electrodes enhanced with the addition of CNF. This combination of low-cost materials and processing techniques has led to the production of composite electrodes that generate up to 20 percent more corona current than metal electrodes at the same voltage. The superior performance of the composite electrode increases the capture efficiency and lowers the power requirements of both dry and wet ESPs. These enhancements are attributed to the presence of the CNF, which provides a conductive path to the surface where the corona current is generated. Additionally, each CNF exposed to the surface of the composite acts as a source of charge emission.\n\n\n\nPolymeric-based nanocomposite electrodes are less expensive to produce, easier and cheaper to install, and corrosion resistant. Based on the generous support, technical guidance, and level of interest expressed by Southern Environmental Inc., and feedback from other ESP providers, this technology will advance the state of ESP performance for both large and small units.",

Implementation of microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology in wastewater systems could change the fundamental energy budget of treatment nationwide.\n\n\n\nThe Phase I SBIR project, entitled \"Electricity Generation from Anaerobic Wastewater Treatment in Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs),\" successfully demonstrated that MFCs can treat municipal wastewater and generate electricity simultaneously. In this pilot-scale project, which had considerable outside funding, a multi-anode/cathode granular activated carbon-based MFC (MAC-GACMFC) was designed, constructed, operated, and modified to treat municipal wastewater at temperatures of 25 to 30\u00b0C with a hydraulic retention time of 20 hours and external resistances of 100 ohm. Electrical power was produced, and effluent chemical oxygen demands (CODs) less than 50 mg/L were achieved in continuous-flow anaerobic MAC-GACMFC systems treating primary effluent.\n\n\n\nIn the proposed Phase II scope of work, two major tasks will be conducted to optimize MFC operation and improve power generation for future commercialization. In the first task, the MAC-GACMFC capabilities will continue to be tested at alternate operating conditions in order to develop a rational basis for design. Specifically, the first task will:\n\n  \n\nDetermine treatment performance with primary effluent as the substrate;  \n\nExamine performance with higher strength dairy-based wastewaters;  \n\nDetermine performance impacts at lower temperatures;  \n\nInvestigate performance at alternate hydraulic retention time (HRT) levels; and   \n\nExamine the impact of alternate external resistance levels.   \n\n\n\nIn the second task, the MFC system configurations and materials will be modified and developed with the objectives of improving power generation and treatment efficiency and developing a practical, cost-effective commercial product. The design improvements will be critical to commercializing the technology. Specifically, the second task will address:\n\n      \n\nImprovements to anode/cathode pairs to minimize internal resistance and improve access for maintenance and repair; \n\nOptimizing anode to cathode ratios and anode density in the GAC bed; and \n\nTesting alternate (lower cost) catalyst coatings on the cathode material to replace the costly platinum coating. Lab-scale tests have shown encouraging results with alternative catalysts. \n\n\n\nThe anticipated results of Phase II will be used to develop a greatly improved and engineered MFC system for future commercialization. In the opinion of the Project Team, this unique MFC technology has great potential to be developed as a modularized system, enhancing its feasibility as a cost-effective, practical retrofit for municipal wastewater treatment systems.",

To maintain cyberspace superiority, there is a need for effective Command and Control (C2) tools to observe, plan, and execute cyber operations. Visualization is a key enabler of C2 but new approaches are required to address cyber security data sets. A principal challenge is the complexity of this data: it is immense and multidimensional, includes streaming and log data, and comes from a diverse set of applications with different protocols and formats. The Visualization tool for Integrated Command and Control (VIC3) fuses these disparate data sets to provide cyber situation awareness and decision support for cyber planning and operations. It allows users to identify information dependencies and critical data flows, correlate cyber events, project potential effects, evaluate alternative cyber COAs, and view the relationships between cyber and kinetic operations. VIC3 uses A) Coordinated Views to fuse different data sets and provide multiple perspectives, B) Abstract Information Layers (AIL) to provide querying and visual layering of cyber security data sets analogous to geographical information systems (GIS), C) Dynamic Queries to select items that match user specified criteria, and D) a Plug-in Architecture to integrate with external tools.

        "abstract": "IPv6 transition mechanisms may cause security problems if configured inappropriately. In this proposal, IAI proposes a comprehensive security management and validation tool, called JANASSURE, to aid the network administrator to effectively manage IPv6 transition mechanisms.  JANASSURE adopts probe-based and penetration-based approaches to detect dual-stack nodes and IPv6 tunnels in networks. Experimental results in Phase I show that JANASSURE can correctly detect the existence of IPv6 transition mechanisms in a real enterprise network and networks configured on test-bed. The experiment results also show that JANASSURE can accurately generate the IPv4 topology and IPv6 topology of networks. In Phase II effort, we will extend JANASSURE by applying automated reasoning technologies such as Bayesian Network in security management and validation of JANASSURE, and make JANASSURE a comprehensive security management tool for IPv6 transition mechanisms. The extended JANASSURE will help the network administrator to conduct static risk evaluation, dynamic attack analysis and damage assessment, and plan counter-measures against attacks. Moreover, we will optimize the deployment of probers in JANASSURE to reduce the probe traffic caused by JANASSURE. The developed measurement techniques and algorithms in our work will be integrated into a prototype implementation.   BENEFIT:  The proposed adaptive and extendible assurance assessment and validation tool for IPv6 transition mechanisms, called JANASSURE, provides a feasible solution to manage IPv6 transition mechanisms. The architecture and implementation approaches can be applied to a broad range of military networks including war-time command and control, real-time surveillance network, homeland security, etc. Other potential commercial applications include border and coast patrol, law enforcement agency, emergency control center and various civil applications. In essence, the ideas, methods and models resulting from this effort will be applicable to virtually all types of networks since all networks are transiting to IPv6. The market is quite large and still developing due to the fact that security is urgently demanded in many applications. The aggregated commercial market size can be much larger than that of military applications. IAI is more than a \u201cthink tank\u201d, and we have actively pursued with our partners the application of our technologies into actual products in the past. For this proposed effort, in particular, we strongly believe that our work provides the solution needed in practice. It is also reasonable to expect a source of revenue from service contracts related with the actual deployment and use of JANASSURE. To achieve successful commercialization, IAI will closely work with our partners and collaborator companies such as Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, BAE systems, Raytheon, and Telcordia to transfer this technology into the military and commercial world.",

An engineering prototype of the system will be demonstrated on both test articles provided by the Air Force and on actual aircraft in the field to evaluate the detection and location performance in terms of probability of detection and probability of false alarm.  The system can be automated using a signal processing algorithm that has been developed and validated by Vista Engineering on the composite samples of the rudder and vertical stabilizer of an F-15 aircraft for the detection of and classification of skin-to-core disbonds, delamination, and fluid ingress.  The successful application of the technology is due to novel methods of heating the composite no more than several degrees to produce a strong thermal signature due to the defect.  A single measurement over a 2-ft2-area can be in 15 to 60 s using a COTS low-cost, low-resolution (320x240) uncooled IR camera; an entire vertical stabilizer can be inspected in the field in less than 1 h.  BENEFIT:  There is significant commercial potential for this system for the present application in terms of manufactured systems and inspection services, and the software is equally application to almost all types of NDT inspection systems besides IR systems.  The benefit is immediately obvious if disbonding, delamination, fluid ingress, and fiber breakage in composites structures can be readily identified in routine maintenance without having to disassemble parts.  The system is immediately adaptable to other military aircraft and all commercial aircraft.  Vista Engineering has identified a large company as a strategic partner that would be interested in offering commercial products based on this technology, and Vista Engineering would be interested in providing commercial inspection services using this system.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR develops a method for the integration of high-efficiency, thin-film solar cells into an Integrated Blanket Interconnect System array that features high specific power, low stowed volume, and a simple and reliable manufacturing approach.  The Phase II program completes the design of the IBIS, including design of the IMM cell in concert with the cell supplier, bypass diode integration, covershield material, wiring, and stowage.  Coupons will be assembled and tested to characterize and compare covershield material performance in multiple radiation environments.  Three IBIS module test articles will be constructed utilizing streamlined manufacturing methods and an automated, consistent interconnecting method.  The modules will undergo testing in relevant space environments including thermal cycling and thermal vacuum, with pre- and post- LAPSS characterization.  Completion of the Phase II effort will see the IBIS technology ready for insertion into military, commercial, or experimental flight applications.  Particular emphasis will be placed on inserting the IBIS in a flight experiment quickly, possibly as part of the MATRS experiment which already plans to fly DRT hardware.    BENEFIT:  An IBIS array that implements high-efficiency, thin-film solar cells offers several advantages over traditional triple junction, rigid substrate arrays.  The flexible nature of the IBIS and its reduced thickness allow it to be stowed in a low volume.  This feature along with the higher mass-specific power of the IBIS allows more power to be launched with a satellite than has ever been possible previously.  Further, the continuous covershield allows the use of higher voltages which can in turn reduce gauge and weight of the wire harness.  The laminated approach to the manufacture of the IBIS lends itself to lower manufacturing costs.  This and the automation that is possible with novel interconnect approaches both reduce cost and improve reliability.  Overall, the cost of the IBIS is likely to be lower than that of a traditional array.    These features make the IBIS highly desirable for high-power missions that would not have previously considered a planar solar array.  Such missions include DARPA FAST, Boeing HPSA, and MDA STSS.  Additional applications include those with a high premium on mass such as UAVs or high-altitude airships.",

        "abstract": "Cyberwar is here. The information landscape is becoming as important as the physical world for commercial, social, and military applications. Being able to detect and monitor a cyberattack is necessary to defend our assets. Being able to respond to a cyberattack has additional merit. OR Concepts Applied (ORCA) proposes to develop Argos, innovative software that supports command and control of cyberspace operations for both defensive and offensive applications. We propose to develop a suite of tools to provide commanders and operators with cyber situation awareness (SA) and mechanisms to manage cyberspace assets. A key part of Argos is the attention devoted to visualization that enhances SA. In addition to the Argos tools themselves, there will also be a simulation environment that will support human factors testing and user interface optimization. As the USAF gears up for cyberwar, it is essential that we create tools that will help us field the most effective systems for cyber operations.  BENEFIT:  Technology, commerce, military operations, and even social interactions depend more and more on cyberspace, the world''s Internet infrastructure. Argos software for cyberspace visualization will benefit governments, businesses, and individuals. Defensive tools can foil cyberattacks and prevent adverse impacts. Thus there are significant opportunities for commercialization.

        "abstract": "Contemporary tactical missiles use Global Positioning Systems (GPS) as an economical means of self-localization and target location identification, but GPS signals are subject to jamming and intermittent unavailability. When a missile loses its ability to reliably self-locate, its strike capability is compromised. Traditional methods have compensated by adding another navigation system, such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU), or TERCOM, but each of these systems is subject to limitations (e.g. an IMU drifts over time and TERCOM uses active radar sensing, compromising covertness). In our prior Phase I effort, we assessed the feasibility of a system called Continuous Optical Mapping for Munitions Using Terrain Elevation and Reconstruction, or COMMUTER, that can estimate the geo-location and orientation of an air vehicle in real time given an onboard library of shape-based landmark features, and a real-time stream of images from an onboard camera. The system uses an onboard processor and data storage, but does not require GPS, active sensing, or any prior information about the expected flight path. In this Phase II proposal, we outline how our approach will be refined and expanded into a full scope prototype that is robust and effective under a full range of operating conditions and scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Silicon Space Technology (SST) working with Texas Instruments (TI) proposes to demonstrate a 90nm low-power radiation-hardened (RH) metal-programmable system-on-a-chip (SOC) cell library. This will be accomplished by defining, designing, simulating and laying out a demonstration circuit that could eventually be turned into a commercial product. A base slice will be developed upon which the demonstration circuit can be fabricated. The elements of the cell library will be designed using the Texas Instruments\u2019 C027 90nm commercial process augmented by Silicon Space Technology\u2019s Harden-By-Isolation (HBI) techniques.  Many customers would find SST\u2019s 90nm low-power radiation-hardened (RH) metal\u00ac-programmable SOC cell library design approach very appealing as compared to custom ASIC or FPGA alternatives due to improved costs and/or performance.  Because the silicon is fabricated by Texas Instruments, one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world, there would be additional benefits associated with a reliable supplier providing state-of-the-art defect density and circuit yields. Due to the $750K Phase II limit and the high cost of 90nm processing, it will not be possible to produce prototypes \u2013 therefore only the design of the demonstration circuit will be completed.  BENEFIT:  Benefits: Space system designers who need high performance application specific integrated circuits (ASIC\u2019s) currently have two choices: full custom design using a Harden-By-Design (HBD) standard cell library or a hardened FPGA. A space-qualified 90nm low-power radiation-hardened (RH) metal-programmable system-on-a-chip (SOC) cell library would give designers a third option that would outperform the other two in many ways.  Improvements over HBD standard cell library The problem with any standard cell library design is the high NRE associated with the design effort. This design method requires a full set of masks to fabricate the circuit. At the 90nm technology node, this can cost almost $1 Million. The silicon wafers for this type of design must start at the beginning of the manufacturing process, adding weeks to the fabrication schedule. A metal programmable cell library design requires only one third of the masks to be generated, thus saving much of this cost. The silicon is pre-fabricated through two thirds of the process, so the cycle time to obtain functioning circuits is much lower. To ensure radiation hardness a HBD cell library must be used. When using these cell libraries there is a typical penalty of 2X the power, speed, and area over commercial cell libraries. Because SST\u2019s low-power radiation-hardened (RH) metal-programmable SOC cell library uses our proprietary HBI hardening techniques, designers are able to obtain the same performance as with commercial cell libraries. The design risk is also reduced because, with the metal programmable approach, the underlying designs are pre-verified. The base layers can be used with multiple designs, reducing inventory costs and production lead times. There would be lower design complexity with this approach. The customer has only to work with routing of the base fabric.  There is no requirement for understanding the lower levels.  The design of the unit cell, or fabric, in the base layers will be designed specifically to the requirements of low power and for frequent use of spatially redundant storage cells. Improvements over FPGA\u2019s FPGA\u2019s can be a very attractive solution for designers due to the capability to reprogram the circuit if needed. However there are several serious issues with FPGA\u2019s. FPGA\u2019s typically use five times the power of standard ASICs. Speed is also an issue with FPGA\u2019s. The metal programmable approach would have the power, speed, and capacity similar to Standard Cell ASICs, consuming 1/5 the power of an FPGA and more capacity. There would be substantial benefits to the customer by large reductions in power over FPGA designs. The lower power requirements would provide additional benefits at the system level for power supply design and thermal management. According to an FPGA Project Survey by FPGS and Programmable Logic Journal, the most painful and difficult problem for FPGA design teams is getting timing closure on their design. The timing closure process generally involves multiple iterations of RTL modification, constraint specification, synthesis, and place-and-route. On large devices, one pass through this cycle can take more than 24 hours, and some teams are experiencing as many as 50-60 iterations before their design converges. The metal programmable design would provide timing closure similar to Standard Cell ASICs.   SST\u2019s proposed low-power radiation-hardened (RH) metal-programmable SOC cell library would also provide a much higher level of radiation tolerance than is available for FPGA\u2019s. FPGA\u2019s for the space community use HBD techniques with the penalties described above. These penalties in speed, power and size are avoided by SST\u2019s HBI technology. Summary of Opportunity With the advantages outlined above many customers would find SST\u2019s 90nm low-power radiation-hardened (RH) metal-programmable SOC cell library design approach very appealing. Because the silicon is fabricated by Texas Instruments, one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world, there would be additional benefits associated with a reliable supplier providing state-of-the-art defect density and circuit yields.",

        "abstract": "3 Sigma Research proposes to develop and implement an innovative prototype and demonstrate a suite of tools to assist with the automated creation of security classification guides and application of the guide in classifying information.  Building on the research from the Phase I Ontology-based Security Classification Guide Investigation (OSCG-I), the prototype will show that a robust and accurate ontological approach can indeed overcome the complex issues related to this problem, and instead become an opportunity.  Phase I focused on two areas of feasibility, 1) development of approaches for specifying a formal ontological open standard for the information contained in a security classification guide (SCG), including security classification rules, and validating the consistency whether a single, or multiple, ontology-based SCGs apply to a given situation, and 2) tools to facilitate and automate creation of SCG and the inherent security classification rules.  Phase II will focus on building an enhanced prototype suite of tools to demonstrate the benefits of automated SCG creation and maintenance to provide more rapid and agile responses to dynamic environments.  BENEFIT:  Our advantage over existing methods is that OSCG assists users in the creation, maintenance, and application of security classification management through the entire SCG lifecycle. This will result in increased efficiency, lower cost, and most importantly increased security. Since the ontology captures the relationships among the SCG component items, the OSCG system automatically checks for consistency within the SCG by capturing SCG components using a formally defined and verifiable ontology. Another advantage to our approach is reusability. Many SCGs have relationships and references that are similar within a hierarchy of security regulations. Our approach, further developed in Phase II, allows existing security classification regulations and documents to be easily incorporated into new SCGs. This reuse capability, along with consistency validation, will help ensure that existing and validated regulations are incorporated and propagated correctly during the SCG lifecycle.  We can envision this approach as a strong complement to cross-domain solutions.  Above any other benefit is that, wherever warfighters are, secure information at the right level of detail and appropriately accessed or disseminated can greatly increase the efficiency of their activities.",

        "abstract": "ATEI\u2019s unique partnership with the University of Minnesota plans to exploits applied and fundamental research, respectively, to achieve unprecedented levels of integration for highly complex RF microwave, mm-wave and analog/digital/mixed-signal modules using Silicon Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology to support emerging DoD-critical applications such as wafer-scale phase array mono-static radars, bi-static radars, MIMO radars, direction finding (DF) signals intelligence(SIGINT), UAV Sense and avoid systems, RF seekers, Forward and side-looking fuse, low visibility precision landing sensor, highly-integrated electronic warfare systems, or compact sensing systems. In Phase I, ATEI and the University of Minnesota focused efforts on application research to establish key performance parameters such as phase noise, phase shifter resolution/accuracy, linear dynamic range, channel isolation, etc. and analyze the feasibility of the proposed integration scheme and RF/mixed signal circuits that will result in revolutionary capabilities or superior performance which cannot be achieved by current III-V technologies.  Simulation and/or basic experiments, expected RF performance, integration level (RF and digital transistor counts), and required integration technologies (3D integration, etc.) of the proposed circuits was presented and discussed including proposed realistic fabrication technologies or necessary technology developments to realize the target RF/mixed signal circuits for the next phases. The results from our research proved the feasibility that highly integrated Si-based RF electronics and infrastructure to can be deployed in small form factor, low power and with superior capability and performance than modern phased-array and other traditional radars. In Phase II, ATEI and the University of Minnesota will design and test Silicon CMOS prototypes which would enable the realization of large-element or wafer scale MIMO radar. The principal blocks would involve the RF front-end for the receiver, the transmitter\u2019s RF section and the MIMO DSP. The linearity of the RF blocks (especially those of the front-end) plays a critical role in determining the capacity of multi-target detection and resolution \u2013 the end-metric for any radar. The end-product of this work would be a single-chip CMOS design consisting of separate transmits and receive sections, each consisting of their respective RF and baseband sub-sections. Eventually, there has to be a central DSP which would run the MIMO algorithm on all the accumulated data, but some level of DSP, which can be done at the individual element level (like out-of-band filtering) would be integrated into the single CMOS chip. In phase II, digital-to-analog and analog-to digital conversions will be performed off-chip using test equipment. IF / baseband transmit waveforms and receive signal processing will be performed using a combination of algorithms develop in MATLAB and SIMULINK.",

        "abstract": "Compact, high-speed, and multi-functional optical transmitters are needed for inter-satellite and on board communication systems. Multiplex, Inc., University of California \u2013 San Diego, and Lockheed Martin propose to develop ultra high speed (> 40Gb/s) optical transmitters with high output power (> 13dBm) by monolithically integrating a laser, electro-absorption modulator and a semiconductor optical amplifier on InP chips, producing ultra compact transmitter assemblies capable of fast wavelength tuning in the 1550-nm band. Innovative laser and expanded-mode waveguide modulator will also be designed for integration on the optical chip with potential growth path to even higher bandwidth and power for space communications. The successful development of the optical transmitter will impact future DoD inter-satellite and on board communication links and stimulate commercial applications by demonstrating innovative and manufacturable technologies for components and subsystems.  BENEFIT:  This device will produce a high bandwidth, compact optical transmitter as an eventual replacement for the externally modulated transmitters now planned for communications between and within spacecraft/aircraft in many next generation military systems (e.g.TSAT/ AEHF/Gapfiller/Space-Based-Radar/Military-Support-Programs/F35). While near term requirements are below 10 Gb/s, growth to over 40 Gb/s to support imaging payloads is very likely. It also will provide a growth path to even higher bandwidths and the more compact and economic components that will eventually be needed as the number of links grow.  Nearer term application for this transmitter can also be found in on-board military space and airborne communications and Special Programs applications.  Therefore this device will enable compact optical RF signal distribution and signal processing with dramatically lower size, weight and power (SWaP) and improved agility.  Eventual commercial space communications applications are also likely.",

Software-based systems, both distributed and embedded, have reached the point where overall complexities radically increase the chance of defects and jeopardize run-time goals of dependability and performance.  Concurrent with these challenges is the pervasive effort to drive mission costs lower while maintaining acceptable levels of quality and reliability in deployed mission software.  Model Based Engineering (MBE) is seeing increasing use as a technique for representing and managing the designs of large, complex systems.   In this project, WWTG would provide new and valuable solutions for automating activities involving the analysis of design information captured in a standards based language such as UML with the following capabilities:  (1)  Tool-assisted evaluation and interpretation of meta-model information for identifying required analysis information, (2) an approach for import and translation of standards-based model information into a common environment that allows for tool-facilitated management and viewpoint-based manipulation, and (3) performance analysis algorithms integrated with the common tool platform that provide value-added evaluation of the design information from the standpoints of schedulability, performance, and resource utilization/needs.     BENEFIT:  The WW Technology Group (WWTG) is developing a collection of engineering tool capabilities that bridge the gap between model based designs and analysis capabilities.  WWTG has developed a tool platform called EDICT, which has shown remarkable promise as an MBE tool platform.  Under this SBIR program, WWTG would position the Air Force to continue to leverage and build upon our successful tool development efforts to provide new and valuable solutions for automating activities involving the analysis of design information captured in a standards based language such as UML.  Furthermore, WWTG\u2019s EDICT tool offers the Air Force an ideal platform for hosting performance and schedulability analysis algorithms, techniques and visualizations. Our approach contains many benefits when employed on complex systems that address system performance, dependability, safety and life cycle cost. The key benefit that our technology provides is reduced engineering development and system certification costs while maintaining high levels of system performance, reliability and safety. Through improved integration of design and analysis of system architectural models, drivers in the system design process are exposed and can be actively considered along with other traditional design trade-offs. This leads to more cost effective initial designs and upgrades of existing systems. The integration of attributes for performance, dependability and safety provide additional benefits; enabling early detection of reliability issues or potential safety violations, which in turn leads to deployed systems that are more robust and have lower cost due to elimination of expensive rework late in the development cycle.",

CLAD addresses three key challenges in maintaining secure access of documents: 1) ensuring that all documents are properly labeled according to the most current guidelines, 2) providing a security classification level for a collection of documents, for which the aggregation of information could result in a higher classification level than any of the individual documents, and 3) preventing unauthorized visibility of a collection of documents when the collection\u2019s aggregated classification exceeds the user\u2019s credentials or system\u2019s certification and accreditation.  CLAD provides a secure web service to ensure that all data passing through it is clad with appropriate labels or routed to another service to gather appropriate labeling so that the most accurate classification is maintained. CLAD balances the need to quickly and securely disseminate information to those with need-to-know based on credentials, and without leaking sensitive data. This ultimately supports the goal of allowing the analysts to discover and retrieve as much information as needed to perform their jobs efficiently and effectively, without compromising individual and national security.    BENEFIT:  CLAD provides two substantial improvements to the current methodology for marking and classifying documents \u2013 an automated label completion verifier and an automated aggregation classifier.  Having these two components as an automated tool enables a more uniform implementation of markings and classifications, a more efficient determination of errors, and a decrease in costs.  CLAD provides assurance that all data passing to the user is clad with appropriate labels, and provides automated detection of situations when the combination of information in documents causes the aggregation\u2019s security classification to increase beyond that of any individual document in the collection.  The CLAD functionality is carried out via a secure web service capable of scaling into an enterprise environment, and allows analysts access to as much information as possible without violation of security requirements on classified data, so they may perform their missions efficiently and effectively.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used by the military to gather Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) information in warfare environments.  Of particular interest is the tracking of multiple targets for global situational awareness. To accomplish this mission, UAVs can be equipped with a myriad of different types of sensors which can be combined in complementary ways for increased tracking performance. It is critical to get the right combination of sensors at the right location(s) at the right time, and to do so in a complex environment of targets, friendly forces, and air vehicles. To achieve this capability Aurora is proposing to pursue the work accomplished during Phase I and develop a prototype software package embodying the core algorithms enabling collaborative multi-target tracking, and validate this prototype in realistic hardware-in-the-loop simulations and flight-test demonstrations. For this purpose Aurora will continue to work with MIT to further increase the capabilities and performance of the system, finalizing the core technologies, and leverage the team\u2019s considerable infrastructure for multi-vehicle testing, developed over the past 4 years, to successfully validate and demonstrate the system\u2019s performance. Aurora\u2019s work to date on multi-vehicle coordination puts it in a unique position to reach this goal.  BENEFIT:  Military planners across all the services have identified the need for technologies that provide 1) real-time or near-real time automated sensing and understanding of the battle space using multiple distributed unmanned platforms; 2) autonomous platform and surveillance tasking to recognize and identify threats and hold them at risk; 3) integration of disparate autonomous capabilities; and 4) implementation of these in an open, non-proprietary architecture.  Aurora\u2019s tools will directly address these needs.  By virtue of its place in the military UAS market,  Aurora is motivated to provide open and extensible tools that can be integrated as third-party software or hardware components onto a broad range of UAVs; this perspective, as well as Aurora\u2019s ongoing commitment to the military standards and common-control development efforts, will benefit the Air Force as well as other military UAS end-users, providing them with cross-platform collaboration, path planning, and sensor fusion tools for team situations.  Commercial applications will emerge as well, as UAVs become more accepted for civilian use, and include fire reconnaissance and fire-fighting support, search and rescue, and homeland security.  All of these applications will benefit from efficient use of resources and intelligent fusion of sensor measurements.",

Specifically, we propose to develop and pursue an ontology-driven approach to information extraction.  We will use a formal ontology capturing concepts of interest not only to facilitate the exploitation of extraction results in a larger forensic analysis system, but also to drive the development of the primitive language resources and pattern recognizers that provide those extractions services at the lowest level.  A formal standards compliant ontology facilitates communication between developers and other stakeholders and can serve as a specification for new language resources required by the SIGACT domain.  This makes it easier for users to understand and evaluate the system, makes the results more useful to downstream applications, and facilitates the integration of the IE engine into a service oriented application environment.  The focus will be on the characterization and extraction of events and relationships of interest, as these establish connections between entities and so allow link visualization tools to be used for forensic analysis, highlighting paths to new items of potentially related data for the analyst''s review.

        "abstract": "The military, government, and commercial enterprises are all vulnerable to the crime of cyber attack.  Digital forensics is the science of investigating digital devices, transmissions, and storage media to acquire and analyze evidence related to an incident or crime with the goal of providing solid information to assist decision makers in an organization, military, or legal context.  The discipline is essential in addressing rising cyber crime rates, and acting as a deterrent to insider threats by providing attribution.  There is need for advanced training capabilities to help students rapidly acquire the specialized skills needed to perform digital forensics investigations.   Didactic instruction, abstract visualization, and simulation exercises are three powerful pedagogic techniques for knowledge transfer.  ATC-NY will combine these three technologies to create Alcuin, an automated, online system for training rapid digital forensics.  Alcuin will deliver remote learning content by seamlessly integrating both declarative and procedural teaching methods.   ATC-NY has assembled a team of leading forensics, visualization, simulation, and learning experts to develop Alcuin based on the successful proof of concept demonstrated in Phase I.  Alcuin\u2019s unique capabilities will greatly advance the state of the art in e-learning solutions.   BENEFIT:  Alcuin\u2019s incorporation of multiple learning strategies will improve skill acquisition and retention.  Its online availability and automated evaluation capabilities will allow for anytime, anywhere training, greatly reducing training costs and instructor workload.  Currently there is no comparable solution available at any price.  The market for cyber training is rapidly expanding in all sectors due to the inability to maintain a sufficiently large, qualified work force capable of responding to the increasing rates of cyber attack.",

        "abstract": "Increasing the power density of current jet aircraft engines requires the replacement of conventional high temperature materials by new materials capable of operating at higher temperatures. Ceramics and ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) represent excellent candidates for increased use in hot engine parts due to their ability to withstand temperatures in excess of 2000 C. Due to the complexity of the manufacturing CMCs, limited guidelines exist that can readily transfer between different components. Consequently experimental approaches are needed to develop detailed manufacturing procedures. The extensive development time and budget needed for this approach can be significantly reduced if predictive design tools for the RMI process were available. This work will develop analytical tools to analyze the multiple interdependent physical phenomena of relevance for the manufacture of CMCs. The analyses will be integrated into a design tool capable of providing engineers with an environment to analyze the CMC manufacturing process thus reducing the need for iterative experimental approaches. Consequently, the costs associated with manufacturing critical CMC components will be dramatically reduced and provide engines with improved thrust and fuel efficiency while reducing emissions.   BENEFIT:  With this tool, designers of turbine components will reduce cycle time, increase part yield, and better define the process window for CMC manufacturing thereby increasing the use of CMCs. Increased use of CMCs in hot engine parts will improve thrust and fuel efficiency while reducing emissions. Additional benefits will include reduced cooling requirements, simplified component design and reduced weight of the supporting structure.",

Semi-active strap-down seekers in tactical weapons offer improved reliability, reduced weight, and lower cost. However, combining wide field of regards with high angular discrimination is more difficult in strap-down seekers than in traditional gimbaled seekers, due to loss of signal to noise ratio. The proposed WAOS3 is based on an innovative optical system that allows for high resolution in the narrow IFOV such as 6 to 8 degrees, combined with lower-resolution guidance signals in the wide FOR such as 40 degrees or more, effective in the presence of strong solar background. The unique benefits of the proposed solution provide an opportunity to create a new class of strap-down seeker optics with high-resolution, narrow IFOV and wide FOR required by the Army. Phase I has established feasibility of the WAOS3 concept. In Phase II, a functional pre-production WAOS3 prototype will be developed, demonstrated, tested, and delivered to the Army for evaluation and use.

        "abstract": "This effort\u2019s objective is developing algorithms that detect, isolate, and track individual scatterer returns in target clutter.  The innovative signal processing algorithms proposed include novel tracking approaches, furthering a phase-sensitive range-compression method that provides sub-wavelength spatial resolution, exploiting the separation provided by Doppler processing for tracking separate scatterers, and advancing statistical analyses for sidelobe rejection and a better understanding of system sensitivities. This work will address four technical areas.  A brief description of each follows.  (1) We will build on existing algorithms that isolate, detect, and track individual scatterers.  This involves methods for estimating scatterer amplitude densities online, refining track termination models, and modeling scatterer phase.  (2) We will improve our phase-sensitive method for scatterer tracking that provides sub-wavelength accuracy.  We will investigate methods for reducing or eliminating discrete errors that characterize this method.  (3) We will exploit the signal separation offered by Doppler processing.  While range compression offers some signal isolation due to the different ranges of individual scatterers, Doppler offers much more scatterer separation.  (4) We will perform advanced statistical analyses, further isolating returns from individual scatterers via a sidelobe rejection method, describing the efficacy of the scatterer tracking process for target shape estimation.   BENEFIT:  At the completion of this effort, the proposed technologies will provide an algorithm suite for estimation of target size, shape, and motion.  The algorithms apply in many commercial applications, including border protection, airport security, traffic analysis, and commercial security.  In particular, DHS, the FAA, other government agencies, and commercial entities routinely need to analyze all traffic passing through a particular area.  Furthermore, policing applications often require certain hot-spots to be intensely monitored for identifying unauthorized traffic, particularly in situations poorly equipped for traditional EO techniques (e.g., nighttime and poor weather conditions).",

This SBIR proposal will extend the advantages of EMA technology into high-temperature, high-vibration applications with a first commercialization target being the JSF F35 Lightning II aircraft platform. During the SBIR Phase I research, PCKA collaborated with NAVAIR and Lockheed Martin to establish the actuator requirements, identified a suitable actuator architecture for the application, and optimized the design in terms of weight, reliability, maintainability, manufacturability, and cost. Key design constraints included the thermal and vibration environment that drove the use of specific motor technologies, high-temperature wire insulation, lubrication, and electronics. In Phase II, PCKA will fabricate a prototype of the optimal design and perform functional and qualification tests. If successful, developed technologies will ultimately transition to DoD programs under a Phase III contract.",

        "abstract": "Q fever, caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii, presents with acute symptoms indistinguishable from many other blood infections. Chronic infection, more frequently developing in immunocompromised individuals, presents a high mortality rate (up to 60% of chronic cases) and often requires open-heart surgery to repair substantial valve damage. Q fever can be airborne or tick-borne and is a significant detriment in deployment conditions. It is important to diagnose Q-fever during its acute phase to direct appropriate treatment and identify personnel requiring follow-up monitoring for chronic disease. While serology tests have been commercialized for Q fever detection, it is necessary to test both IgG and IgM against two types of C. burnetii antigens to differentiate between acute and chronic disease stages. Additionally, a high false positive rate occurs for these assays, and the antibody response is difficult to detect early in infection. To eliminate these shortcomings, Agave BioSystems proposed to integrate a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction built into a point-of-care field diagnostic device. To date, we have been highly successful with the implementation of a breadboard device for real time readings and expect to continue the development of a hand-held, fully-enclosed device, capable of providing early detection of acute phase Q-Fever.",

Our approach is a combination of an advanced trench index cladding fiber design that prevents light leaking-out in tight-bend and ruggedized multi-layer carbon/polyimide coatings that is most effective against harsh environment. This new fiber has salient attributes that is 100 times lower in bending loss than current fibers, little distortion to Gigabit Ethernet Standard data transmission, can be spliced and butt connected to conventional fibers with little loss, can withstand extreme fatigue and stress corrosion factor, and is amendable to mass production. In the Phase-I program, we have successfully demonstrated the feasibility by producing several runes of prototype fiber samples with drastically reduced bending loss as well as little transmission loss. In this Phase II program, we will further optimize the fiber cladding profile, protection coatings, and production process to reach pre-production level. Moreover, we will perform all the reliability and durability tests per aerospace and mil-spec standards. Fully qualified fiber samples will be delivered to the Navy for field test and evaluation.",

The fully developed SPHMS during Phase II effort will: have predictive prognostic models combining the individual component/subsystem (such as electro optics, refrigeration and heat rejection system, gimbal, electronics, reaction wheels, etc.) and their interactions, identify degradation modes and possible failure mechanisms, and impact of uncertainties in the variables controlling the payload performance and reliability.  The proposed SPHMS shall be fully capable of assessing the payload performance reliability, the potential for near term failure, predicting reliable remaining useful life and identify questionable component/subsystem operating characteristics in a logical physics-based manner based on a detailed understanding of the various failure modes / performance degradation mechanisms present. The proposed SPHMS will utilize data accumulated during the life, past performance test data of other similar spacecrafts and highly adaptable ground based simulation to achieve space situational awareness and mission success. This integrated package development will be such that it can be integrated in to a higher level complex system seamlessly.   BENEFIT:  The ability to accurately identify the target and track its movement in order to have situational awareness is primarily dependent on the payload performance of the satellite system.  Reliability based prognostic health management lends significant benefits from the viewpoint of insuring that mission critical functions can be carried out with a high probability of success. In addition, the proposed evaluation system will allow identification of questionable components, subsystems and its operating characteristics in a logical manner based on a detailed physics-based understanding of various failure modes and performance degradation mechanisms. This will allow an informed decision to be made on how to overcome the weakness of a degrading component/system by using the strength of healthy components/system and empower the satellite self awareness.  It also, enables making decisions on how reliable the target identification and tracking of the system is. Integrated physics-based upward compatible SPHMS provides easy integration in to the larger as well as a cluster or constellation of payload systems (distributed network sensing).  It enables the payload designer to use the optimum capability of each individual constituent component and determine the design payload for a desired reliability.  The above will lead to a minimization in the number missions that must be terminated due to failure of the critical component, along with managing the resources in a cost effective manner. Over and above this, the cost of all the desired and designed missions shall be reduced due to (i) knowledge of degradation mechanisms, (ii) optimally using the component and subsystem\u2019s reliable capacity, (iii) reduction in payload system design and hardware cost as well as training costs, (iv) reduction in rates of false identification and tracking and thereby achieving high performance reliability, (v) safely decommissioning the mission.  Overall the greatest benefit will be the confidence in the missions and targeted objectives.",

While the original design allowed for flow of 115\u00c2\u00b0C coolant between the layers making up the module stack, Phase-I testing demonstrated that the high-temperature capability and low ESR of the NBT capacitor enables operation at 150\u00c2\u00b0C ambient without forced cooling. The NBT dielectric, Type H, was selected for this application because of its very low combined temperature and voltage coefficient which gives rise to a net capacitance change < 20% across the band from -40\u00c2\u00b0C to +200\u00c2\u00b0C at full voltage stress. In Phase II, minor variations on the formulation will be investigated to increase dielectric constant and reduce component size, and sintering studies including nano-processing techniques are introduced to reduce intrinsic flaw size, raise breakdown strength and lower the sintering temperature to enable the use of cheaper electrodes. DC HALT studies will be conducted and a novel 60-kHz life/screening test developed to ensure reliability.",

In Phase II, we will demonstrate the complete thermal management/cooling system in an integrated antenna package that is adaptable to meet present and future military electronics cooling needs.",

        "abstract": "Robust altitude estimation for over-the-horizon radar (OTHR) requires a combination of advanced signal processing and high fidelity ionospheric propagation modeling. Since aircraft height is manifested in closely-spaced direct and ground-bounce reflections off the target, during Phase I, we have developed two new approaches for discriminating small delay differences from a sequence of radar dwells. Both methods exploit wideband frequency-hopped illumination. The first performs maximum a posteriori probability altitude estimation by modeling the frequency-selective fading of the target amplitude-range-Doppler peak.  In the second approach, multiband chirp synthesis is used to stitch together dwells so as to resolve small multipath delay differences using a larger effective bandwidth signal.  A robust maximum likelihood approach is then applied to map these delay differences to aircraft altitude. In Phase II of this project, we propose to evaluate these methods using operationally-relevant performance metrics and high fidelity ionospheric propagation models which include both ordinary and extraordinary raypaths.  In order to study the robustness of our methods, we will also perform Monte Carlo analyses under realistic model mismatch conditions.  Finally, existing real OTHR data sets will be identified and a detailed experimental plan will be generated for subsequent full-scale evaluation using a dedicated aircraft.  BENEFIT:  The development of robust altitude estimation for over-the-horizon (OTH) HF radar would represent a major breakthrough in wide area air surveillance.  In addition, we foresee scaling of these techniques to several small-system commercial scenarios.  An example is a family of hardware and software modules for a Wide-Area Wi-Fi Radar Intruder Detection System.",

        "abstract": "In today\u2019s Urban-Warfare Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) environment, current sensor platforms have a limited operational capability due to power consumption and recharge times. Many times these sensor packages are found to be unsuitable for many battlefield environments due strictly to their endurance limitations. Much of the research done to date has concentrated on minimizing the size/power consumption of these sensor platforms (ground-based and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)) in order to minimize the battery power required to complete a mission.  There is now another possible solution, the development of a unique and innovative power system that will enable sensor platforms to provide long-endurance 24/7 operation to support non-traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (NTISR).  DRA is developing a power harvesting technique that utilizes existing overhead power lines to supply unlimited power to ground-based sensors platforms, as well as providing a self-refueling capability for a new class of UAS that will allow unlimited operational time with little to no \u201creturn-to-base\u201d cycles required for refueling.  With this innovative approach, these new platforms will be able to perform C2ISR-type missions with virtually unlimited persistence.  BENEFIT:  Persistent ISR has been identified numerous times as an area of critical importance to the Department of Defense (DOD) and other organizations.  Development of sensor platforms that can supply extreme endurance through an autonomous recharging capability would be marketable to the DOD, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and to various commercial sectors.  These platforms could be used in urban warfare, law enforcement, security in remote areas, immigration control, power line/pipeline maintenance, as well as for many other applications.   The development of the Phase II prototypes will provide an opportunity to demonstrate representative power harvesting sensor platforms that are capable of performing NTISR for a nearly indefinite period of time in the field.  The engineering aspects and results will be transferable to a future phase of ground-based platform developments as well as UAS sensor system developments that contain fully autonomous power line sensing and landing capability.  Autonomous operation of a UAS sensor platform could be transitioned into many possible commercial sectors and military programs. A few of the commercial applications that would benefit from a sustained surveillance presence include border patrol, Agriculture, Merchant Marine & Shipping, Entertainment/News/Media applications, Railway/Pipeline/Power line monitoring, Commercial/business security, Aerial Surveying, and Search and Rescue Support.",

        "abstract": "The Department of Defense has expressed the need for unmanned aerial systems (UASs) that can perform intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and laser target identification & designation missions.  This system should integrate into existing communication and data-link networks.  NexGen Aircraft Corporation developed tactical-class UAS capable of carrying a 15 lb ISR/directed energy (DE) payload for up to 24 hours to bridge the capability cap of existing UASs.  A light-weight, high-aspect ratio, highly-optimized aircraft constructed using rapid prototyping methods can achieve a system cost goal of $50,000. The DE payload will include laser target identification and designation.  The aircraft will be launched using either a trolley or a pneumatic launcher and recovered via a parachute.  This system will employ advanced autopilot and navigation systems to be simple enough for a non-pilot operator to control.  It will be capable of having vehicle and payload control transferred to a forward operating team.   It will use commercial-off-the-shelf electronic components to minimize the system\u2019s cost and ensure seamless integration into existing networks.  Phase II will demonstrate the system\u2019s capability as it is manufactured and flight tested.  BENEFIT:  The purpose of this engineering development is to produce a tactical-class UAS available at a cost of $50,000 or less.  This vehicle will have an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) mission with a 24 hour maximum endurance.  This system will have a directed energy (DE) payload capable of laser target identification and designation.  In addition to being inexpensive, non-pilot operators will be capable of using this system with minimal training.  This system will then be used to operate existing and flight test future military and civilian payloads due to its flexible plug and play design. On the battlefield, this system will offer combat commanders (COCOMs) significant mission capability including persistent ISR, precision target location and designation, base protection, battle damage assessment, and battle management.  This system is capable of being launched from safe zones and flying behind enemy lines to allow forward operating troops to control the vehicle to have real-time intelligence and precision targeting capabilities.  This system will provide the military additional capabilities allowing the military to become more efficient and effective while reducing the risk of casualties. The system design and technology integration will offer the DoD and commercial organizations the capability of theater-class UASs with the simple logistics and cost of small-class UASs.",

In Phase I, Agave BioSystems proposed to develop an accurate and efficient cell-based biosensor using engineered yeast to rapidly evaluate toxicity in drinking water.

        "abstract": "The Department of Defense and NASA are developing high power electric thrusters having high specific impulse for satellite station keeping and long, deep space flights. Light weight, spaceflight-capable power supplies are needed for these thrusters, but their development has lagged. The challenges are that the thruster power supply must have high efficiency, be thermally managed under extreme temperature ranges, must be operational for long periods of time, and must be hardened for high radiation. The Air Force desires a thruster power supply of 10 kW with a weight of less than 3 kg/kW, and efficiency over 94%. In Phase I, DTI developed and evaluated a new power supply design based upon DTI\u2019s multi-phase buck regulator technology. This fault-tolerant power supply is substantially more efficient, lighter, and reliable than existing designs. In Phase II, DTI will refine the design developed in Phase I, and build a prototype unit for delivery to the Air Force to provide at least 10 kW of power, at high efficiency, and at significantly reduced size and weight. We will also begin qualifying the design to support future space missions in Phase III.  BENEFIT:  There are two classes of benefits from this proposed effort. The first, is the ability to build lighter, smaller, higher power supplies for spacecraft electric thrusters. Future spaceflights and satellite mission-keeping opoerations will be significantly enhanced by the fielding of these thrusters, which require the power converter developed in this SBIR. Second, the substantial increase in hybrid and bttery power systems throughout the industrial, automotive, and commercial markets opens a major opportunity for power converters capable of transforming low voltage power into higher voltages to drive motors and transmitter that operate at hundreds or thousands of volts, rather than the tens of volts provided by most battery systems. Compact, efficient, and reliable converters offer an ideal means to address these growing classes of applications.",

The board will be on a commercial VPX (Vita-46) 6U standard.  The processor chip used on the board is a multi-core processor, with 49 identical processing cores, 4 banks of DDR2 memory, and 4 XAUI 10Gb interfaces.  The VPX standard supports interfaces up to 40Gbps.  The processor board will be designed as a prototype software development station for use by the MAESTRO community.  The development includes an initial board support package, hardware and software documentation and porting of a software application from the phase I SBIR for validation of throughput.  BENEFIT:  The MAESTRO board has a number of applications, both terrestrial and space based. The initial prototype board will be used as a software development station for algorithmic development.  The prototype board can be used as a verification vehicle for radiation testing and characterization of the MAESTRO processor itself. The board uses a powerful multi-core processor that has been developed using rad-hard by design libraries, and can be spun into a flight version for space applications.",

        "abstract": "Recently, modern tactical warfare has relied more and more heavily on technologies requiring radio frequency (RF) capabilities. For applications ranging from networking functions (like peer-to-peer and satellite communications) to individual capabilities (like electronic warfare and signals intelligence), a common impetus is to extend broadband functionality to expand system performance. As the operational spectra of these functions have grown \u00e2\u20ac\u201c often to overlapping bands, there has been a corresponding increase in the difficulty of using these functions simultaneously. However, because they function independently, there are usually no interoperability or compatibility considerations made for the various functions used aboard modern US military ground platforms. Furthermore, there is often no way to be sure of interoperability and compatibility on a particular platform configuration without extensive testing. Accordingly, this effort strives to generate isolation techniques that provide platform independence, require no calibration, provide efficient performance over the entire 20-8000 MHz spectrum, and do not rely on expensive, unreliable, or frequency-dependent components. During Phase I, FIRST RF demonstrated techniques that achieved 20 to 65dB of isolation improvement compared to legacy techniques. During Phase II, FIRST RF will leverage this work to provide improvements in bandwidth, isolation, and robustness.",

III-Nitrides have a large band gap and band offset that has generated recent interest for the  realization of short wavelength (1.55 um) telecommunications lasers.  However, in addition to the large band offset that makes short wavelengths possible, III-Nitrides are also characterized by a very large phonon energy (90-meV).  This makes them ideally suited to the realization of near room temperature operating THz lasers.  The goal is to target this THz wavelength, with device design pursuing emission in the 30 - 300 \u00b5m range (approximately 10 to 1 THz).  This group has already demonstrated itself in the areas of III-Nitride inter-band devices and InP-based intersubband based quantum cascade lasers. Phase I leveraged these two areas of expertise to demonstrate the potential to realize effective THz lasers operating at near room temperature.  In Phase II we will complete the development and fabricate working MOCVD grown, electrical injection, THz quantum cascade lasers that operate at or above room temperature (> 300 K).",

        "abstract": "The Army has a clear need for a small mobile robot capable of accompanying a single soldier. Such a robot would help solve both logistical problems of individual soldiers needing to transport more equipment and supplies than they can carry in a backpack, and tactical problems of scouting unsafe areas. Multiple designs for such robots exist; however, a common problem for those robots is that they need remote control or teleoperation. This makes it very difficult for the soldier to do anything else at the same time, such as look out for threats, or even just walk without tripping. A less cognitively demanding form of control is clearly needed that will allow the soldier to control the robot (or robots) and still perform his primary combat mission. We propose a Scene Understanding for Semi-Autonomous Navigation (SUSAN) system for the semi-supervised control of unmanned ground vehicles. The system allows a user to direct a vehicle from behind, using a touch-screen device, or from in front, by leading the way and issuing commands through arm/hand gestures. SUSAN achieves this using novel monocular scene understanding algorithms and robust tracking techniques, and does not require specialized robot-mounted sensors or soldier-worn markers.",

        "abstract": "The development of advanced microelectronics for satellite communications applications have become increasingly expensive. Smaller feature-sized microelectronics fabrication is now needed to provide ICs for complex radiation-hardened communications systems operating in space.  Historically, radiation-hardened integrated circuit (IC) components have been fabricated at dedicated foundries using specialty, hardened, larger-feature size, expensive processes while commercial foundries focus on producing high-performance, non-radiation tolerant, ICs using smaller and smaller feature size processes. Micro-RDC, a leading developer of technology for IC device hardening by design, instead of by process, has developed a family of 90nm Design-Hardened Structured Application Specific Integrated Circuits (DH SASICs) that can be produced on a commercial IC fabrication line using a Single Reticle, Multi-Project-Wafer. This enables satellite systems designers to develop high-performance radiation-hardened ICs, at a very low cost.  This technology has gained much popularity lately amongst space communications IC designers, but the need for even higher speed devices now exists.  This Phase II effort proposes to design, fabricate and test a proof-of-concept test chip to verify some of the key elements of a next generation 45nm SOI DH SASIC.  This verification should demonstrate sufficient reduced program risk to entice an outside investor/developer to fund a Phase III development program.    BENEFIT:  Space Communications program designers are developing high-performance systems to provide advanced processing from space-based platforms.  These systems require advanced, high-speed, radiation-hardened integrated circuits for data processing.  High-Speed integrated circuits for specific processing functions that are radiation-hardened for space, currently either do not exist or are manufactured at great expense.  These devices also tend to be large and require much power for operation.  Commercial ICs are not tolerant to radiation effects and were not designed to meet military specifications.   Micro-RDC\u2019s previous 90nm Bulk CMOS Design-Hardened Structured ASIC program enables designers to develop advanced radiation-hardened digital ICs at a fraction of the cost and with much lower power demands.  With even faster and more dense satellite system requirements now being developed Micro-RDC\u2019s Design-Hardened Structured ASIC program needs to migrate to the next generation 45nm feature-size technology to meet the needs of even faster computing, with the benefit of SOI substrates for enhanced hardness.",

        "abstract": "Aqwest proposes to develop an advanced thermal management for cooling of electronic components using an active heat sink (AHS) offering unparalleled capabilities in high-heat flux handling and temperature control. The project will produce a cooling system with the following benefits to wide band gap amplifiers and high-power laser diodes (HPLD): 1) Heat flux handling > 1200 W/cm2 2) Easily scalable by stacking to >10 kW 3) Heat spreading with equivalent thermal conductivity  several times of copper 4) Temperature control to < \u201eb1\u00a2XC 5) Response time < 1 second 6) Compatible with DOD air and space environments The AHS removes waste heat from semiconductor material and transfers it to system primary coolant.  It employs a miniature closed flow loop receiving waste heat from semiconductor chips at a high heat flux, transporting it by forced convection, and transferring it to an air-cooled heat sink or liquid-cooled heat exchanger at a much lower heat flux.  The flow is maintained electromagnetically without any moving parts.  Junction temperature is controlled by the flow velocity.  AHS solves three (3) problems in one device: 1) effective removal/spreading of waste heat from semiconductor junctions 2) transfer of waste heat to a primary sink, and 3) temperature control.    BENEFIT:  Proposed active heat sink (AHS) offers unprecedented capability in high heat flux handling, heat spreding, and temperature control. AHS can couple high-heat flux / high-power  loads to heat pipes, liquid-cooled heat exchangers, and air-cooled heat exchangers.  AHS-based thermal management offers reduced size and weight.  Military uses include thermal management of high-power laser diodes used in solid-state lasers (e.g., for lidar, target designators/illuminators, remote sensing, and laser communication) and wide bad gap semiconductors (e.g., for communication and electronically scanned radar antennas) on space, air, and land platforms.

        "abstract": "The success of a launch depends upon the reliability of the launch vehicle, with the riskiest part of the vehicle being its rocket engine. For launch vehicles fueled by pump fed liquid propellants, the highest risk component is the turbomachinery, with the top two life issues being the turbine blades and bearings.  These facts support the need for a fast, responsive and accurate health monitoring system (HMS) for turbopumps.  Currently, there is no direct measurement of turbine blade or bearing health. FTT is developing an infrared (IR) HMS that measures temperatures during operation, thus detecting the first indicator of a fault.  The results of the Phase I SBIR have shown the feasibility of applying a thermal optical IR sensor system to rocket engine turbomachinery health management. Testing conducted has demonstrated that a long-wave IR camera can \u201csee through\u201d a cryogenic liquid medium.The conceptual design of the miniaturized system illustrated examples of applying the sensor to monitoring in turbopumps- including turbine blades, bearings and inducers.  The technical objective of Phase II is to advance the IR sensor system to somewhere between TRL 5-6. FTT proposes to do this by demonstrating the IR sensor system capability in an HCB risk reduction rig.   BENEFIT:  Anticipated benefits include extending the temperature range of the IR camera system, which would allow it to measure turbine blades in cooler environments, such as a LOX-rich staged combustion cycle or an expander cycle. Operating the IR sensor to look through a liquid medium would be another benefit that would allow measurements of the bearing inner raceway temperature changes of a relieved sleeve rolling element bearing. Additionally, improving the resolution of the IR sensor could allow it to detect the onset of cavitation in certain propellants by measuring the temperature drop from thermodynamic suppression head (TSH) effects. Successfully miniaturizing the IR camera system would allow it to be applied to on-line health management systems during flight, and the visual images it captures can be post-processed after flight determine on-condition maintenance actions. All these enhancements will serve improve the mission success rate of the launch vehicle, potentially saving millions in aborted launches or lost payload. The improved IR health management system allows improved measurement of industrial gas turbine systems as well. The results from the Phase I SBIR have shown that all previous anticipated benefits are indeed feasible goals- monitoring of lower temperature components, monitoring through cryogenic liquid media, and miniaturizing the system. Benefits from completion of Phase II would include advancing the technology to between TRL 5 and 6.",

        "abstract": "This proposal focuses on developing innovative algorithms which exploit a constellation of narrowband RF sensors to detect IED placement activities. The algorithms include techniques for (i) detecting, localizing, and analyzing behavior of vehicles, (ii) imaging to determine if an area has been disturbed, and (iii) optimally locating sensors to enable items (i) and (ii). In Phase I, we developed a suite of baseline algorithms. These included an new nonlinear filtering approach to detection and localization and a novel CRB method of optimal sensor placement. The algorithms were illustrated in simulations involving both sensor placement and target tracking.  In Phase II, we propose to refine and extend the algorithms from Phase I, develop additional algorithms, and evaluate the system on real data. Refinements include improved modeling and characterization of urban phenomena and modeling enhancements. Additional algorithms include development of kinematic profiling and compressed sensing coherent change detection. Real data will be used to validate the algorithms. The success of the Phase I algorithms warrants continued R&D in Phase II. The expected result of the Phase II effort is a software prototype for automated selection of sensor placement, detection and tracking of vehicles, kinematic profiling, and CCD imaging.    BENEFIT:  At the completion of this effort, the proposed technologies will provide an algorithm suite for automatic target detection, kinematic classification, high-resolution imaging, and tracking. These algorithms apply in many commercial applications, including border protection, airport security, and even traffic analysis. In particular, DHS, the FAA, and other agencies routinely need to secure a border or perimeter and analyze all traffic passing through. Furthermore, policing applications often require certain hot-spots to be intensely monitored, particularly in situations poorly equipped for traditional EO techniques (e.g., nighttime and poor weather conditions).  IAI and MTRI have engaged AKELA, a leading manufacturer of RF hardware both for commercial and military applications, as a potential vendor for the first product from this technology. No funding for AKELA is costed into the Phase II effort. However, discussions and meetings for transition planning are included. The first product would incorporate the algorithms developed here and narrowband hardware for an intrusion monitoring system that could be sold to police departments, the FAA, and commercial entities requiring perimeter control.",

The grating multiplexes the use of an imaging array to enable rapid and simultaneous collection of both spatial and spectral information about the event.  The spatial information is used to ascertain the location of the event, while the spectral information will be used to distinguish between events of interest and false alarms by exploiting explosive, propellant and by-product spectral signatures.  The proposed technology is compact, contains no moving parts, and provides rapid spatial and constituent information about energetic events, thereby making it an ideal solution to the Air Force\u2019s needs.  The proposed technology represents an improvement over flash event detectors operating in the mid-wave infrared based on better visibility over long ranges in inclement weather as well as better specificity of explosives and byproducts.  Our approach also offers novel information about flash events since little research has been performed in this wavelength range.  During the Phase II program OPTRA will design, build and test a fully functioning LWIR threat warning sensor.

        "abstract": "The Air Force space situational awareness mission includes characterization, identification and real-time tracking of resident space objects (RSO).  Under low-light conditions not dominated by sunshine, detectable RSO signatures result from reflections of upwelling irradiance.  These sources, which are important during dawn, dusk and nighttime, include surface emissions, urban lights, aurora, sudden stratospheric warmings and scattering by polar mesospheric clouds.  Tracking RSOs under these conditions will considerably expand surveillance opportunities using both satellite and ground-based sensors.  Spectral Sciences, Inc. (SSI) will develop a first principles toolkit named Robust and Accurate Earthshine/Skyshine Reflection Models, (RAES-RM) for predicting this upwelling irradiance in the UV, VIS and IR spectral regions. Leveraging current first-principles models developed under this and previous programs, SSI is teaming with Tau Technologies to interface RAES-RM with the Air Force TASAT systems model, and with Surface Optics Corporation for validation data for urban lights and with Boeing Corporation for measurements and validation data against actual RSOs. When validated, the RAES-RM has applications to systems visibility, earth-directed surveillance, atmospheric compensation for imaging commercial satellites and satellite services including telecommunications, weather forecasting, and navigation.  BENEFIT:  The anticipated benefits of this effort will be the development and validation of models to support systems studies on how to better track and identify resident space objects (RSO).  This will be accomplished by having accurate low-light models for RSO signatures that will define target visibility and background clutter under nighttime conditions.  A low-light capability will greatly expand the envelope of satellite surveillance. These models will be interfaced with TASAT, an Air Force satellite systems code.  When validated, the RAES-RM has applications to systems visibility and earth-directed surveillance. atmospheric compensation for imaging commercial satellites and satellite services including telecommunications, weather forecasting, and navigation.",

        "abstract": "During a Phase I program Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) has demonstrated a nano-porous/polymer composite separator for low temperature operation of lithium ion batteries.  These continuous nano-porous structures sequester inexpensive liquid lithium ion battery electrolytes depressing both their freezing point and vapor pressure. During the Phase II program PSI proposes to optimize and demonstrate this system in prototype cells.  In Phase I, more than an order of magnitude increase in lithium ion conductivity over conventional separator/electrolyte systems was demonstrated at -40\u00b0C, resulting in significantly improved battery rate capability. In Phase II, the system performance will be further improved by optimizing the polymer and electrolyte components. Pouch cells will be constructed to demonstrate scale up and cell level performance at low temperatures and over extended cycling. In year 2, larger cylindrical cells will be constructed by an industrial partner and the performance evaluated in order to demonstrate readiness for transition to a commercial or military application.     BENEFIT:  The primary market for the proposed technology is the military in particular for space applications. The temperature extremes and long cycle life demands of space deployment would benefit from the robust electrolyte. Similarly, the proposed technology would be beneficial in the uniquely harsh environments in which battery powered combat devices operate.  The reduced solvent vapor pressure and char forming ability of the nanoporous components could allow the development of a non-flammable electrolyte for use in everyday batteries.  This would allow the technology to be extended to commercial devices such as hybrid and electric vehicles, cordless power tools, remote sensing devices, and portable communications such as cell phones and two-way radios.",

The greatest problem has been to achieve high bandwidths while still maintaining low drive switching voltage. Material electro-optic coefficient, optical loss, dielectric loss and permittivity all contribute to these parameters, with lithium niobate currently representing the best balance of materials properties. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project develops novel materials processing techniques that extract the maximum possible performance out of the lithium niobate electro-optic material.  Specifically, the lithium niobate material is reduced to a thin bulk crystal film on top of a low electrical permittivity and low loss microwave friendly substrate. This geometry vastly reduces dielectric loss and effective microwave index for the traveling wave electrode, making velocity and impedance matched low drive voltage modulators possible. Simulation results indicate that a switching voltage less than 1 Volt and 20 GHz bandwidth would be possible with the new thin film geometry.",

Expeditionary forces, in particular, convoys on the move, need an effective counter surveillance capability to combat this threat. Following a very successful Phase I effort, the team of 21st Century Systems Incorporated (21CSI) and Missouri University of Science and Technology is pleased to propose to continue our research and development of a counter surveillance concept called TRANSURV. This transmission surveillance tool is the synergistic pairing of RF DF equipment and video cameras to provide persistent perimeter surveillance without incurring a large manpower footprint. The RF sensors are used to cue video cameras (slew-to-cue), which slew to the RF source. Utilizing advanced video analytics, TRANSURV analyzes the scene for human presence and alerts the operator. Built on 21CSI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successful force protection product line, TRANSURV provides decision support that enhances situational awareness and security.

        "abstract": "In general, there are two ways an FSS Radome subjected to an HPM source can fail.  The first is under a sustained continuous high average power signal where heating in lossy materials causes melting or burning.  The second is under a very high peak power signal where arching or breakdown occurs within or around the FSS elements, essentially shorting them out.  During the Phase I of this SBIR, novel designs were investigated for an L-band radome that could withstand the latter of the two signal types.  For this investigation a combination of FSS element shaping and high dielectric materials was used to increase the power handling capability of the radome.  Detailed CEM analysis was performed during this phase which provided precise knowledge of the field strengths throughout the radome.  During the Phase II effort, these same CEM tools will be used to optimize the Phase I design, whereupon a test coupon will be fabricated for the purpose of demonstrating the electrical properties at low power.  Having confirmed the electrical properties and mitigated the highest risk elements of the design, a high power proof of principle experiment will be designed and executed in order to demonstrate the power handling capability.  BENEFIT:  There are two primary anticipated benefits to the HPM FSS radome being proposed here. The first and most obvious benefit is the protection the band-stop radome affords the HPM antenna.  While the HPM FSS radome appears transparent within the band of operation of the HPM antenna, outside of this band it appears opaque.  Therefore, if confronted by an adversarial HPM the proposed radome will block any harmful HPM signals that are not in its own operational band.  The second anticipated benefit of the proposed HPM radome is that the design can easily be modified to generate its complimentary band-stop counterpart.  By merely replacing the slot FSS with its dipole counterpart the FSS radome becomes opaque instead of transparent at the operational frequency of the HPM source.  For an HPM source located on a platform populated with other antenna systems this band-stop radome would provide protection for these antennas against the neighboring HPM source.  Commercial applications include the HPM hardening of critical computer network systems.  As the technology in HPM progresses, HPM sources will continue to get smaller and cheaper, eventually making it conceivable for non-military personnel to acquire these weapons.  The band-stop variant of the proposed radome could be used to protect otherwise vulnerable computer networks and databases whose disruption in many cases could have a worldwide impact.",

There is intense interest in exploiting the special properties of quantum states for applications such as quantum communication and computing. However, the very properties of quantum states that make them useful also make them difficult to measure. Quantum state tomography is a measurement tool which allows for complete characterization of quantum states. Although great progress has been made in researching quantum tomography techniques, no commercial equipment exists and current demonstrations of the method tend to be slow, thereby providing little information about the quantum state drift over time. Advances in the field of quantum information are severely hampered because every development group must build their own tools including even basic measurement devices.

        "abstract": "A Wide Area Space Surveillance System (WASSS)  would provide near continuous, real-time monitoring of insertion events, orbital maneuvers, and resident space objects (RSOs) in deep space.   A constellation of satellites is proposed with multiple wide field-of-view sensors in an orbit that provides optimal viewing of prioritized regions of space.  The proposed system was inspired by recent highly revealing detections by the Air Force Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI) of numerous satellite orbit insertions.  In Phase I, SSI successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the WASSS concept based on a SMEI-type sensor modified and tailored for a space surveillance mission.  In Phase II, SSI will develop and evaluate the system concept and sensor design.  The three primary aspects of the Phase II study are the 1) down-selection and evaluation of the satellite constellation orbital geometry and surveillance strategy, 2) design and evaluation of a sensor system to meet the requirements of the selected constellation, and 3) demonstration of the critical aspects of the sensor performance in a breadboard prototype sensor.  At the end of Phase II, SSI will conceive a demonstration space experiment to be pursued in Phase III.  BENEFIT:  The Wide Area Space Surveillance System addresses the deficiencies in detection and coverage of the current Space Surveillance Network (SSN). It would provide a unique and vital capability for real-time detection of new orbit insertions and continuous RSO tracking. The WASSS spatial coverage and refresh rate far exceeds those of existing SSA sensors, thereby dramatically reducing the probability that a nefarious satellite insertion event goes undetected.   The integration of WASSS in the existing SSN would, therefore, substantially enhance the protection of high-value commercial and military satellites, in particular those in deep space.   WASSS could serve as a queuing sensor for a high-resolution sensor system such as the Space-Based Surveillance System (SBSS).   A successful Phase II would lead to an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration and a transition of the technology to an Air-Force prime contractor for implementation. The advanced space-based sensor has numerous dual-use applications.  The improved stray-light rejection performance enhances its ability to detect and track coronal mass ejections from the sun.  The associated space-weather forecasting mission is highly relevant to both the commercial and military sectors impacted by solar-induced communications outages and thermospheric density increases that change the orbits of satellites.  The sensor innovations would also have an impact on a variety of commercial and military imaging applications.

Feasibility of the Quickstep out-of-autoclave process for 5250-4 and 977-3 material systems has been demonstrated in prior work. In Phase I, the Quickstep process reduced the heating and cooling time by 40 percent compared to an autoclave process for 5250-4.

A key feature of the program includes active participation of F-35 Industry Partners to provide requirements, support process development, test components, and ensure the opportunity for technology insertion into the F-35 program.

BENEFIT:  As defense systems become increasingly complex the Air Force will find itself in the position of having to design and evaluate more complicated and exotic laser systems. The tool built in this effort will assist with designing, comparing or reverse engineering lasers. Commercially, there is an opportunity for a company to provide the tools to engineers with the know-how or the desire to acquire the know-how to design the exotic custom lasers that are needed in specialty applications. In addition such a software tool could help spur a cottage industry of laser designers in the same way tools like Code V, Zemax and OSLO support an industry of lens designers.",

        "abstract": "Sandwich construction has excellent stiffness and strength to weight, and therefore has been used in many airframe applications for fixed and rotary wing aircraft. Unfortunately, honeycomb sandwich structures have proven costly to maintain due to limited durability. Perhaps the largest single limitation has been corrosion. The Navy operates its aircraft on the open seas in one of the harshest aircraft environments known. In addition to direct salt spray exposure, the maritime carrier aircraft environment features exposure to sustained high levels of humidity and occasional hot gas exposure. Non-metallic core such as HRH-10 Nomex or HRH-36 Kevlar/Korex do not corrode directly, however they remain susceptible to other failure modes such as impact and subsequent moisture damage. In the Phase II effort, Aurora Flight Sciences proposes to design and fabricate a complex curvature fairing using stretch-broken carbon fiber (SBCF) and demonstrate the ability of this material to produce an aircraft quality component without honeycomb that reduces weight and/or overall manufacturing and lifecycle costs. Results of the Phase I effort showed that SBCF integrally stiffened panels can be more weight efficient when compared to traditional honeycomb sandwich panels. The success of the Phase I effort in demonstrating the concept feasibility has paved the way for the design and fabrication of a full-scale article during the Phase II program.",

        "abstract": "Applications that incorporate human behavior models (HBMs) have the potential to improve the training, decision-making, and even the operational effectiveness of US forces. This software can mimic human decision-making, reasoning, learning, social and cultural biases, as well as perceptual, cognitive, and motor limitations in support of many applications, including analysis, simulation-based acquisition, training, and mission rehearsal. Unfortunately, the development of such complex software systems is currently costly, time consuming, and error-prone due to a lack of appropriate high-level languages and corresponding development tools. To improve the affordability, efficiency and robustness of the HBM-development process, we propose to design and demonstrate the feasibility of EasyCog, a high-level cognitive language, development environment, and compiler that is designed to improve the HBM-development process across multiple cognitive architectures. EasyCog combines cognitive, behavioral, social, affect and cultural models with high-level programming language features to improve the breadth and scalability of HBMs. Visual editors and debuggers work at the level of the high-level language to improve the efficiency of model development. Finally, EasyCog can generate configurable source code for a variety of existing cognitive architectures, meaning runtime users can reuse models in a variety of domains based on a single high-level model.",

        "abstract": "Frontier Technology, Inc. (FTI), in cooperation with Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne and D&E Power and Propulsion, will develop tools to better understand the current (and projected) health state of liquid rocket engine turbomachinery. The ultimate goal of the research is the ability to provide real-time health management/monitoring of these devices with the objective of reducing turnaround time, increasing availability and minimizing mission aborts or catastrophic failures. FTI will combine principles of real-time prognostic health management with Linear Engine Models to detect real-time system status and accurately identify failure sources and recommended actions. During Phase II, FTI will develop, demonstrate and validate tools so that experiments in sub-scale or full-scale hardware can be performed and compared to model predictions. The primary deliverables for this effort will be the tools and models created along with the validation data collected. FTI will use data from actual flights and data from rocket engine turbomachinery simulators to validate the ability of the health state analysis models and algorithms to perform accurately on several rocket engines. This effort extends FTI\u2019s research into prognostic assessment of real-time, dynamic systems and the ability of health management technology to reduce turnaround time for reusable systems.    BENEFIT:  The technology resulting from this research is beneficial to any enterprise where early detection of degrading system performance and faster, reliable turnaround time results in increased availability, improved reliability and reduced cost. By providing the ability to identify system faults in real time and to select the correct response, the technology reduces the impact of degrading conditions or unexpected faults on systems operations.  Once a system has been identified as requiring service, the focus shifts to minimizing the time that system is unavailable for use.   The technology supports this objective by ensuring that the problem is quickly and correctly identified and that the system is in a healthy state when returned to service.  The technology is particularly applicable to organizations that manage fleets of aircraft, vehicles or complex systems and desire to reduce unplanned outages and early returns from service while increasing system availability and effectiveness.",

The combination of a universal amplification and labeling system with the beaded array will provide a revolutionary improvement in medical molecular diagnostics with unprecedented fidelity and adaptability to identify occult and emerging disease agents.  These assays will have broad applicability in military and commercial settings, as they will enable rapid action needed to reduce mortality, morbidity and treatment costs.  We will screen the genetic profiles of up to 100 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus with known antibiotic resistance profiles using a 4,000+ feature planar microarray in order to develop a signature set of high value markers for rapid, treatment-based assays to identify MSSA and MRSA.  In parallel, we will develop a multi-signature per organism multiplexed assay for the three major biothreat organisms, Bacillus anthracis Ames, Yersinia pestis, and Franciscella tularensis.  These assays will be developed using the Luminex system, which provides the basis for flexible, rapid, low cost diagnostic assays.  A respiratory viral panel has been FDA-approved on this platform.",

        "abstract": "All existing web-based groupware tools lack any provision for multi-level security. Furthermore, the size and complexity of such software makes it extremely unlikely that any potential extensions to support multiple security levels could ever be certified or accredited across clearance levels. Trident Systems proposes to develop a full-scale, certification-ready implementation of a Multi-Level Wiki (ML Wiki) to enable web-based inter-domain information exchanges. The ML Wiki will provide a secure execution environment and safe access to multi-level Wiki web pages, and will mediate between user workstations and the Wiki engine, ensuring that multiple users can collaborate safely and securely on documents with information annotated with multiple levels of security. The ML Wiki will allow users to mark regions of Wiki documents with varying sensitivity level annotations based on the Intelligence Community Standard for Information Security Markings (IC ISM) standard. The ML Wiki will support a restricted form of Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT), for imposing clearance-level specific views upon documents. The ML Wiki targets the Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) 6 of the Common Criteria, an internationally approved set of security standards, so that it may be used to span at least three clearance levels (Confidential / Secret / Top Secret).    BENEFIT:  The ML Wiki will enable new flexibility in web-based groupware tools by developing the High Assurance system for secure web-collaboration. In so doing, the ML Wiki will significantly enhance the cross domain information sharing capability, shorten the intelligence production cycle, and enable military decision-makers to quickly respond to critical situations. The private sector has similar security concerns that are currently addressed via physical separation of networks and levels of information. A secure web-collaboration solution server would allow secure access from those isolated domains to general information.

        "abstract": "The hundreds of stream cores in the latest graphics processors (GPUs), and the possibility to execute non-graphics computations on them, open unprecedented levels of parallelism at a very low cost. In the last 6 years, GPUs had an increasing performance advantage of an order of magnitude relative to x86 CPUs. Furthermore, this performance advantage will continue to increase in the next 20 years because of the scalability of the chip manufacturing processes. The goal of this project is to efficiently exploit the GPU parallelism in order to accelerate the execution of a Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solver. SAT has a wide range of applications, including formal verification and testing of software and hardware, scheduling and planning, cryptanalysis, and detection of security vulnerabilities and malicious intent in software. We bring a tremendous expertise in SAT solving, formal verification, and solving of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) by efficient translation to SAT. In our previous work (done on the expenses of our company) we achieved 2 orders of magnitude speedup in solving Boolean formulas from formal verification of complex pipelined microprocessors, 4 orders of magnitude speedup in SAT-based solving of CSPs, and 8 orders of magnitude speedup in SAT-based routing of optical networks. During Phase 1 we implemented a prototype of a parallel GPU-based SAT solver that is 1?2 orders of magnitude faster than the best sequential SAT solvers. In Phase 2, we will continue to exploit the GPU parallelism to accelerate SAT solving, and expect to achieve speedup of 3?4 orders of magnitude.",

        "abstract": "The Unmanned Systems market is exploding with applications, products and services. For example, an increasing number of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) are serving the military, commercial and research markets today. To better serve these markets, it would be beneficial if the beginning design stages of UAS development included the capability to support multiple sensors, payloads, and concept of operations. In this way, expansion of the UAS capabilities, or the integration of newly developed subsystems would not require a redesign, yielding a UAS that is truly adaptable to many payloads and missions. The UAS developed and flight tested under this Phase II effort will be capable of supporting a variety of sensors, weapons, and concepts of operations through modular payload bays and payload interfaces. Our modular payload bays and interfaces allow the UAS to support missions with varying endurance and payload needs via interchangeable bays capable of supporting extra fuel, batteries, sensors, or ordinance. By utilizing a systems engineering approach and drawing on years of UAS design experience, the prototype systems developed under the Phase II effort will validate the Phase I design and demonstrate the proposed UAS is a cost-effective solution for a large variety of payloads, customers, and missions.    BENEFIT:  Military, border surveillance groups, search and rescue teams, and researchers could all benefit from an affordable UAS with long endurance and modular payload capabilities. For instance, the low cost UAS developed under this Phase II effort could be equipped with a laser illuminator and be flown into high risk areas to aid soldiers during night operations or be configured to carry large amounts of fuel and a small sensor to provide persistent surveillance over a specific area or along convoy routes. With the United States Department of Homeland Security already capitalizing on larger Unmanned Systems, this system can fly non lethal directed energy payloads to deter illegal immigrants as they cross the border. Moreover, a gimbal with geo-location software could be flown onboard an asset loaded with fuel to search for hikers lost in the mountains. Researchers and scientists could also benefit from a system specifically designed to ease their payload integration and logistics needs, allowing them to remain focused on the science and not the platform. Furthermore, the long endurance platform would allow researchers to capture more data in a single flight without the increased risks associated with multiple launch and recoveries. In summary, a highly versatile, low cost, small UAS is needed to interact with multiple payloads, for a variety of missions, with the capability to operate over an extended period of time. Our Phase I design will be validated during Phase II flight testing to effectively fill this capability gap, meeting the needs of the Unmanned Systems market, on schedule and within budget.",

        "abstract": "A significant number of space launches, both government and commercial, have considerable mass margin that could be used by inserting an EELV Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) ring.  This ring could be transformed into a standard spacecraft bus with capability to add up to six different payloads or be utilized as a spacecraft itself.  The transformed ESPA will have one of six of the available slots occupied by a small satellite.  This satellite can be designed to provide power, electrical, mechanical, logical, and communications capability to other ESPA-attached payloads. Under this Phase II SBIR we will design a ESPA-Sat based CubeSat with significant capability to support AFRL/DoD missions \u2013 using proven COTS components.  We are also proposing to include a novel optical correction technique of a 1m diameter membrane telescope mirror to enable the CubeSat to perform sub-meter imaging. We are taking the best of CubeSat capabilities and adding those to the ESPA-Sat.  Not only can ESPA-based satellite reduce the cost of launching multiple satellites, but the concentration of launch opportunities per ESPA-based satellite bus will promote small-sat development in the direction of standardized packaging, ultimately leading to savings in small satellite development, construction, and operation.  BENEFIT:  By providing a low-cost platform to launch small satellites into available payload slots that would have flown empty anyway, we will promote small satellite development by universities, research institutions, the private commercial sector, and the government.   Because the ESPA-Sat will provide power, electrical, mechanical, logical, and communication needs to the attached payloads, it will further reduce the cost of small satellite development by the user community.  This is a low-cost, high-payoff opportunity.  The novel optical correction technique proposed will significantly advance the state-of-the-art by providing an inexpensive sub-meter imaging spacecraft bus to the aerospace community.

Current manufacturing processes for shaping custom earplugs require that physical impressions be taken of customer''s ear canals. Since this involves injecting silicone material directly into the ear, physical impression taking can be uncomfortable for the customer and yield results which will vary with the skill and technique of the practitioner. The SBIR Phase I predecessor to this Phase II program developed new means, based on Computed Tomography (CT) imaging technology, for capturing ear anatomy information without the need for physical impressions. Eliminating the physical impression will also eliminate the associated discomfort and variability and lead to happier users getting more reliable hearing protection. The Phase I program further demonstrated feasibility of completing a custom earplug manufacturing process using only digital data, starting from a non-invasive CT scan through production to a finished hearing protector product. The proposed Phase II program will refine the technology and logistical model to prepare for production-quantity implementation. The effort has two overarching goals. One is to better optimize the software and hardware components of the system to streamline all elements of the digital process from customer ear measurement through digital design of the hearing protector. The second main goal is to advance the art of designing hearing protectors using the extra anatomical information made available by this technology.",

        "abstract": "To address the U.S. Army CBD need for a low-cost, universal, robust, and fieldable device for rapid, reproducible identification of protein variants from biological samples with high throughput, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Dielectrophoretic Microfluidic Protein Analysis (DiMiPA) system based on an electrodeless dielectrophoresis-based, continuous-flow protein separation technique followed by protein variants quantification and identification via detection of the separated protein bands by UV absorption spectrometry and enhanced Raman spectrometry with POC-designed SERS substrates. The DiMiPA system will be composed of a microfluidic chip, an AC power supply, a syringe pump, and a readout unit. The DiMiPA tool will rapidly (10 min) and with high resolution and reproducibility separate protein variants, preparing them for identification by the readout unit. The DiMiPA system will be an inexpensive, portable, and easy-to-use automated instrument. In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of the DiMiPA device by fabricating a prototype and demonstrating its capability to separate allozymes of sulfotransferase (SULT1A1), SULT1A1*1, and SULT1A1*3, which differ from each other by a single amino acid. In Phase II, DiMiPA will be optimized to enhance system throughput and identification resolution to identify allozymes of SULT1A1 and heat shock protein 70, HSP70-1A, and HSP70-1B.",

There is a need for a low cost, space-based capability that provides simultaneous electro-optical (EO), infrared (IR), and radio-frequency (RF) characteristics to calibrate the U.S. SOSI system. This enhanced U.S. SOSI system capability will enable the U.S. to maintain our space capabilities for executing space control missions, ensuring freedom of action in space, and supporting defensive space control (DSC) by providing the ability to detect and characterize an attack and timely determine object/owner intent capability and intent. Combining the attributes of consistent targets for simultaneous observation of EO, IR and RF in a simple calibration target has not been achieved by inflatable targets to date.

This work bases on a previous SBIR project, in which we constructed a single-channel prototype of the phase control electronics in a laboratory (breadboard) environment. To enable control of a 220-channel system ready for flight testing, the prototype functionality must not only be appropriately scaled, but also must sufficiently address size, weight, power, and operational environment considerations. In addition, two more areas of the electronics must be provided: PIN switching control electronics, and an image acquisition system. By the end of this CPP effort, we will have integrated our custom control electronics with PSI''s distributed-aperture millimeter-wave imaging system. Specifically, we will leverage the power of reconfigurable commodity hardware to replace the current control system, which is not appropriate for airframe deployment.",

The most common CI/LI additive is dilinoleic acid which is chemically similar to many other components of the military fuel. This similarity makes it very difficult to measure the concentration of CI/LI without using a separation technique. During this Phase I project we developed a practical solid phase extraction (SPE) technique to separate and concentrate the CI/LI. At the end of Phase I we had developed a reagent free approach that uses temperature to perform the final separation of the CI/LI and an analysis technique that measures the concentration of CO2 vapors given off by the CI/LI during heating as a measure of the conecentration of the CI/LI in the sample. The Phase II project proposes to further develop this novel reagent free approach into a small, lightweight field instrument. The proposal details the development and testing of the various components of the system and the integration of the components into a robust field instrument.",

Approximately 80% of hemorrhagic deaths on the battlefield are due to intracavitary hemorrhage that is not accessible to direct pressure. Noncompressible hemorrhage is also a primary cause of death in civilian trauma. Unfortunately, methods available to first responders to control hemorrhage are only useful for extremity or superficial truncal injuries and the only viable treatment for intracavitary hemorrhage is surgical intervention. Luna Innovations is developing a novel hemostatic agent and delivery system specifically designed for battlefield treatment of noncompressible intracavitary hemorrhage. The hemostatic agent consists of low-viscosity liquids that rapidly expand into a blood and tissue compatible, non-toxic, bioadhesive and biodegradable gel upon delivery. The product will adhere to and seal injured tissue while promoting hemostasis via several simultaneous mechanisms. The multiple mechanisms, coupled with the sealant nature of the gel, will guarantee hemostasis even in cases of coagulopathy brought on by trauma or fluid resuscitation. The delivery system will be small, lightweight, sterile, preloaded with agent, and easy to use with minimal training on wounds of various sizes and depths.",

We design, implement, simulate, and analyze performance of the measurement-aided spectrum management functional components. We also focus on spectrum monitoring system optimization that enables accurate and sufficient representation of the local RF environment. We develop spectrum fusion algorithms for processing multi-sensor spectrum metrics, and spectrum management functions for de-conflicting spectrum observations with existing spectrum database records. We also build interfaces for integration with Spectrum XXI and JWNM tools. We perform proof of concept lab demos and field tests to show the viability and accuracy of the approach.",

Procedures\nencode the operational knowledge of a system as derived from system\nexperts, testing, training and experience.  In current Space Shuttle and ISS operations procedures are displayed using applications separate from the applications used to display commands and telemetry.  This means that procedures cannot interact with commands and telemetry to help an operator's situation awareness.  This leads to slower procedure performance and greater opportunity for errors.  TRACLabs is building on existing NASA Constellation program technology to combine procedures, commanding and telemetry into a single, consistent framework in which to operate space vehicles.   Instead of viewing procedures in static displays, flight controllers will have interactive, reconfigurable procedure displays and assistants that can be tailored for specific situations.  The displays will have different views tailored to specific operations, including browsing, assigning, editing, executing and monitoring procedures.  A procedure executive automates some procedure execution and provides procedure assistance.  Automation is always under the control of the flight controller via level of automation feature.  Each step or instruction of a procedure can be labeled as manual, automated or consent. This will increase the efficiency of procedure performance and reduce procedure errors.",

Robots have had some successes with the first goal; however, there has been limited progress with using robots to free up soldiers for other tasks. Given the high demands placed on the Army''s force structure, there is pressing need to reduce personnel in support tasks, like logistics, in order to increase combat strength. Vecna Technologies is developing the BEAR (Battlefield Extraction Assist Robot), which combines powerful manipulators with a high-mobility platform.

The goal of the BEAR is to perform many of the simple, high-strength tasks in Combat Service Support, increasing the number of soldiers available for Combat Support and Combat Arms. BEAR can also be used in high-risk missions like rescue and battlefield extraction. In Phase II, Vecna will develop and test a new rotary actuator, then deliver it to the Army.

Phase 1 successfully demonstrated, at TRL 4, the ability of the system to acquire rock core samples that are 10 mm diameter and 100 mm long.  The proposed innovation employs a different drill tube design in the vicinity of the core that does not impose any loads on the core and does not rotate relative to the core.  This novel technique actually envelopes and protects the core as it is generated.  The benefits are two fold; first, the integrity of the core is maintained and second, core ejection is much easier which greatly reduces, if not eliminates the risk of the core jamming within the drill tube/bit.  These improvements can be obtained without increasing the annulus of the drill bit that would otherwise require more down force, torque, power and bit wear.

Modeling and Simulation can support these efforts by providing the ability to model the effects of new technologies and equipment on Ground Soldiers (GS) and Small Combat Units (SCU) in constructive simulations. An example of such a system is the Infantry Warrior Simulation (IWARS) being developed by RDECOM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center. However, existing simulation-based analysis tools, such as IWARS, do not currently provide a means of modeling uncertainty in situation awareness (SA) and the effect of uncertainty on the decision making process. To address this, we propose to design and demonstrate the feasibility of Uncertainty-modeling Rules for Situational Awareness (URSA), a unified rule-based representation of uncertainty and incomplete information that can be used in constructive simulations to determine the importance of information to critical GS decisions.

In the Phase I program Optical Physics Company (OPC) investigated three (3) active methods for cooling a standard lightweight silicon carbide (SiC) foam-core mirror flowing helium, water and water with phase changing wax through the mirror.  A standard foam-core mirror is optimized for minimum weight and maximum natural frequency, not thermal performance.  The improved cooling performance was accomplished refining only the locations of the cooling ports via CFD.  The performance of the standard mirror is very good showing minimal surface distortion for absorbed energy intensities of 0.5 W/cm2 for helium cooling and 1.0 W/cm2 for water cooling.  There are five other parameters that can be varied to manufacture purpose-built SiC foam-core mirrors to improve the performance by a factor of 5-10.

To exploit fully these new sensing capabilities, it is necessary to develop resource management algorithms capable of computing near-optimal tasking decisions in real time for thousands of targets and dozens of sensors, and be responsive to changes in sensor performance capabilities versus different target types and operating conditions. To develop such a multi-sensor resource manager Parietal Systems, Inc.

        "abstract": "The Goleta Star LLC team proposes to develop improved change detection algorithms that are well suited to applications that use persistent RF sensors for detecting, tracking, locating, and identifying targets in urban areas.  We plan to develop advanced change detection algorithms that specifically address both IED\u2019s and moving targets in urban clutter, including dismounts, as has been initiated in Phase I.  The Goleta Star team has a significant expertise in image formation processing and change detection to be able to perform this proposed effort.  During Phase II we will expand on our Phase I efforts to develop multiple candidate change detection approaches and then trade off the candidate approaches that are most suitable for Circular SAR applications and which are suitable for insertion into the Gotcha program and potential specific radar applications, such as evolving and developing AF UAV assets.  Goleta Star has SAR / MTI data collection assets that can be used to support the development of the candidate approaches during Phase II.  Goleta Star in conjunction with parent Quinstar can support hardware definition and dev elopement toward a Spiral 3 Gotcha demonstration system.   Phase III would then be the transfer of this new capability to Gotcha elements and to suitable AF UAV assets.  BENEFIT:  The anticipated result from successful completion of this project will be the development and testing and demonstration of advanced change detection capability suitable for incorporation into the evolving Gotcha effort and in potential AF UAV assets.  The AF will have a capability to detect, track and image IEDs and moving targets that is applicable in surveillance and reconnaissance radar platforms of the Departments of Defense, Homeland, and Justice.",

        "abstract": "Wireless communication of small, nano and micro satellites will play a vital role to NASA mission and marketability of the satellite. The use of an Internet-based protocol, especially TCP/IP, can provide seamless network command and control continuity between terrestrial and space-based platforms and environments, as well as between distributed ground and space stations. However, long propagation and/or large transmission errors can significantly degrade current TCP/IP performance. In addition, current TCP is too complex to fit in a small footprint, which is required in microsats and nanosats. To address this NASA/ARC need for wireless networking technologies for small launch vehicles, Broadata Communications, Inc. proposes to develop a Small Space Platform Internet Protocol Stack with Space-Enhanced TCP technology (or SSP IP & TCP in short) to dramatically increase TCP/IP performance (20 times improvements over standard TCP/IP was demonstrated in Phase I) and enable the use of TCP/IP for processor-footprint constrained spacecraft in NASA missions. The overall goal of this Phase II project is to further develop the SSP IP & TCP technology, and to produce a full-scale, highly-optimized, IP embeddable SSP IP & TCP prototype system for placement in NASA networks with micro- or nano-satellite platforms.  Our Phase II work plan is designed to complete SSP IP & TCP development and to produce: (a) a miniature, nanosat integrateable, standalone embedded network system module that provides all SSP IP & TCP functionalities and can directly meet NASA needs and resource-constraint integration requirements, and (b) a full-scale SSP IP &TCP software package that supports multiple network communication interfaces and provides automated installation for Linux or Windows operation systems.",

The resulting instrument will be significantly more compact and less sensitive to orientation and vibration than current devices.

The innovations in DALBOT design enable detection and locating of these IR triggers at distances of 10-100 m with a degree of accuracy better than 15 cm. In Phase I, POC studied COTS components to evaluate their emitted power, beam divergence, and pulse parameters, which revealed vulnerabilities of potential COTS optical threats. These vulnerabilities were used to design a practical prototype that proved the feasibility of detecting/locating/identifying and, in addition, mitigating COTS triggers with a selected viable countermeasure. In Phase II, POC will design and build an operational prototype including critical improvements in speed, sensitivity, and ruggedness for testing in the laboratory and realistic field scenarios against COTS devices.

It has been fielded at a mid-block crossing at Phillips Academy located in Andover, MA. This product can trigger the beacon flashers once pedestrians (i.e., high school students at Phillips Academy) are detected in the detection zone. After the field test over one month, Phillips Academy has decided to keep the system for its use and plans to purchase two more units to replace its existing IR and microwave detectors. \nBefore MigmaMidblockTM was installed, the same mid-block crossing has an IR-based detector installed. School has also installed the IR-based detector and microwave detector at two other mid-block crossings. It has been observed that there are many issues related to IR and microwave detectors, including missed detections and frequent false calls resulted from pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. Phillips Academy has confirmed that our product outperforms both IR and microwave detectors.\nThe performance issues related to IR and microwave detectors have been reported by numerous studies. IR and microwave technologies are currently recognized as two best candidates for outdoor pedestrian detections. Although stereo vision based pedestrian detection technologies have been studied over the past decades, there are currently no field-proven commercial stereoscopic products for pedestrian detections. Our product represents the cutting edge technology for pedestrian detection in the outdoor environment.\nAlthough our limited field test results have shown that our product has a great potential, extensive field tests under various weather conditions are needed for it to be commercially viable. Various hardware and software issues unforeseen during the product design can be exposed during the field tests and can be resolved in a timely fashion. Performance evaluation and benefit analysis, especially for visually impaired pedestrians, can also help ease the concerns of the effectiveness of this product. Moreover, results from large scale field tests can help future research in the field of pedestrian detections.\n",

        "abstract": "The Navy Unmanned Combat Air System (N-UCAS) is a carrier-based, autonomous combat air vehicle designed to conduct long-endurance strike and ISR operational missions. Due to its very nature, the N-UCAS requires the ability to perform precision navigation in a variety of roles. To accomplish this, a commercial differential GPS (DGPS) augmentation service is used, improving precision but failing to meet current DoD regulatory directives. Additionally, the current precision approach to support automated aerial refueling (AAR) relies on a Precision GPS (P-GPS) technique utilizing relative GPS-INS positioning. This method depends on the tanker and the Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) tracking common GPS satellites, then compares the relative pseudorange and carrier-phase differences to determine their precise relative positioning. This approach results in highly accurate relative navigation (~10 cm) when sufficient GPS satellites are in common view, however, the solution\u2019s robustness can degrade when satellites are obstructed by either aircraft. Under this Phase II SBIR effort, NAVSYS will develop an alternative P-GPS architecture, termed Precision RELNAV (P-RELNAV) where the tanker and the N-UCAS are able to independently navigate to a high degree of precision using Precision GPS Ephemeris (PGE) updates. This architecture will meet current DoD guidance and will demonstrate improved robustness of the P-GPS AAR solution by allowing all satellites in view of either vehicle to be included in the navigation solution. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development The NAVSYS PGE architecture, integrated with the InterNav filter on board the aircraft\u2019s navigation computer will provide a very precise independent navigation solution for the N-UCAS and tanker vehicles during automated air refueling.

In a Phase II development effort, Twinleaf proposes to build, test and deliver a two-axis prototype atomic spin gyroscope, ready for testing on moving platforms.  BENEFIT:  Both airborne and underwater platforms, especially smaller unmanned platforms, stand to significantly benefit from a higher performance and smaller gyroscope.

Undersea cable structures are deployed in environments unsuitable for direct in-situ observation of shape or health monitoring. Therefore, the accurate monitoring of an undersea tether or array can simultaneously provide both performance enhancements and help to guard against catastrophic failure. The 3Pi team plans to extend the development of all efforts from the Phase I work with application to a specific target. Much of the Phase I effort was generalized to be applicable to any one of the four (4) length domains identified in the original topic. In addition, the tether structures used were simplified to thin-walled flexible hoses with no complicated geometry, materials, or internal structure. While shape reconstruction accuracy was maximized within a reasonable set of constraints, 3Pi will work with the program sponsor to provide the system performance necessary for the target application.",

Preliminary design tools utilizing inverse ray tracing and characteristic techniques, as well as CFD codes containing advanced turbulence and chemical kinetic models are incorporated. The end-to-end design framework starts with basic user-defined parameters such as the combustor/isolator shape and cross-section and proceeds systematically from inlet to combustor to nozzle, recognizing that the realistic profiles from one component have a first-order effect on the performance of the subsequent component. The framework considers transitional effects and the design of trips, scalar fluctuation effects on mixing/combustion efficiency, and detailed ignition and recombination chemical kinetics in the combustor and nozzle. The framework will be used to design a hydrogen-fueled, Mach 10 inward-turning propulsive flowpath for a design having an elliptical cross-section combustor. Inlet design will address leading edge effects and crotch design will emphasize self-starting issues. The combustor design will use flush-mounted injectors with optimized spacing and fuel/airstream momentum ratios. Nozzle design will address propulsive performance as well as lift augmentation. Innovative concepts to be considered in this design include transpiration cooling, injection of nano Al, fluidic transitional trips, and base burning.",

        "abstract": "CSSI will develop a smart pultruded structural member (SPSM) that contains the sensory cable network for fiber optics as well as accelerometers. This SPSM will be used for the repair and health monitoring of assets which are rapidly aging and failing. The failure rate of towers will be reversed because action will occur long before inspection discloses damage, and cost for repair will only be a fraction of what it currently is. Additionally CCSI will pultrude a smart tower leg component (STLC). This part will provide a sensory cable network into the legs of new all composite towers and radome supports. This will allow the Air Force to minimize risks in adopting new technology as well as benefit from the life cycle advantages of composite materials. Modal updating and very precise spectral analysis capability of the sensor data was demonstrated by CSSI in Phase-I. This is the key to processing the vast wealth of information and providing useful and simple measures of a structure\u2019s current health status. This technology is directly applicable to thousands of radome and radar equipment towers onto which countless millions of dollars worth of mission critical Air Force (AF) communications technology is installed in various configurations.   BENEFIT:  The Integrated Health Monitoring System benefits for the air force are that millions of maintenance dollars can be saved. The investment in the Health Monitoring System is estimated to be no more than 1% of the acquisition cost of each tower. Based on experience in the bridge sector one can expect to extend the life of assets with one to two decades because maintenance dollars are spent pro-active at the right time and in the right place. Similar benefits apply to the monitoring of electrical utility towers for transmission and distribution. These towers will be part of the future \u201csmart grid,\u201d and need to be reliable and long-lasting. One electrical utility (Southern California Edison) has pledged it cooperation following this SBIR project. Another company which is manufactures a key component for the 21st century smart grid has expressed considerable support to invest in new smart products and services which incorporate our vision of Structural Health Monitoring by using smart pultrusions with embedded sensory networks.

In Phase I POC has fabricated IRVUN and measured its light conversion efficiency at 5% for 1.55 micron radiation to visible light, built a theoretical model of the IRVUN upconversion structure. We also defined major parameters of the material layers, including the maximum achievable quantum efficiency, 7-15%, depending on the infrared wavelength; and the optimal metal thickness, 10 nm, at which maximum conversion efficiency is reached.  Based on this model we have determined IRVUN sensitivity and its radiometric resolution (2 10^-7 W/cm^2), its spatial resolution (of 20 mm^-1 with the technical path defined to increase it to 100 mm^-1), temporal resolution of 0.1 ms and transmissivity in the visible range of 70%.

The COMET laser source is an integrated source that supports LIDAR, wavelength diversity broadband sensing, and laser based free-space communication applications from a single laser source.  The system integrates two parallel channels of modulated fiber amplifiers, and a supercontinuum generator to produce broadband spectral content from 0.4-4 um.  Being an integrated solution, components and functionality are shared between the functional units, minimizing size, weight and Power (SWaP).  The COMET system employs a flexible modulation engine that produces arbitrary pulse waveforms for sensing applications, and flexible data modulation to support bandwidth driven lasercom.  In combination with SA Photonics synchronous pumped fiber amplifier technology, which enables extremely low pulse-repetition frequency sensing operation, the COMET system supports sensing and lasercom operation to greater than 200 km.    BENEFIT:  By providing a common source to support LIDAR, wavelength diversity sensing, and lasercom applications, the COMET system enables enhanced satellite Space Situational Awareness (SSA) capabilities at a much lower cost as well as reduced size, weight, and power (SWaP).  By providing operation for all modes beyond a 200 km range, the safety of satellites and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payload is increased, providing more reliable satellite operation and avoiding costs of satellite replacement.

        "abstract": "Measurements made on RF signals from non-cooperative emitters provide situational awareness of threat locations for avoidance, countermeasures, and targeting. At present, the military uses multiple proprietary receiver systems for this task, which are not designed to interoperate, share data, or function across multiple platforms; thus they forego increased geolocation performance and accuracy that could result from rigorous data fusion. There is a clear opportunity for this, as well as reduced life-cycle operating costs, with a fleet-wide, integrated system. The Phase I effort was focused on developing new approaches based on Bayesian Sequential State Estimation (SSE) for passive emitter geolocation, on modeling many of the standard radar signal measurements for use in the estimator, on development of novel measurement types, and on simulation tradeoff studies. In Phase II, SSCI will extend the software to 1) handle a wider set of emitter signal and measurement types including communications signals; 2) support correlated radar/communications transmissions; 3) allow interoperability with heterogeneous receiver equipment and distributed operation across platforms. Software operation will be demonstrated and validated in the \u201cSuppressor\u201d Electronic Warfare simulation. SSCI will also further develop the sensor resource management aids from Phase I. Raytheon will provide technical and commercialization support.  BENEFIT:  The program will result in a system for geolocating emitters associated with RF radar and communications signals. The system will be easily adaptable to work with different receiver hardware, to operate on different platforms, and to participate in a wide array of mission configurations. This flexibility will ultimately result in a system that is easier for the Air Force to operate and maintain than current systems, and one that is more easily upgradeable for new receiver hardware and mission types, translating into lower life-cycle costs. In addition, as a result of being firmly grounded with a Bayesian sequential state estimation (SSE) engine, the SSCI system will produce more accurate estimates than existing approaches, given comparable equipment and available signal measurements. For instance, it will be able to make use of existing and planned radar warning receiver hardware and as such, incremental costs for functional implementations can be kept low, and there is a near-term path to transition validated technology into practice. The accurate and quantitative uncertainty tracking involved in SSE methods is an added benefit, providing more accurate situational information, and enabling development of analysis tools that can aid with data collection aspects of mission planning.",

        "abstract": "There is currently no repair process to restore aluminum landing gear cylinders inner dimensions. The magnetron sputtering System (MSS) process has the potential of restoring outer cylinders IDs dimensions. This technology is similar to ion vapor deposition (IVD) aluminum, and meets the same specification MIL-DTL-83488. ES3\u2019s RODS Phase I testing results were very positive and indicated that 6061 aluminum alloy MSS coatings have a great potential for repairing the IDs of aluminum outer cylinders. The results for the 7075 aluminum MSS coatings were: 1) Similar hardness properties as the substrate alloy material. 2) Withstood high bending loads without spalling off.  3) Wear characteristics increased by almost 200% on the sputtered surface vs. the bare surface of the 7075 coupons.   Phase II testing will demonstrate the feasibility of the sputtering method on both test cylinders and actual landing gear outer cylinders.  Phase II feasibility testing shall be conducted on coupons consisting of 7000 series aluminum alloy to provide acceptable model of actual landing gear components in operations. Also, Field Service Evaluation of several landing gear outer cylinders will be conducted to certify the MSS process.  After MSS process passes the testing and   FSE a process specification will be developed for MSS.   BENEFIT:  Research conducted to develop magnetron sputtering (PVD) systems, which can restore IDs of worn or damaged land gear aluminum outer cylinders, focuses on military applications; however, benefits will be similar for all commercial & military landing gear that need IDs restored to original dimensions. ES3 expects the following benefits from magnetron sputtering systems restoring the Inner Dimension of landing gear outer cylinders based on both industry and in-house research: \u2022 Outer cylinders with worn or damage IDs can be restored to serviceable condition \u2022 Increased supportability of aluminum landing gear parts for USAF and commercial industry \u2022 Reduction in ownership cost for the USAF and commercial industry \u2022 Magnetron sputtering could be used to repair other aircraft parts",

How to engineer materials to achieve high IR sensitivity and be deposited onto lenses, goggles, or other substrates are challenging and important to military and commercial applications.  For many military missions, a cost-effective, ultra-compact, and efficient infrared detection is desired.  High efficiency upconverting films have the potential to generate visible emissions for direct IR detection.  We have successfully shown in Phase I that our nanostructured upconverting glass ceramic films were capable of meeting the needs of direct detection of multiple IR wavelengths at low costs.  Efforts to further increase the up-conversion efficiency and to implement additional wavelength detection ranges will be conducted during Phase II.  BATi is confident that the encouraging results achieved in Phase I will turn into a great commercial success in the next stage.",

These antennas will harness and demonstrate the use of cryogenically cooled superconductive Josephson Junction (JJ) technology. Several novel thin film process techniques will also be presented in the fabrication of raw materials for these antennas.  The resulting antennas will be miniaturized, up to 100X less the size of a conventional antenna. Frequency tuning for this antenna system will be fast, down to the range of mini-seconds, or faster. Bandwidth of these antennas is wide, down to the 3MHz. range. The arrays of HTS components are extremely sensitive magnetometers and would provide increased output voltage and dynamic range.  They would also mitigate the variation in critical junction currents.  MFC materials would also make excellent small antennas as they provide the mechanical resonance that increase the cross coupling effect between ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity.

The proposed work, to be carried out over two years, is based on a very successful Phase I feasibility study by the same team.   It is anticipated that the modular isothermal panels will be fabricated from high performance carbon fiber composite material designed for low thermal expansion, low mass, and high structural integrity.  A simple \u201cpegboard\u201d configuration will allow payload components to be bolted directly to the panels and facilitate simple bolted connections between panels.  The proposed schedule includes subjecting both the prototype modular panels and assembled prototype satellite bus to appropriate 1-g thermal testing in vacuum chambers and vibration testing.  Based on Phase I results, there is a high level of confidence that Phase II technical objectives will be realized.  BENEFIT:  This project is focused directly on military applications including rapid response spacecraft that may be quickly configured from modular isothermal structural panels.  The engineering prototype resulting from the proposed effort will help enable the very aggressive \u201csix day satellite\u201d concept.  In addition, the proposed technology will have application in commercial space where small satellites with inherently low thermal mass typically expose sensitive payload components to broad temperature swings.

In addition, the proposed effort is complementary to a parallel TMT programs focused on terrestrial applications of the Channel Panel\u2122 heat spreader technology including cooling of: data/server centers, Li-Ion batteries, printed circuit boards, and LED arrays.

Currently used semiconductor-based infrared detectors have low quantum efficiency, high dark counts, and need cryogenic cooling.  An alternative approach is to upconvert infrared lights into visible lights that can be detected by silicon Avalanche photodiodes  (APDs) with much lower noise and higher efficiency. Current phosphor screen used in infrared detection device usually consists of upconverting phosphor with a mean size between 3 to 10 microns, and the light generated scatters over and results in loss of light output, transparency, and spatial resolution. In phase I, we developed upconverting nanophosphors with high upconversion efficiency and pure color emissions, and fabricated transparent upconverting films by incorporating these nanocrystals into polymers.   This Phase II program will continue to develop upconverting nanophosphors and nanocomposite films with desired features of high infrared sensitivity, selectivity, transparency, and appropriate refractive-index (to effectively extract the generated emissions).

At adequate concentrations, the nitrite-thiadiazole inhibitor treatment will virtually eliminate corrosion in the water brake system. A preliminary analysis suggests that the annual cost of treating four water brakes on a carrier with corrosion inhibitor should be less than $5,000. The exact inhibitor dosing protocol (concentrations of the respective chemicals, dosing frequency and methodology, etc.) required for an operational shipboard system needs to be determined in Phase II of the subject SBIR program.

The PolyStrata fabrication technology, being developed at Nuvotronics, LCC, Blacksburg, VA., is capable of meeting or exceeding all of the requirements outlined to be a solution for these frequencies. Air-filled copper rectangular coaxial transmission lines are fabricated using a photolithographically defined layer-by-layer process. The resulting transmission lines are extremely broadband, low-dispersion, high-isolation, and low loss compared to other forms of planar transmission lines. These lines are smaller than rectangular waveguides because the transverse cross-sections of the lines are not resonant. Phase II of this work will include the design, fabrication  and characterization of prototypes that will enable PolyStrata-based frequency-scanned antenna-array operating from 140-160GHz with +/-16 degree beam steering, a beamwidth of 0.5 degrees and 400MHz per beam bandwidth. An antenna array with this performance would require roughly 24cm by 24cm.  This is possible using 4 sub-arrays that each are fabricated on a single wafer and then tied together to achieve the overall system performance. We will develop and deliver prototypes that will be smaller versions of this, but demonstrate all the necessary aspects of the system including the feed network, the antennas, the tiling of subarrays and the connection to the outside world.

Essential technical challenges that will be addressed within Phase II include scaling the purification of semiconducting CNT inks for manufacturing, development of stable n-type doping methods, the development of a TFT gate stack and the optimization of TFT device and circuit printing. Our ultimate goal is to develop a simple and low-cost CNT ink-jet printing platform where one can simply print devices, sensors or circuits with a push of a button.",

        "abstract": "Due to launch cost of systems that operate in space, engineers look for methods to reduce weight while maintaining technical performance.  A key component of the electrical system is the network of cables running throughout a spacecraft.  One particular performance parameter that is crucial with respect to electronics of a satellite system is electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding.  To achieve EMI shielding of cables, a shielded conductor is formed by bonding a thin layer of conductive material to the outer surface of the wires.  Shielding is necessary to keep the signal from escaping the wire bundle and to keep exterior signals from interfering with the wires.  Currently, wires are shielded by metal mesh (aluminum, silver, or copper) that surrounds the conductor, which is a heavy solution.  A lighter weight solution is to replace metals with nano-composite materials.  In the Phase I program, San Diego Composites (SDC) demonstrated, through fabricating and testing subscale cables, a weight savings of 20% could be achieved using nano-composite materials for shielding.  In the Phase II program, SDC proposes to develop a reproducible manufacturing method for nanomaterial shielding in electrical wiring resulting in significant system level weight benefits for satellite systems.  Commercialization of the shielding materials can extend to lightweighting electrical systems on aircraft, missiles and ships.   BENEFIT:  Nanomaterial technology can be used for shielding of electrical systems in spacecraft, missiles, aircraft and ships.  The technology is not restricted to a specific program and can be used for a multitude of applications.  Using this innovative technology has the potential to decrease weight and cost of cabling and improve EMI shielding throughout every system.  With improved shielding capabilities, the amount of shielding required will be reduced, therefore reducing cost and weight.  For larger platforms, many miles of shielded cabling can run throughout an entire system and therefore a small reduction in the weight of shielded cables can lead to significant weight reduction.  One pound of weight savings can reduce launch cost by $10K.  For a large satellite weighing 15 tons, 1/3 of its weight is derived from copper wiring harnesses.  The Phase I program showed that by using nanomaterial shielding instead of metal shielding, weight was decreased by 20%.  By reducing the cabling weight by 20% in a 15 ton satellite, the launch cost would be reduced by $20M.  Additionally, current shielding materials consist of a braided metal and a film, which are assembled in two operations.  As such, assembly time and its associated cost can be reduced with the use of nanomaterials because the nanomaterial is one material applied in one step.  Due to the nature of the nanomaterials SDC has proposed, shielding coverage could improve because of the continuous nature of the nanomaterials.  Along with improved electrical performance due to the nanomaterials, improved thermal capabilities and lightning strike protection are also possible.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this proposed effort is to develop a Mid-level Manager (MLM) that automatically handles all aspects associated with GDPAAs, including global optimized assignment of communication requests to the GDPAAs and dish antennas, intelligent smart beam assignment, multi level beam compatibility checking, and beam active area route planning.  The ultimate system should outperform the existing software and human schedulers including better quality schedules; faster scheduling; handling larger, more complex sets of requests; and handling additional communication system capabilities, including multi-beam phased array antennas.  The developed system should show superior performance on AFSCN/GDPAA scheduling/route planning problems, and demonstrate significant benefit for human future AFSCN schedulers.  Each of the algorithms should be rigorously analyzed and have its most relevant properties proven, such as correctness, termination, and required conditions.  Integration requirements with ESD will be investigated.  The information content and timing between the MLM and the GDPAA managers will be determined.    BENEFIT:  The most direct target for the results of this effort is, of course, scheduling for the future AFSCN which will include GDPAAs and the other Space Communication Networks (DSN, GN, and SN).  By both demonstrating significantly improved performance during Phase II and ensuring that the ultimate results can be integrated into the operational scheduling systems, the Air Force will have a strong incentive to operationalize the Phase II development of the proposed MLM.  Beyond the Air Force and NASA there are several commercialization possibilities available in the government and private sector.  Additionally, there are many similarities between communication scheduling and sensor scheduling.  Thus the algorithms developed here could be marketed to our existing Air Force and Navy sensor customers interested in sensor scheduling and coordination.  Finally, there are the commercial applications for the technology developed for the Scheduler.  We are already marketing Aurora, our general intelligent planning and scheduling framework, and customizing it for a variety of domains.  The additional capabilities developed for communication scheduling can be synergistically marketed to the same clients.

        "abstract": "In phase 1, we have developed a holistic approach to systematically employ distributed sensor management techniques for large scale networks, with technical innovations on network utility optimization, efficient distributed computational methods, and robust and scalable information propagation. To attain predictive and responsive space situation awareness (SSA), the DCM team design, Awareness-based Compressed Data Collection and Dynamic Resource Management (ACDC-DRM), jointly addresses compressive and active sensing with network resource management in a unified manner, which represents an emerging data collection paradigm that is important, and indispensable in many cases, to the success of resource-constrained, large-scale sensor networks monitoring dynamic and/or localized phenomena. Our phase 1 work consists of: 1) compressive and active sensing algorithms for efficient data acquisition and reconstruction of a large-scale complex target-field, 2) in-network cooperative multi-sensor searching and tracking algorithm with information-based awareness metrics; and 3) game-theoretic dynamic sensor resource allocation approach for intelligent targets. In addition, a prototype based on open-source software has been implemented to illustrate the algorithms. In Phase II, we plan to coordinate with government POCs, academic researchers and industrial partners on research and development, as well as updating various open-standard database collection routines. We will also refine the key algorithms in our ACDC-DRM design, extend the system capability using theoretical performance guidelines quantified under various operating conditions, and develop an executive prototype for realistic network scenarios.    BENEFIT:  The first potential commercialization application is JSTAR and SAFIRE program. The second potential application is other DoD application such as ARL. The third potential application is AEGIS program and other programs where LM is the Prime Contractor. Lockheed Martin MS2 is prime contractor on the Aegis weapon system, the Littoral Combat Ship, and C2 lead for the DDG-1000 program. We have developed a strong and realistic plan to transition our technology to their programs. During the first stage of Phase II, LM MS2 will study and quantify through simulation and analysis how the ACDC-DRM can enhance the performance of their network centric platform. Assuming a successful Phase II, during the Phase III LM MS2 will build on the results of the Phase II work to implement and test the technology in real-world systems. Beyond the AEGIS first application, the innovations we are developing will improve situation awareness, planning, decision support for many military applications and we will aggressively pursue these other applications. As a metric of success, the technology is also applicable to commercial systems. Our target application will focus on disaster management, intelligent air traffic control system, and network defense.",

The need for placement accuracy from higher altitudes will be required as the P-8A Poseidon comes on line. Sonobuoy emplacement within historical required accuracies becomes nearly impossible when deployment occurs from high altitudes. Currently, to attain such accuracies, the P-3 must deploy sonobuoys at low altitudes. An air release point is calculated for each sonobuoy based on altitude and wind profile to achieve a desired splash point. Broadening this deployment methodology to include high altitude deployment above 20,000 ft (6100 m) would be insufficient because of the greatly increased amount of time each buoy would be airborne. Increased descent time increases error due to unknowns in the deployment environment which creates a splash point error that is too great for proper placement of deployed sonobuoys. SeaLandAire will address these issues while keeping changes to the package and production cost of the buoy to a minimum. Subsequently, added sensor systems, guidance and navigation systems, and/or other hardware must be kept simple and cost-effective to achieve the programs goals.",

Under the Phase I effort we developed a procedure for repairing existing meshes and performed proof of concept testing using several Navy provided test cases. These repair procedures can also be used to convert asymptotic meshes into full wave meshes. The primary goal of Phase II is to extend the proof of concept repair techniques developed in Phase I and implement them into a production version, user-friendly, stand-alone tool set for routine mesh repair and mesh conversion. The stand-alone gridding tool kit will also include a framework for full meshing capability that can go from CAD to mesh for complex configurations in about 2 hours.",

KaSPAR is a modular system with multiple temporal and cross-track baselines to fully characterize the scattering and statistics expected from SWOT, provide data for developing classification algorithms, and understanding instrument performance and limitations over the vast variety of scenes that SWOT will encounter (ie sea-ice, vegetation covered water, frozen/partially frozen rivers etc).  Furthermore a wide-swath (>5km) high-accuracy elevation mapping capability provides the necessary framework to translate traditional point or profile calibration/validation measurements to the spatial framework that SWOT will measure. Beyond SWOT, KaSPAR's unique 4D imaging capability (2D intensity, elevation and velocity mapping) can be uniquely applied to topography applications, local water resource management and monitoring, weather reconnaissance (e.g. floods & storm surge), electronic vision applications and much more.\nThe Phase II activities will build out a complete multichannel radar system to realize the potential of KaSPAR.  Key developments include the highly phase-stable high-bandwidth receivers, low-sidelobe antennas and integration with a high power (40W) solid-state power amplifier.  The modular, compact design will be compatible between platforms and is directly compatible without modification with two NASA King Air aircraft.

        "abstract": "The USAF requires accurate specification and forecast of thermospheric densities for LEO satellite orbit calculations. The JB2008 thermospheric density model provides the high accuracy densities, partly made possible by using the Dst index. Dst characterizes the energy input during geomagnetic storms and substorms. Because of JB2008''s advantages the USAF plans to operationally implement this model. Unfortunately, Dst is not provided with the operational robustness required for Air Force operations. In addition, Dst is produced outside the U.S. at the World Data Center Kyoto University facility. The USGS has recently developed an excellent comparative Dst index based on the same network of magnetic observatories as the ones used by the Kyoto Dst. This Phase II project will provide a real-time, fully redundant Dst production system demonstrated with 1-minute time granularity at the current epoch, with latencies of no more than 5 minutes, and with cadences of no more than 5 minutes. The system also has the goal of providing an accurate Dst forecast with time granularity of 1-minute up to 1 hour and 1-hour to 72-hours. The project team will develop, implement, and demonstrate this system at TRL 8 for the AFRL customer and the AFSPC JB2008 end user.

For example, the system would have significant application for improving high latitude accuracies in radar, radio communications, and navigation systems as a result of use by the GAIM system that has been implemented at AFWA. At the conclusion of Phase II the project will immediately roll over into Phase III activity, including the operational provision of the real-time and forecast Dst indices to AFSPC for use by JB2008. In Phase III, SET plans to market the real-time and forecast Dst to radio communications and navigation systems users through inclusion in the Utah State University (USU) GAIM system that is being commercialized under the USU USTAR initiative.

Authoritative sources supporting BC applications must be developed to satisfy dynamic needs of active units, incorporating features as they arise and are identified after initial deployment. Ultimately, the data models for these sources must be dynamic, allowing for modification without recompilation or redistribution. Furthermore, data model Software Development Kits (SDKs) should enable the design and development of applications that can effectively exploit dynamic updates to the model, also without recompilation. To ensure dynamic updates do not disrupt users of applications, it is essential to warn model architects of potential disruptions throughout the editing process. These capabilities support timely and non-disruptive distribution of updates while maintaining operational effectiveness, usefulness, interoperability, and multilevel security. Based on the results of our Phase I effort, we propose this Phase II effort to design and develop a full-scope prototype Dynamic Application and Model Updating System (DYNAMUS).

        "abstract": "Micro and nano satellites continue to play an increasing role in future military applications. New mission scenarios are driving the need for higher agility and thus for new actuators capable of meeting the higher torque requirements. In Phase 1, Honeybee Robotics developed a mature concept for a high torque, low power CMG-based attitude control actuator called TORC (Tiny Operationally Responsive CMG) for small satellites with challenging jitter requirements. Smaller and less power hungry, TORC actuators outperform reaction wheels by 1-2 orders of magnitude. In Phase 2, Honeybee proposes to build and test a number TORC EDU\u2019s to quantify torque output, jitter, power and their potential to meet the life requirement. A state-of-the-art nanosatellite test facility at Naval Postgraduate School will be used to characterize the TORC modules.   BENEFIT:  TORC is a modular high torque, low power CMG-based technology with the following benefits: \u2022 CMG Array Customization \u2013 The TORC module mechanical and electronic designs allow for the \u201ccustomer\u201d to configure the array of their choice (e.g., Box 90, Skew, Scissored Pairs, Roof) depending on their momentum envelope needs and other requirements (e.g., fault tolerance). \u2022 Flexible Packaging in Bus \u2013 Because the TORC modules are separate entities they can be placed just about anywhere where there\u2019s room in the bus (provided certain structural interface requirements are met).  This gives system designers more flexibility.  It is important to note that nothing about the design precludes assembling modules on a common frame and delivering as an integrated unit. \u2022 Self Contained, Swappable Modules \u2013 The self contained TORC modules are easily installed and replaced if necessary.  This can be an advantage in that it can mean fewer delays during AI&T if there are problems or something is damaged and also a smaller inventory is necessary since modules would be interchangeable. \u2022 Extensible (Scalable) \u2013 If more torque (momentum) is required, the controller design allows more TORC modules to be seamlessly added in parallel to effectively double, triple, etc. the capacity of or add redundancy to the CMG array.",

While the systems offer excellent performance and reliability they are large and heavy due to incorporation of waveguide-based switches, diplexers, and waveguide packaged solid-state power amplifiers.  Replacement of the waveguide components by micromachined parts that provide significant size, weight, and cost reduction without substantially affecting the electrical performance, can lead to a breakthrough in wireless communications.  During the Phase I program, Nuvotronics utilized its proprietary PolyStrataTM metal micromachining process to create X and Ka band filters with state-of-the-art performance.  During Phase II, tunable filters will be fabricated using the PolyStrata process and tuned using reliable and low actuation voltage MEMS devices.  The filters will be designed and tested for space operation and have immediate applications in the Deep Space Network communications system.  The PolyStrata process is capable of producing high Q, low weight and therefore compact filters.  The PolyStrata process is a new multi-layer technology that creates high quality air loaded copper microdevices.  High quality cavity resonator filters can be fabricated using this high precision micro-fabrication process, enabling very high Q filters while being compact, surface mountable and compatible with the integration of active chips.",

These materials have additional applications including:  EMI cable shielding, EMI/EMP electronics protection, preventing unwanted EMI emissions, highly conductive ground planes, and ESD layers. This proposal describes the continued development of very large, carbon nanotube sheets and panels that are CTE matched to graphite epoxy, nickel free, and exhibit excellent insertion loss in the 1 to 20 GHz region. The phase one program demonstrated that large nanotube rollstock could be manufactured and processed on commercial pre-preg equipment, using both BMI and toughened epoxy resins, and that the prepregs could subsequently be successfully fabricated into composites. This phase two program will bring large area nanotube materials to the pre-commercialization stage with the major milestone tasks being: (1) Optimization with required resin systems, including resin content, and repair/fairing indicator pigmentation  (2) Material certification properties testing , performance consistency, abrasive/corrosion environmental challenge testing, (3) Prepreg qualification, fabrication consistency, in-situ quality control, 4) Pre-launch readiness, range testing on commercial tooling demonstration articles,  and the delivery of a  fully characterized, cost reduced, 52-inch by 100-foot prepregged evaluation sample.   BENEFIT:  The proposed material can serve as a highly conductive light weight coating that has very low impedance in the 1 to 20 GHz region. It is also CTE matched to graphite, and is likely to be immune to corrosion in marine and other harsh environments. It has been shown that it can be handled in normal industrial manufacturing processes such as prepreg operations without major adjustments to normal manufacturing procedures. In addition, this material is free of nickel, is non-toxic and has broad military and civil applications. For example, EMI shielding of data or control cables with dramatically reduced weight and the ability to bond to graphite epoxy and therefore provide highly conductive layers. All of the envisioned applications for this material can be fabricated from 52-inch wide rolls of stock material. The areal density of the material required to achieve these properties is between 15 and 20 gsm and when prepregged, approximately 60-80 gsm.",

        "abstract": "Satellite intelligence information is being used increasingly for real-time operations.  This requires satellites that can be quickly tasked for new objectives and that can respond to opportunistic situations and external threats. The usefulness of satellites and satellite information would be increased if the satellites could respond quickly and effectively with limited ground operator interaction.  In addition, because satellites are increasingly important to modern warfare they also face increasing threats from anti-satellite weapons. Thus, they need a means to effectively and autonomously respond to these threats.  This proposal offers an integrated planning and scheduling architecture for autonomously managing satellite missions called the Highly Autonomous Mission Manager for Event Response (HAMMER) system.  The HAMMER system will allow a satellite to operate and respond to threats even when it is not in communication with the ground or when time constraints require immediate response to threats.  The HAMMER system will attempt to meet mission objectives even in the face of threats.   HAMMER will prioritize multiple, competing user goals and requests and determine an optimal ordering of satellite tasks to conserve resources and maximize capability.  HAMMER will also ensure that the plan is safe from known threats to the satellite.   BENEFIT:  This proposal will produce a collection of software components that will enable the automation of vehicles such as satellites, unmanned vehicles (e.g., unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), etc.), and manned vehicles (e.g., aircraft, spacecraft, ships, etc.).

This modeling tool is a package that integrates thermodynamic databases for the gas phase and silica-oxide EBC systems, and robust computer software dealing with complicated systems involving gas, oxide liquid and solid. With this modeling tool, we can predict the phase stability and compatibility of EBCs with the SiC-based substrate, the durability and high temperature capability of a selected EBC, the volatility of the SiO2 scale, and the recession of the SiC-based ceramic materials under given combustion environment. All this information provides valuable guidance for the intelligent selection of EBCs of CMCs, which is crucial for the development of next generation hot section structural components. CompuTherm, LLC has significant capabilities for developing modeling tools from its past experience with software and thermodynamic databases development. In Phase I, have demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed approach by developing a tool for a simplified model system, whilst a powerful tool, which can be applied to practical complicated system, will be developed in Phase II.  BENEFIT:  A major breakthrough in gas turbine engine performance requires a new generation of hot section structural materials having a temperature capability considerably higher than current metallic hot section structural materials. Si-based ceramics, such as ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), exhibit superior high-temperature strength and durability, indicating their potential to revolutionize gas turbine engine technology. However, their usage as turbine engine hot-section components is limited due to their lack of environmental durability in high velocity combustion environments. Development of advanced EBCs for CMCs is therefore an essential, yet challenging task for materials scientists/engineers due to the complexity of the system. Traditional trial-and-error approach is costly and time-consuming, computational approach, on the other hand, becomes more and more important in materials development/enhancement and durability assessment. Successful completion of the proposed work will provide the US Air Force, other federal agencies, aerospace, and related industries with a valuable tool to accelerate the development of advanced environmental barrier coatings (EBCs) for ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) to be used in combustion environment. In addition, research centers such as government laboratories and universities will find this tool useful for basic materials research. This will result in significant cost savings for the US government and aerospace industry in the development of next generation hot section structural materials.",

Prior to encapsulation plating round or other cross section tubes are inserted thru holes in the plastic foam so that they are incorporated into the electroformed mirror structure when the master is encapsulated with more NiP. The tubes which connect the front and back surfaces of the mirror are made by electroforming with the same NiP alloy. The finished mirror substrate will be diamond turned and the very low cutting force diamond turning process will allow fabrication of a very thin mirror face plate without print through since there is only a very low pressure on the mirror from diamond turning.

Input from each sensor will be automatically rejected once its output becomes invalid, using algorithms based on the real time evaluation of image content. Different sensors will have different rejection points so the maximum information about the landing area will be gained when the last sensor is no longer contributing to the data base. The last acquired high-quality imagery from the sensor, appropriately registered to the terrain, will persist and provide content past the point of no performance for the particular sensor. A second innovative feature will be the definition, detection and pictorial depiction of obstacles in a highly detailed fashion commensurate with the quality of the combined sensor data. The SVS will present ground truth imagery to the pilot during the final seconds of brownout landing when sensors are ineffective. Our approach to the display of terrain and obstacle information is to begin with realistic synthetic rendering of the landing area that may be augmented by adding or enhancing visual features of the scene and the inclusion of alphanumeric information, if necessary.",

        "abstract": "Wound-related pathogens (WRPs) are a major challenge affecting the care of injured soldiers. Infection caused by WRPs can lead to mortality in the event rapid identification and medical diagnosis of wound-related bloodstream infections is not accomplished in a timely fashion. However, limited options exist for field-deployable medical diagnostic instrumentation to rapidly detect WRPs before associated infections become systematic. Current methods for WRP diagnostics require trained technicians and a dedicated laboratory space to perform the necessary assays and cultures. In contrast, the rapidly evolving field of genetic diagnostics promises greater sensitivity and the ability to perform complex nucleic acid extraction and detection on a diverse range of pathogenic species in a simple testing environment. The rate limiting steps in multiplex genetic diagnostics now rest on extraction/collection of the target nucleic acid sequences and the ability to perform high sensitivity binding affinity assessment with a minimal number of processing steps. In order to ensure that treatment is provided as rapid as possible, methods that will enable compact, highly multiplexed testing of genetic information, be it human or microbial, in a field deployable device is required. To this end, Nanohmics proposes to develop NucleoVolt SNAP (Simple Nucleic Acid Profiler), a multiplex genetic diagnostics platform for Wound-Related Pathogen (WRP) detection.",

        "abstract": "QuinStar Technology proposes to develop an ultra-linear, 1-watt solid-state power amplifier (SSPA) operating at 44 GHz with a power-added efficiency (PAE) of greater than 30%. To accomplish these goals we will 1) develop a new high-efficiency MMIC with an efficiency of greater than 40% and 2) develop a digital linearization network that linearizes the MMIC characteristics while maintaining its efficiency over a wide dynamic range. We are proposing to team with TriQuint Semiconductor for the MMIC development and the University of California at San Diego (UCSD) for the linearizer development. This alliance brings together the leading U.S. GaAs foundry with the acknowledged leader in digital linearization techniques. During Phase I, we have demonstrated the validity of our approach by using computer simulations and experimental measurements with commercial MMICs. We have also designed and simulated a 1.5W MMIC operating at 44 GHz with a PAE of over 40%. This is SOA. Using this MMIC in a simulator, we have demonstrated our linearization method with ACPR levels well below -40 dBc and efficiencies approaching 40%. Further, using commercial MMICs operating at 44 GHz, we have demonstrated ACPR improvements of 40 dB and efficiency improvements as high as a factor of 5.  BENEFIT:  The technology developed under this program will address the market for high-efficiency, linear power amplifiers, not only for this MILSATCOM application, but also for satellite/spacecraft communications and applications operating in the radar bands (33 to 38 GHz). This work could also be important for the Army\u2019s SATCOM On the Move (OTM) program. We estimate that the market for Ka/Q-band power amplifiers (space-based, SATCOM and radar) is in the range of $50M per year and growing rapidly. The Air Force is currently developing a communications system operating at E-band frequencies (71-76 GHz), which requires linear power amplifiers. The efficiency and linearity requirements for this amplifier are similar to those for the proposed Q-band amplifier, and consequently, the E-band program could benefit from this proposed Phase II program. In particular, the linearization techniques developed under this program could be applied directly to the E-band linear amplifier application. This linearization technology is not limited to military or government applications, but can be applied to other linear power amplifier applications such as downlinks for commercial satellites, linear power amplifiers for cellular base stations, etc.",

This development utilizes proven fiber optic sensor technology that integrates active thermal compensation with a highly accurate, multi-channel sensing network.

        "abstract": "With the continued improvements in body armor, and the disturbing increase in explosive offensives in modern combat, more of our wounded soldiers are surviving their injuries and there has been a considerable increase in the military amputee population.  Modern prosthetics have improved significantly with regards to control and functionality, but the fit of the residual limb within a prosthetic socket is a primary concern for many amputees. A poor fit can lead to skin irritation, tissue breakdown, and pain.  The volume of an amputee\u2019s residual limb changes throughout the course of a day and/or throughout the year.  Volume fluctuation within the socket can lead to issues for the amputee, including decreased comfort, increased shear forces, increased pressure on bony prominences, as well as a poor gait pattern. An uncomfortable or non-performing socket/residual limb interface decreases user compliance with the prosthetic and therefore decreases the activity level of amputees who want to remain active in their civilian and military lives.   The Infoscitex team proposes a multilayered socket that takes advantage of a novel braided material for strength and allows for adjustable conformability throughout the course of the day, with cooling patches dedicated to improving wearer comfort by managing moisture.  This new socket provides ultimate fit for improvement in the performance of the prosthesis. The socket adapts itself to the changing physical shape of the residual limb as the prosthesis is worn during ambulation, and passively conforms to volume fluctuations throughout the day.  The materials are lightweight, breathable, and allow the prosthetic to function in a variety of environments.",

Their purpose is to reduce weight through part count reduction and improve performance and maintainability. However, to maintain affordability, the need for weld repairs of either partial or full blades is warranted to avoid expensive IBR/blisk replacements resulting from foreign object damage (FOD) to the airfoils. No adequate technology exists today to repair fielded engines. For alloys commonly used in fans and compressors, current pre- and/or post-weld heat treatment practices, as part of the repair of airfoils, result in unacceptable micro-structural degradation in the highly stressed disk portion of the IBRs/blisks. Exposing the undamaged airfoils to needless heat treatment at every repair leads to significant reduction in their structural capability. Thus a novel and enabling weld repair technology that will permit independent repair and optimization of airfoil and disk material properties is proposed to retain and restore the high cycle fatigue (HCF) characteristics of IBRs/blisks.

        "abstract": "Aircraft wheels are subject to high energy braking events and harsh operating conditions. Constant improvements are being sought in key material properties for this demanding application in order to enable component weight reductions and reduce life-cycle costs. In the Phase I SBIR program, QuesTek Innovations LLC, applied its Materials by Design\u00ae technology to the design and development of a new aircraft wheel alloy. Following its design methodology, QuesTek designed a low-cost alternative to 2014 having better strength and ductility, equivalent corrosion, and better expected fatigue performance. During the proposed Phase II SBIR program, QuesTek will optimize and finalize Phase I alloy designs for high performance aircraft wheels. To ensure a commercialization path for the technology developed during this SBIR, QuesTek\u2019s alloy development program will involve an original aircraft wheel manufacturer (OEM), and an experienced aircraft wheel forging house. The potent partnership of an alloy designer (QuesTek), an aluminum forging supplier, and an OEM wheel manufacturer increases the potential for the commercial success and implementation of QuesTek\u2019s new alloy. The Phase II program will culminate with the demonstration of substantial improvement in key material properties in full-scale die-forged wheels over incumbent alloy 2014 wheels to justify alloy adoption.  BENEFIT:  The inability of alloy 2014 to sustain mechanical strength after prolonged exposure to high temperatures during service is a critical issue. The new proprietary ALCOA alloy 2040 has better performance over alloy 2014, but its high-cost is a critical barrier to implementation. The anticipated outcome of the SBIR program is a new 2xxx-type aluminum alloy for aircraft wheel applications, with improved ambient strength, similar strength retention, better corrosion behavior, and better fatigue performance over incumbent alloy 2014, at same or similar cost. An alloy with better mechanical performance over alloy 2014, at same or similar cost, results in component weight reduction, and improved durability.  The improved fatigue resistance of the new alloy enables reduced life-cycle costs. The low alloy cost will be achieved by using standard aluminum alloying additions, standard processing techniques, and by licensing the alloy to multiple suppliers. In addition to military aerospace applications, the commercial aviation sector, as well as the automotive sector will greatly benefit from a high-strength, thermally-stable aluminum alloy. Potential applications of QuesTek\u2019s new alloy (in addition to aircraft wheels) will likely include other common uses of 2014, such as military vehicles, truck frames, truck hubs, tank wheels, transport bridges and other structural applications.",

A unique feature of ZA\u2019s cancellation system is that it requires no input cables carrying RFI reference signals.

        "abstract": "The primary purpose of the KCF Technologies Retractable UUV Antenna Buoy with Smart Tether GPS is to allow RF communication and GPS position update for a UUV without surfacing the vehicle. This can be done periodically by alternately surfacing and retracting the antenna, or the antenna can remain deployed while the UUV is operating, allowing constant communication during an operation. An additional benefit is the inclusion of the KCF\u2019s Smart Tether technology, which uses orientation sensors embedded in the antenna tether to perform an accurate shape calculation of the tether, thereby allowing a position correction to eliminate watch-circle error. Thus, when the antenna is deployed, the UUV position can be determined more accurately than is possible with GPS alone. The SBIR funding will be used to refine the design of the prototype fabricated during Phase I for 21\u201d UUVs and to develop a compact design to be used in smaller UUVs. The SBIR funding will also be used to fabricate a fully-integrated prototype to be installed in a production UUV and demonstrated in a relevant environment.",

The design will attempt to counter both thermal effects and nonlinear-optical limits set by Raman or Brillouin scattering. We will support our design work with experimental studies of the fundamental properties of Tm-doped silica fibers, in particular, absorption in the long-wavelength region beyond 1900-nm, where we would pump the final laser stage. Within the resource limits of a Phase II program, we would design and construct a sub-scale fiber-laser system to test and refine our resonant-pumping design. An additional Phase II effort would be to conduct experiments to better understand the thermal limits set by the fiber polymer coating. This continues to be important because in the proposed design the pump laser would still employ a polymer optical cladding to achieve high numerical aperture for 790-nm, diode-laser pumping. One result of the proposed work will be a design for a 20-kW Tm:fiber laser, which could be actualized through follow-on funding.

        "abstract": "Accurate threat detection is required by workers in search-and-rescue and disaster relief operations.  These threats come from chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) agents as well as electrical hazardous and air quality threats.  This proposal focuses on furthering the Phase I system design and the construction of prototype multifunctional detection systems specifically for collection, speciation, identification and quantification of multiple gas phase chemicals, quantification of radioactive threats and several atmospheric threats. This ambitious, multidisciplinary program will utilize multiple sensor technologies to meet the requirements of the solicitation, including individual low cost detectors, such as chemicapacitive, metal-oxide, and electrochemical sensors, and more integrated technologies which have already been proven in other applications.  In Phase I Seacoast Science investigated several detection technologies and has selected several for inclusion in the Phase II prototype system.  Seacoast proposes to integrate these systems into a single portable, hand-held, robust prototype with an easy-to-use interface.  Chemical sensors will be tested with Seacoast\u2019s preconcentration and chromatography system; thus combining selectivity from a diverse array of sensors with a miniature sampling system for amplified sensitivity.   BENEFIT:  The product proposed here could be used to by civilian and military search-and-rescue and disaster-relief workers to detect threats in area where CBRNE, electrical and atmospheric threats may exist.  Once developed into a standalone system, device has very broad relevance in a number of other government and civilian applications.  For example, these sensors may be used in any application for monitoring a variety of chemical targets where a premium is placed on early detection.  The low cost, low power consumption and small size of this technology is expected to enable penetration of market space previously inaccessible to sensor systems.  Portability makes this system more likely to be effective in rescue efforts over rough terrain.  There are an estimated 2 million first responders in the United States (police, fire fighter, and military).  Assuming that 10% of the US first responder market purchase only one of the proposed systems, i.e. 1-3 system per department-level organization, the total market space is estimated to be at least $10 million.",

By using NGS survey markers, with centimeter-leve position accuracy, as test sites, we expect to create a truth model for both absolute and relative position measurements that is essentially error free (relative to the LNS accuracy), thus allowing very accurate characterization of both random and systematic errors for both absolute and relative position measurements.  This unambiguous characterization of the total error will allow validation (or correction) of the navigation error models and assessment of system performance with a high level of confidence.  Additionally, the LNS prototype hardware is sufficiently small (roughly shoebox size with a laptop PC for data collection) and easy to set up (put on a tripod over the NGS marker), that it can easily be taken to multiple test locations.  Finally, a detailed technology roadmap will be created showing how the TRL 6 LNS can be raised to TRL 9, ready for flight.",

        "abstract": "The future of monopropellant thrusters is moving towards high performance green propellants based on hydroxyammonium nitrate (HAN) and ammonium dinitramide (ADN). Ideally, a multimode propulsion system will include a higher specific impulse thruster for maneuvers that require propellant conservation to complement a higher thrust chemical thruster, with both thrusters utilizing the same propellant.  We propose to develop an electric thruster that operates on almost any monopropellant, while maintaining high performance over a wide range of operation.  The key to success is the elimination of the catalyst bed, shown to be a hindrance for both high performance (HAN, ADN) chemical thrusters and electric propulsion.  Elimination of the cat bed should also increase the throttling capabilities of the electric propulsion engine.  This catalyst-free thruster will also overcome thermal and life issues of the catalyst bed and allow for utilization of almost any propellant imagined. In Phase I we successfully demonstrated the operation of our electrically catalyzed thruster operating on a surrogate monopropellant.  Key technical challenges for Phase II include the liquid propellant injector and feed system.  We have organized a well thought-out plan to attack and solve these issues early in the development, culminating in a complete green propellant electrothermal thruster system.    BENEFIT:  The US Military has a current requirement for multimode propulsion.  Successful development of an electric propulsion thruster operating on a chemical monopropellant satisfies the need for higher specific impulse thruster to complete the multimode propulsion concept.  In addition, any spacecraft that requires high delta-v could benefit from such a thruster. Non space propulsion applications include chemical processing and gas generators for aircraft APUs.",

Significant development is called for in the area of devices and structures that tolerate or mitigate the presence of lunar dust. Honeybee Robotics seeks to develop a scalable dust-tolerant, autonomous utility connector for lunar surface system applications with a focus on small pressurized rover recharge. Honeybee has heritage in developing mechanisms for extreme, dusty environments. There are many near-term applications of such a connector including: the utility and electrical connections that will be used on the next-generation lunar EVA suit, cryogenic utility connections that will be used to pass liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen during in-situ resource utilization activities, and high-power electrical connectors capable of thousands of cycles for the Lunar Electric Rover (LER) battery recharge and data transfer functions.

        "abstract": "The proposed Phase II SBIR will design, analyze, produce and test a protoflight unit for a Low Cost De-orbiting System.  The proposed de-orbit module is a high reliability, modular, aero-blanket system that de-orbits a 180 kg spacecraft from an 800 km orbit to meet DOD Instruction 3100.12 for a 25 year de-orbit time.  The de-orbit system uses common space flight qualified mechanical elements and materials to control costs while maintaining high reliability.  The system requires redundant heater circuits from the spacecraft to initiate deployment.  There is no power requirement from the spacecraft other than the deploy signal.  The system is housed in a modular housing for easy integration into a variety of AF missions with no changes.  The design fits within the available envelope inside a Mark II Lightband mounted on an ESPA ring though the design is scalable.   Blanket based designs have been proposed and flown using flat blankets and carpenter tapes or other devices to deploy the aero-blanket.  Often these systems require an additional deployment to achieve spacecraft passive stability.  The proposed concept resulting from this SBIR uses an innovative pyramidal blanket to achieve passive stability and improved stiffness while maintaining simplicity and lower costs over previous systems.   BENEFIT:  Due to the nature of the atmosphere and parameters that affect the atmospheric drag, the proposed system will reduce de-orbit times by a factor of 10 to 40 times faster than satellites undergoing natural orbit decay. As an example, a 180 kg satellite that would not meet the 25-year de-orbit requirement naturally in a 700 km orbit, will meet the 25 year de-orbit requirement with margin with the proposed system. As part of the scalable aspect of our solution, MMA Design proposes to develop an analysis suite to tailor the solution to an entire class of satellites and desired de-orbit times. At the conclusion of the Phase II effort MMA will have completed the qualification of an ESPA class de-orbit system and have a protoflight de-orbit module available for a flight test mission. Potential commercial applications for the de-orbit product line include Iridium NEXT and associated ESPA opportunities, next generation ORBCOMM and WORLDVIEW, Cicero, and a host of other smaller class spacecraft.",

A disturbance will be generated based on the predictions for aero-optics distortion for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).  The adaptive optics system will use a liquid crystal spatial light modulator (LCSLM) instead of a continuous surface deformable mirror (DM).  A wave optics simulation including models of the EBS and LCSLM will be validated against the laboratory experiment and used to predict performance of an operational system.

This greatly reduces the aero-optical distortion in addition to reducing weight and power requirements and improving the aerodynamics of the aircraft.  Use of the LCSLM instead of the DM further reduces weight and power.

        "abstract": "Many IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried near roadways and exploded days or weeks after the emplacement. Digging a hole for IED emplacement and then refilling the hole fundamentally changes the heat transfer in the disturbed soil compared with surrounding undisturbed soil. This change is persistent for days, weeks and possibly longer and provides observable thermal contrast with infrared sensors. Thermal clutter signals arising from numerous nearby objects can compete with and obscure the buried IED signal. Fortunately, basic differences in heat transfer between clutter objects and buried IEDs result in periods during the 24 hour diurnal cycle where the clutter is low and the IED signal is observable. During these periods, the resulting probability of detecting buried IEDs is highest. We propose to develop a prototype software tool, E-SEARCH that incorporates physics-based heat transfer models of disturbed soils and clutter objects and predicts when detection is most probable based on weather forecast inputs. Requiring minimal operator attention and running on standard PC platforms in less than fifteen minutes, E-SEARCH will enable the warfighters to schedule valuable sensor assets efficiently thereby minimizing wasted efforts when probability of detecting an IED is low. We believe E-SEARCH will improve warfighter survivability.",

The current degree to which weapon sight imagery and data are improving dismounted soldiers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 SA is limited due to the cabling and connectors which tie the integrated sensors to the helmet mounted display (HMD). These cables and connectors restrict mobility, are a source of failure, and can present in-field hazards to the soldier. Replacing the wired connections with a wireless link(s) is thus a logical choice. An adequate cable-replacement solution will exhibit excellent Low Probability of Detection (LPD) and Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) performance, has sufficient bandwidth for current and upcoming high-frequency/high-resolution imagery and other sensors, supports many users in close proximity without cross-interference, is jam-resistant, has minimal latency, and provides guaranteed information assurance. Recent advances in Ultra-Wideband (UWB) RF technology have yielded available transceivers capable of meeting the desired attributes of the above described WPAN. By coupling an UWB transciever with the appropriate support circuitry, a cable-replacement solution is realizable that matches the data throughput, performance and security of a cabled solution without any of its shortcomings.

The proposed Phase II program shall bring microstructure-sensitive computational tools and approaches for reliable property prediction and lifing of advanced hot-section turbine disk materials.  We have already entered in to a partnership with an OEM, Rolls-Royce, under an NDA.  We shall work closely with Rolls-Royce to transition the prediction tools and apply those tools to a component.  At the end of the Phase II programs, we anticipate licensing modeling tools to our partner and continue to refine the products in the years following.",

        "abstract": "Electron Beam Direct Manufacturing (EBDM) has the potential to significantly reduce cost and lead times for such DoD systems as the F-35, if closed loop process control can be implemented.   This effort outlines a pragmatic yet effective means of achieving this closed loop control, one that will expand the realm of applications for EBDM significantly.  The approach described herein uses commercial off the shelf (COTS) sensors, but has significant process knowledge and process intelligence embedded into a stand-alone process monitoring and control device.  No real-time sensors reside in the chamber, thereby greatly reducing the complexity of the interfacing tasks. This current effort will prove the efficacy of this sensing and control approach, but will also demonstrate the technique on a prototypical part mockup that has some common geometric features with actual F-35 parts.  Although initially targeted to benefit the F-35, the closed loop system we have proposed herein has very broad applications to virtually any critical component fabrication including aerospace, conventional munitions, and naval applications.   BENEFIT:  This project will result in dramatic improvements in aircraft and aeroengine prototyping, rapid product development, and even LRIP \u2013 low rate initial production. Also the associated lead times for flight hardware will drop from over one year to less than three months for new designs.  The logistical implications for both OEM and spare parts are tremendously favourable. It is anticipated that such tremendous cost, lead time and productivity benefits will also accrue to other titanium parts for other defence applications as well as commercial aviation, or to any application that utilizes large, high quality titanium parts. Also, the same methodology could be adapted to steel, monel and aluminium bronze parts, thereby similarly revolutionizing the supply chain for critical naval spares.",

        "abstract": "Military bases provide power to a wide variety of electrical loads including life saving equipment and advanced communication systems. During periods of increased power demand, these bases can be significantly underpowered and vehicles should be available to supplement power. Making use of exported vehicle power will benefit the Army by reducing need for generators, which will have positive impact on logistics, saving time and money. Conclusion: exported vehicle power is important to the U.S. Military. Likewise, military vehicles contain subsystems including advanced surveillance equipment and defense weaponry. These vehicle subsystems should be functional without running the vehicle or using the vehicle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s batteries. Additionally, as vehicles advance towards plug-in electric configurations, they will need to recharge from the grid. Making use of imported power will reduce vehicle fuel consumption, yet still provide the protection of vehicle-based defense systems. Conclusion: imported vehicle power is important to the U.S. Military. Vehicle power export / import solution will provide our soldiers with robust power options. Vehicle-grid interaction must occur safely, without impacting the primary vehicle mission. Power management, control, and integration within the vehicle and with the microgrid are keys to enabling robust and safe vehicle-grid interaction.",

Users will be able to associate outside data with the risk information to support the decisions made regarding the risks. Users will also be able to plan mitigation strategies for the risks, to plan risk mitigation strategies across multiple missions, and to balance the interactions between risk mitigation strategies on a single mission.

Such windows serve as primary protection for sensitive multi-band electro-optic instrumentation or sensors in aerospace platforms (missile, aircraft, UAV, rotorcraft, etc.).  It is critical in most of these applications that the hyperspectral window resist erosion from raindrops and dust encountered during flight, and that spectral transmittance is not degraded as a result.  Multispectral Cleartran windows have poor erosion resistance and so a protective coating is required for applications where impact with sand, dust, or raindrops is anticipated.  Furthermore, the relatively high refractive index of Cleartran windows causes significant reflection losses at each material interface, unless special anti-reflective coatings are applied.  Nanohmics proposes an applied research program with the aim of creating and characterizing a patterned surface for Cleartran windows that reduces optical reflections over a broad spectral range, in addition to providing enhanced protection from rain and sand erosion.  BENEFIT:  The continued design and development of coating and patterning technology and the successful construction and demonstration of initial prototype hyperspectral windows to provide to development/manufacturing partners for airborne testing are the overall goals of the program.  Technical success will lead to sales of window components to defense system contractors for advanced sensors, seekers, and airborne surveillance platforms.",

Advanced Optical Systems, Inc. (AOS), together with partners Technology Systems, Inc. (TSI) and Raytheon IDS, have joined together to propose APSTAAT. APSTAAT is a system for autonomous persistent surveillance for the asymmetric air and surface threats. APSTAAT provides threat ID and allow a single operator to act as an entire watch team, supporting optimized manning concepts. The system will provide persistent surveillance even during times when the ship is at a relaxed readiness condition. APSTAAT consists of three software/hardware modules that can combine as a stand-alone system or it can be integrated into the existing DDG 1000 system design or other surface combatants. These modules include: an Object Recognition System, and Expert System, and an Augmented Reality Display. APSTAAT accepts inputs from the wide variety of existing sensors. APSTAAT finds and assesses the threats, fuses and geo-registers the data in an augmented reality view, and hands off precision targeting data to weapons mounts. This powerful combination gives the commander unparalleled situational awareness and the edge he needs to win the fight.",

This work showed a technique of reverse pumping to mitigate Four-Wave Mixing (FWM) and Cross-Phase Modulation (XPM) in fiber amplifiers. In Phase II we propose to extend the modeling developed in Phase-I to include time-dependent dynamic effects to understand observed stability and mode-locking phenomena. We propose to employ the two 1kW fiber amplifiers at the Albuquerque Northrop Grumman site to validate theoretical predictions of this work. The modeling effort should provide better understanding and assessment of passive phasing fiber systems and help in improving the performance of these systems.

        "abstract": "Beam combining is considered as the most promising approach for creation of high power 100 kW-class portable electric lasers. Passive coherent beam combining is based on mixing of output fields of a multichannel laser device, selection of proper combination of transverse and longitudinal modes for feedback to all channels, and some nonlinear mechanisms of phase locking of radiation in different channels. An approach proposed in Phase 1 is based on the unique properties of volume Bragg gratings (VBGs) recorded in a photo-thermo-refractive (PTR) glass which are widely used for spectral and angular locking of different types of lasers, spectral beam combining, and agile beam steering. These elements show both unique spectral and angular selectivity combined with unprecedented for diffractive optical elements tolerance to high power laser radiation. Study of thick VBGs with different tilts of grating vector in respect to the normal to the surface of PTR glass slabs (including corner grating where a diffracted beam crosses a lateral surface) enabled a demonstration of coherent radiation from two fiber lasers coupled by means of a VBG which provides radiation exchange between channels. The proposed Phase II project will deliver a mathematical modeling of a multichannel system (up to 16 channels) with passive coherent combining by volume VBGs, multichannel volume Bragg beam combiners with a number of combined beams up to 16, and multichannel laser systems providing high efficiency coherent beam combining. Year one demonstration of 4-channel combining will be produced at laser laboratory in OptiGrate. Year two demonstration of 16-channel combining will be produced at the fiber laser testbed at AFRL.

The system will support CORBA, DDS and SOAP middleware messaging systems necessary to support modern aircraft and network architectures of the USAF Mobility Air Force (MAF) and Air Force Expeditionary Force (AEF) to aid in maturation of RWR geolocation threat detection and avoidance concepts. A goal of the proposed system is to leverage existing work and experience and amalgamate them with the new developments which are proposed in this program.  Phase II of the proposed effort will integrate prior Team-developed products, including existing AFRL tools and simulators, existing receiver hardware, situational awareness software, advanced detection, tracking and geolocation algorithms and existing EA/ES/EP techniques.

        "abstract": "The US Air Force needs a system to help identifying root-causes of jitter in HEL beam alignment systems. This is of particular interest to the USAF as jitter smears the HEL beam on target, reducing its integrated intensity and therefore its target damage capability. Jitter is caused by several disturbances introduced in the beam alignment system with multiple sources and complex interactions between the multitude of sub-systems and components. With the current state-of-the art it is not possible to unequivocally identify sources of jitter from the analysis of the jitter signal alone. Rather, a comprehensive, yet streamlined and efficient, test plan to map the relevant sub-systems/components is required.  A process has been established using strategic measurement techniques and advanced signal processing algorithms to quantify the jitter sources and paths in a consistent and accurate manner.  This process will be further developed by testing on a variety of different HEL beam control installations to ensure the algorithms are optimized to effectively address jitter in all applications.  The algorithms and test process with then be developed into a \u201cJitter Vibration Decomposition Toolbox\u201d software program to allow increased efficiency for testing personnel to perform jitter analysis.  BENEFIT:  The primary objective of this Phase II project is to deliver to the USAF test and signal analysis tools to decompose beam jitter into its most important contributions.  The immediate benefit is for time and cost savings during the integration phase of an HEL system when much of the jitter root-cause investigation takes place.  The improvement in testing efficiency and more applicable output will lead to the supplier base implementing updated test procedures to impact their design process with updated models and more informed design decisions.

These include increased efficiency, reduced vibration and reductions in overall system mass and power consumption. For the small coolers required, pulse tube and Stirling coolers offer the best opportunities. At present, the efficiency of these coolers is limited by the effectiveness of low-temperature-stage regenerators. Below about 60 K, two factors play key roles in reducing the effectiveness of regenerators. One is that the heat capacity of most materials falls rapidly with decreasing temperature, thereby, severely limiting the number of useful materials to a few in common use. A second factor is that these commonly used materials are only available in powder form, a form known to raise reliability issues. In this effort, we will address both factors. We will use newly developed materials with high heat capacities at temperatures below 80 K, higher than that of commonly used materials. Further, we will develop novel low-temperature regenerator matrix configurations that will address both the aspect of high-efficiency and regenerator durability.

Furthermore, mobile networks are composed of heterogeneous nodes with different capabilities and limitations and goals, each of which needs to be taken into consideration during service discovery. In addition, discovered services can be very similar to one another and thus mobile nodes are faced with the fact that they need to evaluate and differentiate between available options. All of these issues complicate discovery process and require thoughtful and comprehensive design that takes these characteristic into account and delivers scalable and fault tolerant solution. During Phase II we will enhance peer-to-peer collaboration by protocols allowing nodes to customize service discovery protocol, service advertisement protocol and advertisement caching protocol.

(MEI) and the Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) propose to develop and demonstrate a microchannel methanation reactor based on nanofabricated catalysts.  Our innovative approach of combining microchannel reactor technology with nanofabricated catalysts provides the synergy between these two emerging technologies with the potential to enhance reaction efficiency by orders of magnitude.  This improvement in efficiency leads to more compact and lower mass reactor systems.  Thermal and mass diffusion distances in microchannel reactors range from tens to hundreds of microns versus tens to hundreds of millimeters in conventional reactors.  Slow heat and mass transfer dominate the operation of conventional reactor designs, thus limiting reaction kinetics.  As is well known, catalytic efficiency increases with decreasing catalyst particle size (reflecting higher surface area per unit mass) and chemical reactivity frequently is enhanced at the nanoscale.  By virtue of their nanoscale dimensions, nanotubes and nanorods geometrically restrict the catalyst particle size that can be supported upon the tube walls.  By confining catalyst particles to sizes smaller than the CNT diameter, a more uniform catalyst particle size distribution may be maintained.  The high dispersion provided by the vast surface area of the nanoscale material serves to retain the integrity of the catalyst by reducing sintering or coalescence.  To maximize catalyst exposure, our design includes hierarchical support structures, consisting of a 3-d network of open pores within the microreactor structure, and finally the nanofabricated support.  Additional advantages of the hierarchical catalyst support structure include minimal pressure drop (while providing superior catalyst contact) without the need to resort to fluidized bed configurations.",

BENEFITS: The Government desires a high resolution LWIR imager that costs not more than $1,000 per copy in production quantities. The low cost and high resolution will enable a much wider use of thermal imagers in military applications and would result in a major improvement in the thermal sensor market. These advantages plus the low power consumption of the new technology will enable greater application in Special Operations Forces (SOF) unattended ground sensor systems.",

        "abstract": "Many current United States Navy (USN) OPSIT/TACSIT scenarios comprise demanding dynamic environments for airborne sensors. The ability to task or mode interleave with adaptive scheduling is essential to achieving desired sensor/mission effectiveness. Both active electronically scanned array (AESA) and conventional mechanically scanned antenna (MSA) airborne multi-mode radar systems will require energy timeline resource management to realize their full performance capabilities. Real-time adaptive optimization of AESA control and scheduling over the implicitly large number of degrees of freedom is computationally impractical without sufficient constraints. In contrast, non-adaptive legacy resource management approaches rely exclusively on rule-based constrained methodologies that relax computational concerns, but significantly under utilize radar energy timeline resources. LSI proposes to extend the work currently being performed under our N06-123 effort that is building a modular framework to develop and evaluate sensor resource management (RM) concepts. We will also leverage the results of our recently completed N05-006 effort entitled \u201cRadar Detection and Discrimination of Small Maritime Targets at High Altitude and Grazing Angle that examined simultaneous multi-target tracking and discrimination (MTT&D) through the inclusion of target features within an interactive multiple model/multiple hypothesis tracking (IMM/MHT) framework [1]. The connection between the RM and MTT&D lies in the desire to adaptively control sensor revisit and dwell time as needed, to maintain desired track quality and target discrimination. LSI will incorporate a MTT&D functional understanding and the associated performance attributes in the RM through the use of metadata. The overall proposed effort to develop and evaluate hybrid rule-based constrained optimization techniques for real-time adaptive optimization of airborne AESA and MSA control/scheduling involves many technical areas that are applicable to specific USN AESA radar sensors planned for the BAMS and VT-UAV platforms.",

The objective of the proposed project is to use single-layer metamaterial metal/dielectric composites to develop multiwavelength polarimetric focal plane arrays (FPAs) that far exceed performance requirements for ACE and CLARREO, while reducing costs through component integration. Phoebus's metamaterial films are an enabling technology and can be used to develop high spectral resolution, low-crosstalk components for other NASA missions, such as GEO-CAPE, as well as transparent metal contacts for high-efficiency sensors and solar cells. Phoebus's metamaterial films can eliminate several problems with current polarimetric detectors, such as diffraction, light scattering, moving parts, and the need to dice/bond components. This project will use recent discoveries in metamaterials research that allow for polarimetric control of the flow and focusing/superbeaming of light, concepts that have been analytically and experimentally verified during Phase I. Phoebus's Phase I results confirmed that its structures will allow for 2500x improvement in polarization extinction ratios - the key performance metric for polarimetric detectors \u0096 compared with currently available polarimetric detectors. Phase I results also confirmed that the relevant structures can be fabricated using routine materials and fabrication techniques in widespread use throughout the semiconductor device industry.

YTP has proposed to develop advanced Li-ion batteries for space-based application by improving the battery materials, electrode processing and the cell chemistries. During Phase I of this program, YTP has successfully demonstrated the Phase I proof of concept of this proposal by focusing on developing novel electrode manufacturing technology and surface modified electrode materials. Phase II of the program will incorporate the Phosphate coated materials, cell chemistries and new processes developed in Phase I to fabricate prototype cells for test under LEO-type test profiles. Power output and energy capacity will be scaled up to levels appropriate for integration into battery packs to demonstrate the path forward for subsystem-level performance.   BENEFIT:  The target application for this surface modified cathode based Li ion battery is in Air Force applications where safety, longer cycle life, high energy density and power densities are required. This new technology will have superior performance even at low and high temperatures due to robust electrode coating method and surface modification of the electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "Currently, two types of antenna configurations are in use with GPS receivers; fixed reception pattern antenna (FRPA) and controlled reception pattern antenna (CRPA). FRPA is a single element antenna and, thus, can not use angle of arrival as a discriminator to suppress interfering signals or jammers. CRPA is an array of antenna elements that can use angle of arrival as a discriminator to reject interference signals and/or jammers. Many DoD platforms use FRPA due to the cost, size and weight issues. Also, a given platform may have many GPS FRPA to support various communication/ radar/ navigation systems on board the platform. Applied EM proposes a thorough performance evaluation of GPS antenna electronics when conventional antennas (GAS-1 CRPA, GAS-1N CRPA, etc.) are replaced with a set of GPS FRPA. The performance evaluation will be carried out under the jamming scenarios of interest for selected FRPA distributions on a UAV. The goal will be to come up a distribution consisting of four FRPA and another distribution of seven FRPA which lead to the best AJ performance. During Phase I, we compared the AJ performance of the many four  and seven FRPA distributions with the performance obtained using regular antenna arrays (inter-element spacing of the order of half a wavelength) when the platform was assumed to be an infinite ground plane. In Phase II, the study will be extended to a UAV. The final goal will be build the antenna arrays and demonstrate their AJ performance on a UAV platform.  BENEFIT:  The proposed solution is based on the development of a practical GPS AJ system for DoD platforms. Our research effort will also focus on implementation techniques with realistic FRPA designs which will help toward commercialization. This technology has applications in many military systems.",

        "abstract": "A critical capability required by the DoD is maintaining an accurate and comprehensive picture of the battlespace at all times.  A key to this is the growing use of layered sensor networks that together form complex systems-of-systems.  Utilizing this approach for effective situational awareness requires high level of trust in the data that is ultimately produced.  Critical to this goal is ensuring the trustworthiness of the components that ultimately compose the system-of-systems.  In addition, the measure of trustworthiness may be different between missions.    To overcome these obstacles, the Air Force is taking a focused, architecture-based approach to systems engineering.  They require new tools to capture and analyze systems-of-systems architectures in an unambiguous and mathematical way.  This provides the basis to assess risk and measure trust at the architectural level.  The proposed RAISE/T Phase II solution builds on previous EDAptive Computing, Inc (ECI) knowledge and technology \u2013 itself innovative \u2013 to evaluate trustworthiness and its impact on risk within a system-of-systems architecture through modeling and simulation. The resulting capabilities will provide a flexible framework for architecting trust into distributed, heterogeneous sensor networks.  Ultimately, the Air Force will be able to deliver new solution to the warfighter with greater confidence and significantly reduced risk.   BENEFIT:  The ability to accurately architect complex systems that are safe and reliable is a fundamental and unmet need in nearly every DoD acquisition program.   The RAISE/T tool is applicable to any mission-critical complex system where trustworthiness is important.  Our graphical system modeling framework provides a valuable foundation for analyzing the system at varying degrees of granularity, allowing both an abstract view of the system-of-systems and detailed views of individual components and their behaviors.  The result is a system-of-systems architecture which performs as expected and provides high level of trust. The future warfare model increasingly depends upon employment of net-centric, distributed technology.  Model-based, architectural engineering is a key to success.  Not only does our solution address the needs of the Air Force, but it will provide a significant foundation for improving trustworthiness of distributed, mission-critical system architectures across today\u2019s military and aerospace markets.  As a result, RAISE/T will be beneficial to the DoD, Homeland Security, NASA, NSA and other agencies with common requirements.  Importantly, our proposed solution can be transitioned effectively to the commercial sector by providing a more cost effective method to improve the trust of system-of-systems technology development in a variety of market sectors such as healthcare, commercial aviation and communications where privacy, financial or security concerns make trustworthiness in mission-critical systems very important.",

Furthermore, the software system will assist the user in the analysis of DOE data, model building, diagnostics, and system optimization.

The International Space Station and future exploration vehicles require a light weight, compact, portable oxygen concentrator technology (OCT) that can provide medical grade oxygen from the ambient cabin air.  Current OCTs are heavy, bulky, have a narrow operating temperature range (ambient to 40 degree Celsius), and require 15 to 30 minutes start-up time to reach their full operating capacity.  Lynntech's proposed electrochemical OCT solves these issues by operating the OCT with a cathode-air vapor feed, unlike conventional electrochemical OCTs which require a liquid water feed.  This is possible due to the use of in-house developed proprietary nanocomposite proton exchange membrane and catalyst technologies.  Cathode-air vapor feed operation eliminates the need for a bulky on-board water supply, significantly reduces the complexity of the balance-of-plant, and greatly increases the system efficiency. OCT will be a quarter the size and weight of conventional OCTs, be capable of instant start-up, and have a wide operating temperature range. Lynntech will develop a Phase II prototype that is capable of delivering 4 SLPM of 60% oxygen and deliver it to NASA for further testing.",

        "abstract": "Busek proposes to develop a flight prototype micro resistojet (MRJ) propulsion system for CubeSat satellites.  Ammonia has been chosen as the propellant because it is self-pressurizing, relatively high density, and is well suited as a cold gas propellant for propulsive attitude and control system.  The MRJ system will be base-lined at 5 Watts with options up to 15 Watts total power, 5 milliNewton thrust and predicted 165 second specific impulse. CubeSats, especially 3U (10cm x 10cm x 30cm) sized, are becoming a viable option for low cost, minimal functionality missions.  Though very useful for University student development, the lack of propulsion limits the usefulness and practicality for the US Air Force.  The addition of the proposed propulsion system creates a maneuverable vehicle that, at the very least, has enough delta V for a prolonged Low Earth Orbit mission.  For a 3U/3kg Cubesat, the proposed MRJ system will enable a 230 day, 300km circular orbit.  With the addition of propulsive ACS, polar orbits, GEO and elliptical orbits become practical for CubeSats.  One example is a 365 day Sun-Synchronous elliptical orbit with a 235km perigee and 1000km apogee.  The MRJ system can also be used for controlled deorbit of the CubeSat.   BENEFIT:  The successful completion of this micro propulsion program will facilitate pico and nano sized spacecraft missions well beyond University student training and thrust them into mainstream space applications.  The micro resistojet enables a wealth of missions including observation, interferometer missions, space situational awareness/inspectors and defenders, fractionated systems, and many more.  The CubeSat format will give the USAF an inexpensive architecture which could be expanded to dozens to hundreds of spacecrafts; though this architecture has only been chosen as the envelope for the baseline development with multiple options for larger spacecraft available upon completion.

The demonstration was performed in a wind tunnel at sea-level conditions. The original SBIR Phase II design flight condition objective of 280 KCAS at sea level altitude were not representative of a mission profile for an EA-18G with a NGJ Pod. The near-term specific task executed under this program is the development of a prototype PPG system, to be tested in a wind tunnel that can simulate the more representative flight condition objective of 220 knots calibrated airspeed (KCAS) at 25,000 feet altitude. Development will be completed through the detailed design and performance analysis of the systems key components. At the end of the Baseline effort, performance predictions for design and off-design flight conditions will be complete and a full PPG will be fabricated and experimentally demonstrated in a wind tunnel environment and result in a prototype unit at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 4. During the Option portion of the program, Mainstream will complete final wind tunnel testing. Testing will be completed at representative flight conditions, resulting in a prototype at a TRL of 5.",

Identification of patterns in the enemy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behavior is critical to disrupting his activities. Intelligence analysts are currently swamped with information from a wide variety of sources, but this abundance of information hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t paid off to its fullest extent because of the tremendous amount of manual (human) processing required to analyze it. Research in information extraction from natural language texts can greatly reduce this manual effort by automatically extracting descriptions of militarily-significant events and their temporal features from intelligence data. Furthermore, if the event descriptions are stored within a semantic model, i.e., ontology, then machine reasoning algorithms can be applied to generate the implicit event relationships currently requiring human effort. This capability will significantly reduce manual processing of intelligence that currently plagues Army analysts.",

We propose to extend current capabilities to predictive and real-time analysis by developing an automated tool which estimates threat patterns based on historical data, and detects and extrapolates emerging instances of these patterns from real time data. Our predictive clustering algorithm computes a list of predicted threat events based on real time data, prioritized by likelihood and characterized by statistical uncertainty of location and time of each event. Complementing the predictive clustering algorithm, a forensic clustering algorithm processes historical sensor data and threat events to estimate parameters in the predictive clustering model. The Phase I effort developed an efficient clustering algorithm and demonstrated its ability to detect abnormal maneuvers using both simulated and real moving target data. Phase II will extend the algorithms to use more realistic models of threat patterns and normal background, and evaluate performance using both simulated data to determine performance operating characteristics and real GMTI data to evaluate military utility.  BENEFIT:  The research will produce automated algorithms to predict threat events from multi-source data. In particular, it will output a statistical estimate of the event likelihood as a function of event location and time. This estimate can be used in military planning to avoid or counter potential threats. In addition, the predictive clustering method proposed could be applied to many commercial problems of predictive analysis such as fraud detection, risk analysis, and analytical customer relationship management.",

Conventional systems, however, either incorporate a heavy precision gimbaled telescope assembly for directing the gaze or utilize separate imaging systems for wide and narrow field imaging resulting in increase size, weight and power requirements. The proposed Enhanced Field-Foveated Imaging (EFFI) system is designed to permit simultaneous high resolution wide and narrow field of view imaging over any desired field angle in the image. EFFI incorporates a novel all reflective primary optical assembly, coupled with state-of-the-art deformable mirror technology to provide a high optical zoom and foveation without any conventional moving parts. Proprietary algorithms for object detection, and Fourier method based reconstruction result in diffraction limited images of the target under observation. The phase I efforts established the feasibility of this novel concept through design, analysis and simulations. In the Phase II work, an end-to-end testbed capable of validating the major technological challenges associated with the sensor implementation and validating the functionality will be built and delivered to AFRL. The modular design of the test bed will also allow for performance enhancement and continual research as new adaptive optics technologies become available.    BENEFIT:  Completion of the EFFI system testbed will provide the foundation for development of space situational awareness sensors capable of wide and narrow fields of view.

In previous work, our staff members have developed several generations of cold atom sensors that achieved ultra-high performance in laboratory and field tests. Our sensor will trade-off some performance margin to reduce size, weight and power, while still significantly outperforming the stated program goals. The fundamental performance limits for our sensor technology leave room for additional orders-of-magnitude improvements with further development beyond the scope of this effort.  BENEFIT:  Light pulse atom interferometer (LPA) sensors are poised to revolutionize navigation in the same way that atomic clocks have revolutionized timekeeping, as they are based on the same essential technology. LPA gyroscopes have already demonstrated better performance than conventional navigation sensors such as ring laser gyros, fiber-optic gyros, or microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Our proposed compact atom-optic gyroscope will make substantial improvements in miniaturization, cost reduction, and manufacturability of LPA technology, and will achieve extremely low bias drift and angle random walk noise. Smaller, cheaper, more robust LPA gyroscopes will enable higher performance and more cost-effective inertial navigation systems for critical applications such as military and commercial aircraft, missiles, unmanned autonomous vehicles, ships, and submarines.

While the approach is useful for power-scaling demonstrations, it is not practical for operational lasers in terms of both reliability and ruggedness.

The approach addresses the vulnerabilities of existing PHM systems and allows achieving low (the smallest theoretically possible) false alarm rates while simplifying system engineering and sustainment. The fault states are estimated (detected) from the pre-processed sensor data and pre-processed BIT data using fault signature models. Existing PHM approaches use heuristics for determining engine fault alarm conditions from a mix of parametric and discrete data. This project relies on recent breakthroughs in estimation and optimization that allow integrating discrete and parametric data as well as discrete and continuous fault states in a multivariate mixed estimation formulation. Phase II will develop an embedded functional application implementing the approach in the avionics of the target engine. It will also maturate tools supporting the system analysis and design of the mixed data fusion. Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of the approach for a linearized model of F110 engine. Limited functionality and partial fault coverage were implemented. Phase II will develop full functionality for a target engine and integrate it with engine on-board. Its objective is to prepare the developed mixed data fusion function for productization and operational deployment.   BENEFIT:  The proposed Mixed Data Fusion approach can substantially improve the accuracy of diagnosing root cause engine faults from a mixture of parametric gas path data and discrete (BIT/BITE) data. The accuracy is improved both by reducing the error rate and by allowing discrimination between more different fault conditions. A feasibility study for the F110 engine demonstrated the reduction of the false error rate by a factor of 1.5-2 while discriminating between 15 faults (compared to 4 faults for the baseline approach). The Mixed Data Fusion software can be deployed in on-board engine avionics or in ground maintenance support systems. The ability of the software to reduce false alarms and fault ambiguity groups could help to reduce the maintenance costs significantly.",

The development of new generations of OOA materials has enabled the fabrication of large composite structures with nearly identical properties to their autoclave-cured counterparts. These materials have increased the designer\u2019s flexibility to create larger integrated composite structures without the restraint of available autoclave size. In the Phase II effort, Aurora Flight Sciences will develop the engineering and manufacturing requirements for the manufacture of an OOA radome. Two OOA radomes will be fabricated during the Phase II program. The first Radome fabricated will be subjected to teardown inspection while the second article will be supplied to NAVAIR as a delivery article. The fabrication and subsequent destructive and non-destructive testing on the OOA radome will demonstrate the feasibility of the developed processes to provide complex naval aircraft structures. Also during the Phase II program, a market strategy will be developed to transition OOA technology to specific identified programs. The collected cost and inspection data from the out-of-autoclave articles will assist with further development of the technology transition plan and provide key marketing data for the continued commercialization of OOA technology.",

The developed DF algorithm is capable of high resolution DOA and polarization estimation using an antenna array having polarization diverse antenna response.  The algorithm can operate on signals of any bandwidth or polarization.  The algorithm will be implemented in a hardware prototype and demonstrated in over-the-air tests at the end of Phase II.   BENEFIT:  The results of the Phase II effort will be a demonstrable wideband DF technology which is polarization invariant.  As the DF technology can estimate the arrival directions and polarizations of signals of arbitrary bandwidth or polarization, it can be applied in any DF application that require high resolution estimates in near real-time.  The new capability will greatly enhance military COMINT and ESM applications.  The technology can also be used for emergency/disaster response, search and rescue, and for location services in the cellular telephone industry.

During the Phase I program, we developed and successfully demonstrated an electrochemical reactive-separation platform that binds sulfur compounds via a charge transfer process to a redox carrier that is subsequently transported across a membrane separator releasing the sulfur components. The Phase II program will continue to develop the membrane electrode assemble to improve the separation process as well as transition this technology to RIL's advanced reactor platform for more extensive testing.

Further, ogive domes have increased durability to such effects as rain impact at high velocity, as well as increased field of regard.

Precision Photonics'' Phase I effort for NAVAIR has proven that the coating thickness profile challenge can be solved by using a combination of shadow masking and modeling of the deposition process.

By its very nature, submarine warfare succeeds or fails based upon the stealth abilities of the platform. Covert communications at speed and depth are required to fully engage the platform but providing this capability continues to be challenging. Recent efforts to achieve submarine communications at speed and depth have demonstrated numerous enabling technologies. Through the uses of expendable or tethered communication buoys, RF signals have achieved significant range performance with high reliability. However, such deployments potentially compromise the stealth capabilities of submarine operations under certain situations. Furthermore, tethered communications sensors may not be deployable in certain operational areas. Through the use of spread spectrum signal technology, Progeny Systems will demonstrate a low probability of intercept (covert) ACOMMS solution that can be fielded as both an Advance Process Build (APB) improvement initiative and as a stand-alone transmit / receiver modem solution for use at acoustic ranges or other Navy applications.

These tools will estimate achievable separabilty based on sensor characteristics, sensing modes, mission specifications, target sets and operating conditions. A significant component of the work is developing robust vibrometry feature extraction algorithms based on physical understanding and modeling of power plant vibration generation mechanisms for nominal and off-nominal power plant operation. These tools will enable a performance based sensing approach to multi-mode sensor design studies, directly linking sensor design descisions to impact on achievable ATR performance. In addition these tools can be used for mission planning, optimizing sensor and ATR algorithm parameters for specific mission objectives and environmental conditions.  BENEFIT:  The ATR separabiilty performance estimation capability developed will enable sensor design decisions to be linked directly with achievable ATR separability performance. THis will speed development of improved sensors, feature extraction algorithms, classification approaches and ATR systems in general.",

The development of efficient odor removal systems for use inside lunar architectures is one of NASA's critical needs (2008 SBIR Topic X2.03). Because of the limited space and resources in both exploration vehicles and non-moving habitats, a treatment system must be compact, lightweight, and robust, and have low energy and material input requirements, with focus on reducing equivalent system mass (ESM). We have developed a novel, robust, and highly effective Silica-Titania Composite (STC) technology capable of adsorbing and oxidizing VOCs to harmless byproducts when irradiated with UV light. The effectiveness of the technology for removal of ethanol from air when irradiated continuously with UV was proven under Phase I. This Phase II proposal will focus on the design, fabrication, and evaluation of a prototype employing the STC technology with UV LEDs as the light source, challenged with several VOCs simultaneously. The prototype will be designed based on the requirements of the Lunar Habitat in NASA's Lunar Outpost mission. Revised ESM calculations will be completed after system optimization, and a final prototype will be delivered to NASA for future testing.",

The approach is conceptually similar to pH or urinalysis test strips which allow multiplexed measurements in a linear format.  The main difference is that we are proposing test strips at the nanoscale, shrunk in size over a billion-fold in volume, allowing multiple sensing elements to be included in a tiny area.  In Phase I, we fabricated, tested, and demonstrated functional parathyroid hormone and vitamin D nanostrips for bone metabolism.  Furthermore, we developed thrombin aptamer and immune IgG antibody nanostrips.  For Phase II, we will develop a breadth of nanostrips designed to address key space-flight medical needs.  These will be for assessment of bone metabolism, immune response, cardiac status, liver metabolism, and lipid profiles.  We plan to enhance our technology capabilities by developing a Rapid Nanostrip Assay Capability, mix-and-run assay capability, in-house aptamer production, advanced lyophilization technology, and nanostrip accelerated stability tests.

Further development of the tools, with the goal of insertion into the logistical stream, will revolutionize the current manual track changing and inspection methods and greatly reduce the logistical burden associated with track maintenance.

Additional objectives of this program include maturing the gun hard packaging concept and to establish plans for silicon development in a follow on Phase II.5/Phase III program. The long term objective of the program beyond Phase II is to develop the silicon on the 90 nm 9LP Trusted Foundry process line.

        "abstract": "Synthetic Jet (SJ) actuators have recently been pursued as solutions in active flow control applications and aeroshaping of airfoils. Of particular interest is the use of SJ actuators as flight air flow control devices where their compact size, reduced weight and all-electric actuation make them desirable for use on high performance military aircraft. In this proposed program, the performance, reliability and uniformity of the piezoelectric SJ actuators developed in Phase I will be optimized through modifications to the materials used in their construction, the design of their internal elements, and the manufacturing process. Synthetic jets will be tested under various environmental factors including humidity, salt spray, dust exposure, temperature variation, and shock and vibration conditions; under high drive conditions; and in accelerated life testing. The integration of a synthetic jet flow control system into the hingeline of a representative wing section with a highly deflected trailing edge flap will be investigated. A full-scale mock up of design concept will be fabricated as an airfoil segment centered on the hingeline of the actuator installation point. With the jet velocities defined, full scale section lift benefits will be estimated based on available wind tunnel test data and computational simulations.  BENEFIT:   This SJ actuators being developed in this program will provide numerous benefits in both military and commercial aircraft applications, including but not limited to:  increasing lift on aircraft wings or turbine blades; reducing noise in aircraft engines; optimizing vehicle performance including reduced speed and increased weight at landing; improving aerodynamic control (for improved aircraft maneuverability); reducing control surface size and weight; and improving control in unsteady wake conditions.   The technology developed in this program will be applied to the optimization of piezo diaphragm air and liquid pumps which can potentially be utilized in a wide variety of commercial applications including medical (e.g. ambulatory & syringe infusion pumps, enteral feeding pumps); automobile (e.g. automobile windshield washer pumps); computer thermal management (e.g. desktops, workstations, servers, etc.); industrial (e.g. chemical processing, cleaning, semiconductor manufacturing); and consumer (e.g. air pumps for fish tanks).",

        "abstract": "Radar signature databases are critical elements of combat aircraft target identification systems that must accurately reflect the target configurations at the time the identification is to be made. However, there are numerous effects that can cause the databases to be less than optimal in terms of real-time target representation and impede portability and hybridization. The proposed work addresses one broad category of such effects, those which are caused by non-rigid body motion of the target structural features illuminated by the radar. The proposed work will include innovative analysis of non-rigid body scattering effects including development of time domain theory, radar measurements, and construction and validation of a new software analysis tool.  BENEFIT:  The Air Force uses aircraft manufactured by several major contractors, most of which produce several different aircraft that contain NCTI systems. It is very costly and inefficient for signature databases to be developed independently for each of these platforms. Better understanding of the fundamental scattering effects that can impede portability and hybridization of signature databases will result in cost savings to the manufacturer and to the Government, as well as leading to better NCTI performance. The software developed under the proposed Phase II program will be marketed to the Government and to large and small companies seeking signature prediction and analysis capabilities beyond that offered by currently available tools such as Xpatch.",

        "abstract": "This work is focused toward developing disruptive hybdrization techniques for imaging focal plane arrays in which the optical detector material system is different from the silicon material used for processing, amplifying and reading out the opto-electronic signals.  In these cases, the detector pixels need to be interconnected to the electronic pixels through a process called hybridization.  This process has traditionally been performed through the use of high precision, high stiffness flip chip bonders, which are expensive to procure, operate and maintain.  Additionally, as defense needs drive imaging arrays to better resolution, these hybridization platforms will need to evolve.  The supply base for this equipment base has shrunk dramatically, and are non-U.S. based, creating a gap for development of next generation, higher resolution arrays as well as maintaining and scaling production of the current generation of arrays.  The disruption pursued in this work is to use micro-machined and micro-fabricated features to enable precision alignment and hybridization of imaging arrays, using standard pick & place machines with modest levels of precision.  This is achieved through use of alignment structures at the periphery of the array that can provide a rough level of alignment.  The self aligning action of the solder in the pixel areas achieves the final precision alignment during reflow.   BENEFIT:  The work benefits production of the current generation of imaging focal plane arrays in the SWIR, MWIR and LWIR wavelength ranges.  It also enables development of the next generation of imaging arrays at increased levels of resolution (and reduced levels of pixel pitch)in the material systems used for these wavelengths.  It addresses a critical supply chain gap for the U.S. defense industry since the equipment supply chain used to support conventional hybridization processes is shrnking rapidly and is non U.S. based.  Apart from the technical and supply chain benefits, the disruptive hybridization process brings significant cost advantages to the manufacture of imaging focal plane arrays.",

The objective of this research project is to develop a speech human interface that can offer both crewmember usability and system operational efficiency. But loud noise and strong reverberation inside spacesuits make automatic speech recognition (ASR) for such an interface a very challenging problem. In Phase I, the feasibility of using WeVoice proprietary microphone array signal processing and robust ASR technologies was validated. In particular, it was found that novel multichannel noise reduction produces larger gain in SNR than conventional beamforming but the latter is more preferable as far as ASR is concerned. In addition, it was confirmed that the model adaptation algorithm can make an ASR system more robust inside spacesuits. An arithmetic complexity model for ASR was developed. It can direct the decision as to whether a specified speech interface is sufficiently efficient to be possibly implemented with a wearable system. Phase II will analyze and minimize the scientific and engineering uncertainties identified during Phase I. Furthermore, a voice command interface for future generations of a suit's processing system is proposed to be developed on DSP chips. The system should be ready for testing and use by NASA suited crewmembers at the end of Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Many AEDC personnel are tasked with supporting facility operations by providing testing support, instrumentation support, facilities engineering and facilities maintenance.  This requires personnel to spend some of their time in their normally assigned work areas and portions of their time in and around test cells, wind tunnel control areas, and on the wind tunnels themselves.  The AEDC plant areas are equipped with a plant-wide paging system consisting of outdoor speakers.  The sound quality of these broadcast paging messages is highly variable and dependent on the location of the listener in relation to the speakers and the level of background noise.  As such, these messages are often difficult to understand.  Streamline Automation proposes to develop a Secure Plant Operations Data Network that will enable voice communications between personnel using mobile devices and others within the AEDC facility, and will enable access to a variety of server-hosted documents and applications.  The proposed prototype network will be designed to operate within the overall enterprise network architecture framework.  The Phase 2 prototype system will build on the capabilities demonstrated and features evaluated during the Phase 1 project.  BENEFIT:  The challenges of communicating in plant spaces experienced at AEDC are by no means unique.  Most power plants and industrial facilities have areas with high background noise levels that may vary based on plant operations.  In these areas hearing protection is required, which hampers voice communications.  Additionally, sound quality is highly variable in outdoor areas of the plant and depends on the relative location of the listener and the system loud speaker, and intervening obstacles.  The proposed voice and data communications system offers an attractive alternative to plant paging systems and provides additional capabilities that a plant paging system could never provide, such as access to documents on network servers.  AEDC will gain several advantages from implementing a plant voice and data communications system: 1. Improved voice communications with personnel working in plant spaces.  2. The option to use text messaging when communicating with personnel in areas with high background noise levels.  3. Enabling users in the field to access their or communal documents in a plant network document management system. 4. The ability to track users and equipment within plant spaces to improve the safety and efficiency of operations.",

        "abstract": "We propose the continued development of a novel approach to the detection of chromosomal inversions.  Transmissible chromosome aberrations (translocations and inversions) have profound genetic effects, such as disrupting regulatory sequences that control gene expression, or creating genetic chimeras.  These chromosome aberrations play a causative role in cancer, and ionizing radiation is one of the most efficient agents known to induce them.  As such, chromosome aberrations are relevant to three NASA needs, biodosimetry, analysis of astronaut lymphocytes for cumulative radiation damage, and space radiation risk modeling.  Of all structural chromosomal anomalies, inversions \u0096 a reversal of orientation of material within a chromosome \u0096 are the most difficult to detect.  This is especially true of small inversions, most of which are invisible to all current cytogenetic techniques.  Yet small inversions are likely the most transmissible (nonlethal) form of chromosomal damage, so they persist for long periods.  This is a useful feature for retrospective biodosimetry, and may also prove to be useful as an indicator of radiation quality..  In Phase 1 we demonstrated the use of a human chromosome 3, partial chromatid paint to detect a known inversion. During Phase 2, we will continue to improve the efficiency of the technology, an essential goal for commercialization (Phase 3) ultimately creating an improved and complete chromatid paint for chromosome 3.  Finally, we will test the chromosome 3 'chromatid paint's' ability to detect radiation-induced inversions, and establish their frequency.  The technology readiness level at the end of the Phase 2 contract is expected to be 5, i.e. validated in laboratory and relevant environments.",

ROSAs high-performance provides incredible improvements over current state-of-the-art and in many cases are mission-enabling for future applications.  The current Phase 1 effort has shown a modified-ORS-ROSA technology as ideally suited for Responsive Space (ORS) missions in terms of high-performance, rapid-responsiveness, and affordability.  DSSs ORS-ROSA solar array is extremely simple with >50% components reduction, standardized/common parts, scalable/modular, and provides exceptional specific-performance compared to conventional arrays.  DSSs ORS-ROSA-specific technology enables rapid-assembly capability and supports ORS program goals of spacecraft/ELV rapid-launch within 7-days from alert-status.

The LSPS can improve ISRU oxygen yield by boosting the concentration of ilmenite or other iron-oxide bearing materials found in lunar soils.

LSPS particle size separations can be performed to de-dust regolith and to improve ISRU reactor flow dynamics. LSPS mineral separations can be used to alter the sintering characteristics of lunar soil. The LSPS can also be used to separate and concentrate lunar minerals useful for manufacture of structural materials, glass, and chemicals. The LSPS integrates an initial centrifugal particle size separation with magnetic, gravity, and electrostatic separations. The LSPS centrifugal separation method overcomes the reduced efficiency of conventional particle sieving in reduced gravity. The LSPS hardware design integrates many individual unit operations to reduce system mass and power requirements.

Toyon\u2019s approach is based on dense 3D reconstruction of every pixel in the scene using a novel algorithm which provides significantly improved modeling accuracy, while maintaining computational efficiency required for airborne processing. Toyon\u2019s approach to moving target detection is based on statistical background modeling for suppression of motion clutter, and building the model in the 3D framework enables accurate registration to new video frames in the presence of parallax effects, effectively mitigating the greatest challenge to automated moving target detection in urban environments. Numerous other improvements to WAPS video exploitation are also enabled, including persistent target tracking and identification based on super-resolved features, statistical characterization of normal target motion and identification of anomalous motion, and rule-based alerting of possible threatening target actions defined and observed in the context of the geo-registered 3D framework. In Phase II, Toyon proposes to perform large-scale statistical characterization of the software performance, document and deliver the developed algorithms and software to AFRL, and support integration of the developed technology in AFRL\u2019s TechEdge laboratory.  BENEFIT:  The successful completion of this research and development will result in significant improvements in real-time exploitation of persistent wide-area high-resolution video-rate EO/IR imaging sensors, including automated target detection, tracking, and identification in dense and cluttered urban environments. Secondary technical benefits will include the ability to automatically calibrate imaging sensors using flight data and rapidly create high-fidelity geo-registered 3D models of large scenes. This technology would have direct applications in deployed and current developmental wide-area persistent surveillance EO/IR sensor systems, including Angel Fire, Constant Hawk, ARGUS-IS, Gorgon Stare, and TAILWIND, as well as in a broad range of Air Force and other DoD surveillance systems, including air-, ground-, sea-, and space-based platforms. In surveillance applications, geo-registered 3D data provides context for the sensor operator, as well as exploitation system operators. Highly precise 3D geo-registration is required for multi-look change detection to locate emplacement of possible structures of interest or of threats such as IEDs, and on shorter time scales to perform moving-target detection.

        "abstract": "The capability to automatically monitor areas of strategic interest at increased ranges will undoubtedly yield a key advantage on the battlefield by reducing manpower and improving knowledge of enemy target locations. The ability to effectively exploit data from multiple sensor types to find, track, and recognize targets of interest such as dismounts is key to realizing the promise of AFSOC advanced sensors. Yet due to a number of well-known challenges, including the large number of target classes and aspects, long and varying viewing range, obscured targets, cluttered backgrounds, various geographic and weather conditions, sensor noise, and variations caused by translation, rotation, and scaling of the targets, effective algorithms for discriminating enemy and neutral targets have been elusive to date. An integrated solution which addresses the aforementioned problems in a rigorous, methodical way is necessary to achieve the goals of AFSOC advanced sensors. During Phase I of this contract, Toyon Research demonstrated the feasibility of its algorithms for distinguishing armed dismounts from unarmed dismounts by searching for line-shaped objects consistent with the appearance of weapons. For Phase II, Toyon Research Corporation proposes to further develop advanced algorithms and software to automatically detect and classify dismounts, distinguishing gun-carrying dismounts from those which are unarmed. In addition, Toyon proposes to gather test data from airborne platforms on which to demonstrate its algorithms and demonstrate real-time operation.  BENEFIT:  Toyon''s has successfully tracked multiple, closely spaced targets using multiple sensor types (including EO, I, MWIR, and LWIR), mounted on multiple platforms (hand-held, building pan-tilt-zoom, and UAV). Successful completion of this work will result in a prototype that can discriminate armed dismounts from unarmed dismounts, and run in real time. Such a system will allow the warfighter to prioritize targets and engage targets of increased threat before targets of less threat and also avoid engagement of neutral targets, which increases the safety of the warfighter and overall probability of a successful mission.

        "abstract": "As an alternative material to aluminum-lithium, cryotanks developed from fiber reinforced composites can offer significant weight savings in applications for fuel containment of liquid oxygen and hydrogen. For composite materials to be accepted and utilized in these structures, they must be resistant to microcracking. It is the objective of this work to develop a matrix system for aerospace composites that alleviates all forms of microcracking from cryogenic cycling regardless of the lay-up and configuration. This will be accomplished by using a novel chemistry that provides the necessary inherent network and backbone structure for this environment combined with newly developed nano-modifiers. This technology and approach will result in a high performance matrix system that has low or no cure shrinkage combined with very low CTE and extremely high toughness. Such a matrix will be combined with carbon fibers to fabricate lightweight, high performance composites that are expected to have the microcrack and permeability resistance required for cryotank structures.",

        "abstract": "Bridger Photonics (BP) and collaborative partner Montana State University (MSU) propose to utilize feature specific imaging in concert with an innovative actively stabilized FM-CW chirped laser radar source for multi-mode target identification and classification.  Feature specific (or compressive) imaging systems project their information directly onto a low-dimensional, predetermined subspace, which is ideally suited for target identification or classification tasks.  While such systems have been constructed for 2D passive imaging, they have yet to be extended to active 3D imaging, where they are critical due to the shear amount of information inherent in obtaining the object representation.  Under the proposed effort, BP and MSU will work to validate 3D feature specific imaging concepts and provide brassboard demonstrations of a multi-modal laser radar sensor showing the competitive advantages of the technology over conventional approaches.  At the end of the effort the team will outline a design for a commercial ready prototype device that could be built and flown with follow on (Phase III) funding.  Ideally, the active, multimode sensor would operate at approximately 20 km standoff distances, and provide 30 m fields of view and 0.15 m down range and cross range resolutions of the scene.  BENEFIT:  On completion of the Air Force Phase II project efforts, Bridger Photonics will have a high-speed, compact, laser-based imaging system with high-resolution ranging and target ID capabilities.  The imaging system will be capable of measuring the distance and vibrational signature of targets at short and long ranges (out to 20 km).  Because the Bridger system uses feature specific imaging, it has inherent advantages in terms of update rate and hardware/memory resource allocation.  Bridger\u2019s use of telecom components allows the system to be highly cost competitive, eye-safe and durable.  Bridger Photonics envisions that it will sell these sensors in a variety of military markets ranging from the F35 Joint Strike Fighter to unmanned aerial vehicles like the Predator.

Qynergy has developed a hybrid ultracapacitor technology called the QynCap which utilizes one activated carbon (capacitor) electrode and one nickel hydroxide (battery) electrode in an aqueous KOH electrolyte. Compared with conventional ultracapacitors, QynCaps have a higher capacity per mass because of the use of the battery electrode, and they operate at lower temperatures (-55\u00b0C) because of the aqueous electrolyte. Although the use of this electrolyte reduces the QynCap operating voltage, it also lowers the internal series resistance which improves power performance (KOH/water is > 50\u00d7 more conductive than any organic electrolyte). The objectives of this eighteen month Phase II SBIR Basic Effort are to fabricate and test spirally-wound QynCap cells for use in Navy high-energy laser systems.

        "abstract": "The Navy has an emergent need to refuel USVs immediately upon launch from LCS, without putting a sailor onboard the USV. To meet that need, a robust simple system was developed during Phase I using mostly COTS components. The system accomplished the objective simply by making the fuel connection before the USV is launched and released the connection remotely when the off board fueling was completed. The objective for the Phase II effort has expanded to include the ability to remotely fuel USVs from the LCS without recovering them onto the LCS, approximately every 12 hours. This will require a fueling system that can be connected and disconnected remotely. Having the ability to make the remote connection also opens the potential to refuel the USV at the mission site from a ship of opportunity without returning to the LCS. The work to be performed under the Phase II Base contract is the development of a breadboard model of the manned connection/unmanned release fuel connector. The breadboard model of the manned connector will be evaluated and refined in the laboratory and the performance will be demonstrated in the Mockup of the LCS 1 & 2 Mission bays. The 1st Option will add the capability to remotely connect the fuel connector. Breadboard models of the unmanned fuel connector will be mounted to rolling carts: one will simulate the USV and the second the fueling platform to which the fuel funnel is attached. A winch will be mounted to the fueling platform to pull the USV into position so that the fuel probe can be extended to engage the fuel connection. The laboratory performance of the unmanned fueling system will be demonstrated to the TPOC and Program Office. The 2nd Option will waterproof the fueling components developed for the laboratory demonstration of the unmanned USV fueling in the 1st Option so that they can be used for in-water development of the system. Power supplies and a wireless link for the control functions will be integrated into both of the floating platforms. The fuel platform will be towed in the water so that the tow stability can be evaluated and adjusted to perform through a range of seastates. The surrogate USV will be towed behind the fueling platform connected by the winch cable. The winch will pull the USV into position so that the fuel probe can be extended into the fuel funnel.

BENEFIT:  The technology offers a powerful capability that enables persistent surveillance analysis of SAR data at operations and analysis centers in theater that don\u2019t have abundant computing resources.  This provides persistent surveillance data to a larger audience of Intelligence Analysts. This will significantly improve counter IED operations performance by providing increased access to critical surveillance data. This technology has broad ranging implications for our U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan, where IEDs remain the number one cause of military casualties.The technology can also be used for border surveillance to detect and track illegals.",

        "abstract": "We propose to continue our Phase I efforts by demonstrating the cooperative position location using mixed signals of opportunity in Phase II. Mixed signals of opportunity include broadcast signals (e.g., AM/FM radio and digital television) and communication signals (e.g., cellular network and wireless local area network). It is likely that a single type of signals could not provide sufficient sources of good geometry and quality for reliable positioning. Yet a mixture of different types, at an increased hardware and software complexity, complements each other with different frequencies, bandwidths, and propagation paths. This is also valuable in combating multipath and in particular non line of sight (NLOS) propagation. Further, the integration with displacement sensors and analytic procedures will ensure a joint solution even when only a limited number of sources is available. In Phase II, the demonstration will be carried out by building a super RF front-end and data acquisition systems that can selectively acquire mixed signals, implementing computational algorithms, conducting field tests, and processing field test data for analysis and evaluation. The Phase II deliverable will include validated software tools that can also serve as \u201cmarketable\u201d products to pursue after Phase II. We will contact third parties for demo as initial steps toward technology transition.  BENEFIT:  The proposed cooperative positioning algorithms, when used in conjunction with tactical radio network, are very appealing to the military as they have the potential to improve battlespace awareness and surveillance for timely decision making and multiple platform coordination and information integration. An important civilian application is for firefighters/first responders in search and rescue and similar missions in which fast locating of people in need can critically reduce or prevent the loss of life and/or damage to property. It can also be applied to homeland security and law enforcement in which the need for operating within buildings can benefit greatly from this device. As a positioning and navigation device, it can be applied in portable and transportation systems to supplement other navigation means for location-based services and in infotainment.",

        "abstract": "The combat environment and nature of combat injuries make peacetime or pre-deployment teaching and practice of combat trauma surgery very difficult. The goal of this Phase II work is to develop a simulation-based system to enhance the training of US military surgeons in the essential skills of trauma surgery in a combat environment prior to being deployed. Surgeons preparing for deployment are rarely available for intensive and time-consuming training, therefore the Rapid Trauma Skills (RTS) model will be concise, modular, and challenging. Training priorities will focus primarily upon decisionmaking skills for specific combat trauma cases and clinical/pathophysiological scenarios as well as technical review for surgical approaches not commonly carried out in civilian peacetime practice. Working with seasoned combat surgeons, case scenario-based training will be used to develop time-sensitive decisionmaking and clinical management of combat injuries. The system to be prototyped and demonstrated in Phase II is a dynamic entity that will respond to evolutionary changes in combat environments. In the proposed work, SimQuest plans to demonstrate the prototype system\u2019s capability to improve trauma surgery training in the uniquely demanding context of combat.

        "abstract": "Submarines have actuated parts that must be lubricated with grease to ensure correct operation and long service-life. In dry deck shelters (DDS), which are enclosed areas, divers are subjected to fumes that may be off-gassed from these greases. The DDS\u2019s are subject to elevated temperatures and pressures that cause volatile components to be off-gassed from the standard greases used. In order to eliminate the threat to divers, the Navy utilizes Krytox 240AC or Halocarbon 25-5S lubricants in the DDS\u2019s. These aerospace quality greases (which are fluorocarbon-based) do not release toxic chemicals. However, resistance to seawater washout is low, and these expensive materials constantly have to be reapplied. The resultant expense is unacceptable. To eliminate this problem form the Navy, TRI has been developing a grease that is resistant to water washout, but does not off-gas toxic fumes upon exposure to the environments encountered in the DDS\u2019s. This new grease will provide the same lubrication properties as the materials currently used by the Navy. During the Phase II effort, TRI will be refining the formulation, and scaling up production. The Navy can expect to save both time and money associated with the constant reapplication of the currently used materials.",

        "abstract": "As the power demands of airborne sensor platforms increase there is a growing need for improved capacitor technologies for compact energy storage.  While progress has been made on electrolytic supercapacitors as well as nanocomposite composites, an ultrahigh dielectric strength capacitor with high dielectric constant and compatibility with a broad range of associated materials technologies is still lacking.  In Phase I of the program we have confirmed that capacitors fabricated from organically modified sol-gel/DNA-CTMA blends have dielectric constants in the range of 6-8 and dielectric breakdown strength on the order of 1kV per micron for a 95/5 blend, nearly an order of magnitude higher than observed for common dielectric polymers.  The energy storage potential for the subject capacitors is superior to that of any known polymers.  The Phase II effort will be directed at further improving the dielectric performance through both optimized film formation techniques and nanoparticle doping.  In parallel, a significant effort will be devoted to developing manufacturing techniques that will scale to large areas, for which a partnership with a polymer film manufacturer is proposed.  In Phase II we will further test the temperature and humidity reliability of the manufactured capacitors, with the goal of rapid commercialization.    BENEFIT:  The growing energy demands of modern society and the desire to reduce dependence on fossil fuels have created an intense interest in new technologies that can impact the energy equation.  Energy storage is a key function of any energy system and capacitors are the workhorses of energy storage in electrical systems, thus improvements in capacitor technology will impact the efficiency, size and cost of those systems.  Furthermore, emerging flexible optoelectronics technologies such as organic electronics demand the development of subcomponent approaches, such as thin film capacitors, with high performance, low cost, and excellent compatibility with other materials.  The proposed biotronic capacitors have the ability to fulfill all of these requirements.",

        "abstract": "Future U.S. Information Systems will be subject to increased attacks.  These attacks will come from both internal and external threats.  As reflected by the budgets for combating these threats, external cyber threats are assumed to be more likely.  By comparison, internal threats to cyber networks from U.S. personnel receive little attention; yet, the consequences can be even more devastating.  Although technical solutions can alert management, supervisors or auditors still would be required to take immediate actions to limit the scope of the damages.  In addition to automatic defense systems, these supervisors must be alert to behavioral markers of suspicious behavior or attitudes on the part of employees.  In particular, cyber network supervisors must be trained to identify behavioral signs that might indicate that an employee intends to commit an insider crime. To address this challenge, the TiER1 Performance Solutions Team proposes to validate its Phase I design of the XL-CITR system (Accelerated Learning for Cyber Insider Threat Reduction), and to fully develop the training system that will properly teach supervisors, in the Air Force, DoD, or in any domain, to detect and thwart insider threats to cyber networks.",

It screens the data for evidence of motion on the ground and displays those cues to the IA. The IA exploits the data to detect suspicious activities and cues the system to track movers in the vicinity. The system uses space-time adaptive processing to detect movers and estimate their position. The system forms tracks on the movers, displays those tracks and issues track reports.

In addition to real world cueing, flight test provides subtle but key intangibles that cannot be duplicated in a ground-based simulator. There is, however, a cost to be paid for the benefits of flight in terms of budget, mission complexity, and safety. New technologies and test procedures are therefore needed to maximize the investments and reduce some of the related costs associated with flight test. To address this need, Systems Technology, Inc. is developing a Fused Reality (FR) Flight system that allows a virtual environment to be integrated with the test aircraft so that tasks such as aerial refueling, formation flying, or approach and landing can be accomplished without additional aircraft or risk of operating in close proximity to the ground or other aircraft. Furthermore, for the first time, the dynamic motions of the simulated objects can be directly correlated with the responses of the test aircraft. The FR Flight system will allow real-time observation of and manual interaction with the cockpit environment that serves as a frame for the virtual out-the-window scene.",

Electrically Heated Tooling (EHT) utilizes a coal-based carbon foam (CFOAMREG) core that serves as both the tool substrate and the heating source for a composite part being cured. The tool heating is a result of flowing current through the carbon foam, which results in heating.  This approach to self-heated tooling is a potentially enabling technology for manufacturing large composite structures by eliminating the need for autoclaves and large curing ovens, as well as by reducing costs, weight, and improving composite part quality.\n\nThe overall objective of the NASA Phase 2 program will be to optimize critical factors for thermal uniformity in a CFOAM Electrically Heated Tool (EHT) and to validate the electrically heated cure process with current state-of-the-art OOA materials.

        "abstract": "Recovery of water from brine is critically important for future manned space exploration.  Resupply of water is prohibitively costly for such extended missions.  Water reclamation processes typically recover 90-95% of the water present in wastewater formed by combining urine, hygiene water, and humidity condensate with the remaining concentrated in brine.  This concentrated brine contains a significant amount of water, potentially a very valuable resource.  The proposed prototype development will recover virtually all of the remaining water using an ultrasonic brine dewatering system (UBDS).  In the UBDS process, extremely small nebulized droplets of the brine are created ultrasonically at the brine\u0096air interface.  Small droplets enable quicker drying due to their high relative surface area. This is particularly important when drying brines that contain thermally labile materials, which require relatively low temperature drying.  The UBDS prototype has no nozzles to become plugged, requires little power, is simple and small, requires minimal astronaut attention and is compatible with continuous, closed cycle operation that can be made gravity independent.  The innovative Phase 2 prototype will fulfill the unmet need to significantly improve water loop closure during extended manned missions.

Currently this type of work is often performed in an open air environment which, decreases productivity, reduces efficiency and allows release of regulated air emissions into the environment. An enclosure system that is easy to use, easy to relocated from one work location to the next, easily maintained, storable within a small cube, and robust is desired. Finally, it is desirable that these structures are able to function onboard the ship to enclose the ship\u2019s superstructures and around other complicated geometries. Enclosures of this type will increase productivity, by decreasing down time (allowing work to continue during inclement weather). These enclosures will also allow capture of regulated air emissions (VOC\u2019s), and ultimately increase worker efficiency, comfort, and safety. Federal Fabrics-Fibers (FFF) proposes an AirBeam supported Large Modular Super Structure Enclosure System (LMSSES) solution. This enclosure will be supported using our AirBeam and AirFrame technology. FFF has considerable experience in designing and manufacturing custom AirBeam supported shelters, i.e. tents and enclosures. Due to the nature of the AirBeam and AirFrame technology this system lends itself to be easily adapted to different configurations and sizes. For example FFF has produced \u201cenclosures\u201d ranging from as small as 15 ft spans 43 ft spans by potentially unlimited lengths. In addition, individual AirBeams with spans of over 80 ft have been produced here at FFF and adding a skin to make a relatively large enclosure is a simple task.",

        "abstract": "Laser diodes (LD) have many desirable properties, e.g. small size and high electrical-to-optical efficiency.  For ease of use, most applications require coupling the LD photons to an optical fiber.   Attaching the LD-die to a heat-sink is a key packaging procedure.  The heat-sink material is generally copper since it is the lowest thermal-resistance metal but its CTE (coefficient of thermal expansion) is significantly larger than the LD-die.  Unless compensated, this CTE mismatch leads to mechanical stress which in turn degrades LD performance, lifetime and fiber-coupling efficiency.   The use of a malleable-metal solder, consisting of either an indium-based or a lead-based alloy, is the present solution to the CTE mismatch problem between the LD and a copper heat-sink. Unfortunately, indium-alloy solders are subject to thermo-migration and electro-migration whereas lead-alloy solders do not comply with RoHS (Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances) regulations.

        "abstract": "The lunar surface is, to a large extent, covered with a dust layer several meters thick.  Known as lunar regolith, it has been produced by meteorite impacts since the formation of a solid lunar surface billions of years ago.  The regolith, while promising as a future building material for lunar installations, also poses a hazard in the form of dust clouds being generated by all forms of gas expansions in the high vacuum environment of the lunar surface.  This is especially pronounced during spacecraft operations; a single lunar landing and take-off emits the same amount of gas as the whole lunar atmosphere contains.  Instruments placed on the moon by the Apollo mission showed marked degradation due to damage from dust released during the lander's takeoff.  Since there is no air movement to remove the dust after it is deposited, it is essential that dust is not displaced during everyday operations of a permanent lunar installation.\n\nAdherent Technologies, Inc. (ATI) has over the last decade developed a number of specialty UV-curing resins for NASA applications in space.  In the Phase I program, ATI developed a resin and dispenser system to coat large areas of lunar surface around landing pads and atmosphere locks with a thin, dust-stabilizing coating.  The coating is UV stable and elastic enough to weather the temperature extremes of a lunar day and night cycle.  Special emphasis was given to a low outgassing, solvent-free system that does not contaminate the lunar atmosphere.\n\nIn the Phase II program, ATI will optimize the resin formulations from the Phase I for thin film coatings.  By comparing those to two-part resin systems, a balance between required properties and needed launch weight can be struck for different mission profiles.  The engineering development will concentrate on a lightweight, reliable spray system to be added onto existing NASA moon vehicles.",

These are extremely unique and expensive assets, and their successful deployment, operation, and recovery are essential to our nation's scientific discovery, economic prosperity, and national security.  Surveillance and weather monitoring are significant factors in enabling safe, secure, reliable, and cost effective operations.  Ranges encompass large marine regions that are expensive to monitor and not under the exclusive control of the spaceport.  Marine regions include backwater areas (lagoon, river, and estuary) near the launch site, as well as the coastal and open-ocean regions extending hundreds of miles downrange.  The most hazardous regions must be cleared and maintained clear in preparation for launch and reentry operations to ensure public safety as well as the safety and security of the vehicle itself. To support such operations, Emergent Space Technologies, Inc. (Emergent) proposes to develop the marine autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) range surveillance (MARS) system.

However, the position of the jammer may be such that the jamming power is directed at the sidelobes of some threat emitters, and hence ineffective. In order optimize the jam coverage of the standoff jammer, real-time information is needed of threat emitter locations, so that the jamming assets can be repositioned. To address this issue, TSC demonstrated in Phase I of this study the feasibility of a concept denoted TEGS, which geolocates ground-based emitters with sufficient accuracy to allow the jammer to correct its spatial coverage.  For Phase II of this topic, TSC proposes to fully define the TEGS system design;  predict/estimate its performance characteristics via high-fidelity digital modeling and simulation tools;  develop, procure, assemble, integrate, and test hardware and software of a TEGS Proof-of-Concept Demonstration System;  perform and document tests to measure the efficacy of the TEGS concept in Geolocating ground-based emitters of opportunity;  and identify commercialization paths for the concept, both for military and civilian applications.  BENEFIT:  It is anticipated that the potential outcome of this study will be hardware and software designs that will result in a small, lightweight ES receiver that can be carried onboard UASs, possessing the capability of detecting a variety of RF emitters, utilizing either conventional or low-probability of intercept (LPI) waveforms.  The software algorithms, in combination of small UAS fleets (at least four), will provide the ability to Geolocate these emitters with sufficient accuracy to optimally position support jammers to protect vulnerable MAF assets.  The technology may also benefit domestic commercial applications, among them are rescue missions to locate hikers and skiers carrying small RF beacons, and homeland security missions such as locating teams of intruders that communicate using cell phones.  Additionally, the multi-sensor TEGS technique may be used to locate and manage slowly moving aircraft in airports, and to foil ADS-B spoofing by either measuring range to aircraft identified by these signals or locating the spoofing emitter.",

The reason for maintaining a low junction temperature is that all semiconductors perform better at lower temperature. SRL has recently demonstrated the dramatic potential of our advanced thermal management technology by extracting more than a kilowatt of optical power from a centimeter-wide laser-diode (LD) bar, which represents a 10X increase over the state-of-the-art. This successful demonstration was completed by attaching the LD chip to a pre-prototype, low thermal-resistance, high thermal-capacity, enhanced-performance impingement-cooler (EPIC).  In this effort, SRL will demonstrate that the EPIC cooler can be built with a thickness of 3mm and preserve its low thermal resistance and high thermal capacity",

Mezzo\u2019s approach is to redesign the engine cooling heat exchangers (LTC, HTC, fuel cooler, and condenser) using Mezzo\u2019s heat exchanger technology to reduce the overall heat exchanger pressure drop and thus the demands on the cooling fans. Reduced pressure drop through the heat exchangers translates to reduced fan noise and reduced fan power. In Phase I, Mezzo showed that its heat exchangers could reduce the fan noise by 4dB, reduce the fan power by 38%, and reduce the heat exchanger weight by 170lbs. The goal of the Phase II program is to advance the Technical Readiness Level (TRL) of the LTC/HTC heat exchanger and the Condenser/Fuel Cooler to TRL 6. In Phase II, Mezzo will design, fabricate, and test full-scale drop-in replacement heat exchangers. In the Option period of the program, Mezzo will build 2 LTC/HTC heat exchangers and supply them to the EFV office for vehicle testing. If funding above and beyond the baseline Phase II program is available, Mezzo will advance the condenser/fuel cooler to TRL 6 and build units for vehicle testing.",

        "abstract": "In response to an Air Force requirement for a laser measurement system capable of identifying targets through a turbulent atmosphere, MetroLaser proposes a multi-aperture laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). The signals collected through the multiple apertures would be co-phased to compensate for the phase disturbance that is due to the atmospheric turbulence and target-induced speckle effects. Consistent with AF requirements, the LDV system would operate at the wavelength of 1.55 microns. The proposed Phase II work would extend the Phase 1 effort, which demonstrated the feasibility of the technique with a combination of modeling and experiments. The Phase II effort would include modeling and experimental work in a long-range outdoor facility and will culminate with the delivery of a prototype multi-aperture, LDV system.  BENEFIT:  The proposed system would enable measuring targets several kilometers away through a turbulent atmosphere. This capability would benefit both military and commercial programs. DOD applications include target ID and the detection of landmines and improvised explosive devices (IED). Commercial applications include testing the structural integrity of bridges, historical buildings, and other large structures. The proposed system would fill a military and commercial market need.",

The new MAC protocol includes a novel mechanism of TDMA overlaying CSMA/CA and ensures scalable throughput and QoS performance in the hierarchical multihop wireless mesh networks proposed for lunar surface networks. The new MAC protocol will be implemented on top of a reconfigurable 802.11 radio and is compatible to legacy 802.11 networks. It also includes advanced features like efficiency power management, adaptive channel width for improving receiver sensitivity and communication range, and error control for eliminate errors due to radiation and radio burst. The hybrid routing protocol combines the advantages of ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing and disruption/delay tolerant network (DTN) routing. Its performance is significantly better than AODV or DTN, and is particularly effective to wireless networks with intermittent links, as in lunar surface networks and orbit access. In this proposal a detailed prototyping plan to implement the developed protocols is also presented.

        "abstract": "IR imagers currently require hybrid read-out integrated circuits (ROIC\u2019s)and additional separate AD converters (ADC) to provide transmittable data formats to digital signal processors (DSP\u2019s). The DSP is currently dominated exclusively by CMOS technology as the only high density low power  technology. New capabilities for IR imaging based on GaAs are being developed which have the potential for monolithic ROIC\u2019s. However the advantage of the monolithic pixels increases enormously if digitization could also be realized within the chip. To this end, a special requirement is to develop and optimize the IR pixel simultaneously with the ADC.  ODIS has identified a unique opportunity to implement novel multi-wavelength pixel designs together with a \u00d3\u00c4 ADC in which the true \u00d3\u00c4 performance can only be realized with a high speed decimator. At 60GB/s bit rates, the only solution to the decimator is EO logic. The pixel response is based upon intersubband absorption with CCD read-out transfer. The EO logic is based upon the unique thyristor properties.  The combination of these functions monolithically will result in unrivalled IR capability. In this project, ODIS will optimize the pixel response and readout amplifiers in a planar technology platform that supports the EO logic needed for the decimation.     BENEFIT:  The digital processor market is several billion dollars with steady growth potential based upon an expanding PC industry. The IR imager market will realize huge growth with the availability of monolithic pixel and ROIC combinations. A market opportunity thus exists to produce IR imagers supported by EO logic circuits. The market share for GaAs based digital products in the multi-GB/s range will expand dramatically. Digital and imaging products can now be added to a growing number of markets addressed by integrated optoelectronics  including parallel optical data links, optical interface circuits, phased array receivers and other markets currently dominated by Si.",

        "abstract": "NASA has a pressing need for increasing the efficiency of launch range surveillance during mission launch operations. Difficulty in verifying a cleared range causes significant launch delay that may significantly affect the operation safety, cost and schedule. With the increase of workload on existing and/or newly-built spaceports, challenges in launch range clearance and surveillance call for new breakthrough in technologies to better serve for NASA's missions. \nWe propose this SBIR to develop a novel \"Smart Pan/Tilt/Zoom Visible/IR Sensor\" platform, dubbed Smart PTZ(TM), especially suited for detection, tracking, recognition, and identification of persons and objects that have intruded areas of the range that must be cleared in order to conduct safe launch operations. \nConventional optical sensors have limited field of views (FOV). They observe objects through a small solid angle. Simultaneous acquisition of target in panoramic view is not possible. Although optical amplification may provide detailed target image, detecting and tracking target(s) in a large area is difficult, resulting in lengthy search time, costly UAV maneuvers, low efficiency in verifying range clearance, even missing intruder due to limited FOV.  Increasing FOV, however, is a double-edged sword that leads to a decreased spatial resolution, causing difficulties in target recognition and classification. \nTo resolve the simultaneous yet contradicting requirements on the FOV and image resolution for range surveillance applications, we propose a novel Smart PTZ sensor concept that meets both needs with unprecedented performance.  By integrating both wide FOV sensor and agile PTZ sensor within a compact package, together with a set of intelligent video analysis algorithms, the Smart PTZ sensor  would enable high performance target detection, tracking, recognition and classification, within a very large FOV (up to 360-degree) for NASA launch range clearance and surveillance.",

The physics simulation capability will consist of a set of coupled software tools used to model the response of hypersonic vehicle structures in extreme aero-thermal environments, at both the global level of the full flight vehicle and the local level of critically-loaded vehicle skin panel(s). For both cases, a hypersonic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code will be integrated with a nonlinear computational structural dynamics (NLCSD) code in a fully coupled, fluid-structure interaction form. At the global vehicle level, the coupled analysis method will simulate the quasi-static deformation of the vehicle to aero-thermal loads along a given trajectory and identify hot-spots and panels exposed to locally extreme aero-acoustic loads. At the local level, it will simulate the time-accurate response of a skin panel subject to extreme environments to predict stresses and the onset of snap-through and/or flutter. The new coupled multiphysics capability will be validated against available test data for panels subjected to hypersonic flight loads. The final deliverable will be a documented methodology which can be accessed by the Air Force and its contractors as a combination commercial and open-source software.  BENEFIT:   A key outcome of the Phase II program will be a quantitative evaluation of structural design based on coupled multiphysics versus current design methods limited to uncoupled/bounding methods. This will allow future designers to identify whether hypersonic structural design is overly conservative or not, when coupled physics are ignored. Applications in the DoD market include the design/development of weight-efficient military hypersonic vehicles, scram jet and related propulsion systems for hypersonic vehicles, and stealth aircraft with ducted exhaust.

The AID is based on polymer proton-conductive membranes used as resistive media to measure ion flow and activity, and modulation of the ionic current by variation of the redox potential in the internal ionic channel. This enables AID to directly detect low-frequency EM fields in seawater, emulating the capability found in elasmobranchii (rays and sharks) to facilitate localization and classification of low-signature hostile objects or vehicles in challenging, noise filled littoral water environments. The AID can sense changes in the local electrical field on the order of 0.1 nA/cm^2 in approximately 1 ms.

        "abstract": "SSCI is proposing to develop, test and deliver a set of topology control algorithms and software for a formation flying spacecraft that can be used to design and evaluate candidate formation architectures.  Properties of these topology control algorithms include: (a) Preserving the connectivity of the underlying state-dependent sensing graph during reconfiguration and re-targeting of the formation; (b) Achieving a balanced interplay between performance and robustness to communication delays; and (c) Using only local information to make local decisions that collectively guarantee global properties such as the network connectivity for formation flying.\n\nPhase I effort resulted in the development of a unified framework for the design and analysis of many topology control problems associated with formation flying spacecraft. A novel game-theoretic approach to network topology control was successfully applied to key trajectory design problems such as formation initialization and reconfiguration in the presence of local and global constraints.\n\nPhase II effort will deliver a complete set of algorithms and software tools to help the NASA TPF-I team plan and evaluate missions for candidate TPF-I architectures. In order to achieve these objectives, we plan to carry out the following tasks:\n\n(i) Further refinements and testing of the game-theoretic approach to state-dependent network synthesis problems and trajectory-following in the absence of centralization,\n(ii) Development and testing of convex parameterization of path-planning problems for multiple spacecraft formations,\n(iii) Demonstration of the application of the developed novel methods to TPF-I baseline mission.\n\nThese algorithms and software will be tested on high fidelity formation flying testbeds at JPL such as FAST or FCT. \n\nProfessor Mehran Mesabhi of University of Washington will provide technical support under the project.",

Phase I explored acoustic metamaterials for acoustic cloaking of naval structures. Our approach centers on a general theory due to Norris, which describes the behavior of elastic materials with a single resistive deformation mode and five modes which are not resisted. In Phase II, we will advance the material microstructure design. The prototype material designs will be fabricated, and tested in-air to verify their properties. If ONR exercises the Phase II option, the project will conclude with in-water acoustic scattering tests. To summarize, the technical objectives of the Base Program are: 1. Design pentamode acoustic cloaking materials, 2. Optimize these materials for cloaking applications, 3. Fabricate and test these materials in-air, to verify the mechanical properties, 4. Predict the cloaking behavior of the prototype materials in an in-water test.

High frequency, wide bandwidth signals have several advantages in applications ranging from high data rate communications to high resolution radar. However, the biggest challenge to realizing these systems is limitations to the amplifier noise performance. Advanced transistor technologies based on compound semiconductor transistors (such as pHEMTs and mHEMTs) have been reported to possess lower noise figures and higher frequencies of operation than conventional silicon-based transistors, principally due to their higher electron mobilities. In Phase I, preliminary designs of low-noise, ultra wideband amplifiers employing mHEMTs as the active devices and feed-forward noise cancellation circuits were created. Simulations show that noise cancellation circuits decrease thermal noise and increase gain. The principal result is a reduction in the noise figure. We propose a Phase II program that will build on the Phase I foundation by undertaking simulations with more realistic components and perform further optimizations. Additional work will be undertaken to extend the mHEMT model to cryogenic temperatures. We will first implement the amplifier as a hybrid circuit and test it. This will be followed by a monolithic implementation.  BENEFIT:  The proposed design efforts have numerous direct applications ranging from wireless communication, optical free space communication, commercial radar, high quality wireless video communications, next-generation cell phones and GPS receivers. While compound semiconductor-based devices are commonly used in military systems, their cost and level of maturity still limit their commercial applications. However the volume production of lower cost high-frequency and low-noise amplifiers becomes realistic as the demand for wide-bandwidth and high-performance amplifiers increases. It is anticipated that the commercial market will rapidly overtake the military one as the level of product maturity increases.",

Further hybridization with 800 W/mK \u201cz\u201d inserts with local thermal expansion matching provides for thermal management.  This was accomplished while reducing mass and exceeding the stiffness of Al isogrid structures.  Phase II is directed toward rapid response to space where satellites will be required to be tailored, configured and launched within a period of one week.   This technology will be scaled to ~0.5m x 0.5 m panels with tailored locations of \u201cz\u201d inserts which will be delivered to the customer/assembler within three to four days.  Blank pre-manufactured panels and pre-machined/electroplated \u201cz\u201d inserts will be held in inventory.  When the customer provides the electronics/sensor mounting map, panels will be machined, plated and the \u201cz\u201dinsert/local CTE pads will be soldered to specification, QC inspected and shipped to the assembler. A thermal and mechanical properties database will be generated.  Thermal models and micromechanics models of thermal stresses associated with \u201cz\u201d inserts will be generated to provide predictability and extension of the technology.  Full scale panels of specified design will be delivered to the Air Force for evaluation.   BENEFIT:  Passive methods for thermal management and thermal leveling will result from the research.  Rapid response ability to tailor and deliver panels within a few days is provided.  Low cost CTE matched materials with ultra-high thermal conductivity will become available for the aerospace and defense electronics thermal management industry.

A Raman fiber laser is used as a resonant pump laser source for Ho3+-doped fiber laser.  High gain per unit length at 1.26 micron can be achieved in Ho-doped fluoride glass fiber due to the strong pump absorption and strong emission at 1.2 micron transition.  5 W single frequency 1.26-micron MOPA system with high-speed frequency modulation capability will be developed.   It consists of a 1.26 micron single frequency seeder fiber laser and a 2-stage fiber amplifier.\nThis type of fiber based seed laser is needed for remote sensing of O  and O -N  for measuring atmospheric pressure.

        "abstract": "Lightweight, high performance thermal insulation is critical to NASA's next generation Exploration spacecraft. Zero or low cryogenic propellant boiloff is required during extended missions and lengthy on-orbit times. Heat flow through multilayer insulation is usually the largest heat leak in cryogenic systems, so improvements are desirable. Load Responsive Multi-Layer Insulation (LRMLI) is an innovative new technology using micro-molded polymer dynamic spacers that provide high performance insulation both in-atmosphere and on-orbit.  \n\nLRMLI under atmospheric pressure compresses dynamic spacers to support an integrated, thin vacuum shell for high performance in-atmosphere operation, and disconnects the spacers during on-orbit/lunar surface operation to reduce heat leak and provide ultra-high performance thermal insulation.\n\nLRMLI was successfully proven feasible in Phase I work, reaching TRL4. A LRMLI prototype was built and tested and a 3-layer, 0.25\" thick blanket demonstrated 7.1 W/m2 (0.19 mW/m-K) heat leak for on-orbit and 14.3 W/m2 (0.34 mW/m-K) for in-atmosphere operation. Equal heat leak on-orbit of a 0.25\" LRMLI blanket (2.1 kg/m2) would require 16\" of SOFI (15 kg/m2), with LRMLI having a 64X advantage in thickness and a 7X advantage in mass.\n\nLRMLI insulation can provide superior cryogen insulation during ground hold, launch and on-orbit/vacuum conditions without need for purge. Total heat gain into cryogenic systems could be substantially reduced. Terrestrial non-NASA applications include LH2 powered aircraft and cars in development.\n\nThis proposal is to further develop LRMLI toward commercialization. Tasks proposed include a study of both NASA& non-NASA applications to select two for further optimization, next generation design of dynamic spacers and modular vacuum shells, and building and testing prototypes in realistic environments such as a 3' diameter cryotank similar to a selected use like NASA Altair or Boeing HALE tanks.",

To accommodate this in a grazing incidence design, extremely thin mirrors are formed in concentric shell configurations. A slumping technique has been demonstrated with such thin, lightweight shells. However, the optical surface is found to contain a significant amount of mid-spatial frequency errors. Reactive Atom Plasma (RAP) is a figuring technique that does not impart mid-spatial frequencies to the optical substrate geometries and can additionally remove specific spectra from the figure error. RAP is a sub-aperture, atmospheric pressure, non-contact figuring technology that relies on a deterministic gas-phase etching of the optical surface with high material removal rates. Further, RAP has the ability to modulate tool footprint on the fly, allowing the removal of specific spatial frequencies from the error spectrum. RAP has already been demonstrated as a very credible approach for fabricating the lightweight wedges required for the assembly of such mirrors and  is especially suitable for figuring extremely lightweight mirrors given the non-contact operation. In phase 1, we demonstrated the ability of the RAP process to impart minimal mid-spatial errors into the optical surface. A fully automated figuring platform with adjustable footprints is to be developed for phase 2.",

        "abstract": "We propose to develop and commercialize a new type of low-stress iridium (Ir) X-ray mirror coating technology that can be used for the construction of high-resolution X-ray telescopes comprising thin-shell mirror substrates, such as the Flight Mirror Array (FMA) currently being developed for the IXO mission.  The urgent need for low-stress Ir coating technology is driven by the current limitations on telescope angular resolution resulting from substrate distortions caused by conventional reflective Ir coatings that typically have very high stress.  In particular, we have measured film stresses in excess of 4 GPa in the case of Ir films deposited by conventional magnetron sputtering.  It is thought that the distortions in the thin glass mirror shells (such as those proposed for the IXO FMA) resulting from such extremely large coating stresses presently make the largest contribution to the telescope imaging error budget, of order 10 arcsec or more.  Consequently, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to meet the imaging requirements of IXO, or other high-resolution X-ray missions in the future that use thin-shell mirror technology, unless high-quality Ir coatings having significantly lower stresses can be developed.  The development of such coatings is precisely the aim of our proposal.  Specifically, building on our successful Phase I effort, we propose to complete the development of low-stress Ir/Cr bilayers, and also investigate the use of Ir/Ti bilayers. We also propose to investigate the properties single-layer Ir films, as well as Ir/Cr and Ir/Ti bilayers, prepared by reactive sputtering with nitrogen.  Finally, we plan to transfer the low-stress Ir coating technology to our large, production-class sputtering system so that we can coat GSFC-supplied thin-shell mirror substrates and conclusively demonstrate reduced stress-driven substrate distortions.",

This will be accomplished by eclectic combination of technology developed in three existing SPEC optical cloud particle probes:  1) A fast FSSP, that measures size distributions from 1 to 50 microns and records individual particle statistics and remove shattered particles using inter-arrival times, 2) a cloud particle imager (CPI) with upgraded imagery capable of recording up to 500 frames per second, and 3) a 2D-S (Stereo) probe that is configured with one channel to provide full-view images of particles from 10 microns to 1.28 mm, and a second channel configured to provide full-view images of particles from 50 microns to 6.4 mm.

The key functionalities of the MDS-C to be developed are: 1. Deterministic and probabilistic multiscale multiphysics hygro-thermo-mechano-oxidation-fatigue capabilities; 2. Automated design cycle for HTPMC materials including integration of experiments and simulation; 3. Seamless commercial software interface and an intuitive, workable, user-friendly GUI.    Phase II demonstrations will compare the MDS-C predictions with the experimental data of PMR-15 and FreeForm 14 based components subjected to various individual and combined environmental conditions, such as hygro-thermo-mechano-oxidation-fatigue environments. For model calibration and validation we will have an access to the NCAMP MVK-14 FreeForm\u2122 Polyimide Composite test database.   BENEFIT:  Polymer matrix composites used in high-temperature applications, such as turbine engines and engine exhaust washed structures, are known to have limited life due to oxidative, hygrothermal and thermal fatigue degradation. For example, high temperature, pressure, and the presence of moisture limit the life of some polyimide composite components to only 100 h of service for worst-case operational conditions. Therefore, a reliable multiphysics-multiscale simulation model is critical to yield an understanding of the mechanisms behind observed degradation phenomena, help to design accelerated tests and serve as a basis for truly predictive capability.  Such a predictive capability will be developed and housed in the Multiscale Design System product line (MDS-C) and will be of immediate use in situations where conventional design procedures for HTPMC component lacked predictability. The MDS-C will provide not only a customizable environment for research into HTPMC materials, but also an integrated engineering design platform for high temperature components. The hygro-thermo-mechano-oxidation-fatigue modeling capabilities will become part of our MDS-C product line and will continue to be evolved to meet more general needs.    The three partnerships (GE Aviation, Boeing and Renegade Materials) already established and strong endorsement from six other companies (Northrop-Grumman, Lockheed-Martin, Rolls-Royce Aerospace and Automotive Composites Consortium (ACC) consisting of GM, Ford and Chrysler) are indicative that the proposed life prediction methodology and advanced design tools for HTPMC components will be readily marketable to commercial aircraft and automotive industries.",

This tool will be based on the Unified Flow Solver (UFS) developed at CFDRC for hybrid simulations of rarefied, transitional and continuum flows. In this project, UFS will be enhanced to include: radiation transport, non-equilibrium chemistry with real gas effects, and weakly-ionized plasma. The unique strengths of our proposal are: (i) smart software with self-aware physics and adaptive numerics for hypersonic flows with non-equilibrium chemistry, (ii) direct Boltzmann solvers for charged and neutral particles in rarefied regimes, and (iii) a high-fidelity multi-scale radiation transport model that can handle orders of magnitude variation of optical thickness. During Phase 1, we evaluated the relevant physical models and numerical algorithms, and started initial implementation and demonstration of the new capabilities. In Phase 2, these capabilities will be fully developed, validated and demonstrated for selected benchmark problems of interest to NASA. The proposed tool will significantly upgrade the modeling fidelity of high-speed weakly-ionized flows of molecular gases, and enable computational investigation of innovative hypersonic plasma technologies.",

This would be the most advanced in the family of such products developed during the last three years. The cryocooled receiver integrates a low-noise amplifier (LNA) with 5 K noise temperature with a 30 Gsample/s wideband analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The LNA and the ADC will use InP high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) and Nb Josephson junction (JJ) large-scale integrated circuit technologies respectively. In addition to the oversampling bandpass delta-sigma ADC, the superconductor chip will include digital in-phase and quadrature downconverters, decimation filters, and improved output drivers. In Phase I, HYPRES collaborated with University of California, Berkeley (UCB) to characterize the LNA gain, linearity and noise temperature over 4\u201380 K, and investigated SATCOM system architectures for both small and large platforms. Using a modular design with flexible temperature control on a commercial, multi-stage cryogen-free refrigerator, we will evaluate the overall receiver noise figure and validate the expected 1.8\u20132.5 dB figure-of-merit (G/T) enhancement for both architectures.

However, life management for composites is in its infancy compared to life management for metal structures.  Limitations in the ability of standard nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods to observe manufacturing quality and in-service damage evolution of composite structures may prevent designers from realizing their full potential.  Current NDE practices are incapable of overcoming these limitations.  Thus, a new framework and methodology is needed for high resolution imaging and tracking of manufacturing quality and damage evolution.\n\nThe goal of this program is to enable assessment of the matrix, fiber, and bonding conditions for composites using a combination of detailed physics-based models, high resolution imaging, and controlled loading sources to isolate the composite characteristic of interest.  Micromechanical models allow quantitative determination of composite constituent properties.  This program focuses on magnetic field sensing (i.e., eddy-current) methods that can be combined with structural analysis to enhance the diagnostic capabilities of these NDE methods.

In a new concept, the communications architecture will evolve from the present centralized system to one where user/missions will be given direct control of communication schedules, allowing them to directly change requests, while working with other user/missions to solve scheduling conflicts in a collegial environment.  A radically new user interface paradigm will be needed to support this new approach. It is our contention that such an interface is best designed using intelligent agent technologies, resulting in an intelligent space communications scheduling agent for each user/mission.  In Phase 1 we demonstrated the feasibility of using the Distributed, Collaboration and Interaction (DCI) intelligent agent software to support key activities of user schedule representatives of the Deep Space Network (DSN). These agents used models of mission preferences for preparing requests and posting notifications, and took actions on the part of the user to resolve schedule conflicts and take advantage of unexpected asset availability.  In Phase 2 we will extend our prototype agents to support the full range of user scheduling activities, to add capabilities to support multi-user conflict management and to design them to integrate with DSN Service Scheduling Software as it evolves to support user/missions.

In order to provide an extended coverage area and allow for navigation without requiring a fixed network, we will develop an ad-hoc mode supported by mobile ad-hoc networking.   We are developing this system using signals of opportunity (SoOP) which we developed in our Phase I project. As we found, digital television (DTV) and a wideband cellular standard, WCDMA, signals have the best attributes.  Our approach is to utilize these signals and design advanced navigation and signal processing algorithms as the basis of our prototype system.  Development of this prototype includes system architecture and algorithm development.   The prototype consists of custom software built around a flexible RF platform and includes all functionality necessary to navigate with SoOP.  We also implement a WiMAX-like cooperative network that allows users to share information.  With the cooperative network, the ability to provide navigation to users outside of the coverage area of the SoOP is inherent.  Additionally under this research program, we perform field testing and develop a navigation-specific fading model.  BENEFIT:  There are numerous potential military applications for our non-GPS solution utilizing SoOP. Since our solution involves IP in both the navigation system (algorithm development, and communication systems design & modeling) and in the mobile device design, there would be several applications which would be a natural fit.  One would be the capability to provide access to data, voice, video and/or location information for ground troops in challenged locations or when traditional communications devices are being jammed. Because DTV, AM, & WCDMA SoOP are the same globally, our troops would be able to utilize this information in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Our cooperative navigation can provide access to identification, tracking, and locations of various types of entities:  \u201cgood guys\u201d or blue force tracking; tracking of enemies; or tracking of other communication signals via communication/navigation devices.  This can be utilized for rescue missions in enemy territory or for the ability to determine enemy location in relation to troops or other known locations.   Integrated with sensor systems including classified SoOP and with other data, this technology can assist our troops in finding and destroying enemies and their weapons (IED\u2019s, etc.), while increasing access to relevant information while in theatre.  Our solution would be able to take geographic coordinates based upon these SoOP which could then be utilized within a three dimensional map.   This SoOP would provide an accurate picture in theatre and would be integrated with other operational data and applications.  Specific  military examples include: setting up of perimeter communication systems in theatre,  indoor or below ship deck navigation, GPS denied or jammed situations where it is impossible to access GPS signals,  assisting a netted fleet in accessing relative locations of potential \u201chostile\u201d ships, tracking Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) networks and their devices, etc. or any situation where access to relative location of SoOP can enhance communication and operational support. There are many commercial applications including: solutions for DHS (like SBI-net), enhanced 911 and/or first responder services, and non-GPS navigation for commercial cellular markets.",

        "abstract": "A new low power high speed design scheme was developed for GaAs HBT mixed signal circuits.  In this new design scheme, most of the transistors are biased in quasi-saturation mode to reduce power supply from 5 V to 3.3 V. Due to electron drift velocity overshoots at low electric field for GaAs material, all the analysis including DC, RF/speed and thermal effects favor the GaAs HBT circuits biased in quasi-saturation mode for higher speed operation.  This new design scheme offers two DDS architectures to achieve the analog bandwidth greater than 2.25 GHz. Low power consumption has been considered in the design from building block level up to architecture level. The conventional single sampling rate DDS was simulated with 4.5 GHz clock to have the worst spur of 60 dBc across the 2.25 GHz Nyquist band. The innovative double sampling rate DDS was simulated at 3 GHz and 4.5 GHz clock rates. At 3 GHz clock, the analog output is 6 Gsps and the worst SFDR across the 3 GHz Nyquist band is 50 dB.  At 4.5 GHz clock rate, the worst SFDR across 4.5 GHz Nyquist band is limited to ~ 40 dB which can be further optimized in Phase II. Two wafer lots will be fabricated in Phase II. The packaged broadband DDS devices will be delivered with evaluation boards. A generic frequency hopping spread spectrum module with the developed DDS ICs will be demonstrated.  BENEFIT:  We have established many customer bases through the selling of our 2 ~ 3 GHz DDS and other 2 ~ 8 Gsps DAC-related products in the past 4 years. These customers include both defense industries and commercial companies. The applications covered satellite communication spread spectrum terminals, Radar, EW, DRFM, Software Defined Radio, scene generation, fast tuning frequency synthesizers, WLAN modem, hard drive testers and memory testers. We have frequently got requests from these customers about the availability and schedule for the next generation wider bandwidth DDS products. As the frequency band of commercial wireless communication systems are pushing from 900 MHz , 1.9 GHz to 5.8 GHz and even higher such as 60 GHz WPAN, there are big commercial opportunities to use the wideband DDS for frequency hopping wireless data modem applications. We believe once we release the availability of the new DDS product with wide bandwidth, not only many of our existing customers will start to design with this new product to improve their system performance, but also it will penetrate into consumer wireless communication markets. The commercialization channels already exist for Euvis and there will have more commercial markets to be explored as the wider bandwidth DDS is available.",

These data fusion capabilities have focused on organic sensor track and feature detection data (acoustic and non-acoustic) for situation awareness at the platform-level. As the Navy moves forward with plans to augment the conventional assets with unmanned sensors vehicles, standoff weapons, and intelligent command and control (C2) systems we find more data will be available from these remote assets that is needed to maintain an accurate, complete, and consistent Common Tactical Picture (CTP). To enable the development of this CTP in scalable fashion, a new USW Composite Tracking architecture is needed. This new architecture must clearly define the functional services, their processing, and services interactions that must be performed in order to integration data into the CTP. With an initial architecture defined in Phase I of this SBIR, the emphasis of the Phase II work is to implement, integrate, and demonstrate this new architecture and its ability to enable CTP formulation using multi-layer information sources from the tactical and operational domains.",

        "abstract": "Generating a collection plan for airborne ISR assets is a long-standing problem which has led to the development of many different automated management algorithms. Not only does a collection plan have to satisfy multiple constraints (e.g., collision avoidance, limited fuel supply), but it must also meet numerous and often competing objectives (e.g., avoiding adverse weather effects, maximizing sensor performance, and consistently tracking targets). These challenges, coupled with the increasing number of sensors and sensor platforms, the highly diverse advantages and limitations of each, and the ways of combining them, are making it harder for ISR mission planners and ISR operators to optimize their use. As automated ISR constellation management algorithms are being developed to address this problem, the acquisition community has the challenge of objectively identifying superior algorithm performance under differing operational scenarios with varying assets and sensors. We propose to develop ICONVIEW (ISR CONstellation Visualization and Investigative Evaluation Workbench) as a means of impartially evaluating and contrasting different ISR constellation management algorithms. ICONVIEW is a complete end-to-end analytical research environment capable of specifying scenarios, customizing metrics, executing simulations, and evaluating the results using visualization techniques to bring insight into the analysis of alternatives (AoA) task within the acquisition process.  BENEFIT:  The ICONVIEW workbench will have immediate and tangible benefit for a number of military agencies in the acquisition community, such as AFMC\u2019s ESC and ASC, by helping them with the comparative analysis of alternatives process. ICONVIEW also has the potential to improve the effectiveness of ISR constellation planning operations in the J-2 community and the JAOC by determining the best ICMA to use as part of the planning process. Additionally, technology developed under ICONVIEW will be incorporated into our own DRIVE\u2122 visualization toolkit to increase its appeal as a commercial product and to support our consulting services to customers within the DoD, other Federal agencies, and commercial markets.",

        "abstract": "Life on Earth is unique in many ways; one of its great mysteries is that the building blocks of life on Earth (amino acids, nucleotides, sugars) are all chiral. One optical isomer of each amino acid or nucleic acid was selected by evolution. In our pursuit of finding life on Mars and beyond (Triton, Europa, etc.), it is likely that one of the clues to extant or extinct life could be the detection of non-racemic chiral molecules. This proposal describes the development of a highly miniaturized and ultrasensitive lab-on-a-chip polarimeter that will meet the NASA need to measure chirality in very small volumes of samples at very high sensitivity. The proposal builds on a novel technology that is based on a proprietary design, in which a modulated liquid crystal variable retarder (LCVR) enhances sensitivity and reduces size without sacrificing performance. This detection principle with a long-path-length microfluidic flow cell allows for the measurement of chirality in microliter volumes of samples. The Phase I effort has conclusively demonstrated the technical feasibility of the detection principle.  A miniaturized polarimeter with microfluidic flow cell was designed and fabricated. The polarimeter was calibrated and tested with samples. In Phase II, we will build, fully characterize, and deliver a miniature polarimeter with optimized performance, enhanced mechanical stability, and integrated fluid handling capability. The primary goals are to further improve the polarimeter's sensitivity, accuracy, size, weight, reproducibility, measurement speed, and power needs, conduct extensive testing, and  deliver a robust prototype, engineering drawings, software, and test results to NASA.",

With this concept applied to surface operations at major airports, NASA's NextGen-Airportal Project is exploring the use of surface 4-dimensional (4D) trajectories, which use required times of arrival (RTAs) at selected locations along the route. Observing these RTAs as constraints along the taxi route, the flight still has many degrees of freedom in adjusting its state profiles (i.e.,  position, velocity, etc. as functions of time) to achieve the timing constraints. This research will investigate whether and how these degrees of freedom in trajectory control may be used to achieve desirable behaviors for the taxi operations. Previous research has applied the trajectory control freedom to assure passenger comfort by keeping the accelerations and decelerations within pre-specified limits, and yet there is still untapped flexibility in designing the trajectories. The proposed research will explore this trajectory design problem to achieve additional desirable behaviors, beginning with the consideration of fuel burn, emissions, and noise. A flight-deck automation experimental prototype will provide the platform for simulating the designs, augmented by models developed to evaluate environmental benefits. The findings will benefit future designs of flight-deck automation systems, as well as tower automation systems which rely on accurate understanding of the flight deck's operational behaviors to plan efficient and safe operations for the entire surface traffic.",

Abrasive challenges have plagued F-35 coated composites because of operating at 450\u00baF (232\u00baC) for extended periods of time while being abraded as the aft elevators are adjusted. Texas Research Institute Austin (TRI) proposes an innovative coating approach to utilize a thermally stable preceramic binder in conjunction with inorganic, high temperature abrasion resistant filler, and also a heat resistant inorganic camouflage pigment package. Texas Research Institute Austin, Inc. (TRI) in the Phase I SBIR effort developed a low temperature cured, single component, heat stable, high temperature abrasion resistant coating. This coating material facilitates improved high temperature wear of composite surfaces. A comprehensive coating development program will be executed in the Phase II to insure product viability, confidence in the coating, develop specifications, and to prepare for Phase III insertion and commercialization.  This Phase II responds directly to needs for development, testing, specification, packaging, production, and ultimately demonstration as a coating material for the JSF. Our proposed project approach will mitigate high temperature abrasive wear, cost, maintainers time associated with repairs, and thermally protect the BMI composites.   BENEFIT:  These unique coatings will be directly and immediately applicable for OEM application and repair of the F-35, and ultimately any other military aircraft requiring high temperature abrasion resistance. Additionally, these coatings can be built up providing considerable thermal protection for many composites and extending the operational capability of composite aircraft. Another future application for these coating may be in the area of conductive high temperature thermally protective coatings for composites. Use of the new technology will result in the savings of thousands of repair and production hours.

Total organic carbon (TOC) indicates the overall quality of reclaimed and stored water and their suitability for crew consumption by indicating the potential presence of hazardous chemicals. For extended missions, water monitoring requires reliable, real-time, online sensors, with limited or no need for resupplied chemicals, and low equivalent system mass (ESM). The goal of this project is to develop a reliable, compact, flight-qualifiable, microgravity-compatible, TOC analyzer (TOCA) for online, real-time water monitoring with an operational lifetime of 5 years with no need to resupply chemicals or water.

        "abstract": "One of the main attributes contributing to the competitiveness of rotorcraft, is the continuously increasing expectations for passenger comfort which is directly related with reduced vibration levels and reduced interior noise levels.  Such expectations are amplified in the VIP market where people are used in the acoustic and vibration levels of civil and executive jets.  One of the most critical excitations for interior noise in helicopters is the one from the gearbox.   Thus, the structure-borne noise path (i.e. excitation propagating from mounting locations through the fuselage structure to the panels of the cabin and to the interior) must be captured in rotorcraft interior noise computations.  This proposal addresses the need stated in the solicitation for developing physics based tools that can be used within a multi-disciplinary design-analysis-optimization for computing interior noise in rotorcraft applications.  Currently, there is no robust simulation capability for this type of acoustic simulations.  The hybrid FEA method can be used for structure-borne helicopter applications and can be integrated very easily (due to the finite element based model) with models from other disciplines within a multidisciplinary design environment.  It combines conventional FEA with Energy Finite Element (EFEA) and it extends the frequency range of applicability of an existing finite element model by converting the elements that model the flexible panels into EFEA type of elements.   A seamless Hybrid FEA capability of commercial quality will be developed based on MES' commercial EFEA code.

        "abstract": "In Phase I, NP Photonics has successfully demonstrated the feasibility to fabricate a single mode THz crystal fiber as THz parametric converter that can generate high power, narrow linewidth, and tunable THz source by leveraging our proprietary fiber processing techniques. In Phase II, we will further optimize the design and fabrication process of the proposed THz crystal fiber converter under collaboration with University of Dayton, and demonstrate the highest conversion efficiency for THz parametric generation by using the proposed THz fiber parametric converter, owing to its features of THz fiber confinement, quasi-phase-matching, high NLO coefficient (100 pm/V). We will achieve the compact high power fiber-based THz source with average power of 1-10 W, widely tuning range of 0.1-7 THz, and narrow linewidth of 1-100 MHz. Furthermore, for the high resolution THz spectrometer based on NP\u2019s narrow linewidth THz source, we will demonstrate the detective sensitivity below sub-part per million and noise equivalent power (NEP) below 1.0x10-14 W/Hz\u00bd. Finally, NP Photonics will offer product or prototype services of THz crystal fiber converter, high power THz source and stand-off high-resolution THz spectrometer for Air Force NDE applications in Phase II.  BENEFIT:  Currently, the THz spectral region has been underutilized because of the inadequacy of THz sources. The proposed THz crystal fiber converter and high power tunable fiber-based THz source are expected to break this limit, which has the advantages of compact, high efficiency/power, high spectral resolution, extremely wide tunability, and room temperature operation. So this proposed THz crystal fiber converter, high power tunable fiber-based THz source and the THz spectroscopy will have large potential market in THz applications, such as nondestructive evaluation (NDE), remote characterizing damage in aerospace materials, as well as standoff trace detection of hazardous materials and explosives in field due to the fast response, room-temperature operation, low noise, and high sensitivity.",

LUNA is based from the concept of CheMin, the XRD/XRF instrument of MSL, but is redesigned to provide a more compact unit at much reduced costs. Many details of LUNA derive from the designs of a small portable XRD/XRF instruments developed and marketed by inXitu. Bringing LUNA to TRL 6-7 is possible within the scope of this Phase II because key components have been or are being developed.  Phase 2 addresses the missing critical subsystems: a low-cost flight-qualifiable X-ray CCD, and flight-qualifiable electronics to drive the detector and control the instrument.   LUNA is not frozen in a particular geometry or mechanical implementation, it is meant to be flexible to answer the specific needs of any lunar mission.  Transmission or reflection geometries are possible as demonstrated by inXitu's commercial instruments.  Phase 2 will demonstrate a reflection version of LUNA operating under vacuum.

        "abstract": "We propose to develop a novel capacitor film with nanodielectric blocking layer for energy storage capacitor applications. The innovative dielectric materials combine the high dielectric constant, high temperature stability, high dielectric breakdown strength, low dielectric loss, fast discharge speed, and long lifetime of two different components. In addition, the capacitor film can be manufactured with inexpensive film processing machine in a short time. The film capacitors will be designed and fabricated utilizing the unconventional nanodielectric capacitor film, state-of-the-art film metallization technology to promote self healing, and robust capacitor design and packaging. The advanced capacitors will have energy density above 10 J/cc, dielectric loss lower than 0.01, dielectric breakdown strength above 600 V/\u0192\u00ddm and Weibull shape parameter above 30, and self healing feature. The high energy density, high performance film capacitors can be used to enable the miniaturization of the electrical power system on the air and space platform to support more electric aircraft and high voltage loads for direct-energy weapons.  BENEFIT:  There are numerous applications that will benefit from the improved energy storage capacitors with high voltage endurance, long lifetime, fast discharge, low loss, and high energy density. These capacitors can be used in pulse-forming networks (PFNs) for the conversion of prime electrical energy into the necessary short pulses of energy needed to energize loads such as high power microwave, directed energy, kinetic energy weapons, and high power microwave. The Army is developing future vehicles which require compact electrical power systems. The Navy is developing the all-electric ship in which the power requirements of future Naval vessels will not be as dominated by propulsion as current ships and it may be desirable to be able to transfer energy between uses. This will require storage and conditioning of vast amounts of power. In addition, weapons, catapult systems and other military technologies that demand pulses of power would require very large banks of dielectric capacitors. In parallel, the Air Force is developing more-electric-aircrafts and the Army is trying to develop all electric tanks. Compact, high-energy-density, pulse-power capacitors will be the enabling technology for all future weapon systems that the DoD plans to pursue. In addition, these advanced capacitor film can also be used for implantable cardiac defibrillators, external defibrillators, and capacitor bank for hybrid electric vehicles.",

        "abstract": "The OneTESS program is the U.S. Army next generation system for conducting live training exercises of simulated force-on-force/target engagements.  The existing weapon orientation system for the OneTESS program uses magnetometers to obtain the weapon heading information. Unfortunately, the magnetometer measurements are highly susceptible to many random error sources such as sun spot activity, power lines, and hard/soft iron effects.  In addition, the GPS methods for obtaining absolute heading information during indoor exercises are vulnerable to RF multi-path problems and to signal degradation and loss.  In the Phase II program, Trex Enterprises Corporation in collaboration with Innalabs Inc. and Evolution Robotics will design, build, and field demonstrate a revolutionary sensor system that provides an ideal solution to the OneTESS weapon orientation problem and can be used in other commercial and military applications.   The proposed Celestial/inertial Weapon Orientation Module (CWOM) integrates three advanced navigation technologies: Inertial Sensor Technology, Celestial Navigation sensor system, and Optical Navigation Technology for both outdoor and indoor operation.  The CWOM overcomes principal limitations of the current weapon orientation system and provides a means for precise measurement of weapon\u2019s aim point in highly dynamic and difficult magnetic environments.

        "abstract": "Optical fibers are extensively used in military aircraft, both as interconnects in electronic cards and in aircraft frames. Fiber ribbons, manufactured primarily by W.L. Gore, used in computer cards suffer significant breakage failures, usually close to the exit point of the MT connectors and at points where they have been tacked to prevent movement. Fiber cables, primarily manufactured by OFS, suffer \u201cmaintenance induced breaks\u201d when, for example, a heavy object falls on them or they are bent sharply at an anchor point. Both these situations would benefit from development of a rugged, durable optical replacement fiber. Ideally, it should be a drop-in replacement for currently used fiber. There is significant handling associated with the bonding of optical transceivers to circuit cards which can result in broken or cracked fibers that later become failure points. Optical cables used in aircraft frames, such as JSF and F-18, are manufactured by OFS, Tensolite and General Cable. A cable made by using a high temperature thermoplastic buffer layer, as proposed by Linden, is likely to be both hermetic and strong. Programs such as JSF may benefit from development of such cables. Linden fabricated and tested an optical fiber consisting of commercial polyimide buffered fiber surrounded by a dual extruded layer high temperature thermoplastic and fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP). These can be applied to bend insensitive fiber already available commercially from OFS, DRAKA, Corning and Sumitomo. This is attractive since it takes COTS fiber and makes it kink and bend insensitive, moisture resistance, chemical resistant and exhibit high tensile strength. The cable has been tested to be impact resistant, kink resistant, and passes temperature cycling test.",

The safety and well-being of the crew critically depends on early detection of threats as well as maintaining stable and acceptable conditions in the crew habitat. Prototype sensor technology being developed on this project addresses both aspects. Carbon monoxide formation is a reliable indicator of evolving fire threats and this gaseous combustion product allows rapid early detection.  A highly sensitive carbon monoxide sensor is proposed for early, fast and unfailing fire detection.  Current fire detectors are prone to fatigue and have insufficient sensitivity, selectivity and time-response.  Smoke detectors cannot detect early stages of combustion and become unreliable if exposed to dust particulates.  A second project part addresses habitat air composition monitoring.  A multi-species device will be developed to simultaneously monitor oxygen, carbon dioxide and moisture. The optical sensors developed on this project have unique features like fast response, high precision and strong species selectivity.  Design criteria such as small footprint, low weight, low power consumption as well as internal calibration and continuous sensor health monitoring will be implemented to provide spaceflight optimized sensors.

        "abstract": "Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations for combustion do not currently have the predictive capability typically found for non-reacting flows due to the prohibitively high computational cost incurred when one introduces detailed chemical kinetics. In this SBIR project, we propose a novel method, Adaptive Chemistry, to enable such detailed modeling. This method adapts the reaction mechanism used in CFD to local reaction conditions. Instead of a single comprehensive reaction mechanism throughout the computation, smaller, locally valid reduced models are used to accurately capture the chemical kinetics at a smaller cost. Our Adaptive Chemistry approach seeks to obtain a reduced model guaranteed to be valid within the variable range for each grid point, and controls errors rigorously without evaluating the very expensive full model. Adaptive Chemistry also dynamically constructs a reduced model library based on real-time reaction conditions to prevent large memory overhead for arbitrary solution trajectories. This also allows Adaptive Chemistry to be easily extendable to transient problems. Finally, Adaptive Chemistry allows users to set a constraint on the largest model size by using a skeletal model, but selects each reduced model based on the full, detailed chemistry, which obtains a guaranteed optimal solution more efficiently compared to the traditional skeletal model methods.\n\nIn this project, we will develop an error-controlled reduced-species Adaptive Chemistry software package that can be easily interfaced with any CFD solver. The first objective of this work is to continue developing needed methods for error-controlled reduced-species Adaptive Chemistry for steady-state reacting flow simulations. The second objective is to implement the available methods into a modular package that can be easily interfaced with any CFD solver. We will also develop an Adaptive Chemistry module that can be coupled with the PREMIX program for commercialization.",

A distributed array of bimorph tuft sensors is embedded in a flexible, self-adhesive backed sheet of polymide substrate.

The development of algorithms that leverage and recognize the interactions and interdependencies between DAC and TFM is the key innovation of this effort. Some examples of expected operational improvements include 1) reduction in congestion and delays when sector capacities (Monitoring Alert Parameter or Dynamic Density) are violated, 2) reduction in controller workload and improved safety, 3) ability to accommodate user preferred routes and weather uncertainty and 4) achieve a balance between airborne delay and grounding holding delay. The SBIR Phase-I effort demonstrated how a combined DAC-TFM algorithm determines an optimal airspace configuration different from a DAC-only algorithm and could result in minimization of peak count and dwell time variance. The effort also included the design and preliminary implementation of a TFM model that uses ARTCC sector configuration to determine the delays that is generated, absorbed and propagated. The Phase II effort includes development of DAC-TFM framework as an enhancement to NASA's ACES- DADS (Dynamic Airspace Design Service) work and interaction of NASA's airspace partitioning DAC algorithms such as MxDAC, DAU slicing and Sector Combination algorithms with the TFM models using the same framework.",

The objective of Phase II is to raise the TRL by comprehensive development/improvement of the prototype system, extensive performance evaluation, and close collaboration with Pratt & Whitney for technology transition. The success of this program will bring significant benefits to the propulsion industry by providing a cutting-edge engine diagnostics system with features that have never been available, including adaptive nonlinear engine model, adaptive threshold, transferrable-belief-model-based residual evaluation within a unified framework. These novel technologies will greatly improve performance of onboard engine diagnostics system especially during transient operations and further reduce false alarm rate and missed detection rate, resulting in improved flight safety and significant reduction in overall engine maintenance cost.",

        "abstract": "IAI  is actively developing Software Defined Radio platforms that can adaptively switch between different modes of radar operation by modifying both transmit waveforms and receiver signal-processing on the fly. Our Plug-and-Play (PNP) transceiver innovation focuses on implementing maximum transceiver functionalities on a single digital reconfigurable platform (FPGA), and minimizing the number of analog components. The proposed work directly supports AFRL\u2019s objective to develop a Hybrid MIMO Phased Array Radar (HMPAR), where a transmit array is partitioned into sub-arrays which can be electronically steered in different directions and driven by separate transmit waveforms. Our proposed digital approach provides excellent control over amplitude, phase and frequency of radar waveforms, which is critical for phased-array radar implementation. Since the transceiver is reconfigurable, it is easy to change its operational modes by switching between configuration files stored in memory on-board the PNP transceiver. Scalable and modular hardware architecture allows phase coherent interfacing of multiple PNP transceiver sub-modules to drive a number of phased-array elements. Our collaboration with LM-MS2 will support the incorporation of Radar Open Systems Architecture (ROSA) into the transceiver design to maximize universal PNP capability.  BENEFIT:  The proposed technology is built upon the software defined radio expertise of IAI. The most promising commercial applications outside of Air Force are: \u2022 Arbitrary wideband waveform synthesizer \u2022 High-speed digital processors \u2022 Reconfigurable radar transceiver with multi-mode capabilities \u2022 Cognitive radios",

The Raman laser is pumped by commercially available fiber laser at near-infrared wavelength. Its wavelength can be selectable by tuning the pump laserwavelength. The PBG fiber is fabricated using a new IR material developed in Phase I, which is highly transparent in the broadband infrared region. Confining hydrogen and pump light together in the hollow core of the PBG fiber can lead to much higher Raman laser conversion efficiency and low threshold. The all-fiber laser structure is compact and robust. No free-space optical components are used. It is insensitive to environmental changes in temperature, pressure, humidity, and vibration. The laser can be used for infrared countermeasures to the next generation of heat seeking missiles and for high-resolution, long-range target identification remote sensing of biological or chemical agents. In Phase II, we will produce the PBG fiber and build a prototype of the all-fiber infrared Raman laser.  BENEFIT:  The all-fiber, robust and compact infrared Raman fiber lasers can be used as infrared countermeasures (IRCM) for defense against heat seeking missiles or man-portable air defense system. Illumination, targeting, secure communications and sensing are also important military applications for the fiber lasers.  Infrared lasers are of great interest for a wide range of scientific and technological applications from spectroscopy and frequency metrology to information technology, industrial process control, photochemistry, photobiology and photomedicine, contamination control, atmospheric chemistry, imaging as well as rapid detection of explosives, chemical and biological agents.",

Current Direct Digital Synthesizers (DDS) consume too much power are too large for space and airborne applications where power and size are critical factors. An integrated DDS is needed that 1) exploits submicron integrated circuit technology to meet power and size constraints, and 2) defines new approaches for the DDS architecture so that goals for tuning range, spur free dynamic range (SFDR), time to switch frequencies (tuning time), and tuning frequency resolution can be achieved. RBS Technologies LLC and its subcontractors  plan to pursue an innovative DDS architecture which would be implemented in submicron CMOS technology to meet the stringent objectives specified in the SBIR topic description. The proposed DDS architecture eliminates the need for some of the standard components in a conventional DDS which are bottlenecks to achieving the desired spectral purity (SPDR), tuning range, and frequency switching times.  BENEFIT:  High performance compact low power Digital Synthesizers are a critically needed item at the present time and the demand will become stronger in the future. The application focus of this research effort is for Air Force advanced electronic warfare systems, but successful demonstration of a low power implementation of a integrated circuit digital synthesizer will also spur future R&D for Army and Navy EW applications.

We propose a new approach where low cost, extensive measurement campaigns can be made using standard meteorological balloons.\n\nIn this SBIR program, Southwest Sciences is developing a lightweight, inexpensive greenhouse gas sensor suitable for balloon sonde measurements, Using a novel measurement technique, this sensor will provide dry air mixing ratios of CO2 without the need for concurrent measurements of temperature, pressure or moisture.

The goal is to reduce costs of maintaining critical engine components and to enable life extending, on-condition maintenance practices. In this proposal the specific needs addressed are: (1) Residual stress relaxation mapping and tracking for critical engine components, and (2) NDT before and after CBM actions, such as LSP, LPB and shot peening. Fatigue lives of rotating engine components are greatly enhanced through application of shot peening and other processes that impart residual compressive stresses to their surfaces. X-ray diffraction measurements, however, confirm that these stresses relax during service, rapidly or gradually, and can vary by location. This proposal addresses the need for a nondestructive method of measuring and tracking residual stress relaxation with scanning MWM-Arrays. JENTEK\u2019s patented MWM-Arrays have demonstrated capability to provide residual stress relaxation imaging for shot peened nickel alloys and we are confident we can transition a solution within two years. This proposed program will also address stress relaxation in titanium alloys. Scanning MWM-Arrays, already integrated into automated engine disk inspection systems in use at Navy depots, have the potential to provide crack detection and residual stress relaxation tracking with a single inspection system.",

Our approach to the development of the functional components of the MADPT PS software is the use of services oriented architecture (SOA) and data model mediation capabilities of enterprise service bus (ESB) components of emerging enterprise-level software architectures. This approach enables our team to leverage a significant source of new capabilities that provide innovative data model, data mediation, service oriented architecture development, display frameworks, and re-use of business logic functional components. The MADPT PS software will support pre-mission risk assessments. In addition, our approach will support post mission validation of risk assessments using in-situ environmentals, ship tracks, and actual sonar transmissions for ship and aircraft. The marine species sighting software, a sub module will reduce manpower requirements related to sighting of marine species during active exercise. The transition of this capability into the Undersea Warfare Decision Support System (USW-DSS) provides a clear path for operational transition into the fleet to support environmental and mission planning communities.",

        "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have undergone tremendous technological advances over the last few years, and a broad range of ubiquitous computing applications have been enabled in the area of distributed sensing and control. To fully achieve the potentials of WSNs, designing a reliable and secure routing mechanism becomes critical. The key innovation of this work herein described is a Trust-Aware dynamic Routing Framework (TARF), which will complement existing cryptography-based approaches. The intent of this work is to incorporate theories of trust from social networks into sensor networks, in order to provide a reliable and trustworthy routing path in the dynamic WSN environment with both system and environmental uncertainties. Here the system dynamics refer to security dynamics caused by the unknown and varying nature of the nodes which comprise the WSNs. The advantage of the proposed TARF can be summarized as follows: 1) Enhanced security by trust-aware routing, 2) Scalable, 3) advanced trust management, 4) Low overhead, and 5) Easily integrate with existing routing protocols and security solutions.    BENEFIT:  First, wireless sensor technologies have shown its potential for various military applications, such as surveillance awareness, intruder detection, battlefield monitoring, and target tracking. However, the increased deployment of wireless sensor technologies is facing a challenging requirement of security. The traditional view of security based on cryptography and authentication alone is not sufficient to provide a complete solution. The proposed Trust-aware routing framework will provide a complementary approach. It can be easily integrated with existing routing protocols and deployed on commercial available wireless devices. The proposed solution will have tremendous potential in sensor network related defense applications. Our technology can be integrated with the sensors and systems being developed by those prime contractors for their DoD customers. We will leverage our on-going relationships with these Prime contractors to transition our Phase II technology into the DoD applications. The market for military applications is quite large. Second, a broad range of ubiquitous computing applications has been enabled in distributed sensing and control areas, such as border network, environment monitoring, structural health monitoring, pipeline leakage detection, disaster recovery, and chemical detection. Correspondingly, there is a growing demand for secure and reliable information delivery, which is critical to the operation of the U.S. critical infrastructures, such as energy, water treatment, agriculture, and transportation systems. Our technology has significant potential for providing information delivery reliability in these applications. We believe that our technology could be integrated with communication vendor products to enhance performance in sensor networks.  The size of the market is quite large and may grow rapidly with the commercial demand for network reliability and security.",

        "abstract": "Environmental factors can strongly attenuate electromagnetic waves, degrading communication distance, data rate, signal-to-noise ratio and reliability of RF systems.  Magnetic near-fields are an attractive alternative to propagating electromagnetic wave communication because the former are not negatively impacted in environments that interfere with RF communication.  Near-field magnetic communication (NFMC) has traditionally been realized through coil-to-coil inductive coupling. Because magnetic near-field strength decreases rapidly (1/r3) with increasing distance from the source, receive coils must contain many electrical turns, making communication over 100s of meters challenging.  This Phase I program demonstrated a novel approach to NFMC by replacing the receive coil with a magnetostrictive/electroactive (ME) laminated receiver measuring typically 20 mm \u00d7 8 mm \u00d7 0.4 mm.  The pT field at 140 m from a 46 cm diameter coil of 6 Ampere-turns was readily detected with the ME receiver.  The Phase II effort will further develop the NFMC system by improving the internal properties of the ME receiver, designing sophisticated and power efficient transmit and receive electronics, and optimizing system efficiency.  The Phase II prototype NFMC system will be wearable and provide soldiers with 2-way voice communication over many hundreds of meters and data transmissions (such as text) to distances over 1 km.",

The effort is multidisciplinary and requires varying levels of expertise in diverse and rapidly advancing technologies including materials science, photonic-device design and fabrication, RF antenna and signal-processing. The sensors and the instrumentation could be incorporated with other equipment used in the test and measurement of electromagnetic fields. The sensors will be tested to the limits to characterize nonlinear behavior operation and to create correction and calibration factors over the desired operating range. The testing is expected to stretch some of the sensor devices to failure to fully understand and characterize the device capability. In order to validate the new sensors that are being developed, a test has been proposed that combines a realistic environment, wherein an actual High Power Microwave (HPM) source is used in a unique test chamber that can accommodate both near and far field RF measurements.",

Under this proposed funding, TRA will continue to work with the potential users of this program and make necessary modifications to increase its utility. In particular, we will add functionality to increase the interaction between the Rapid Review portion and the Detailed Analysis portion, increase the size of images handled to enhance overall performance in rural areas, allow the use of signature data bases, and conduct training. The steps performed will take the HVE to TRL 7 and ready for a full operational demonstration.",

The rapid deployment of networked systems has not yet led to an equally advanced plan for the maintenance community to identify and perform preventative maintenance on these systems. As a result, the potential for mission failure due to system faults has risen to an unsatisfactory level. To address this problem, Cybernet developed the architecture for an Automated System Test and Repair System (A-STAR) that will detect system faults and automate repair actions with minimal input from a Crew Member. A-STAR will reduce the time required to verify and maintain the integrity of today''s submarine combat system, and minimize the possibility of system failure during mission critical operations by continuously monitoring the integrity of the Submarine CCS for faults and providing Navy crew members the solutions in real time. Ultimately, A-STAR will deliver the Navy the following capabilities: Detection and alert of combat control system faults; generation of repair actions for resolving mission critical functions; generation of system design metrics based on the accumulated knowledge base; and automated execution of predictive repair actions.",

The process for extracting the needed aerodynamic database will be prototyped and validated using a scale model of the P-8A aircraft. A major advantage of the CTSi approach is the option to dynamically scale the model. This allows the responses of the model to be compared to the full-scale aircraft for flight conditions that the full-scale aircraft can fly. Because the full-scale aircraft cannot be safely flown in most upset recovery scenarios, the CTSi scale model approach may provide the only means to validate the aerodynamics and control system response that the full-scale aircraft may exhibit.",

This ML sensor system will also be demonstrated on a curved blade using conforming shadow masks. Characterization will include microstructure, thermoelectric performance, and survival to thermal cycling/oxidation. Finally, the sensor system will be tested in a burner or engine rig to simulate the thermo-mechanical environment of turbine engine operation. In the Phase II option, we will demonstrate the reproducibility of sensor fabrication on curved blade surfaces and expose coated-blades in the burner or engine rig.

Using pulsed laser beams projected from two small spotting telescopes and range gated detectors, we are able to remotely measure 2-D wind vectors at contiguous range intervals along a 3-km targeting range with the accuracy and resolution needed to significantly improve ballistic trajectory prediction and decrease dispersion. The technology is simple, robust, and builds on decades of development by several groups and the principal investigator, using scanning aerosol backscatter lidar. The turbulent flow of air in the lowest layers of the atmosphere insures an abundant supply of airborne aerosols to serve as tracers of atmospheric motion. Innovative SESI lidar technology turns what were previously one-of-a-kind scientific research instruments into a compact, rugged, and affordable operational wind profiling instrument suitable for military and civilian applications. SESI''s Phase II instrument will be a production prototype suitable for use on the Aberdeen Test Center''s various gun test ranges. Versions small enough to be man portable are contemplated for sniper teams, or weapon mounted for howitzers. Civilian applications include airfield wind mapping on a continuous basis and wind surveys needed for developing wind energy farms.",

CRG\u2019s SMP bladder tooling reduces labor costs and manufacturing time for fabricating complex composite parts. Conventional silicone or latex bladders are not rigid enough to support composite lay-up before custom molding. This process is labor intensive, can produce seams, wrinkles and bridging, and often results in inaccurate part shapes. These drawbacks have led to the theory of an inflatable bladder core used as the mandrel, but conventional bladder cores lack the structural integrity required for accurate composite lay-up. SMP bladders operate both as rigid mandrels and inflatable bladder cores initially providing a rigid, durable surface for composite lay-up, then flexibility and inflatability when the part is formed against the interior of the final mold. Phase I demonstrated SMP bladder tooling feasibility for composite fabrication of a representative part. Phase II will focus on using SMP bladder tooling to fabricate a full-scale composite Navy rotorcraft part.",

The individual cells of the MCTB contain a thermal storage media that is specifically designed for optimal performance at a given temperature range. Each of these cells is charged with thermal energy from hot regolith that has been used in a lunar ISRU application. Once the MCTB is charged, the heat is transferred from the battery to newly harvested regolith. In this manner over 85% of the heat can be transferred from the expended to the new regolith. This is a large improvement especially considering that this reduces the heating requirement to produce 1000 kg of O2 from lunar regolith from an average of 1 kW to only 0.15 kW (assuming 3% O2 recovery by weight). The other irreducible power consumption of lunar ISRU O2 production is electrolysis which consumes at least 0.3 kW. Hence, using the MCTB decreases the irreducible power consumption of lunar ISRU by 65 %.",

It is important not only to recognize and reward good performance, but also to groom future leaders. Developing effective assessment techniques that are valid, effective and fair is an ongoing challenge. Assessing factual knowledge using multiple-choice test batteries is relatively inexpensive and tends to be commonly used. Hands-on assessment is the most effective in assessing task proficiency but is resource intensive and expensive. Computer-based simulations enable users to be assessed in the context of skill application under controlled conditions. However, they are expensive to produce and maintain. Validated guidelines and methodologies are needed to help organizations develop effective assessment simulations. Rapid authoring tools are needed to reduce costs.  To address these challenges, we propose to develop a standard, prescriptive methodology for developing assessment simulations. Using our existing products as a basis, we also propose to develop rapid simulation-development tools that make this solution cost-effective.

        "abstract": "SEAKR Engineering\u2019s Application Independent Processor (AIP) standard product integrates FPGAs, GPPs and malleable interface support into a flexible onboard processor designed to support many spacecraft applications.  The AIP architecture reduces risk, costs, and schedule for satellite missions by providing a reconfigurable space-based platform and variations of the system are slated to be deployed in a variety of missions including communications waveform processing, real-time image processing in the ARTEMIS sensor on TacSat-3, and is being baselined for the vision processor unit on NASA\u2019s Orion crew exploration vehicle.  This capable system concept is well suited to processor-intensive missions like 3GIRS sensor OBP and the results of the preliminary study undertaken by SEAKR Engineering in Phase I of this SBIR have identified areas for improvement to meet the future goals of the program.  The goals of phase II are to work toward upgrading the AIP to meet current and future 3GIRS requirements and thus improve the system\u2019s commercialization success.  Ultimately, the technology developed under this program will be integrated into the planned 3GIRS missions as well as other space-based sensor processing missions.

To address this need, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to complete the development of the Extended Realistic Network Optimization with Terrain fading model (ERENOT) with accurate representation of complex terrain effects in network simulations based on extension of terrain effects and cross-layering to the open-source NS-2 network simulator.  The ERENOT extensions include not only NLOS and LOS models, but also realistic terrain effects based on inclusion of geographical models with mesh representation of terrain, reflecting its characteristics of RF fading, either completely dropped or partially transparent to RF signals.  ERENOT further extends NS-2 with cross-layering control and activity analysis, enabling assessment and analysis of cross-layer optimization on end-to-end quality of service matrices in complex environments. In Phase I POC successfully demonstrated ERENOT feasibility by developing and validating a terrain fading model at 315 MHz and integrating it with NS-2. In Phase II POC will advance the ERENOT design to a full-scale simulation software prototype with both spatial and temporal fading and cross-layering, and demonstrate the impact of multiple cross-layer interactions on end-to-end quality of service metrics.",

In the Phase I, a nearly-ideal blocking voltage SiC Thyristor with improved Gate-Anode design was found to offer the best solution for the challenging requirements. Extensive analytical and 2D device simulations were conducted to accurately model SiC FPS Thyristor devices and their performance was verified. Important Gate-Anode structures were fabricated in a commercial semiconductor foundry to demonstrate critical technology that enable the realization of these high voltage SiC devices. Low inductance power packaging technology was explored that allows reliable packaging of up to 28 kV devices. In Phase II SBIR program, five batches of SiC FPS Thyristor devices will be designed and fabricated with successively increasing voltage and current capabilities to meet the program objectives.

Materials of interest include spinel, polycrystal alumina, and AlON. However, the description, fabrication and metrology of these surfaces can be costly, or even impossible. Fabrication of these surfaces is difficult, since they are not axisymmetric and can have varying local radii of curvature, rendering grinding, lapping and polishing of these surfaces untenable. A method to overcome these difficulties in fabrication is to apply ductile mode machining (DMM) to eliminate grinding, lapping and polishing. DMM has been successfully applied to spinel, AlON and sapphire in Phase I. Through the use of physics-based modeling, DMM conditions can be identified where material removal results in ductile chip formation, damage free surfaces and excellent surface finish. This SBIR activity extends the technology of DMM to transmission optical materials enabled by physics-based modeling technology.

(PSI) and its team member, Aerojet, propose to synthesize and evaluate a range of novel furazan based energetic oxidizers with high performance (high energy, high oxygen balance, high density, low sensitivity) and clean combustion (chlorine free). During the Phase I program, PSI developed a two step synthesis for a furazan oxidizer from low cost precursors. The synthetic methodology is very adaptable to a wide range of furazanic precursors to produce similar oxidizers with desirable energetic properties. In the proposed Phase II effort, PSI will scale up the oxidizer synthesis, as well as synthesize and evaluate related structures based upon the methodology developed in the Phase I work. Depending upon the energetic properties of the materials successfully produced and their projected cost, the PSI-Aerojet team will select the furazanic oxidizer that will be scaled up for formulation and motor testing. PSI proposes to produce up to 450 g of the target oxidizer and will demonstrate its use in propellant formulations.  The formulation and motor testing will take place at Aerojet Corp.  This effort will advance the understanding and use of this promising class of compounds.",

        "abstract": "The nature of electromagnetic launchers requires operation in a harsh environment due to the large electromagnetic field, electrical current, temperature, and mechanical stresses present during a shot. This environment can significantly reduce the lifetime of the rails and therefore limits the military utility of the device. Increasing the lifetime of the rails while maintaining high launch velocities is a critical requirement for electromagnetic launcher development and is the focus of a number of ongoing research efforts. These efforts, however, are hindered by a lack of diagnostic capabilities to support the modeling and simulation needed to design better launchers. Diagnostics are a particular challenge for electromagnetic launchers for a number of reasons, including a lack of access to the interior of the launcher, electromagnetic interference with sensors that use electrical signals, and high temperature and mechanical stress conditions that make survivability of sensors an issue. The electromagnetic launcher modeling and simulation (M&S) community has identified a number of parameters that represent critical diagnostic capability shortfalls for electromagnetic launchers. The highest priority items on that list are temperature, magnetic fields, and stress measured with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution. During Phase I project, PhosphorTech successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a high-speed and repeatable phosphor-based approach to measuring temperature up to 700 degrees C. The proposed Phase II work is based on further development of the technological innovation performed in Phase I and subsequent implementation on actual electromagnetic launchers.",

        "abstract": "This Phase-II SBIR proposal proposes the use of a new class of diamond-seeded solid-state material system for the manufacture of virtually all packaged intense heat-generating solid-state electronics in X-band and Ballistic Missile Defense radar components and systems. In this proposal wherein much preliminary (also MDA-funded) work has been demonstrated hitherto by the authors, Gallium Nitride-on-SiC power amplifiers in X-band radar are replaced with GaN-on-Diamond power amplifiers to enable nearly total and immediate heat extraction from the device\u2019s active region. This proposal is focused on producing a 3\u201d GaN-on-Diamond FET wafer, as well as 5 W/mm GaN-on-Diamond FET devices. Polycrystalline free standing CVD diamond \u2013 nature\u2019s most efficient thermal conductor \u2013 enables nearly perfect heat extraction from a \u201chot\u201d device, owing to the extreme thermal conductivity of diamond (GaAs, Si, and SiC are 35W/m/K, 150W/m/K and 390W/m/K respectively; diamond ranges from 1200-2000 W/m/K depending on quality). In the proposed scheme, the device\u2019s active epitaxial layers are removed from their original host substrate and transferred to a specially treated low-cost CVD diamond substrate using a proprietary low-cost manufacturable scheme. The semiconductor-on-diamond technology proposed here may be applied to Si, GaAs, GaN, SiC, SiGe, etc. at up to 8\u201d in wafer diameter.  BENEFIT:  It is expected that GaN-on-diamond power amplifiers deployed in an X-band and BMD radar system will result in (i) a 50-80% reduction in thermal management devices/space volume, and (ii) a 250-800% increase in heat dissipation performance while maintaining LRU form factor \u2013 when compared to traditional technology such as GaN-on-SiC or InP. The boosted heat-dissipation performance will also be reflected in the transistor\u2019s maximum output power density, gain, frequency bandwidth, and power amplification efficiency when compared to traditional (Si, GaAs, GaN, and SiC) technology. GaN-on-diamond based devices cost the same as traditional semiconductor-on-semiconductor technology owing to a) the low cost of CVD polycrystalline diamond ($200-$400 per 4\u201d diamond wafer), and b) the availability of large diameter diamond substrates (6\u201d & 8\u201d) compared to standard GaN and SiC (3\u201d and 4\u201d). The proposed solution requires no moving parts, liquids, or gases. Group4\u2019s proposed technology is expected to impact other markets including Wireless base-stations, WLAN, Radar, ultra-bright White/Blue/Green LEDs, Laser Diodes, Household ovens, etc. that are worth over $1bn.",

This limited gain and bandwidth constrains the maximum communication data rate for submarines. With the increasing communication requirements planned for the OE-538 mast (e.g. Iridium), future antennas in the OE-538 mast will need to make more efficient use of the limited available aperture. Fortunately, there are some opportunities for better utilization of the aperture within the OE-538 mast. For example, the area in the AFT portion of the radome (behind the backbone) can be utilized to enhance the azimuthal directivity of the UHF antenna. Another example is that both GPS and Iridium can utilize the space currently allocated for the GPS antenna while providing a conduit to a Ku-band antenna located above. Finally, the UHF antenna can be redesigned to accommodate both UFO and MUOS frequency bands. Toyon has extensive experience designing antennas for the OE-538 mast.

According to the solicitation, the device should be of appropriate scale to be field deployable and/or wearable. Ozone, formed in photochemical air pollution, has well documented adverse effects on human health, including reduction of lung function and aggravation of preexisting respiratory disease such as asthma. Emergency department visits, daily hospital admissions and mortality increase during episodes of high ozone concentration. A Personal Ozone Monitor (POM) is required for environmental health studies of the physiological effects of ozone and for validating computer models of human exposure. In the Phase I project we successfully developed a small (4 x 3 x 1.5 inch), light weight (0.7 lb), low power (2.9 watts), low cost ( 795 in parts), battery-operated POM based on the well established method of UV absorbance (an EPA Federal Reference Method). The pocket-sized POM has a precision and accuracy of # 2 ppb, makes new measurements every 10 s and has an internal data logger for downloading data to a personal computer. During the Phase II project proposed here, we will further improve and finalize the development of the POM to include the following: 1) dedicated ground plane on the printed circuit board to further reduce noise, 2) ruggedized, easily manufactured enclosure, 3) human interface consisting of liquid crystal display and keypad, 4) docking station with battery charger, 5) GPS for co-locating measurements with geographical coordinates, and 6) wireless communication between the POM and docking station. Firmware will be developed to support the new functions, and software will be developed for data acquisition and graphing by a computer and for uploading ozone data to the web. The efficacy and accuracy of the POM will be evaluated in personal exposure monitoring studies conducted at the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute (EOHSI) of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. Several large markets for a pocket-sized ozone monitor have been identified in addition to personal ozone monitoring; these include rapidly growing industrial applications of ozone and the Global Ozone (GO3) Project, an international educational project in which high school students build and operate an ozone monitoring station and share their data as an overlay on the Google Earth  map.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to develop a less invasive long-term copulsation device to treat patients in late Class III and early Class IV stages of heart failure (HF). Chronic congestive heart failure is the largest unsolved problem in cardiac care today. There are over 5.5 million people in the United States with this diagnosis and the number of patients is expected to double over the course of this decade. ABIOMED's key innovation will be an apically placed implantable partial left ventricular assist device (LVAD) system designed for copulsation, called the Apical Copulsation Device (ACD). Synchronizing assist with the heart will reduce the work required by the heart during systole and unload the left ventricle during diastole. Phase I proved the feasibility of the ACD both in bench testing using a specially designed mock loop and in three in vivo animal studies. The system control is based on the left ventricular pressure and it successfully and consistently ejected 30 ml of blood during systole after the native ventricle opened the aortic valve and completed this ejection before the valve closed. No dilatation was observed and the ACD reduced the mechanical external work required by the ventricle up to 45% with no significant increase in end-systolic pressure compared to baseline. This device can be implanted through a thoracotomy and without cardiopulmonary support, reducing the risks associated with more invasive techniques. Phase II of the program will focus on developing a durable, integrated system for extended use and characterizing its effects on the heart. There is currently no published chronic in vivo data for copulsation therapy and studies will be conducted to assess the system's hemocompatibility and how the body reacts to this type of support over time.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic heart failure (CHF) affects over 5 million Americans, with 550,000 new cases diagnosed annually. The associated mortality rates are high with CHF patients under age 65, 80% of men and 70% of women die within 8 yrs. The 1-yr mortality rate is 20%, and that figure jumps to 60% for patients with end-stage (decompensated or New York Heart Association Class IV) heart failure. There are few treatment options for end-stage CHF and medical management is the first line of treatment with limited results. Heart transplantation can provide significant individual benefit, but its impact is limited by the number of donor organs available; worldwide, less than 2900 heart transplants occurred in 2005. Over the past 15 years, mechanical circulatory support has become an established means of treating end- stage CHF. A ventricular assist device (VAD) is a blood pump that is designed to assist or replace the function of either the left or right ventricle. The device is most commonly deployed on the left side (i.e. as an LVAD), where blood is withdrawn from either the left atrium or the apex of the left ventricle. The blood then passes through the pump and is returned to the ascending aorta. The Apical Copulsation Device (ACD) proposed here affords a very effective ventricular decompression and unloading without requiring cardiopulmonary bypass or a sternotomy. The role of VADs has evolved since their clinical introduction. For end-stage CHF patients, the Thoratec HeartMate LVAD that originally received approval for bridge-to-transplant (BTT) use is now approved for alternative-to-transplant (destination therapy or DT). The results from the REMATCH study showed that for patients who are not candidates for cardiac transplantation, mechanical support increased not only the survival rate, but also scores on physical and emotional tests at one year compared to patients treated with medication. While extending the life of these patients is important, the quality of this life is paramount. Earlier treatment of HF using the ACD approach provides the opportunity to treat many more patients and may also be more effective in preserving end organ function and restoring quality of life. With over 100,000 patients in the United States receiving biventricular pacemakers each year, it is anticipated that up to 50,000 patients may be candidates for chronic copulsation therapy. The market for copulsation technologies is a sizable portion of the moderate to severe HF patient population (represented by approximately 250,000 to 300,000 annual cases in the U.S. alone) and, hypothetically, may have a very significant total market potential (estimated at  0.8 to  1.0 billion).",

        "abstract": "Traditional enterprise cyber-security methods are inadequate to address the increasing number of threats, particularly within larger and higher-performance networks.  Several government and third party organizations report consistent failures within corporate and federal, state, and local government networks.  A key point of failure in securing these networks is the centralized security architecture which relies heavily on single-point-of failure network appliances such as firewalls, while insufficiently protecting the end systems. Several commercial off the shelf (COTS) solutions provide distributed security functions for standard networks operating at data rates up to 1 Gb/s. However, to date, no distributed solution has emerged that supports the requirements of high-performance networks operating at 10 Gb/s and beyond.  To that end, we propose to address these problems by developing a distributed security platform designed specifically for high-performance networks.  This system will consist of a Secure Network Interface Controller (sNIC) card designed for use in high performance end systems, clusters, storage area networks, etc., along with software for management and support.  It will be designed to meet or exceed the security guidelines established by NIST Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 200.  In Phase I, Acadia proved the feasibility of an FPGA-based sNIC card capable of operating at 10 Gb/s and beyond. An alpha prototype system which incorporates industry-standard security features such as SSL Encryption Engine, Firewall Engine, and Quality of Service (QoS) Engine operating at 10 Gb/s and a secure Authentication, Authorization, Accounting, and Auditing (AAAA) channel was developed. A thorough study was undertaken to examine the compatibility of widely available remote management and monitoring tools with the proposed system.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: In Phase 2, Acadia will transition the Phase-I feasibility study and the prototype hardware demonstration into a complete system ready for commercialization.  We will deliver a complete distributed security solution for high-performance systems on an FPGA-based Secure Network Interface Controller (sNIC) card. The system envisioned here is especially well suited for large-scale high performance enterprise networks such as those in use in DOE and in large corporations",

Manual antenna design and optimization methods are time- and labor-intensive, limit complexity, and require significant expertise. Genetic algorithm (GA) optimization has demonstrated success at quickly finding effective antenna design solutions not ordinarily found through engineering intuition. To harness the power of these search algorithms currently, an engineer must be an expert in both GAs and Electromagnetics. In Phase I, feasibility of a highly-automated design approach where useful antennas can be generated without requiring significant guidance was demonstrated: the user simply inputs design requirements (e.g., RF performance, dimensions, etc.), and an automated optimization produces compliant designs. \nIf successful, this technology promises to improve the performance and economics of future antenna applications for commercial and government customers.  The world is in the midst of an explosion in the number of new wireless, mobile, and RF systems - all of which rely on one or more antennas. Yet antenna design has changed little in the past two decades, with large up-front costs and slow, inefficient trial-and-error methods.

        "abstract": "The Navy reduced manning requirements drive the need for more sonar automation. Automatically detecting and classifying targets of interest meets the challenge of reduced manning and workloads required for passive anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and torpedo detection, classification and localization (TDCL). The signal processing technology is comprised of a system architecture and a suite of algorithms which have the potential to provide a robust, automatic detection, classification and localization system for torpedoes. The Phase II effort is focused on finalizing and prototyping the automated data exploitation architecture based on the design concepts developed in Phase I. Both the SQQ-89(V)15 Combat System and Torpedo Warning System (TWS) programs require TDCL capability to detect, classify, and localize threat torpedoes with sufficient range and accuracy to support effective countermeasure engagement. Both systems require high probability of target classification with very low false alert rate. Testing to date has indicated a specific need to reduce automated false alert rate while maintaining current probability of correct classification. The tasks included in this Phase II address the false alert rate issue in several areas: improved spectral classification, improved target state estimation to support spatial and kinematic classification, and improved multi-target tracking.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The shortage of nurses and medical technologists is accelerating. Shortages can be reduced by scheduling staff to precisely meet the hour-by-hour demand for medical service. Think of bank teller scheduling, where more staff are scheduled at peak demand. Current attempts to schedule to demand are relatively primitive: a small number of quantized fixed shifts, for example: 7am-3pm, 10am-6pm, 3pm-11pm, 7am-7pm, 7pm-7am, etc. is allowed. The pre-determined fixed shifts are rigid input parameters for the scheduling process and workers are assigned to the shifts. In this innovation, fixed shifts are replaced with flexible shift parameters; specifically, a range of start times and shift durations that are harmonious with worker lifestyles. These parameters become elastic inputs for the scheduling algorithm. The actual shift assigned to a worker on any particular day is computed with the objective to have just enough workers to meet the hour-by-hour demand. Phase I research successfully determined the efficacy of worker-friendly, flexible shift scheduling and found savings of 4 percent are possible. Four percent can cut the current worker shortfall significantly and corresponds to annual savings of  3.5 billion in healthcare costs. Despite many scientific studies of flexible shift scheduling, there is a dearth of practical commercial applications primarily due to the complexity of technologies employed in the research. In Phase II, a simple but powerful technology, Monte-Carlo simulation, will be employed. The hypothesis is that a Monte-Carlo simulation can be developed that uses worker-friendly, flexible shift parameters to precisely meet the hour-by-hour demand for medical service. The Specific Aim is to find an objective function that quantifies the goal of meeting hour-by-hour demand and a set of shift perturbations for the Monte-Carlo process to use during the simulation. The commercialized product will be a new module for DOCS Scheduler, Acme Express Inc.'s healthcare staff scheduling software that is already in the marketplace. The current DOCS Scheduler was designed for salaried (physicians) staff and uses fixed shifts. Using flexible shifts is an entirely different innovation and focuses on shift workers like nurses and medical technicians. A new module that saves 4 percent in healthcare staffing costs will be a market-changing, competitive advantage for Acme Express, Inc.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An ageing population with increasing lifespan, coupled with healthcare worker retirements and high turnover, is exacerbating the shortage of healthcare workers. The USA nurse shortage of 200,000 workers in 2008 is estimated to be 1,000,000 by 2014, with similar estimates for medical technologists. Phase I found that healthcare worker shortage can be reduced by 4 percent and healthcare worker morale improved by using flexible shifts that are harmonious with worker lifestyles to schedule staff precisely according to demand for medical service. In Phase II, Acme Express, Inc. will employ a simple but powerful technology, Monte-Carlo Simulation, to automatically build the staff schedule, minimize periods of overstaffing, and significantly reduce healthcare labor costs.",

        "abstract": "A 24-month SBIR Phase II Project titled \"Weapons Effects FRMs for Small Munitions on Urban Reinforced Concrete Walls/Slabs.\"  The stated objective of this solicitation topic is to develop High-Fidelity Physics-Based (HFPB) Fast-Running Models (FRMs) for simulating the effects of small weapons in urban structures and materials.  This proposal covers RC walls and slabs while an accompanying proposal covers masonry walls.  The main focus of this project is to develop FRMs to predict secondary debris generated when small cased munitions detonated at impact or at partial penetration on urban walls.  First we propose to validate the selected HFPB modeling approach by comparing its predictions with experiments conducted by JLF over several years.  Then, we will exercise the validated HFPB tool in a parameter space to generate virtual data to develop and calibrate our FRMs.  In this Phase II, we proposed to develop FRMs to predict (a) hole size, (b) residual capacity index, (c) debris mass, (d) correlated debris mass-velocity distribution for RC walls.   BENEFIT:  In recent years, the US military finds itself more and more involved in urban warfare.  In urban warfare or MOUT armed forces have to exhibit caution so that their actions will not harm civilians and friendly forces in the area.  These precautions exclude the use of large weapons and therefore the military is extremely interested in the use of more precise small weapons.  These small weapons are often used to breach urban walls and can be inert projectiles or explosive projectiles (cased weapons) that a) detonate upon impact or b) set for a delayed detonation during partial penetration in order to maximize damage.  The physics of the inert or explosive impacts and the resulting breakup and debris generation of these munitions are very complex and validated numerical methods do not yet exist.  Therefore, there is a need to develop validated small munitions models capable of determining the consequences of their use in order to assist military planners and soldiers in the field. The HFPB models that can simulate the complex phenomena involved in the impact of an inert/explosive ammunitions require vast computer resources and skilled personnel to setup and run the models; this is not suitable for military planners and commanders who need quick answers or to perform \"what-if\" studies.  Therefore, it is necessary to develop FRMs that capture the essence of the HFPB simulations and run very quickly.  The FRMs also need to provide information to the analysts/planners on their predictive accuracy (confidence in the results) given the inherent uncertainties in the modeling process.  For example, commanders might like to know what munitions to use and where to impact a wall of a particular construction material (e.g., concrete) in order to breach the wall and create a hole that will enable a soldier into a building.  They might also like to know the how injurious the debris thrown from the wall breach will be to occupants or to critical assets.  The fast-running debris throw models  developed in this project will support these kinds of decisions.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Remarkable advances in signal processing techniques, materials sciences, battery technologies, and computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) processes have led to significant developments in assistive technologies. Coordinated research and commercialization have dramatically increased prosthetic function, utility, personalization, comfort-and unfortunately, cost. The initial cost of modern upper-extremity prostheses ranges from US 10,000 to US 40,000 (excluding recurring costs for maintenance and repair), placing them well-beyond the economic reach of many amputees worldwide. The extensive customization required to create modern sockets is a large component of the initial and recurring cost; socket replacement and refitting is recommended every three to five years. The monetary cost of purchasing, repairing, and maintaining prostheses combined with a lack of clinical infrastructure in some countries precludes a large percentage of the world's amputee population from accessing modern prosthetic technologies. In response to diverse patient needs, increasingly restrictive insurance regulations, and laws prohibiting the re-use of equipment, clinical prosthetists are faced with an urgent need for new prosthetic technologies that are 1) economically appropriate for disadvantaged persons, 2) designed to withstand repetitive rigorous use, and 3) easily fit on amputees without extensive customization. The critical element necessary to satisfy this need is an economically and technologically viable upper extremity socket (UES). Phase I of this proposed Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project successfully demonstrated the technical and economic feasibility of creating a low-cost UES that can be easily adjusted to accommodate residual limb variations in shape and volume over a defined size range (representative of a selected quartile of amputees). Elastic, rigid, and compliant materials were used to realize a design that remains stable and comfortable when used to support a load of 50 lbs during the performance of physically demanding activities such as lifting, pulling, and other actions commonly associated with farming, ranching, and manual labor. The design is easily adjustable, able to be fit on individuals within one (1) hour, and in production quantities has a manufacturing cost of less than US 50. Phase II encompasses making design refinements identified in Phase I and using anthropometric dimensional data from the protective equipment and garment industries to expand the basic socket design into a family of products covering three standard sizes: small (S), medium (M), and large (L). Manufacturing infrastructure will be established to produce commercial product for release into the marketplace in Phase III. This research effort has been intentionally formulated to address an important need revealed by the market, and to use NIH funding in a way that will significantly benefit disadvantaged men, women, and children in the United States and abroad who are affected by upper-limb deficiencies, in keeping with the spirit and purposes of the SBIR program.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Modern prosthetic sockets are highly functional, require extensive customization, and are prohibitively expensive for some individuals. A versatile new prosthetic socket for upper-limb amputees has been devised using advanced engineering methods and materials to realize appreciable cost savings. The socket is easily adjustable for individual users, is comfortable and stable, and enables disadvantaged amputees to perform physically demanding tasks associated with agricultural work and subsistence farming.",

        "abstract": "Selection of appropriate hearing protection devices (HPDs), such as earplugs and earmuffs, is important in mitigating noise-induced hearing loss among military personnel. The standard method of measuring the noise attenuation performances of HPDs is based on a psychoacoustic method involving human subjects, which is time-consuming, costly and inherently variable. It also cannot be used to measure the performance of earplugs with special acoustic features such as non-linear venting and active noise reduction, which are increasingly relevant for military use. An alternative is a physical measurement using a test fixture which has the advantage of being repeatable and efficient. However, conventional test fixtures are designed for the evaluation of earmuff-type HPDs and can be inaccurate for earplug-type HPDs. ATI is developing an advanced hearing protection evaluation system (HPES) which can assess a wider range of HPDs including earplugs. HPES is essentially a simulated human head with sufficient acousto-mechanical emulations for accurate evaluation of a variety of HPDs. The fixture is designed with the capability to accurately measure earplug attenuations, large microphone dynamic range and ability to take into account the bone conduction effect. This Phase II SBIR research will further refine the Phase I HPES design and develop a pre-production prototype.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will resolve the technical issues associated with scaling up the manufacturing of non-woven fabric composites made from a blend of coir fiber (from coconut husks) and recycled polypropylene.  Final product variability due to the coir fiber itself, the milling of coir fiber from coconut husks, and the manufacturing process to make the felted composite, will be minimized.  The variability of the coir fiber feedstock will be determined, along with the resulting variation of the composite's flexural stiffness.  The most cost-effective production process to produce consistently clean, 2-3\" long fibers in-country from husks will be defined.  Finally, the manufacturing processes required to produce these coir fiber composites with the required consistency for automotive applications will be developed.  This project will include continuous input from a major automotive manufacturer as well as an automotive parts maker.  This research will result in an improved readiness of a polypropylene/coconut fiber based non-woven fabric composite that meets industry certifications for use in automobile trunk liners, and which is greener, less expensive, and better performing than current all-synthetic parts.\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will take many forms.  The total market for automotive non-woven fabric composites is 300 million kg/year.  Each vehicle platform that adopts this technology will require 2 million kg/year just for the trunk liners.  Replacing synthetic fiber with coconut fiber makes parts more environmentally friendly while utilizing a waste material.  Petroleum consumption can be reduced 2-4 million barrels per year and CO2 emissions reduced by 450,000 tons per year by replacing polyester fibers with coir in automotive interior composites.  Additionally, the improved performance and lower weight of these materials will lead to cost savings through increased fuel economy, saving up to 3 million gallons of gasoline per year in the U.S.  Finally, this project will lead to great economic opportunities for poor coconut farmers and to a very positive environmental impact.  Ninety-five percent of the 50 billion coconuts grown worldwide are owned by 10 million coconut farmers whose average income is less than $2/day.  Approximately 85% of the coconut husks are currently disposed of as trash, creating pollution.  The successful adoption of these materials would create a market for this material, in many cases doubling the annual income for these farmers.",

        "abstract": "The Bureau of Land Management and other agencies have called the rapid expansion of energy exploration on the Rocky Mountain Front, the single largest environmental challenge facing the western U.S. The Powder River Basin (PRB) of Wyoming and Montana is an area of major development for coal bed methane gas (CBM) exploration. CBM resides in underground coal seams, trapped by large aquifers of water which contain elevated levels of salts and sodium ions. In order to harness CBM, these saline-sodic \"discharge\" waters must be pumped to the surface. Discharge waters are already causing degradation of soil, water, and air quality, loss of drinking water reserves, increased soil erosion, reduction in land values and agricultural productivity, degradation of wetlands, native range habitat and dependent species, risks to human and animal health, as well as impacting rural community life. In 2008, more than 900 million barrels of discharge were pumped to the surface in the PRB with 120,000 new wells expected to come on line in the next 20 years. Each well can produce as much as 20 tons of salt being applied to the surface, impacting thousands of acres of land. The EPA has called for the development of phytoremediation (plant-based) strategies to counteract and ameliorate the negative effects of discharge water on soil and water resulting from CBM exploration in cold-arid environments. No such efforts have currently been developed. In Phase I research, Westscape Nursery demonstrated that their selected, adapted halophytes (highly salt-tolerant plants) have the ability to remove sodium and other toxic elements (including selenium) from impacted soil and water, as well as evaporate (via transpiration) large volumes of salinated water. In Phase II, Westscape will further develop advanced breeding lines and clonal material with enhanced abilities for these traits. These plants will be integrated as part of a pre-vegetated mat system which can be readily deployed for in situ soil and water remediation on CBM and other similarly impacted sites. The (erosion control-like) mats will also contain proprietary formulations of fertilizer, growth, and other biotic factors for enhanced establishment and performance of the mats. Westscape anticipates that at the end of Phase II, it will have an innovative, market-ready, phytoremedial technology that is environmentally friendly, easy to use, and far less expensive to implement than current mechanical solutions currently being employed. The proposed technology is widely applicable across the region. Exploration companies are being strongly encouraged to take more pro-active measures at reducing the deleterious effects of CBM development; the BLM and other agencies manage expansive tracts of impacted lands in the West; private land owners and agricultural operations could also benefit from this technology. In 2010, Westscape will implement a field-scale demonstration of this technology in a contract with the US Fish & Wildlife Service for reclamation of saline and selenium impacted land at the Hailstone National Wildlife Refuge in central Montana.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The detection and enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) has the potential to become a very powerful tool in cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, current technologies for CTC detection are not yet established in routine clinical practice. One reason is that CTCs are present in blood at an extremely low concentration of one in 10 million white blood cells. Existing technologies lack the sensitivity and/or specificity required for reliable detection of these rare CTCs. Another reason is that current technologies do not offer information about the molecular status of CTCs, which can be used to select appropriate targeted therapy and monitor therapy response. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop an automated system called CTCscope  for detection and molecular phenotyping of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood. This automated system is based on the successful development of ACD's RNAscope  technology and prototype CTCscope system, both of which are supported in part by a SBIR Phase II grant R44CA122444. Our aim in this proposal is to develop and validate the automated CTCscope  system for sensitive detection, accurate enumeration, and molecular characterization of CTCs. The long term goal of this effort is to leverage CTCscope  to develop a suite of high value cancer diagnostic products. These products would satisfy many significant unmet needs in cancer management, especially in the areas of early detection, therapy selection and guidance, and recurrence monitoring. With the support of the SBIR phase II grant, we have successfully developed the RNAscope assay capable of in situ multiplex detection and quantification of RNA markers with single molecule sensitivity and exquisite specificity. We have also developed a manual prototype system for CTC detection and analysis. The manual system includes three components: 1) CTC preservation: CTCs are preserved and RNA stabilized in the blood sample; 2) CTC labeling: CTCs are labeled for multiple RNA markers in situ by the RNAscope assay; and 3) CTC detection and analysis: CTCs are detected, enumerated and characterized based on RNA marker signals observed under the fluorescent microscope. Using this system, we have demonstrated highly specific detection of circulating tumor cells and characterized their EGFR expression status in breast cancer patients. These data demonstrated that CTCscope  has several unique capabilities which could potentially offer significant advantages over existing CTC detection methods. In this proposal, we will extend our current work to develop and validate an automated CTCscope  system for reliable detection and enumeration of CTCs, and for quantitative analysis of RNA markers reflective of CTCs' molecular phenotype. In addition, as part of the CTCscope  system validation, the HER2 and EGFR status of the CTCs and their concordance/discordance with their status in primary tumor will be determined. The specific aims include: 1) Develop an automated CTCscope  system for CTC detection and molecular characterization; 2) Validate CTCscope  by comparing its performance with the CellSearch(R) system using blood samples from ~230 metastatic breast cancer patients; and 3) Determine HER2 and EGFR status on CTCs and compare their status on primary tumors. The specific outcomes of this research will include an automated CTCscope  platform that is successfully developed and validated, enabling a suite of high value diagnostic products to be developed for greatly improved cancer management. This research will also lay the foundation for a valuable diagnostic product that can guide targeted therapy selection and monitor therapy response for metastatic breast cancer patients. With the CTCscope  platform successfully developed and validated, a suite of high value diagnostic products can be developed for greatly improved cancer management.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a SBIR Phase II Bridge Grant application. The automated CTCscope  system developed under this proposal will enable reliable detection, accurate enumeration, and molecular analysis of circulating tumor cells, which will lead to a suite of high value cancer diagnostic products for early detection of cancer, for selecting right cancer patients for targeted therapies, for determining their response to treatment, and for monitoring cancer progression and recurrence.",

Traumatic brain injury affects 3 out of every 1000 Americans each year accounting for as many as 60,000 deaths and an estimated 70,000 to 90,000 patients with permanent neurologic disabilities. Despite advances in the treatment of patients with head injuries, traumatic brain injury is the leading cause of death and disability in children, adults in their most productive years, and our soldiers in the military. The economic consequence of these injuries in terms of both lost productivity and the cost of medical care are enormous. While the last two decades of research has resulted in a greater understanding of the physiologic events leading to secondary neuronal injury, advances are needed in the treatment of elevated intracranial pressure and decreased cerebral perfusion secondary brain injury. The applicants recently developed a novel device to decrease intracranial pressure and increase in cerebral perfusion pressures. The new non-invasive device is inserted within a standard respiratory circuit between the patient and a means to ventilate the patient (e.g. mechanical ventilator). It functions by cycling between lowering intrathoracic pressure during the expiratory phase to subatmospheric levels and providing a means to provide positive pressure ventilation. The decrease in intrathoracic pressure, typically to -7 to -9 mmHg, creates a vacuum within the thorax relative to the rest of the body thereby a) enhancing blood return to the heart and consequently increasing cardiac output and blood pressure and b) lowering intracranial pressure thereby increasing cerebral perfusion. Use of the intrathoracic pressure regulator (ITPR) is intended to significantly improve patient outcomes, based upon a unique way to increase in blood flow to the heart and brain. Phase 1 studies, the investigators 1) Established safety and proof of concept of the ITPR device in animals by demonstrating that use of the ITPR in the first hour after a substantial and potentially lethal brain injury helped to maintain metabolic stability of the brain better than standard resuscitation fluid alone; 2) Incorporated an intrathoracic pressure vacuum gauge into the ITPR system and begun work on a closed loop system by prototyping a custom digital display interface that tracks important physiological variables like intracranial pressure and intrathoracic pressure and 3) Received 510k clearance of the device. This phase 2 research application proposes to 1) Demonstrate proof of clinical concept that application of the ITPR will result in a decrease in intracranial pressure and an increase in cerebral perfusion pressure in patients with head injury in a neuro-intensive care unit; and 2) Design and prototype an enhanced, variable vacuum version of the ITPR with self-contained vacuum source and power supply for use in the OR and ICU. If a significant clinical benefit is demonstrated in these Phase 2 investigations, the ITPR promises to provide a fundamentally new tool to increase cerebral perfusion and thus reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with increased intracranial pressures, including patients who suffer from traumatic brain injury and stroke.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this SBIR Phase 2 application is to continue the development and evaluation the intrathoracic pressure regulator (ITPR), intended to increase circulation and blood pressure clinically significant states of hypotension, including cardiac arrest and septic shock. This novel non-invasive device is inserted within a standard respiratory circuit between the patient and a means to ventilate the patient. It functions by decreasing intrathoracic pressure during the expiratory phase to subatmospheric levels after each positive pressure ventilation. The decrease in intrathoracic pressure, typically to -7 to -9 mmHg, creates a vacuum within the thorax relative to the rest of the body thereby a) significantly enhancing blood return to the heart and consequently increasing cardiac output and blood pressure and b) uniquely lowering intracranial pressure thereby increasing cerebral perfusion. Phase 1 pre-clinical studies demonstrated significantly improved survival and neurological outcome without adverse effects when using the ITPR to treat cardiac arrest and hemorrhagic shock. Recent pilot studies in humans with intra-operative hypotension provide support for the potential for this innovative technology to have a significant clinical benefit. Building further upon our recent and significant progress with this device including studies in animal models of cardiac arrest, hemorrhagic shock, and septic shock, the specific aims of this research include: 1) demonstrate proof of clinical concept that application of CPR and an active ITPR device in cardiac arrest patients will augment key physiological parameters including mean femoral systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and end tidal carbon dioxide values when compared to patients treated with a sham ITPR device and CPR; 2) demonstrate proof of clinical concept that application of an active ITPR in patients undergoing a) general abdominal surgery and b) hepatic resection surgery will augment key hemodynamic parameters including systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure and mean arterial pressure when compared hemodynamic values when a sham ITPR is used; and 3) refine the device design to address current and future clinical needs by: a) designing and manufacturing a commercial version of the ITPR device that can be easily inserted into an anesthesia circuit or attached to a resuscitator bag and vacuum source that includes a manometer, a means to quickly disengage and reengage the device and includes a gas sampling port; b) designing, manufacturing, and bench testing a prototype of an enhanced version of the ITPR (eITPR) capable of providing 3 phases of therapy: positive pressure breath during the inspiratory phase, negative intrathoracic pressure during the first portion of the expiratory phase and then positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) during the secondary portion of the expiratory phase; and c) evaluating the long-term effects of the commercial version of the ITPR and the eITPR on lung function in an animal model of lung injury. A positive CPR trial would result in a new tool to help save tens of thousands more lives per year after cardiac arrest in the US alone. Positive intra-operative studies promise to decrease morbidity and mortality for patients inside and outside the hospital with severe hypotension secondary to blood loss and other life-threatening causes. In addition, the proposed product enhancement work proposed in Aim 3b and 3c will provide a means to treat patients with ITPR therapy who have underlying pulmonary disease, thereby significantly expanding the potential clinical value of this novel non-invasive treatment modality for clinically significant and life-threatening hypotension.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite advances in the treatment of patients with life-threatening hypotension from traumatic injuries, trauma remains the number one cause of death among Americans between the ages of 1 and 44 and the fourth leading cause of death overall. The economic consequence of these injuries is estimated at 40 billion dollars in direct costs and over 400 billion dollars per year in productive life years. The main objective of this Phase 2 proposal is to provide proof of concept evidence in two carefully designed clinical studies that a novel device, the intrathoracic pressure regulator (ITPR), can rapidly counteract the effects of severe hypotension. As such, this new device has the potential to be an important new advance in treating life-threatening hypotension and thereby reduce civilian and military mortality rates.",

        "abstract": "Web searching has become a ubiquitous and indispensable activity for a wide spectrum of human endeavors. The success of Google and its competitors depends on extensive software and network infrastructures and costly hardware. Federated search engines, such as Science.gov, WorldWideScience.org and ScienceEducation.gov also run on powerful, albeit much smaller, server clusters that connect to diverse government and non-government information sources. Many desirable federated search and discovery applications would require prohibitively expensive server farms and network bandwidth to provide classroom and home access to high quality educational content in DOE, NASA, NIH and other government scientific and technological databases for millions of students and researchers. Next generation federated search and discovery applications must implement economical and scalable solutions to accommodate new information services for very large numbers of potential users and information sources.  The goal of this SBIR project is to find a highly scalable and affordable alternative to the server farms, network bandwidth and performance bottleneck by integrating the federated search application into the web browsers of individual users. Another important goal is to achieve better quality search results by developing a next generation distributed federated search technology with powerful semantic search and personalization capabilities.  The Phase I project developed a proof-of-concept prototype running an advanced Web 2.0 federated search engine plugin inside the Firefox browser. The prototype has hybrid semantic search capabilities that are distributed between the federated search engine client and the remote knowledge base server.  The Phase II work will research and implement robust federated search engine plugins and add-ons for the major web browsers. The Phase II research will also develop expanded semantic knowledge bases (e.g. for energy, health, education) and explore how the client-side federated search engine can optimally utilize remote knowledge base web services to support powerful semantic search functions that produce better search results. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The novel client-side federated search architecture, and the innovative semantic search capabilities to be implemented during the Phase II research, will open up significant new commercialization opportunities for very large scale applications in the education, health, science, technology and business markets in Phase III and beyond. At the same time, there will be important opportunities for this new technology to offer public benefits, especially in the form of free access to high quality government and other educational and health resources for tens of millions of students and the general public",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that 2 million health-care associated infections are acquired each year by hospitalized patients resulting in 90,000 deaths and about  4.5 billion in excess health care costs. A large and growing percentage of these infections can be attributed to Staphylococcus aureus and, in particular, to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Rapid PCR-based tests have been developed for screening MRSA in health-care settings, but the high cost and complexity of existing nucleic acid testing platforms have limited their acceptance for routine screening in most health-care settings. The goal of this project is to develop a rapid, low-cost, easy-to-use nucleic acid testing platform that can be deployed for MRSA screening in a wide range of health-care settings. The proposed testing platform is based on Advanced Liquid Logic's  digital microfluidics  technology which enables programmable micro-manipulation of sub-microliter sized droplets using an electrode array formed on a low-cost and disposable printed circuit board substrate. In Phase I of this project Advanced Liquid Logic developed chip-based methods for rapid thermocycling, real-time PCR detection, magnetic-bead based sample preparation, and reaction preparation and mixing. In Phase II, these results will serve as the foundation for the development of a product prototype nucleic acid analysis system for near-patient and point-of-care use. An MRSA screening test will be developed on the platform and extensively validated in preparation for an FDA submission. Ultimately, additional cartridges could be developed for screening and detection of other health-care associated infections. This lab-on-a-chip platform will offer significant advantages over other approaches in terms of flexibility, scalability, performance and cost.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A system for the detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus will be developed to help control the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospital settings.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work is focused on exploring the physiological processes and therapies associated with hot flashes. The project proposes to develop a tool for use by researchers studying hot flashes in broad population research studies. Hot flashes are experienced by approximately 80 percent of American women between the ages of 45 and 54 and are a significant concern during menopause. Typically expressed as a period of intense heat with sweating, flushing and rapid heartbeat, episodes usually last from five to ten minutes, but have been reported to last as long as an hour. These events frequently occur at night, and may be repeated anywhere from a few times per week to dozens of times per day. No longer relegated simply to women reaching the end of their child bearing years, hot flashes now affect breast cancer survivors, women with chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure, oopherectomized women, women being treated for endometriosis or infertility with gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists such as Lupron, and men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Hot flashes are often disruptive and unpleasant, with broad overall health consequences affecting work responsibilities, social activities, sleep, etc. The fundamental physiological triggering mechanisms of hot flashes are not well understood although hot flash therapies are an area of active research often including large therapy trials in broad populations. These studies require an objective measure of the hot flash phenomenon that optimally correlates with self-reported diary data, is specific to hot flashes, and is accurate under ambulatory conditions.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced Medical Electronics Corporation (AME) proposes to develop and deploy a smartphone-based health-coaching tool, which we will specifically design for people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Regular spontaneous physical activity plays a large role in maintaining health, including for patients with COPD. This tool consists of a smartphone, software, and two custom activity monitors on the patient end, and a remote server, software, and a computer on the health care professional end. We propose activity monitors to detect and measure both high-dynamic motion, such as walking, and low-dynamic motion, such as shuffling. Commercially available devices, such as pedometers and accelerometers, may measure the former, but not the latter. We use smartphones, cellular phones with PC-like functionality, e.g., RIM's Blackberry, Apple's iPhone, etc., both for patient-physician communication as well as a computing platform in which to run measurement algorithms and electronic diary/motivational software. The remote server contains a repository of patient activity data and hosts a web application that allows health care professionals to manage patients and assess their adherence to their exercise regimens via a web browser. A key feature of this tool is its electronic diaries, which permit patients and physicians easy and ubiquitous access to activity results to use them for making decisions, e.g., health coaching or self management, in order to increase physical activity. In phase I, we designed the proposed tool and established its feasibility by validating two key components. In phase II, we will finalize, deploy, and validate the entire tool via a clinical trial.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed methodology, which we will test in a human study, may have profound significance in chronic care: 1) access to accurate information about physical activity that can be used for health coaching/self management and may influence patients to be more active, an independent predictor of mortality and well- being, and 2) the proposed methodology is feasible for widespread use due to its size, cost, and use of elements familiar to patients and increasingly available, i.e., smartphones such as RIM's Blackberry, which facilitate its use and interpretation. Since this methodology allows health care professionals to directly or remotely adjust mutually set goals and motivational reminders to patients based on their accomplishments, it provides relevant information and responses in a timely and ongoing manner that direct patients toward activity.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop an advanced wireless home video electroencephalograph (EEG) system based on an ultra-miniature ambulatory EEG recorder combined with new synchronized wireless high-quality video recording technology. An initial diagnosis of epilepsy is often based on the description of a seizure, a neurological examination, and routine EEG studies. However, the cause of a seizure may still be unclear and longer term EEG monitoring can be used to confirm the diagnosis in both children and adults. Ambulatory EEG recorders are often used in these long term studies allowing a patient to go home with the recorder attached and continuously monitoring seizure activity. With currently available ambulatory EEG recorders, the size of the recorder and non-existent or limited video recording capability diminishes the benefits of ambulatory EEG. Video monitoring can play an integral role in the diagnosis of epilepsy. Recordings from the brain along with video recordings allow physicians to document and analyze patients' seizures. Video scalp electroencephalography (v-EEG) is a cornerstone technology for the evaluation of patients presenting with transient, paroxysmal clinical events associated with neurological symptoms. Ambulatory EEG recorders have existed for years and in the past decade they have been reduced in size and included limited video recording. However, the size of even the most advanced products remains an obstacle, particularly for small children, making home monitoring difficult. Ambulatory video monitoring is limited to a single tethered camera, if available. The recent widespread commercialization of several enabling technologies makes possible the creation of a miniature ambulatory EEG recorder with synchronized video approximately one-tenth the size of currently available systems. The proposed advanced ambulatory v-EEG will be developed and evaluated against a gold-standard clinical v-EEG system at the Mayo clinic.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: One of the most common neurological diseases is epilepsy. Epilepsy refers to the tendency to have unprovoked seizures, and encompasses a number of different syndromes. It has a prevalence of 0.5 to one percent. This translates to approximately two million persons in the United States. Expensive long term hospital stays for diagnostic video scalp electroencephalography (v-EEG) monitoring are typically prescribed. Ambulatory v-EEG carried out in the patient home can provide a large cost savings and patient benefit if size, ease of use, and adequate video issues can be resolved.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced Medical Electronics Corporation (AME) proposes to develop a tool for pulmonologists and respiratory therapists specifically designed for the care of home ventilator-dependent pediatric patients.  Technology-dependent, chronically ill children represent a broad population of patients that are more frequently affected by acute, life-threatening illness than the general population. Following a critical illness, children require specialized care to facilitate recovery and rehabilitation that does not impede social and psychological development. Early intervention may mitigate against the development of more severe illness that would likely require inpatient hospital care in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). However, intervention strategies have been confounded by the need for frequent assessment via physical exam in a relatively immobile patient population. At present, even evaluation frequently requires admission to a PICU or at a minimum, evaluation in an outpatient setting wherein patients are exposed to a wide array of infectious pathogens. Given the special monitoring equipment and the technology required to support these children, caregivers are appropriately concerned about traveling to a clinic for an assessment. The availability of technology that enables effective, timely, and reliable information transfer between the homecare providers and the attending pulmonologists and respiratory therapists is likely to decrease the need for transport and hospitalization, and provide a dramatically increased level of comfort for care providers in the home and ultimately the children.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Perchlorate, ClO4-, is a small highly water soluble anion created by both geogenic and anthropogenic sources. Anthropogenic sources include solid rocket fuel, matches, dyes, paints, airbag inflators, pyrotechnics, flares, and fertilizers. Human exposure to perchlorate is of concern because of the potential for impaired thyroid function, leading to a number of developmental delays and other medical problems. Most remediation projects rely on ion exchange resin bed reactors that operate in series as a fail-safe measure for when the first resin bed loses its ability to capture perchlorate, namely, its exhaustion-limit. Resin beds and resins are the largest cost item in the remediation process. If an online monitoring device could be developed that would warn operators of a bed reaching its exhaustion-limit, remediation efforts could operate more cost- effectively and with greater public safety.  In our successful Phase I effort, Advanced MicroLab, LLC (AML) worked with the Prof. Henry Group at Colorado State University to transform a proof-of- principle laboratory experiment into a proof-of-concept commercial prototype for online analysis of perchlorate. Our prototype was field tested at a remediation pilot plant with our collaborators, Applied Research Associates (ARA). Testing post-remediated water, perchlorate was baseline resolved from interfering ions with lt  1 5g/L limit-of-detection (LOD). Based on S/N, our device matched, if not out-performed, the gold standard, offline Ion Chromatography, in a side- by-side comparison. Additionally, we demonstrated resolution and reproducible detection of other ions in addition to perchlorate, such as, nitrate. In the proposed Phase II work, will transform a proof-of-concept prototype into a near- commercial demonstration unit meeting end-user specifications for online remediation processing. We will develop a companion field portable prototype for water source spot analysis in the field. We will also develop a companion analysis for nitrate and perchlorate from the same water sample.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Department of Defense alone spends approximately  88 million annually on perchlorate-related research activities, including  60 million for perchlorate treatment technologies. In addition to remediation efforts, untold millions of dollars are spent to barricade contaminated sites and forcing to treat alternative non-contaminated water sources. The majority of the burden for the problem falls on the American citizen either through higher tax rates or municipal water rates. AML provides an innovative technology capable of significantly reducing these burdens through more cost-effective remediation efforts. Our market research conducted in collaboration with remediation technology experts concluded a typical remediation effort would save  0.65 - 1.73 million over a standard 20 year installation lifetime, which translates into a potential savings of  32.5 - 86.4M in California tax dollars alone. More importantly, remediation efforts would be safer, benefiting public health. Remediation facilities have been known to fail with resin release into the public water system. Embedding a monitor within the process can detect malfunctioning equipment or abrupt environmental changes and flag the problem at an early stage before other system components fail.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer remains one of the top three cancers to affect and cause mortality in women. Major shortcomings with current treatment are the high level of side effects induced in patients and insufficient efficacy, particularly for patients with metastatic disease. Targeted cancer therapy is designed to treat only the cancer cells and minimize damage to healthy cells. These targets are critical to the tumor's malignant phenotype but not to the host's normal tissues, improving outcomes while minimizing systemic side effects. Anti-HER2, Herceptin, leads the way for targeted therapy in breast cancer with a much lower incidence of side effects and definite efficacy in a specific but small subset of patients. However, there is a clear need for additional therapeutic options including other novel targeted therapies. The 88 kDa autocrine growth factor called PC-Cell Derived Growth Factor (PCDGF), also known as granulin precursor (GP88), has been shown to play a critical role in breast cancer cell biology, exemplified by the following: 1) GP88 is an autocrine growth/survival factor for breast cancer cells, 2) increased GP88 expression in breast cancer cells is associated with increased tumorigenicity, 3) GP88 mediates tumor cell angiogenesis and invasiveness, 4) breast cancer cells overexpressing GP88 are resistant to current therapies - Tamoxifen, Faslodex, doxorubicin, 5) increased GP88 expression in breast cancer tissue correlates with clinical parameters of poor prognosis while normal and benign breast tissue are negative, 6) patients with poor prognosis have elevated GP88 serum levels. These experiments show the essential role that GP88 plays in breast cancer cell tumorigenesis and that the inhibition of GP88 expression or function leads to inhibition of tumor growth. These results highlight the importance of GP88 for targeted therapy of breast cancer via the development of anti-GP88 therapeutic neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (Mabs). Our Phase I research proposed to evaluate a library of murine anti-GP88 for antigen binding properties and for biological activity in GP88-dependent in vitro and in vivo functional tumor cell models. These Phase I specific aims were accomplished and resulted in the identification of anti-GP88 neutralizing Mabs with the in vitro and in vivo potency and efficacy to be candidates for targeted therapy in breast cancer to address a vitally important unmet clinical need. We have selected one Mab, AG1, for further pre-clinical development activities, specifically the generation and characterization of a recombinant Mab (chimerized and humanized Mabs). The following Specific Aims are proposed for this Phase II SBIR application:  1. Cloning of the cDNA encoding the variable sequences of the light chain and heavy chain of the antibody expressed by the AG1 hybridoma cells and generation of expression vectors for both a humanized (HuAG1) and a mouse-human chimeric antibody (ChAG1).  2. Transient expression of the HuAG1 and ChAG1 chimeric antibodies and validation of their binding properties. The antigen binding characteristics and biological activities of the cloned, expressed HuAG1 and ChAG1 will be evaluated and compared with the murine AG1 Mab in order to select candidate recombinant AG1 that fit acceptance criteria for further development.  3. Generate stable HuAG1- or ChAG1-producing cell clones. HuAG1 or ChAG1 selected above will be stably expressed in CHO cells. The HuAG1- or ChAG1-producing clones will be compared for cell growth performance, antibody productivity, and metabolic profile in order to select a candidate clone for scale-up production.  4. Express, purify and characterize the biological properties of the HuAG1 or ChAG1 Mab.  The Mab will be evaluated in relevant in vitro and in vivo functional tumor cell models and compared directly with the murine AG1 Mab. GP88 represents a novel, pre-clinically validated target for breast cancer. At the conclusion of this research in this Phase II project, we will have generated a mouse/human chimeric Mab with the in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical efficacy and potency for targeted therapy of breast cancer and we will have developed an optimized clonal antibody production cell line suitable for transfer to a CMO for contract manufacturing. However, once this chimeric anti-GP88 Mab has been generated and characterized it will require further pre-clinical development activities (e.g. formulation, pharmacokinetics and safety) before IND filing for clinical trials in breast cancer. These additional development activities will serve as the basis for a subsequent continuation/renewal Phase II SBIR application.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast cancer remains one of the top three cancers to affect and cause mortality in women. Major shortcomings with current treatment are the high level of side effects induced in patients and insufficient efficacy, particularly for patients with advanced disease. The innovative breast cancer therapy to be developed in this proposal will target a mechanism inherent in breast cancer but avoid the side effects associated with many current breast cancer therapies.",

The mTOR pathway is an important pathway in tumorigenesis and currently the target of several drugs on the market for kidney cancer (TORISEL(R) and AFINITOR(R)) as well as over a dozen compounds in Phase I-III trials for multiple tumor types. It has been demonstrated that a more complete characterization of the mTOR pathway is required to best determine the appropriateness of a specific therapy and as such measurement of a panel of multiple biomarkers will be required. Thus 20/20's L-IHC system is a most appropriate system for the development of mTOR companion diagnostics. This SBIR Phase II Bridge Award proposal seeks to develop what is likely the first mTOR companion diagnostic, PredicTOR , and clinical validation of this test in two or three cancer types, specifically kidney cancer, breast cancer and lung cancer. This work will be done in consultation with the FDA and will include the necessary protocols and procedures to obtain regulatory acquiescence or approval of the products as laboratory developed tests (LDTs). To increase the likelihood of successful and timely commercialization, applicant plans to match the requested  2.75 million in government funding (over 3 years) with at least  3.75 million in private sector investment. This private investment will come from one or more strategic partners ( 2 million) and individual investors ( 1.75 million). 20/20 has a proven track record in procuring both equity investors and corporate partnerships and has already successfully commercialized innovative products developed with federal funding. Commercialization of these products is expected by the conclusion of the funding period.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This SBIR Phase II Bridge Award proposal seeks to develop what is likely the first mTOR companion diagnostic, PredicTOR , and clinical validation of this test in two or three cancer types. This work will utilize 20/20 GeneSystems, Inc. proprietary L-IHC t=technology and will be done in consultation with the FDA and will include the necessary protocols and procedures to obtain regulatory acquiescence or approval of the products as laboratory developed tests (LDTs).",

        "abstract": "Virginia Cobia Farms Phase II USDA-SBIR grant is designed to assist our company at implementing discoveries made during our Phase research I into larger scale production where the process of cobia egg to market size fish production will be integrated into a single interlocking system. Building upon fundamentals established during Phase I, VCF proposes to investigate enhanced brood stock nutrition and its potential impacts upon hatchery output, determine optimal rearing temperatures during hatchery phase of production, establish a multiple grading protocols to increase production efficiencies during grow-out and optimize stocking densities for 1 kg and 2 kg market-sized cobia. This research collectively will produce 2 and 4.4 pound fish for the live market and fillet market, respectively, in RAS consisting of an integrated system of tanks designed as a prototype that will serve as the basis for VCF's large scale expansion scheduled to occur during Phase III. For this Phase II work, VCF will focus on both the production cycle and as well as the quality and consistency of its final product delivered to consumers in the Washington, DC metro area. We will also produce 4.4 pound market size fish for sale as \"bullets\" (head off gutted fish) to the retail fresh fish market. Continued development and optimization of our in house dietary formulations during Phase II will further the enhance VCF's efficiency and quality control during its rearing of cobia under low salinity conditions in RAS. This proposed Phase II effort will further augment USDA funded efforts awarded to VCF itself or its municipal partner, the Town of Saltville, VA, in the areas of renewable energy generation and rural business development. Successful completion of the Phase II effort will enable VCF to drive its integrated production methods into a modular design format and implement this format in a manner that will both reduce costs and shorten delay times in additional scale up and operations.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed SBIR program is to implement and evaluate a low cost retinal camera, the Laser Scanning Digital Camera (LSDC), in a system for diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening. Untreated DR has reached epidemic levels in underserved populations worldwide. As the LSDC has already demonstrated its readiness for DR screening in preliminary studies, a Fast-Track proposal is presented.  Existing instruments for retinal imaging have been inadequate tools for DR screening as they are too expensive or provide too high a proportion of ungradeable images. Unlike these devices, the patented LSDC design provides a combination of a non-mydriatic design and high contrast retinal images, yet remains low cost and easy to operate. Comfortable near infrared illumination provides strong light return from the retina regardless of eye color. Anterior and posterior segment imaging are real-time. These features allow the LSDC to screen patients with small pupils, darkly pigmented eyes, or moderate cataracts, while providing a sufficiently wide retinal field for analysis.  The LSDC will be further developed by Aeon Imaging, using field-testing data and analysis provided by UC Berkeley and Indiana University. Already low cost, LSDC materials and assembly cost savings will be explored further. Apart from low instrument costs, a supporting system that employs trained device operators and graders, including cost-effective and accurate image transfer protocols, is critical for overall DR screening success. Thus, Aeon will partner with an existing clinical communications system, EyePACS, operated by UC Berkeley, that is already providing DR screening and telemedicine referral services to underserved individuals.  In Phase I, Aeon, in collaboration with Indiana University, UC Berkeley, and Vision for All, will investigate the performance of the LSDC using trained but non-specialist operators. The initial screening will be feature- based, i.e. the success in detecting specific DR features with the LSDC will be analyzed. The LSDC will be compared against a commercial non-mydriatic fundus camera and a dilated fundus exam. In Phase II, Aeon will incorporate further cost reductions and operator/patient feedback from Phase I studies into the 2nd generation LSDC design. Aeon will also train non-specialist image graders to identify DR features found in LSDC images, and determine whether they can accurately specify which patients require referral for follow-on eye care. A comparative study will determine if screening with the LSDC using trained operators, telemedicine image transfer with EyePACS, and trained image graders matches the independent referral decision made using costlier devices and specialist image analysis. At the conclusion of this study, Aeon will have field-tested the LSDC and the low cost screening system, establishing its capability with respect to costlier approaches. If successful, Aeon will be prepared to expand DR screening operations and help reduce health disparities.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: 7. Project Narrative Aeon Imaging, LLC, will further develop a novel and low cost Laser Scanning Digital Camera that has already been shown to produce high contrast retinal images without pupil dilatation in patients from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. This retinal imaging device has a sufficiently wide field of view to visualize the optic disc and macula at the same time, and uses comfortable near infrared illumination for real-time imaging. To reduce the overall costs of diabetic retinopathy screening, the success of accurately recommending referral for follow on eye care will be assessed with trained, but non-expert, LSDC operators and image graders.",

        "abstract": "Assessment of CO2 exchange between the atmosphere and the biosphere remains one of the largest uncertainties in predicting carbon sequestration by vegetative uptake on a global basis.  Distinguishing between photosynthetic uptake and respiratory emission of CO2 is difficult, due to the small differences between two large parameters, but crucial for determining net ecosystem exchange for CO2 between the atmosphere and the biosphere.  Carbonyl sulfide (COS) is a surrogate for CO2 uptake by plants during photosynthesis, but COS is not emitted from plants during respiration.  COS measurements may be used to provide unique constraints on carbon assimilation by the biosphere that are independent of the influence of respiration.  This proposal would develop a highly precise and portable instrument for absolute COS measurements based on newly available continuous wave mid-infrared quantum cascade lasers (QCL).  The instrument, with a precision for COS of 1 part-per-trillion (ppt) with 100 s averaging time, would provide continuous measurements of COS both at ground level monitoring sites and from aircraft platforms in order to address the global distribution of COS sources and sinks.  A newly acquired QCL was used in a pre-existing laboratory spectrometer to demonstrate detection sensitivity for COS of 5 ppt with 1 s averaging time and 1 ppt in 100 s.  The system operated continuously for a period of 5 months sampling roof top ambient air from December to May.  Gradual variations in COS due with wind trajectories in the winter contrasted to sharp daily variations due to uptake by soil vegetation with the onset of spring.  This data set uniquely demonstrates the power of continuous monitoring for assessing carbon uptake cycles in the biosphere. We will develop detailed optical, thermal, electronic and spectroscopic designs for a Phase II prototype instrument.  We will build two versions of the resulting instrument to demonstrate the capabilities both for long term unattended deployments at a local forest research site, and the potential for global COS measurements from aircraft platforms.  The instrument will be rigorously tested against existing measurement techniques.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The proposed instrument will provide the capability to measure atmospheric abundances of COS in real time in order to better asses CO2 uptake by vegetation.  Improved understanding of CO2 uptake will improve our understanding of global warming and help mitigate global climate change.  There is a worldwide market for such measurement systems in the environmental and ecological research communities.  Potentially larger markets exist in the medical research community where COS measurements in exhaled breath can be used to diagnose cystic fibrosis, liver disease, and lung transplant rejection.",

        "abstract": "Aerosol particles have important impacts on visibility, acid deposition, climate, and human health, although large uncertainties remain in quantifying their chemical composition and atmospheric transformations.  A large fraction of the anthropogenic aerosol is generated from energy-related activities, and organic compounds are known to constitute a significant fraction of ambient aerosol mass.  Organic aerosol can be directly emitted from combustion sources or formed through gas-phase reactions of volatile organic compounds.  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the need for improved monitoring technologies for continuous particulate mass and chemical speciation of ambient aerosols.  A prototype Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor will be developed that measures ambient aerosol mass and chemical composition of non-refractory PM2.5 aerosol particles in real-time, providing quantitative measurements of particulate ammonium, nitrate, sulfate, chloride, and organics.  The instrument will be designed to run autonomously for extended periods of time and will need no expensive post-processing analysis.  The Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor will be a simple, robust, modestly-priced, aerosol chemical speciation instrument ideal for routine monitoring of local and regional air quality, for continuous emissions monitoring, and for process control monitoring.  The Phase I project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor.  A prototype was constructed and deployed in a field campaign for intercomparison with routine environmental monitoring instruments.  Progress was made addressing quantification issues.  During Phase II, a commercial version of the instrument will be developed.  Specific tasks include designing and constructing new hardware, optimizing the design of the inlet and detector, and developing new data analysis tools for fast and broad dissemination of particulate mass loadings and chemical composition. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor will provide cost-effective, quantitative particulate matter mass loading and chemical composition data for determining compliance with air quality standards, and for inclusion in atmospheric climate models.  The primary market for this instrument will be government agencies that conduct routine environmental monitoring programs.  In addition, atmospheric research groups at universities and national laboratories will provide a substantial market.  We expect that the system developed in this program will yield a significant level of direct commercial sales in the atmospheric science and environmental pollution research and development communities.",

A large fraction of the anthropogenic aerosol is generated from energy-related activities, and organic compounds are known to constitute a significant fraction of ambient aerosol mass.  Recently discovered discrepancies between measurements of organic aerosol mass and predictions from large scale atmospheric models suggest that our understanding of the sources of secondary organic aerosol is incomplete.  This SBIR project addresses the critical need for improved chemical characterization of the gas-phase organic compounds that serve as precursors for organic aerosol in the atmosphere.  We will develop and test a novel instrument for the measurement and characterization of atmospheric Total Gas-Phase Organics.  Gas-phase organic compounds will be collected cryogenically, desorbed, and measured with high-resolution electron impact mass spectrometry, a general technique allowing for the measurement of the total mass of all organic species, as well as key chemical characteristics, such as the oxygen-to-carbon ratio.  Temperature control of the sample desorption process will give information on the volatility of the organic compounds, a crucial element in understanding gas to particle conversion.

The primary market for this instrument will be atmospheric research groups at universities and national laboratories.  In addition, the instrument will be well-suited for environmental monitoring, as well as for the characterization of emissions from a variety of industrial and energy production processes, including aircraft combustors, gas turbines, fluidized bed combustors, diesel combustors, and conventional furnaces.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral edema (and its counterpart in the spinal cord) is a major contributor to the damage caused by stroke, traumatic brain injury, traumatic spinal-cord injury, and bacterial meningitis. Stroke alone is the third leading cause of death in the USA and the leading cause of disability. Unfortunately, few treatment options are available for cerebral and spinal-cord edema, and these are of limited efficacy. Central in the development of cerebral and spinal-cord edema is the H2O channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in the astrocytic end feet that envelope CNS blood vessel at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). AQP4 is upregulated by ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and a diverse array of other CNS pathologies associated with inflammation. But, paradoxically, AQP4- null mice do substantially better than their wild-type counterparts in experimental models of ischemic stroke, retinal ischemia, and bacterial meningitis, making AQP4 an attractive drug target. A unique aspect of the present proposal is the recognition that the AQPs are bifunctional proteins that are permeable not only to water, but also to dissolve gases (CO2, O2, NO). Indeed, the upregulation of AQP4 in the aforementioned pathologies may have the beneficial effect of maximizing O2 permeability across the BBB, with the side effect of increasing osmotic water permeability and predisposing to cerebral edema. The long-term goal of Aeromics is to develop a drug that treats cerebral edema by blocking the water permeability of AQP4, leaving gas permeability intact. In its Phase I SBIR, Aeromics already accomplished its major goals of (a) developing a very successful high-throughput screen (HTS), (b) developing appropriate counterscreens, and (c) identifying 6 hits from four different structural classes. The goals of this Phase II SBIR application are to: (1) optimize discovery-stage safety and efficacy screens, (2) use available compounds and some synthesis for medicinal chemistry to refine leads, generating several compounds appropriate for in-vivo testing, (3) perform in-vivo pharmacologic proof of principle, and (4) determine mechanism of action. The proposed work will prepare Aeromics for a Phase II renewal that will include additional medicinal chemistry, as well as the preclinical work necessary for filing an IND application for treating stroke-induced cerebral edema.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          Swelling of the brain (cerebral edema) and spinal cord is a major contributor to the damage caused by stroke, traumatic brain/spinal-cord injury, and bacterial meningitis. Unfortunately, only a few treatment options are available for such edema, and these are of limited efficacy. In its Phase I SBIR, Aeromics developed technology to identify new drugs for treating cerebral edema while maintaining the oxygen delivery to the brain, and in fact discovered 6 new drugs in 4 drug families. In this Phase II SBIR, Aeromics plans to use this information to create new drugs that it will test in animal models of cerebral edema and stroke. The next step will be to refine the drugs further and prepare them for human testing.",

This fast-response atmospheric turbulence probe (FRAT probe) will be able to sample ambient air, and measure CO2 and other gases.  Phase I work demonstrated that with a proper design of the probe nose, ingestion holes for gas sampling do not interfere with port pressure measurements. Variations of this probe will be able to operate in harsh atmospheric environments. High-frequency response and resistance to water spray were accommodated by mounting the pressure sensors in small chambers very close to the probe nose surface. To return the absolute instantaneous velocity of air and calculate atmospheric turbulence, the motion of the probe and the aircraft will be measured. To this end, the components of an Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS), namely accelerometers, magnetometers, GPS and other electronic equipment have been assembled, and tested.  These components will be packaged into a stand-alone probe system that will include an A/D board converter and a microcomputer. Software for post-processing of data will be developed.

Improvements to current methods of spacing aircraft could significantly increase airportal capacity, but there is currently limited awareness of wake encounters and information with which to assess spacing in real-time or to design new spacing schemes. AeroTech proposes to improve situational awareness of wake vortices and enhance the prediction of wake vortex transport and decay by continuing development of the In Situ Wake Vortex Encounter Detection and Reporting System (VEDARS). The VEDARS will quantitatively detect wake encounters from flight data; downlink encounter reports in real-time to enhance ATC awareness and enable assessment of spacing schemes; and collect and report meteorological parameters from aircraft for use in wake transport and decay predictions. AeroTech is also proposing to improve the accuracy and reliability of reported wind speed and direction (and hence crosswind estimation) by improving and validating an estimator for sideslip angle. A reliable and accurate crosswind estimate is a key component in predicting the transport of wakes.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Neuropathic pain is a common complication of cancer, diabetes mellitus, viral infections, and other causes. Although physicians currently employ a variety of treatments to manage moderate to severe neuropathic pain, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, anti- seizure medications, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and others, many patients are still inadequately treated. The poor success with the currently approved agents has been attributed to both inadequate efficacy and dose limiting toxicity. This unmet clinical need has generated numerous efforts to identify novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of neuropathic pain, but most of these efforts have focused on identifying additional members of drug classes that have previously shown to have some efficacy in this area. Not surprisingly, many of these agents offer little improvement over what is already in use. By means of our proprietary technology, Aestus Therapeutics has identified new classes of substances that may prove effective in treating neuropathic pain by means of novel mechanisms. This approach is particularly promising for targeting the high percentage of patients who are refractory to established therapies. While there are many causes of neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a particularly useful model for investigating novel analgesic agents. PHN is commonly defined as persistence of the pain associated with herpes zoster for more than three months after resolution of the herpes zoster rash. In the United States more than one million new cases of herpes zoster are reported each year. The pain associated with PHN is typically moderately severe and poorly responsive to established therapies. The focus of our proposal is to conduct a clinical phase 2a proof of principle study to determine whether one of the identified products is likely to be effective at improving PHN pain when administered over a seven day period. A positive outcome of the study will enable us to commercialize the product by partnering with a large pharmaceutical company for late stage clinical studies, filing New Drug Application at FDA and market the product to the benefit of patients and society.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Neuropathic pain patients tend to become globally disabled and are heavy users of healthcare resources. Current therapies have limited efficacy and issues with side effects. By means of our proprietary technology a new class of compounds has been identified that may prove effective in treating neuropathic pain by means of novel mechanisms. This approach is particularly promising for targeting the high percentage of patients who are refractory to established therapies.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 700,000 surgical hernia repairs are performed each year in the United States and despite recent advances, a significant rate of recurrence persists. The incorporation of biocompatible mesh to strengthen the abdominal fascia has largely replaced high-tension suturing techniques in hernia repair. Currently, the preferred biomaterials include durable synthetic mesh, which bears all the pitfalls of a permanent foreign body; or other collagen-based meshes, which are bioabsorbable but fail at an unacceptably high rate causing recurrent hernias. Surgeons are therefore left to choose either a foreign body or a weak repair. Our goal is to apply our site-specific delivery technology toward the improvement of current biomaterials, shortening the critical period between initial repair, and endogenous wound healing. Using phage display technology, we have isolated peptide sequences which selectively bind PDGF-BB and TGF- 3 and collagen-based surgical repair materials with sub-micromolar relative affinity as synthetic peptides. During our Phase I research program, we have linked these peptides to generate a bifunctional molecule, capable of localized retention of biologically active doses of growth factor on the surface of collagen-based mesh materials. The technology presented here provides a unique means of sustaining the retention and delivery of growth factors to a surgical site, without altering the structural composition of collagen-based resorbable hernia repair mesh. The proposed Phase II research plan will continue the commercialization of our leading PDGF-BB:collagen peptide as a coating for collagen-based repair mesh. The TGF- 3:collagen peptide will be put through a similar battery of tests and optimization efforts during a follow-up product development plan. First, we will employ our extensive experience in peptide chemistry and sequence optimization to devise an efficient pilot-scale peptide synthesis strategy capable of generating gt 500 mg of peptide per batch. In parallel with these synthesis efforts, testing will begin on Affinergy's PDGF:collagen binding peptide using autologously harvested sources of growth factor, such as platelet rich plasma. Success in these efforts would remove any future need for a partner with proprietary rights to a recombinant growth factor. The PDGF-BB:collagen and peptide will then be subjected to the battery of biocompatibility testing required for regulatory approval. Peptide will also be examined for stability and function after simulated long-term storage and after exposure widely-used sterilization technique(s). Finally, a rodent model for soft tissue healing after mesh implantation will be used to establish both pharmacokinetics and wound healing rates using peptide-delivered PDGF-BB on collagen repair mesh. These data will provide the first evidence for in vivo efficacy of our peptide, and will be essential for regulatory submissions and partnership development. We feel that the proposed Phase II research plan accelerates the entrance of this product to market, refreshes our product pipeline and extends our core capabilities into critical areas for our continued growth as an innovative medical technology company.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving the rate of healing after surgical hernia repair would reduce pain, discomfort and follow-up care. The introduction of biologics into soft tissue healing represents a potential improvement, but due to a lack of clinically viable delivery mechanisms, these molecules remain under-utilized. This proposal aims to further the commercialization of a novel peptide linkage system for the local retention of growth factors on a collagen-based surgical repair mesh. We believe that this primary product concept has the potential to enhance healing after surgical hernia repair by adding growth factors to collagen meshes without altering their desireable properties. However, we also seek to extend our technology to the use of autologous growth factors from platelet rich plasma, to provide partnership flexibility, and accelerate our route to market. Because hernia repair is one of the most common surgical procedures world-wide, this product will provide substantially improved clinical outcomes. .",

To achieve field portability and sensitive screening for identification of toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) a handheld device that is biologically-based and easy to use with components that remain viable for 6 months would be ideal. In Phase I, Agave BioSystems proposed to develop an accurate and efficient cell-based biosensor using engineered yeast to rapidly evaluate toxicity in drinking water. Phase I results were highly successful in that Agave BioSystems developed a yeast biosensor exploiting yeast strains engineered to report changes in fluorescence upon exposure to chemical stress, resulting in proof-of-concept for this novel biosensor. This methodology utilized Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast measuring differences in GFP expression to ensure TIC detection accuracy establishing proof-of-concept for rapid detection of a range of toxicants between MEG and HLC. Additionally, this novel yeast strain can be lyophilized for long term storage and is expected to be responsive to several classes of TICs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High Performance Detectors for SPECT P.I.: Dr. Michael R. Squillante Abstract Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a powerful, noninvasive medical imaging modality that mathematically reconstructs the three dimensional distribution of a radionuclide throughout the body of a human patient or a research animal. Typically, the collected data are displayed and evaluated as a set of two-dimensional images through the organ or diseased area under investigation. SPECT allows quantitative study of the function in the investigated region and therefore is an extremely useful tool for understanding organ and tissue physiology including that in the heart. SPECT is very commonly used in identifying as well as localizing coronary artery disease and as many as 90% of all myocardial perfusion studies are now performed using SPECT. Thus, SPECT is playing a critical role in cardiac imaging, providing both diagnosis as well as prognosis. However, there is urgent need for improvement in the instrumentation that is currently used for this imaging modality and expand its capabilities in order to exploit its full potential. At present, the performance of SPECT systems often is limited by the detectors used in these systems. Modern SPECT systems consist of scintillation crystals coupled to photomultiplier tubes as detectors. Important requirements for scintillators used in SPECT applications include high light output and high energy resolution, reasonably fast response and high gamma ray stopping efficiency. Ideally, the scintillator should also be inexpensive, rugged and easy to manufacture. Currently, NaI(Tl) is the detector of choice in SPECT systems and it is relatively inexpensive and its light output is fairly large. However, the poor energy resolution of NaI(Tl) often limits SPECT performance. The energy resolution of NaI:Tl is limited by its relatively poor proportionality. If scintillators with higher energy resolution at typical SPECT energies (~140 keV) were available, the essential process of scatter rejection would improve. The goal of the proposed effort is to investigate new high resolution detectors for SPECT studies. Enhanced scatter rejection can be expected from the new detectors, which are also expected to be relatively easy to produce. The Phase I project will be aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed concept, while the Phase II project will be aimed at optimization of the new detectors, implementation of the prototype modules and detailed performance evaluation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: High Performance Detectors for SPECT P.I.: Dr. Michael R. Squillante Project Narrative - The proposed research will investigate a promising detector technology which should have a major impact in health care, in particular, in the development of detectors for in-vivo imaging. Other areas to which this research could be of benefit are: physics research, materials studies, homeland defense, and non-destructive testing.",

        "abstract": "Recent significant improvements in synchrotron radiation sources have enabled the growth of powerful techniques such as time-resolved X-ray diffraction studies for use in understanding dynamic phenomena in materials, including those in biological systems.  To make the most effective use of synchrotron sources for protein and other such studies, however, new, efficient, high-throughput detectors are needed that will enhance the quality of the molecular model that is the end product of the macromolecular crystallography process.  Novel detectors based on new designs of charge coupled devices (CCDs) have been developed, but the performance of these powerful devices is significantly limited by all current X-ray-to-light converters that provide low light, low X-ray absorption, and a tradeoff between spatial resolution and efficiency.  To address these issues, we are developing a novel semiconductor quantum dot scintillator that promises to provide bright emissions, high X-ray absorption, and fast decay with no afterglow, emission in the wavelength range most suitable for CCD-type devices, and orders-of-magnitude higher radiation resistance compared to current scintillators.  This scintillator will be fabricated in a thin film form, which, in addition to its excellent scintillation properties, will provide very high spatial resolution. When combined with a suitable readout, this scintillator will enable realization of a cost-effective high frame rate, large area, high resolution detector needed for many important time-resolved X-ray diffraction and other studies.  The Phase I research accomplished, and in many respects exceeded, all stated goals, and as such successfully demonstrated the feasibility of developing novel scintillators based on quantum dot nanoparticles. Through our inventions of new technologies to synthesize quantum dots and incorporate them in suitable polymer matrices, our Phase I research succeeded in demonstrating the first ever X-ray imaging by means of quantum dot scintillators using both X-ray generators at RMD synchrotron sources.  Highly encouraging Phase I results led us and our collaborators, to develop a comprehensive research plan for the Phase II and subsequent commercialization of the technology. Our Phase II research will focus on modifying quantum dot structural and morphological properties to further enhance X-ray absorption efficiency, decay times, and emission efficiency, and amplify Stokes shift to minimize re-absorption.  Complementary developments in the medium in which quantum dots will be suspended will also be undertaken, with a goal of creating meta-particle structures for improved charge transport, and hence emission efficiency, and enhanced X-ray absorption. These parallel approaches will lead to the desired scintillator film fabrication and to experimental evaluations at Argonne National Laboratory and to substantial efforts toward commercialization of this technology.  Commercial applications and other benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology proposed here is of critical importance in many important synchrotron-based applications, including time-resolved macromolecular crystallography and polymer research and other applications ranging from medical imaging to nondestructive testing.  Due to its potential applications in homeland security and advanced biotechnology, National Security Technologies, LLC has become highly enthusiastic of the proposed research",

        "abstract": "Advanced photon sources, capable of providing extremely high X-ray intensities, have proven to be outstanding resources for X-ray scattering and time-resolved diffraction studies of materials such as organic semiconductors used in electronics, photodiode, and photovoltaic applications, and biological materials such as non-crystalline biological systems.  The problem, however, is in finding a detector that can acquire multiple frames of detailed structural information on the required millisecond time scale with high spatial resolution and high sensitivity, over a large area. Recent detector designs address some of these requirements, but even though none satisfies all of them, they are still prohibitively expensive.  Development of new and cost-effective detectors that can simultaneously address all of these demanding needs is the key to fully exploiting these outstanding new X-ray sources.  To address these limitations we propose to develop a novel X-ray imaging detector that can simultaneously provide millisecond time resolution, high spatial resolution, large imaging area, sensitivity to detect individual low-energy X-rays above noise, and wide dynamic range, all at a very low cost compared to current detector systems.  Our approach takes advantage of revolutionary new developments in low-cost readouts, and counterbalances their limitations using novel system components such as an advanced new scintillator from RMD.  The Phase I research accomplished, and in many respects exceeded, all stated goals, and as such successfully demonstrated the feasibility of developing a low-cost, high-performance detector for materials studies and other synchrotron applications.  We have developed technologies to fabricate the new scintillator with the desired properties, and have combined this sensor with a high-speed readout to form a prototype detector.  The detector thus produced has been thoroughly evaluated in our laboratory as well as at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory to demonstrate its sensitivity, resolution, and speed of operation. The Phase II project will build on the Phase I research and will seek to develop and deliver a fully functional large-area detector for advanced materials studies to be performed at the NSLS and the APS synchrotron beamlines.  Efforts for commercialization of the technology will also be undertaken during the proposed research.  Commercial applications and other benefits:  Beside its exceptional value in critical time-resolved X-ray diffraction and scattering studies of biological systems, this detector will find widespread use in many areas of medical imaging, high speed computed tomography, non-destructive testing, and basic physics research.  Due to its high performance, compact nature and very low cost, the proposed detector will be ideally suited for homeland security applications ranging from baggage scanning to detection of biological agents without contaminating the detector system.",

        "abstract": "The ideal biological imaging system would provide non-invasive, high-resolution, high-sensitivity, three-dimensional (3D) images of living systems.  Positron Emission Tomography (PET) offers high sensitivity to a range of biological processes through the use of targeted radiolabeled probes.  Unfortunately, precise signal localization can be extremely difficult due to low spatial resolution and the lack of anatomical information.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can provide high spatial resolution and excellent soft tissue contrast, but suffers from poor signal strength leading to low sensitivity.  Thus, these single modalities do not satisfy all requirements of imaging studies.  The overall goal of the proposed effort is to combine the best features of PET and MR modalities for small animal studies into a single imaging instrument that will record data in both imaging modalities near simultaneously.  The most immediate benefit of the melded system will be to provide high-resolution anatomical context for microPET studies.  The Phase I project was aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed imaging system.  Specifically, we designed and build PET detector modules that can be operated inside a small animal MR scanner.  Effect of both PET and MR detectors on each other were analyzed and based on the results, the feasibility of Phase I was adequately demonstrated.  The Phase II project will be aimed at design, construction and evaluation of a high performance PET insert for conducting simultaneous PET-MR imaging of small animals.  Optimization of the photodetection technology; construction of high performance PET modules and eventually, a single ring scanner; and detailed characterization of performance will be carried out in Phase II.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The  hallmark  of atherosclerosis is the accumulation of cholesterol in arteries, resulting in plaque which can lead to a heart attack (myocardial infarction (MI)). The excess cholesterol causes inflammation, promotes plaque instability, and in later stages, narrows the vessel lumen to obstruct blood flow. Normally, cholesterol is removed from arteries and delivered to the liver for excretion into bile by a multistep process known as  Reverse Cholesterol Transport  (RCT). In the first step of RCT, small high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles called  pre-beta  HDL acquire cholesterol from artery walls. In the second step, the plasma enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) increases the amount of cholesterol carried in HDL by the esterification of cholesterol to cholesteryl ester. The recent observation that individuals with heart disease have high pre-beta HDL levels and reduced LCAT activity suggests that LCAT is a critical and perhaps rate-limiting component of RCT. Moreover, enhancement of LCAT in animal models by gene transfer, or more recently by the injection of recombinant LCAT, is known to increase HDL-C, enhance RCT and reduce atherosclerosis. Therefore, it is reasonable that increasing the amount of LCAT in patients who have suffered an MI will rapidly stimulate RCT, stabilize the plaque, and consequently, reduce the likelihood of another adverse clinical event. The long-term commercial objective of AlphaCore Pharma is to gain FDA approval for recombinant human LCAT (rhLCAT) as a therapy for reducing the risk of a repeat (secondary) MI in post-MI patients. Phase I of this project was highly successful. SBIR funding was used for bench-scale production of active rhLCAT and to conduct initial proof-of-concept studies in mice. A single injection of rhLCAT in three relevant mouse models increased HDL cholesterol (principally LCAT-derived cholesteryl esters) and size. Moreover, HDL-C remained elevated for more than 48 hours, which increases the possibility that once-weekly dosing may be achievable in humans. The response to rhLCAT was similar whether the injection route was intravascular, intramuscular or subcutaneous, which suggests different dosing options may be possible in humans, including self- administration. Multiple injections of rhLCAT over several days produced even greater increases in HDL-C, and resulted in enhanced expression of liver genes involved in bile acid production, suggesting enhanced delivery of cholesterol to the liver. The Phase II specific aims are 1) to demonstrate enhancement of macrophage specific RCT after rhLCAT injection, 2) to determine if rhLCAT will induce rapid changes in atherosclerotic lesions in rabbits, 3) to conduct a toxicology study in non-human primates to obtain the data for an Investigational New Drug submission; 4) to demonstrate that rhLCAT becomes associated with HDL after injection and is functional. Achievement of these specific aims will enable application to the FDA for approval to test rhLCAT safety and efficacy in humans. The ultimate goal is to make rhLCAT a unique and effective therapy for reducing the unacceptable number of recurrent cardiovascular events in post-infarct patients.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease, the most prevalent manifestation of atherosclerosis, remains the single largest killer of American men and women. AlphaCore Pharma proposes that the injection of the enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase will result in the rapid mobilization of vessel and peripheral cholesterol to HDL, and consequent stabilization of the arteries, reducing the risk of repeated events in patients who have suffered at least one heart attack.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New Reagents for Synthesis of High Potency siRNAs Abstract Since the discovery of short interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules in the late 1990s, siRNA technology has developed rapidly as a powerful tool for functional genomic analysis, target validation and therapeutic purposes. However, the potency and persistence of unmodified siRNAs is dramatically limited by their sensitivity to nuclease degradation. Developing chemically modified siRNA duplexes with higher potency and improved nuclease resistance is essential, especially for therapeutics applications in vivo. In Phase I of this project, we demonstrated proof of principle for a new approach using phosphorodithioate siRNAs (PS2- siRNAs), prepared using novel ribonucleoside thiophosphoramidite reagents (R-thioamidites). We successfully synthesized the four ribonucleoside thiophosphoramidites (A, C, G, and U) at small scale and used them to synthesize a variety of PS2-siRNAs. Importantly, we showed that PS2-siRNAs had increased gene silencing activity against multiple different gene targets in cultured cells. These results demonstrate that PS2-siRNAs have the potential to greatly improve siRNA-based research and drug development. To achieve that potential, Phase II of this project will achieve the following aims: (1) increase the scale of R-thioamidite production; (2) optimize protocols for solid-phase synthesis of PS2-siRNA for in vitro and in vivo applications; (3) synthesize and screen several PS2-siRNA libraries to identify design rules that maximize the gene silencing activity of PS2-siRNAs; (4) demonstrate increased potency and antitumor efficacy of unformulated PS2-siRNAs in a murine model of metastatic colorectal cancer; (5) develop formulated PS2-siRNAs that provide increased potency and antitumor efficacy in a murine model of metastatic ovarian cancer. Successful completion of this project will demonstrate the value of PS2-siRNAs in vivo, and enable AM and its commercial partners to proceed with full commercialization of the R-thioamidite reagents and contribute toward the realization of effective siRNA-based therapeutics.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New Reagents for Synthesis of High Potency siRNAs Narrative The possible therapeutic applications of small interfering RNA (siRNA) are broad and far reaching for many diseases. However, chemically unmodified siRNA molecules are rapidly degraded by nucleases, and often have inadequate potency, especially in animals. The need to develop nuclease resistant siRNAs with improved activity in vivo is critical to the development of novel siRNA-based therapies, as well as for many research applications of siRNA. AM is developing a novel type of chemically-modified siRNA that is expected to significantly improve siRNA potency and stability, which may lead to improved treatments for multiple human diseases.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S and Western world. Despite  increased screening and advances in treatment, the mortality rate (~50,000/year) and high national health-care  burden for CRC is likely to remain high unless more effective methods are developed to predict recurrence and  response to chemo-radiation therapy. For example, the five-year survival rate of CRC is 90% for the over 70%  of patients who do not recur (even without therapy). However, this rate for non-local metastasized CRC  (mCRC) drops to only 10%. CRC treatment and the patient outcome could be significantly improved if it could  be focused on only those patients who need and are most likely to benefit from the therapy. For this reason  the NCI has made as a critical goal the  Discovery of new indicators of prognosis and the likelihood of  response to chemotherapy and radiation  (Recommendations of the NCI Colorectal Cancer Progress Review  Group (PRG), 2000).  As a result of the Phase II, AmberGen has developed a promising CRC tumor assay based on multi-gene  expression profiling, termed the Praxis-CRCTM. This assay is designed to accurately predict the likelihood of  CRC recurrence and response to therapies used to treat post-surgical CRC patients including major  chemotherapies and external beam radiotherapy. The initial assay developed and evaluated in Phase II  requires only 4 genes to predict recurrence (mCRC) with over 95% accuracy and 4 genes to predict response  to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) therapy with over 91% accuracy as described in the proposal. This compares favorably  to commercial assays developed for breast cancer such as OncoDxTM (Genomic Health) which utilize a panel  of over 25 genes with much less accuracy. Novel steps in the development of the Praxis-CRCTM signature  include: i) Acquisition of high-quality fresh-frozen CRC tumor samples with known clinical outcome data going  back 5 years, ii) Measurement and analysis of low-noise gene expression microarray data, iii) Generation of  priority gene list by Meta-Analysis, iv) Validation of the priority gene list by RT-PCR on FFPE samples with  known outcome for over 5 years, v) Development of the final assay on an industry standard 384-well RTPCR  platform.  This Phase II Bridge project is aimed at accelerating the commercialization of Praxis-CRCTM. This will involve  further refinement and evaluation of signatures to predict outcome of common therapies such as folfox, folfiri  and external radiation using 300 well-documented clinical FFPE tumor samples. The project involves a  partnership between AmberGen and a global leader in biomedical assay products with over  1.7 billion in  revenue in 2008 and a total of 9,000 employees. As a result of the success of the Phase II project and the  opportunity to receive SBIR Phase II Bridge funding, this company will provide at least  6M in funds for the  additional costs of commercialization including a large-scale multi-institution validation study, FDA regulatory  approval and world-wide marketing of PRAXIS-CRCTM.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The overall objective for this project is to develop and implement a comprehensive set of technologies to improve screening and diagnosis of conditions associated with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). FXS is caused by an expansion of a cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) triplet repeat in the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. FXS affects 1/4000 men and 1/6000 women. Full expansion to greater than 200 repeats is associated with hypermethylation of the FMR1 gene and complete loss of FMR1 protein production. A more modest expansion of the CGG repeats is associated with Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FX-TAS) in older men and primary ovarian insufficiency (FX-POI) in women. Recently published guidelines suggest follow- up chromosome and Fragile X testing for a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which impacts 1/150 individuals-roughly 33 times the population incidence of Fragile X. Furthermore, promising drugs are currently in clinical trials and will require accurate and early identification of Fragile X patients. Improvements in testing for Fragile X will have important implications for a broad range of individuals of all ages across multiple mental and health conditions associated with this disorder.  Our phase I grant was focused on developing amplification technologies that can enable rapid, high throughput and sensitive detection of CGG repeat numbers, and methylation associated with FXS. Furthermore, these technologies would be able to address confounding zygosity in females, a feature that is not available on commercial PCR based FXS tests. All of the major milestones of phase I have been met and exceeded. We have developed three PCR technologies, some of them with overlapping functionality that can address all major issues associated with FXS testing. These technologies show promise for completely replacing the need for reflex testing with Southern blots, which are cumbersome and slow. In the phase II portion of this grant we propose studies to integrate the PCR technologies into comprehensive and streamlined test. This includes the development of a complete set of controls, quality control procedures and a computer interface for data analysis and storage. The comprehensive test workflows will be evaluated in archived clinical specimens. This phase II grant will result in a comprehensive diagnostic workflow that can support routine testing and screening, and thus enable earlier interventions and improved treatment options for patients.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The long-term goal for this project is to improve screening and diagnosis of Fragile X Syndrome and related conditions. In this project, we will leverage our breakthrough in PCR of the FMR1 gene to develop a set of robust and accurate tests that are cost-effective and efficient. This will enable widespread screening to identify carriers and permit earlier diagnosis and intervention for Fragile X Syndrome patients.",

        "abstract": "The designs of many existing nuclear power reactors incorporate a digital rod position indication system to monitor the positions of the control and shutdown rods within the reactor.  These digital rod position indication systems have been in service for over 30 years in nuclear power stations worldwide.  In recent years, however, aging and obsolescence issues have led to an increase in problems with the digital rod position indication systems including analog card failures and coil cable connection problems that, in some cases, may result in unplanned reactor trips.  These problems, along with plans for plant life extension, have prompted the nuclear industry to actively seek viable options to monitor the health and accuracy of these digital rod position indication systems in order to ensure reliable plant operations for decades to come.  The existing plants will be facing the end of qualified life for several components of the existing digital rod position indication systems during the next decade and are actively seeking replacement options at this time.  As such, the objective of this project is to conduct a research and development effort to design, implement and demonstrate an advanced digital rod position indication diagnostic system for existing and new nuclear power reactors.  In the Phase I project, the proposing firm demonstrated the feasibility of developing a digital rod position indication monitoring system from commercial parts that not only monitors for system diagnostics, but also provides additional capabilities such as higher resolution rod position indication than is currently available as well as automatic rod drop times.  The approach in Phase II is to build on the success of Phase I to construct a prototype digital rod position indication diagnostic system and implement it in an existing nuclear power reactor.  The prototype digital rod position indication diagnostic system constructed in the Phase II project will be used as the basis for the design of a digital rod position indication diagnostic system for next generation reactors.  Commercial applications and benefits:  As plants focus on replacing obsolete digital rod position indication system components, this proposal offers a commercial system that will also provide enhanced diagnostic capabilities if carried into Phase II and commercialized in Phase III.",

        "abstract": "Over the last decade, on-line monitoring (OLM) technologies have become prevalent in most industrial processes including nuclear power plants for equipment and process condition monitoring, predictive maintenance, aging management, and life extension. However, research reactors have not benefited from all that OLM can offer for their immediate and long term maintenance needs. Classically, these facilites have verified the performance of their systems using conventional, hands-on procedures. OLM technologies will help automate and optimize this process and thereby contribute to the accuracy of process measurements, provide for trending of the I&C performance, reduce manpower, and minimize the potential for human errors during equipment maintenance activities. This proposal focuses specifically on performance monitoring of Instrumentation and Control (I&C) systems and to a lesser extent improved predictive maintenance of rotating equipment using remote data acquisition of existing process and test sensors while the plant is operating  hence the word on-line). In Phase I, the feasibility of implementing a variety of OLM technologies for I&C systems and rotating equipment in research reactors was established through a hands-on R&D effort using the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) as the test bed.   The goal of this project is to establish OLM technologies for predictive maintenance of I&C systems and rotating equipment of research reactors using ATR as the test bed. This goal will be achieved through a practical and hands-on research project which will cover the following objectives: 1. Determine to what extent the existing data from the ATR plant computer can be used for OLM  2. Establish data qualification and data analysis algorithms and software packages 3. Validate OLM results through comparison with conventional techniques 4. Incorporate OLM for more frequent monitoring of rotating equipment of ATR 5. Establish a trending program for I&C systems of ATR 6. Develop a prototype OLM system for research reactors and demonstrate it at ATR 7. Design commercial OLM prototype system to be marketed to research reactors   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The product of this work has immediate application in the worldwide fleet of research reactors. Worldwide, there are 245 operational reactors with 14 either planned or under construction. Many of these reactors produce critical medical and industrial isotopes. Additionally, some of the materials and fuels research that is performed at these facilities cannot be performed anywhere else in the world. A majority of these reactors have been in service for 30+ years and are in need of improved maintenance capabilities such as those proposed for development herein to help assure their continued reliable operation and service to the nation. Example direct benefits to the facilities include reduced labor hours, reduction of radiation dose to maintenance personnel, improved accuracy of process measurements, etc. Certain aspects of this research will also enhance the state-of-the-art in OLM for nuclear power plants serving those facilities as well.",

        "abstract": "In the U.S., almost all 104 operating commercial nuclear power plants have applied for or plan to apply for, or have already received license renewal to allow operation for up to 60 years. As the plants age, safe operation becomes increasingly important and more frequent monitoring of the health of plant equipment becomes vital. This was recognized by the leaders in the industry over twenty years ago when studies of equipment aging and development of ways to handle aging began. Today, electrical cable aging and its impact on plant safety and operation is a worldwide concern for nuclear power plants. Loss of a cable because of a cable fault or problem can impact the operation and function of important plant safety equipment and/or the loss of performance and operational data. Knowing the aging condition of critical plant wiring and in particular aging that could result in degraded performance of a cable circuit is extremely important to the availability and safe operation of the plant. Current techniques provide problem identification and fault location capability but further advancements in the available techniques and development of new ones are needed before they can be relied upon for effective and consistent cable aging assessment. During the proposed project, AMS will investigate the state-of-the-art in cable aging evaluation techniques applicable to nuclear power plant wiring systems, and investigate their effectiveness for identifying aging mechanisms in cable circuits through objective laboratory experiments. Measurements will be correlated against classical tests to build a database of aging relationships that will simplify analysis. The result of the Phase II project will be a holistic cable aging assessment program that will provide comprehensive cable testing capabilities, analysis tools, training and technical services, and turn-key plant implementation for assessing the aging of plant wiring systems.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Successful commercialization of this product will result in an easily implemented, operational cable aging assessment and management system using the state-of-the-art in cable condition monitoring techniques that will provide correlated aging evaluations of plant cable and wiring. Applications will include tests to evaluate cable problems, insulation aging, and gross or localized cable and connector problems as well as an assessment of the aging condition of the cable. The system will have immediate application in nuclear power plants as well as other commercial or industrial facilities interested in effectively assessing and managing cable aging assets.",

        "abstract": "For mission critical data storage on systems operating in natural space and nuclear weapons environments, the use of radiation hardened (RH) non-volatile memory (NVM) is imperative.  Today's complex computer controlled electronic systems use NVM to store critical data for proper operation.  This typically includes configuration parameters which allow the system to return to a known configuration after the loss of power.  If the critical data becomes corrupted, system recovery and operation is severely impacted. Current state of the art technologies being evaluated for RH NVM include Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) (1Mb), Ferroelectric Random Access Memory (FeRAM), chalcogenide-based Phase-change Random Access Memory (PRAM) (1Mb), and silicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon (SONOS) (4Mb) based devices.  Of these, the only qualified RH NVM technology commercially available today is the SONOS based memory.  Development of higher bit-density SONOS memories is necessary to meet increasing system demands for critical data storage. During this effort, we will design a 128Mb RH NVM using the advanced NVM architecture and materials identified in Phase I.  Relevant test structures will be fabricated in an advanced RH CMOS process to demonstrate functionality of key elements of the NVM design.  Operational parameters of these structures will be characterized, including read/write times, retention, endurance, etc.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has become the mainstay for treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Whereas early recanalization undoubtedly salvages myocardial tissue, reperfusion following prolonged ischemia can also exacerbate injury. Infarct size needs to be limited, and the conditions favoring adaptive ventricular healing and remodeling optimized because in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who do not die of out-of-hospital arrhythmias, long-term prognosis is dependent on the amount of myocardium that is lost, and the outcome of ventricular remodeling. Scatter factor / hepatocyte growth factor (SF/HGF) is an endogenous cell survival factor that exerts both acute and chronic cardioprotective effects and can potentially be harnessed for salvaging the ischemic myocardium. The feasibility of SF/HGF as gene or protein therapy however is limited by issues relating to immune and inflammatory responses evoked by adenoviral proteins, inherent instability of proteins in solution, their limited tissue half-life and the exorbitant costs associated with such therapy. Supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) and Rapid Access to Interventional Development (RAID) programs, we have identified and developed BB3, a novel small molecule SF/HGF mimetic. BB3 duplicates the bioactivities of the native protein in every assay tested to date. In single cardiocyte models simulating ischemia-reperfusion injury, BB3 attenuates apoptotic and necrotic death. In the isolated perfused heart, BB3 improves postischemic function and in in vivo experimental normothermic myocardial ischemia- reperfusion, systemic BB3 administration attenuates infarct size when administered 24 hours following onset of reperfusion. Of significant clinical interest is our finding that delayed BB3 administration also attenuates post-infarct ventricular dysfunction in both rat and pig. Furthermore, delayed BB3 administration confers functional and infarct-sparing benefit in renal, hepatic and cerebral models of ischemic and/or traumatic injury, preventing transition of these organs to failure. Supported by the SBIR program, a comprehensive panel of preclinical regulatory studies comprising genotoxicology, in vivo toxicology and safety pharmacology studies for BB3 has been completed. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for BB3 and a Phase I, Randomized, Single-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Single Dose, Dose- Escalating Study of BB3 Injected Intravenously in Healthy Subjects has been completed; no serious adverse events have been reported. The overall objective of this program is to evaluate clinical efficacy of BB3 in patients presenting with acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (A-STEMI) who undergo successful percutaneous reperfusion.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A small molecule organ protective agent has significant clinical potential in treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have developed an effective bacterial cancer therapy strategy by targeting viable tumor tissue by using Salmonella typhimurium auxotrophs that we have generated which grow in viable as well as necrotic areas of tumors. However, the auxotrophy severely restricts growth of these bacteria in normal tissue enabling them to be used for cancer treatment. The S. typhimurium A1-R mutant, which is auxotrophic for leu-arg and has high antitumor virulence was developed in our laboratory. In vitro, A1-R infects tumor cells and causes nuclear destruction. A1-R was initially used to treat metastatic human prostate and breast tumors that had been orthotopically implanted in nude mice. Forty percent of treated mice were cured completely and survived as long as non-tumor-bearing mice. A1-R administered i.v. to the nude mice with primary osteosarcoma and lung metastasis was highly effective, especially against metastasis. A1-R was also targeted to both axillary lymph and popliteal lymph node metastasis of human pancreatic cancer and fibrosarcoma, respectively, as well as lung metastasis of the fibrosarcoma in nude mice. The bacteria were delivered via a lymphatic channel to target the lymph-node metastases and systemically via the tail vein to target the lung metastasis. The metastases were cured without the need of chemotherapy or any other treatment. A1-R was administered intratumorally to nude mice with an orthotopically-transplanted human pancreatic tumor. The primary pancreatic cancer regressed without additional chemotherapy or any other treatment. A1-R also was effective against pancreatic cancer liver metastasis when administered intrasplenically to nude mice. A1-R has also shown to be effective for spinal glioma in orthotopic mouse models. The approach described here, where bacterial monotherapy effectively treats primary and metastatic tumors, is a significant improvement over previous bacterial tumor-therapy strategies that require combination with toxic chemotherapy. The present application will develop bacterial therapy of cancer with S. typhimurium A1-R in immunocompetent mice as a bridge to the clinic. The specific aims of the present application are (1) Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of S. typhimurium A1-R in tumor-bearing C57 immunocompetent mice. (2) Determine the optimal dose, route and schedule of S. typhimurium A1-R in tumor-bearing immunocompetent mice. Exploitation of the tumor-killing capability of Salmonella has great potential for a new paradigm of cancer therapy.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have developed a bacterial cancer therapy strategy using Salmonella typhimurium variants. These bacteria kill cancer cells but do not grow in normal tissue. Our S. typhimurium A1-R mutant has antitumor virulence against a number of cancer cell lines in nude mouse models. In vitro, A1-R infects tumor cells and can cause rapid nuclear fragmentation and apoptosis. A1-R was found to be effective against metastatic human prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancer cell lines as well as osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma and glioma cell lines in clinically-relevant mouse models. Treated mice were often cured completely and survived as long as non- tumor-bearing mice. The approach described here, where bacterial monotherapy effectively treats primary and metastatic tumors, is a significant improvement over previous bacterial tumor-therapy strategies that require combination with toxic chemotherapy. The present application will develop bacterial therapy of cancer in immunocompetent mouse models as a bridge to clinical trials.

        "abstract": "With the increasing volatility of petroleum and natural gas resources, small coal-fired boilers have become increasingly more attractive for steam and power generation in several industries. This switch to small-scale, coal-fired plants is expected to continue, and increases the need for clean coal utilization technology. The U.S. Energy Policy Act includes support for a clean coal technology initiative focusing on the environmental challenges of using coal. While initial efforts focused on addressing acid rain, more recent efforts focus on addressing the potential health risks of particulate matter (PM).\nA key technology for removing PM from flue gases generated by coal-fired power plants is the electrostatic precipitator (ESP). ESPs operate with an efficiency of 90 to 99 percent for the removal of mercury and fly ash from the flue gas stream. ESPs work by applying an electric voltage to an electrode, which in turn applies a charge to the PM entrained in the gas flow; the charged PM then is collected on a large plate with the opposite voltage. The collection surface and electrodes are made from metal, are extremely heavy with a high installed cost, are easily corroded, and have a limited service life unless very expensive alloys are used.\nTo address these issues associated with using metallic ESP components, Applied Sciences, Inc., working closely with Ohio University, investigated the use of inexpensive carbon nanofibers (CNF) to enhance the capture efficiencies of ESPs. The joint effort focused on producing polymeric, composite electrodes enhanced with the addition of CNF. This combination of low-cost materials and processing techniques has led to the production of composite electrodes that generate up to 20 percent more corona current than metal electrodes at the same voltage. The superior performance of the composite electrode increases the capture efficiency and lowers the power requirements of both dry and wet ESPs. These enhancements are attributed to the presence of the CNF, which provides a conductive path to the surface where the corona current is generated. Additionally, each CNF exposed to the surface of the composite acts as a source of charge emission.\nPolymeric-based nanocomposite electrodes are less expensive to produce, easier and cheaper to install, and corrosion resistant. Based on the generous support, technical guidance, and level of interest expressed by Southern Environmental Inc., and feedback from other ESP providers, this technology will advance the state of ESP performance for both large and small units.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to improve the quality of on-demand job matching by applying data mining and machine learning techniques to natural language descriptions of job requests, worker reviews, and transaction history. The project will enable lasting job matches by predicting the needs, preferences and constraints of workers and human resource managers. Currently available methods of job matching rely primarily on keyword search, corporate personality assessment tests, or fixed ontologies. Such systems lack comprehensive learning and therefore have difficulty matching workers with jobs. This project approaches job matching with a bias-free learning model that learns from hiring successes, trains on real-world data, and adapts to new job verticals.\nThe broader/commercial impact of the project is a matching technology that optimizes workers' and employers' strengths, discovering matching opportunities overlooked by traditional search technologies. Online reputation-building through performance reviews can improve workers' ability to market themselves. The global matching technology permits nearly every skill to become marketable by matching workers with all features from every available job request. Natural language processing techniques, developed in the course of this project, have the potential to broaden the appeal of cell phone text-messaging as a comprehensive job-searching tool. Furthermore, the contextual approach to learning about workers and employers enables trends to be identified among  users, and has far-reaching commercial implications in fields as diverse as medical research and e-commerce.",

        "abstract": "The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) will be a key tool for nuclear science that promises to change the way we view and describe the nucleus.  A charge stripper foil is an essential device in a heavy-ion accelerator; they increase the variety of acceleration schemes and decrease the accelerator construction cost. The FRIB facility will require a stripper foil that can sustain a beam power loss of 1 kW.  To handle such a high power load over a small beam size (about 1 mm diameter), the design of the stripper foil includes a need for large area, robust carbon foils.  These foils are typically expensive to make, are fragile and are difficult to make over large area (eventually we may need to scale to 30 cm diameter).  There is a need for a stripper foil in the range of 0.5 mg/cm2 that is low-Z, thermally conductive, mechanically robust, has high uniformity and can be fabricated over large areas at low cost.  In addition, researchers at the ATLAS accelerator at Argonne National Laboratory have a need to replace metal foils as windows for gas targets such as are currently used for in-beam reactions to generate secondary radioactive beams.  The overall goal of this two phase program is to develop robust carbon foils that can be made over large areas at low cost for stripper foil and windows for gas targets.  We will address this problem by using vacuum filtration methods to make carbon foils from graphene and carbon nanotubes.   The Phase I effort demonstrated that graphene foils are feasible materials for ion stripper foil applications. The methods used can be scaled to large area and they show superior uniformity.  We also demonstrated feasibility to use this foils for gas target window application.   The overall technical objective of this Phase II program will be to increase the foil diameter to > 15 cm, demonstrate uniformity over this area and demonstrate mechanical robustness of the foils, even when taken to high temperature.  FRIB will produce key new rare isotopes of atomic nuclei that are essential for our understanding of the universe.  It is the overall consensus of the international nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics communities that the future of the study of atomic nuclei centers on and requires advanced facilities for access to exotic nuclei. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  FRIB will have profound benefits to society; it will play an important role in the 21st Century",

Fouling of heat exchangers is a serious and longstanding problem causing significant energy losses (0.25% of Gross National Product), premature material failures, and increased downtime/maintenance. With increased emphasis on environmental regulatory standards, such as carbon cap, energy-intensive production facilities will be required to improve energy efficiency which will impose harsher conditions for the heat exchangers, exacerbating fouling and related problems.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project conducts research and development of a unique laser technology that simultaneously provides a compact and low-cost alternative to laser guide star and polychromatic laser guide star sources.  Guide star lasers are used in ground based adaptive-optics telescopes to provide high altitude, bright, point sources enabling adaptive near real-time correction for atmospheric aberrations.  Adaptive optics systems rely on a combination of laser and natural guide-stars for tip-tilt correction. This limitation reduces the regions of space that can be explored due to the scarcity of natural guide-stars of adequate brightness. An elegant solution is to use polychromatic laser beacons comprising two closely spaced output wavelengths (569 and 589nm) to produce guide stars emitting, at distinctly disparate wavelengths (330 and 589nm).  In 2008 a National Science Foundation committee of key adaptive optics scientists and decisions makers found astronomy is limited by the current state-of-the-art in lasers and that improving sodium laser beacons is critical to reaching stated astronomy science objectives.  The research conducted under this SBIR project will produce optically pumped semiconductor lasers that can overcome technical limitations presented by more traditional guide star laser alternatives while simultaneously making guide star lasers more affordable.\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will significantly impact the ability of observatories around the world to reach their scientific objectives by making available highly-reliable, low-cost guide star lasers.  Currently, laser guide star systems are too expensive for all but the most well endowed observatories.  Renowned experts and key decision makers in the field estimate the current laser guide star system cost at $100,000 per Watt of output power.  The use of the laser technology to be produced can dramatically reduce the cost while simultaneously reducing the size weight and power required to operate the laser.  In the near future, astronomical observatories will develop and field telescopes with much larger apertures.  These and existing large aperture telescopes require multiple guide star lasers with a higher level of diversity, greater reliability while having lower per unit acquisition and maintenance costs.  Successful development of the proposed product will positively impact astronomy, science and education by freeing up resources otherwise allocated to acquisition of expensive guide star systems.  As a result, smaller observatories requiring a single system and large observatories requiring multiple laser guide stars will be able to execute their capital acquisition plans and achieve their science goals more rapidly.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the important unresolved problems in fungal antimicrobial chemotherapy is the ineffectiveness of existing therapeutics against cells that do no exist in a rapidly-growing, planktonic population. Upon attachment to abiotic surface or tissue, C. albicans produces quiescent, drug-tolerant persister cells. Subsequent development of a biofilm protects the pathogen from the immune system. Non-growing stationary cells are also tolerant to antimicrobials. Candida biofilms are responsible for infections of catheters; our data point to involvement of persister cells in oral thrush; and relapsing vaginitis is likely due to the presence of drug-tolerant cells as well. Our in vitro studies showed that amphotericin B or miconazole applied even at high, topical concentrations are not effective against a mature biofilm of C. albicans and persister cells. The goal of this Phase II project is to develop lead compounds that potentiate conventional antifungals and are capable of eradicating all forms of the pathogen, be it exponentially growing, stationary, biofilm or persister cells.   We reasoned that a compound that can interfere with the formation or maintenance of quiescent forms of infection would synergize with conventional antifungals and produce a sterilizing therapeutic. In Phase I, we developed a screen for compounds that act synergistically with antifungals and successfully identified compounds that eradicated C. albicans biofilms in vitro in the presence of miconazole. The compounds have no activity alone. This is the first observation of effective action against Candida biofilms and persister cells for any anti-fungal agent. One of the compounds, AC17, has good drug-like properties and serves as proof-of principle for developing a combination therapeutic to eradicate fungal infections.   In Phase II, we will introduce a large-scale drug discovery program to identify additional attractive leads for developing potentiators of antifungals. Together with AC17, the hits from the HTS will undergo a detailed in vitro validation, medicinal chemistry optimization, and animal studies.   We plan to target currently untreatable diseases: Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (RVC), refractory Oropharyngeal Candidiasis (OPC) and biofilm infection of central venous catheters with a sterilizing combination therapeutic. Essentially 100% of women experience vaginitis due to Candida at some point in life, and the disease is treatable with azole antifungals in most cases. However, 5-8% of women suffer from relapsing vaginitis that is recalcitrant to currently available therapies. Similarly, mild cases of oropharyngeal  candidiasis are usually cured with antifungal therapy, however the infection is recurrent in  immunocompromised patients with HIV and cancer. C. albicans biofilm infection of central venous catheters is untreatable with currently available antifungals, requiring device removal. If left untreated, catheter biofilm infection can develop into disseminated candidemia with mortality of 38-50%. We intend to salvage biofilm- infected catheters using a lock therapy of miconazole and potentiators.   This is a multidisciplinary project that brings together experts in drug development (Tom Dahl, PI);  antimicrobial resistance and drug discovery (Kim Lewis, NEU); yeast molecular genetics (Carol Kumamoto,  Tufts University); medicinal chemistry (Richard Lee, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital); and animal  models of fungal infections (Paul Fidel, LSU; Mahmoud Ghannoum, Case Western; Saul Tzipori, Tufts).   Obtaining 2 advanced leads with good efficacy in an animal model of disease will be the end-point of this Phase II project.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of this project is to develop an effective therapeutic which will sterilize fungal infection caused by Candida albicans. Currently available therapeutics suppress, but do not sterilize the infection causing relapse and resistance. This project is based on preliminary data that describe a discovery of substances that potentiate existing antifungals and effectively eliminate the pathogen. The end result of the project will be lead therapeutics validated in an animal model of fungal infection.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this project is to develop and optimize our novel particle-based microarray platform, ArrayableESP, for application to high multiplex (50- to 2000-plex) proteomic analysis of human serum samples. ESPs are optically-encoded microfabricated particles that can be manipulated using magnetic force. They are manufactured on commercially available photolithographic equipment using efficient and robust techniques borrowed from the semi-conductor industry. They have significant advantages in cost throughput, scalability, and flexibility over existing bead-based liquid array platforms. We will use aptamers, instead of antibodies, on our platform, which will eliminate the need for sample pre-labeling/pre-processing and allow for a parallel method of homogeneous detection following protein binding. The combination of the ArrayableESP platform with aptamers is expected to increase accuracy of analysis and result in a simplified workflow. Such attributes, in combination with the nearly unlimited multiplex potential offered by the ArrayableESP platform, will provide a multiplex product with significant advantages over currently available technologies for proteomic analysis. ESP technology has broad applicability and should be a valuable tool in the diagnosis, prognosis, and characterization of a variety of disease states, including cancer, heart disease, arthritis and inflammatory diseases, kidney disease, liver disease, allergic responses, and infectious diseases (e.g. HIV).        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Efficient high multiplexed genomic analysis has been achieved by others. Analysis of the proteome is expected to be the next important component of biological analysis for improving human health. Current methods for multiplex proteomic analysis are either unable to perform greater than 30-plex analysis, or at high multiplex require processes that result in inaccurate analysis with inefficient workflows. We are developing a cost-effective technology for low to high multiplex proteomic analysis with significant advantages over current comparable technologies. This technology should be useful in the diagnosis and prognosis of a variety of disease states, including cancer, heart disease, arthritis and inflammatory diseases, kidney disease, and infectious diseases (e.g. HIV).",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a common problem that often results in major limb amputation. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells likely play a role in the pathogenesis of CLI; the number and function of these cells that are mobilized from the bone marrow are reduced in the elderly and diabetics, groups at high risk for CLI. Allogenic Umbilical Cord Blood (UCB) derived CD133+ hemangioblasts demonstrate greater activity for stimulating angiogenesis. However, there are no clinical trials of UCB-derived cell lines for CLI and the number of cells available from a cord sample is limited. The long-term objective is to develop a clinically relevant approach, through nanomaterials engineering, to efficiently expand human allogenic UCB derived CD133+ hemangioblasts and to demonstrate the biologic and therapeutic feasibility to treat CLI. In this proposed study, Specific Aim I will optimize clinical grade nanofiber scaffold ex vivo expansion of UCB derived CD133+ hemangioblasts from fresh and cryopreserved UCBs in a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) based cell culture and production facility. Specific Aim IIa will test survival of the expanded UCB allograft in a Histocompatibility Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-matched, unrelated, non-immunosuppressed recipients. To test this aim 5 women with CLI will undergo implantation of HLA matched, gender mismatched UCB-derived cells subcutaneously with biopsy of the delivery site used to determine cell survival. To identify transplanted cells the specimens will be examined for viable Y-chromosome bearing cells using the Fluorescent in situ hybridization techniques (FISH). Specific Aim IIb will establish the therapeutic potential of the expanded HLA matched UCB allograft as a strategy to improve tissue perfusion in CLI. To test this aim 10 patients with CLI will receive HLA matched, ex vivo expanded, UCB-derived cells injected into the affected limb. This Aim will have 80% power to detect a 10 mmHg improvement in Transcutaneous Oxygen Pressure (TcPO2). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall objective of this project is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of injecting ex vivo expanded allogeneic (from other people) umbilical cord blood-derived stem cells (CD133+ cells) for the treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI). By providing enough blood supply to the ischemic limb, Arteriocyte hopes to observe reduced rest pain, increased exercise capacity, increased skin surface oxygen pressure and improved ulcer healing in the CLI patients.

        "abstract": "Identification and Significance of the Problem or Opportunity: The meat processing infrastructure is declining and aging across the United States leaving small farms with limited poultry, natural pork, and ruminant processing options. Work to rehabilitate existing but aged processing establishments utilizing energy efficiencies and renewable energy design to increase the profitability is needed. Because current processing options are limited, local distribution systems are rare. Research Question: Can a successful local foods distribution model be replicated in a different area of the country with a processing facility as the centerpiece while utilizing renewable technologies to further enhance the marketability of the differentiated farm products while reducing energy operating costs Work Plan Summary: The work plan consists of two main research objectives. 1. Develop a plan for the revitalization of the aging processing infrastructure utilizing renewable energy systems and energy efficiencies to lighten large energy needs in small scale processing. The majority of small processing establishments were built before 1980 and are declining in number at an alarming rate (Henning, 2007). The processing infrastructure creates a bottleneck in the ability to get farm product to the consumer. Without local processing options the small family farm is no longer viable. Erick Smith, Principal Investigator, is uniquely qualified to work on this research. He brings skills as a professional engineer with a focus on electrical construction and sustainable design with an experience of 17 years in the industry married with a desire to provide local meat options and support the small family farm through his years working to create a viable small family farm to hand down to the next generation. He can not only work to create a lasting plan but disseminate the information collected to help other plant owners. Most often, plants would be owned by meat cutters, not engineers. Phase 1 research showed success in that a plan for revitalization was created, now that plan needs to be implemented and the results tested. 2.The processing facility is the center of an expanded distribution network. For this objective we would test the possibility of replicating a local foods distribution system developed in Kansas City by Diana Endicott, named Good Natured Family Farms. Diana Endicott successfully initiated a local foods distribution network in Kansas City supplying farm products from 100 family farms to Ball Foods, a local grocery chain. Instead of repeating her research, we have developed a consulting relationship with her so that we can utilize her expertise and expand upon her SBIR funded research in Indiana. Jessica Smith will serve as the Farm to Market Coordinator as Diana did in Kansas City. Jessica Smith has the education and background needed to represent the alliance and form marketing relationships.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reaching and engaging Hispanic women, given their central role in families, is a critical strategy in efforts to reduce disparities and improve health outcomes for adults and children in these communities. Quality prenatal care is designed to promote health and reduce risks for women, infants, and families before, during, and after pregnancy. Unfortunately, Hispanic women are twice as likely to receive late or no prenatal care as non-Hispanic white women. Currently at 11 million, over the next several decades the number of Hispanic women in their childbearing years is projected to increase exponentially.  The long-term goal of the proposed project is to improve access to quality, linguistically and culturally appropriate prenatal education and care for Hispanic women. The program will be based on the Teach-With- Stories (TWS) Method  developed for empowerment-based group education. The existing De Madre a Madre/From Mother to Mother prenatal care photonovels will be redesigned according to the prototype developed in Phase I to be distributed via the Teach-With-Stories Free Publication Network.  Phase II aims will focus on the development of program components that address implementation factors identified in Phase I to facilitate the adoption, integration, and sustainability of a Teach-With-Stories lay health educator model. The program will be designed to build community capacity to offer and evaluate prenatal education in community-based or clinic-based sites The goal is to increase access for Hispanic women and foster opportunities for partnership with systems of care. In addition, the research team will develop and test study instruments and data collection protocols for a subsequent formal control design study.  The study team will achieve these aims through a collaborative, participatory-based development process coupled with a Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) continuous quality improvement methodology. This will ensure that the products are medically accurate, culturally sensitive, and effective in practice. Hispanic consumers will field-test the photonovels for readability and cultural and linguistic appropriateness. In addition, the complete program will be tested to determine its effectiveness as compared to a control-match group of Hispanic women who receive usual care.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Positive, culturally sensitive experiences in prenatal care can have a long-term impact on the use of healthcare services by Hispanic women and their families. An empowerment-based lay educator model designed to address system and provider needs unique to prenatal care could help generate cost-savings to the health care system, improve quality of care, and address the multiple needs of this growing population. A commercially successful model for prenatal education could be adapted for other health topics and potentially for other traditionally underserved populations.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to minimize morbidity due to non-adherence to outpatient antipsychotic-antimanic therapy with olanzapine. Olanzapine is currently a mainstay of treatment for psychotic disorders and mania. Its elimination half-life of (ca. 30 h in humans) is appropriate for once-daily oral dosing. Most psychotic and manic-depressive disorders require long-term, maintenance treatment, in which reliable and sustained adherence to therapy is a major clinical challenge and limitation to therapeutic effectiveness. Long-term adherence to antipsychotic treatment can be enhanced with long-acting, injectable preparations. The only such agents licensed in the US currently are long-chain fatty acid esters of the older neuroleptics fluphenazine and haloperidol, which carry a high risk of adverse extrapyramidal neurological effects, including tardive dyskinesia, and a sustained release formulation of risperidone incorporated into carbohydrate microspheres which has recently been approved for twice-monthly injection. Based on the clear clinical need and market opportunity, we have developed a formulation of olanzapine, currently one of the most widely clinically employed and versatile antipsychotic-antimanic agents. This preparation promises to support twice-monthly administration of olanzapine. We believe that the development of an injectable sustained release olanzapine is readily achievable and that it will become a useful tool in the outpatient treatment of patients with highly prevalent major mental disorders including schizophrenia and manic-depressive illness, which together affect several percent of the general population at any time. In Phase 1 of this work we have accomplished our stated specific aims. We have formulated an injectable subcutaneous sustained release delivery system using novel particle parameters and coating strategies. This formulation demonstrates release over approximately 2 weeks into buffer in vitro and achieves a significant increase in the plasma half-life in the rat compared to oral. We have demonstrated tissue compatibility for this formulation and have demonstrated a sustained pharmacodynamic effect in the standard rat model. In so doing we have demonstrated both the general feasibility of the approach and our ability as a team to carry out the proposed work.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Schizophrenia and manic depression affect millions of patients in United States. Psychotic episodes often necessitate hospitalization where treatment is instituted and results in diminution of symptoms sufficient to allow discharge. However, once discharged these patients often do not take their medicines which can then re-start the cycle: admission - control - discharge - nonadherence - admission....... Injectable treatment using sustained release formulations has long been a mainstay of therapy for these patients. However there exists only one sustained release formulation (Risperdal Consta(R)) for an atypical antipsychotic: the class of drugs is most effective. We have developed sustained release formulations for the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine. The successful development of products based on these formulations can potentially aid in the treatment of hundreds of thousands of patients. Other groups are working to achieve the same goal using different sustained release technologies. We believe our proprietary drug delivery platform has significant technological advantages which will allow us to succeed where others have failed. The principal investigator has been responsible for two existing release drug delivery products which have been approved through the NDA process by the FDA. This is impossible by licensing at the appropriate stage to corporate partners with resources necessary for such an undertaking. We plan to repeat this strategy in the development of these important treatments for schizophrenia and manic-depressive illness.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Between 10% and 20% of the United State population suffer from seasonal influenza each year. While most individuals recover from influenza in one to two weeks, the very young, the elderly and persons with chronic medical conditions can develop post-flu pneumonia and other lethal complications. The causative agent of influenza is influenza virus, a myxovirus that readily develops new strains through a process of reassortment and mutation of the segmented viral genome. Highly virulent strains of type A influenza virus can produce epidemics and pandemics. In recent years there has been emergence of a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza A virus subtype H5N1. First detected in Thailand, Vietnam and other countries in Southeast Asia, this strain of  bird flu  has now spread too many parts of the world. Some variants are capable of directly infecting humans and other mammals, inflicting a high mortality rate. Human-to human spread of current highly-pathogenic bird flu strains does occur, but not yet at the efficiency necessary to trigger a pandemic in which millions or even tens of millions of people could die. In preliminary studies, we identified a remarkably effective peptide entry inhibitor that blocks infection by different strains of influenza A virus of the H1, H3 and H5 subtypes as well as influenza B viruses (IC50 in the nanomolar to picomolar range depending on assay conditions). This 16mer peptide, Flufirvitide-3, potently inhibited signs of influenza in ferrets, generally considered the best animal model for influenza. Peak titers of influenza virus in ferret nasal washes were reduced by over two logs and in the lungs by over six logs. The scope of work for this Phase I/Phase II Fast Track application includes preclinical IND-enabling activities that can potentially lead to human clinical trials and Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). In Specific Aim 1 (Phase I) optimal manufacturing, formulation, and delivery methods for Flufirvitide-3 will be developed and sufficient product for pharmacokinetic, bioavailability, toxicology and animal studies will be provided. In Specific Aim 2 challenge studies in ferrets using seasonal strains of influenza A and B viruses and highly pathogenic influenza a viruses will be performed to define the optimal formulation and delivery mechanism for Flufirvitide- 3. In Specific Aim 3 non-clinical pharmacokinetic and bioavailability analyses of Flufirvitide-3 will be performed and in Specific Aim 4 evaluation of the non-clinical safety profile of Flufirvitide-3 and related platform therapeutics will be initiated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Because of the threat posed by influenza virus both to public health and as a potential agent of bioterrorism, developing therapeutics to control seasonal influenza and the increasing threat of pandemic influenza is one of this nation's highest priorities. Flufirvitide-3 is a potent inhibitor of infections by influenza virus in vitro and in the ferret model of influenza. We will develop a formulation and delivery regimen of Flufirvitide-3 that has broad-spectrum activity, high bioavailability in the respiratory tract, a simple dosing regimen, and safety in diverse populations for the prophylaxis and early treatment of seasonal and pandemic influenza.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year in the United States, gt1.25 million people suffer from burns, 6.5 million have chronic skin ulcers caused by pressure, venous stasis or diabetes mellitus and 0.25 million have keloids sufficiently severe to require surgery. Burn treatment costs  1.8 billion per year in the US. The treatment of persons with chronic skin ulcers costs  13 billion per year in the US. The annual cost of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and/or neuropathic foot ulcers in the U.S. is   0.8 billion for type I diabetics and  10.1 billion for type II diabetics. Limb-sparing surgical procedures are also widely used. In spite of these large costs for the care and the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, each year 82,000 limb amputations are still performed on US patients with diabetic ulcers because current therapy is not very effective. These surgical treatments cost about   0.3 billion per year in the US. Currently, there is no agent which has been shown to be effective for treating cutaneous wounds. As these costs suggest, there is an urgent need for developing effective agents to accelerate wound healing and reduce scarring or tissue fibrosis in patients with burn injuries, blast injuries, chronic skin ulcers, keloids and other similar disorders. New products to treat these patients will drive the market.  Accumulating evidence indicates that TGF-2, a cytokine, provides an ideal target for developing novel therapeutic agents for many types of wounds including chronic wounds. TGF-2 is produced at the wound site and is responsible for recruiting inflammatory cells and fibroblasts to the wound site, inhibiting epithelial cell growth (wound re-epithelialization) and stimulating extracellular matrix synthesis by fibroblasts (fibrosis) at the wound site. In prior studies, we developed a synthetic TGF-2 peptide antagonist (termed TGF-2 peptantagonist) which is the only known synthetic TGF-2 receptor antagonist. TGF-2 peptantagonist can enhance wound healing and reduce scarring in pig skin burn/excision and rabbit skin excision wound models. However, the efficacy of the synthetic TGF-2 peptantagonist is limited by its poor solubility in aqueous solution. This project aims at developing new chemical forms of our TGF-2 peptantagonist with excellent solubility, high tissue penetration ability and potent TGF-2 antagonist activity as drug candidates for treating wounds in humans. In Phase I studies, we have developed two new TGF-2 peptantagonists with rationally engineered properties exhibit high solubility in aqueous solution and are 10-times more potent than the prototype (unmodified) TGF-2   peptantagonist in inhibiting TGF-2 activity in vitro. One of these two new TGF-2 peptantagonists has been shown to potently prevent tissue injury, accelerate wound healing and reduce scarring in several animal injury models. These promising results have provided rationales for the proposed studies in the Phase II project. We hope the clinical availability of these two novel TGF-2 peptantagonists will be commercialized by large pharmaceutical companies, eventually directly benefiting individuals with various types of wounds including normal, impaired and chronic wounds.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop synthetic TGF-2 antagonists into wound healing agents for accelerating wound healing and reducing scarring. The clinical availability of these agents would benefit millions of patients who suffer from various types of wounds including normal, impaired and chronic wounds.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study utilizes novel electronics and microfabrication techniques to create scalable, in-vitro Microelectrode Array (MEA) technologies that conform to industry standards for multiwell plates. This research will not only enable rapid advancements in the study of network-level electrophysiology, but it will also create new opportunities for pharmaceutical research and toxicity screening. This Phase II proposal involves two significant developments for neurological research. Specifically, Aim 1 builds on the scalable simultaneous stimulation and recording Integrated Circuit (IC) developed in Phase I to produce a full electronics platform for capturing, processing and storing electrophysiological information. Among its many advantages, this electronics platform will recover signals traditionally obscured by stimulation artifacts. This captured data, combined with the ability to simultaneously manage 768 microelectrodes and automate experimental protocols, will provide new measures of single-cell and network-level neural activity. Aim 2 will produce scalable, inexpensive, and flexible processes for fabricating multiwell MEAs that, in conjunction with the electronics developed in Aim 1, will yield a high-throughput, network-electrophysiology toolset.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research uses novel electronic and fabrication technologies to create faster, lower-cost methods for neural research. Ultimately, this development will facilitate medical and scientific discoveries that will benefit the treatment of neural disorders such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Phase II research program focuses on the development of a wireless Small Animal Physiological Monitor (SAM). The SAM system will provide the capability to monitor up to 16 laboratory animals (initially rats and mice) simultaneously, with continuous recording, synchronization, and display of physiological data, including heart rate, respiratory rate, motion activity, skin temperature, and ambient temperature. Data will be collected from each animal via a miniature, lightweight  backpack  that is worn on the dorsal surface of the animal, with sensors integrated into an appropriately-sized, chew-resistant design. Optional wireless cameras can be mounted in laboratories or animal housing areas and integrated into the SAM system for remote visual monitoring of animals in real time.  SAM system data (both physiological and video data) will be uploaded wirelessly to a shared receiver unit that interfaces to a PC (which can be local or over the Internet). The PC will consolidate the incoming data stream(s), archive all data on a hard disk, and provide real-time data display, enabling remote, simultaneous monitoring of all instrumented animals.  The proposed Phase II research follows a successful Phase I effort that demonstrated proof of concept and feasibility for the SAM system in both anesthetized (supine) and conscious (prone) rats and mice. The Phase II research will involve creation of a fully-functional, commercially-viable SAM system that will be evaluated in laboratory experiments conducted on a variety of rats and mice, including several animals simultaneously over a one-week period. The SAM system will significantly refine animal welfare for many research experiments by eliminating the need for surgical implantation of sensors and providing the capability for wireless monitoring of key physiological variables.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The SAM system will provide improved instrumentation that will facilitate biomedical and behavioral science investigations across essentially all NIH institutes, as rats and mice are the most commonly used vertebrates in research. Additionally, the SAM system will enable research in areas that are presently constrained by the absence of suitable monitoring devices. For example, many questions regarding housing and husbandry practices of rodents and the impact of environmental conditions and/or external events on these animals remain unanswered.",

Functions provided by the TELEHOME system include: (1) monitoring/alerting for fall events, personal emergencies, activity/inactivity, and wandering; (2) automatic connection of mobile speakerphone to call recipient in response to an emergency event, or to calling parties for incoming telephone calls; (3) capability for family members and friends to stay abreast of in-home activity patterns of monitored individuals (e.g., track transitions through areas of the home, activity counts, etc.) through automatically-generated telephone voice calls, e-mail messages, or the TELEHOME website; and (4) recorded voice message delivery to mobile speakerphone to remind monitored individuals to take their medication, etc. The TELEHOME system is easy to operate, and requires no modifications to the home or involvement of a third-party monitoring company (eliminating associated fees). The TELEHOME system will be valuable to informal caregivers, such as adults who have an elderly parent living alone in a community or senior care facility, who want to ensure that those in their charge are safe and up and about each day. It will also provide peace of mind to elderly persons who want to continue to live independently, but have a safety net in place.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The role of informal caregivers (i.e., family, friends, and neighbors), as contrasted with formal compensated home care providers, has increased greatly over the past two decades in the U.S. due to changes in the Medicare system. One way to lessen the burden on informal providers and provide peace of mind, as well as increase quality of care and quality of life for elders, is to make available a low-cost monitoring system that would allow potential emergencies to be identied when they occur and enable family and friends to stay abreast of activity patterns of those in their charge.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this research project is to develop, evaluate, and disseminate an Internet-based (web) application for SMART Recovery: Overcoming Addictions (OA). OA will be based on the four point cognitive-behavioral program for SMART Recovery (www.smartrecovery.org). The goal of the OA program is to help users learn cognitive and behavioral skills to abstain from drinking, drug use, and problem gambling. The major project goals in Phase II are to complete the development of the OA web application and evaluate the effectiveness of the OA web application in a randomized clinical trial (RCT). The study design has three conditions: 1) participation in face-to-face SMART Recovery meetings alone; 2) use of the OA web application as a stand-alone intervention; and 3) combining the OA web application with participation in face-to-face SMART Recovery meetings. Baseline assessment will consist of a 3-month TimeLine Follow Back (TLFB) interview that asks about both drinking and drug use, the Inventory of Drug use Consequences (InDuC) that asks about both alcohol and drug-related negative consequences, and assessment of additional help sought during the course of the study. Post-baseline assessments will occur at 3-and 6-months and will be parallel to the baseline assessment. The proposed project also has significant potential to benefit the public health. If the OA program proves to be effective, it would provide individuals seeking help for a wide range of addictive behaviors with an accessible Internet resource that uses evidence-based approaches to address addictive behaviors and to promote positive, sustainable changes. Consistent with the nature of many web-based applications, this help could be provided in a relatively cost-effective manner either as a stand-alone intervention or as an adjunct to both SMART Recovery's face-to-face groups (depending on the outcomes of the clinical trial). It could also serve as an adjunct to treatment programs that have a cognitive-behavioral orientation. This SBIR project will add another product to our set of programs for people with alcohol and drug problems. A long-term goal of Behavior Therapy Associates LLP is to develop and offer a suite of evidence- based interventions both to the general public and to treatment providers (both in substance abuse treatment and in primary healthcare). We have already developed the Drinker's Check-up, a brief motivational intervention for heavy drinkers, and have just completed a study of our moderatedrinking.com web application. This application follows logically in sequence: a program to help people abstain once they're motivated to do so.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If this program proves to be effective, it would provide individuals seeking help for a wide range of addictive behaviors with an accessible Internet resource that uses evidence-based approaches to address addictive behaviors and to promote positive, sustainable changes. This assistance could be provided in a relatively cost-effective manner and could be contribute to a reduction in alcohol, drug, and gambling-related problems in our society. 1",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Panic attacks (PA) impact about 23% of adults in community samples. Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (PDA) tends to be a chronic condition with a lifetime prevalence of 4.7%. When untreated, panic disorder (PD) often leads to debilitating problems, with severe financial and interpersonal costs. Panic Control Treatment (PCT) is an efficacious treatment for PD. The overarching goal of this project is to facilitate the dissemination of PCT (aka MAP; Mastery of Your Anxiety and Panic) to clinicians who treat PD by creating the Online PCT Training for Clinicians (PCT OLT). In Phase I, we produced an innovative OLT prototype comprised of 143 screens using an iterative process of development with feedback from target end-users and PCT experts. A randomized controlled trial (RCT; N=31) was then conducted comparing the PCT OLT to a control OLT. PCT OLT subjects significantly outperformed controls on all outcome variables, including knowledge, recall, and self-efficacy. Results were maintained at the one week follow up. The proposed Phase II project extends this work by expanding the OLT and its evaluation in Phase II. Specifically, we will include all remaining content from the PCT manuals and add additional clinical scenarios and performance-based interactivities. We will test the program's efficacy in a RCT (N=180) using an additive research design of three training approaches: text (n=60), text + PCT OLT (PCT OLT; n=60), vs. text + PCT OLT + expert weekly consultation (Hybrid; n= 60). Outcome variables will again include PCT knowledge, as well as self-efficacy in treating PDA clients with PCT. We will expand the assessments to include a computer- generated clinical application test of competence and fidelity to PCT and course completion. Subjects will be assessed pre- and post-training, then again at 30-day and 60-day post-training follow-ups.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although empirically-based treatments do exist for people diagnosed with panic disorder (PD), only a relatively small percentage of this population will receive such treatments. Panic Control Treatment (aka Mastery of Anxiety and Panic; MAP) is an efficacious treatment for PD. The intent of this project is to develop a uniquely comprehensive and interactive online training in MAP, to aid in the dissemination of this evidence based treatment, in order to improve clinical outcomes for patients suffering from PD.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Our goal is to develop a new molecular entity with a novel mechanism of action for targeting and eliminating glioblastoma multiforme (GBM, high grade glioma), a deadly and invasive brain tumor with no effective treatment. Of the 12,000 patients expected to be diagnosed with GBM this year, most will succumb within the first year. Clearly, there is an urgent demand for an efficacious anti-glioma drug. To address this need, we are developing a new class of therapeutic proteolipid nanovesicle that can target and destroy glioma tumors. Composed of the small lysosomal, sphingolipid activator protein saposin C (SapC, 80 aa) and the phospholipid dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS); the stable 200 nm SapC-DOPS nanovesicles have unusually high affinity for phosphatidylserine-enriched membrane surfaces that occur widely in many types of tumor cells and tumor neovasculature. In a mechanism consistent with activation of sphingolipid protein function, SapC- DOPS also appears to selectively induce tumor cells to undergo apoptosis. In Phase I of this proposal, we demonstrated the feasibility of using SapC-DOPS nanovesicles to target and kill intracranial gliomas in mouse models. Injections of SapC-DOPS in mice with orthotopically implanted gliomas resulted in dose-dependent improvement in survival. Specific targeting of SapC-DOPS to the tumor mass was demonstrated using fluorescently-tagged nanovesicles in live animal imaging experiments. We also showed that saposin C protein, in specific association with DOPS is essential for targeting. Anticancer activity of SapC-DOPS was confirmed in a second orthotopic glioma model, derived from an aggressive and invasive glioma line. Pilot toxicity data indicated SapC-DOPS to be relatively nontoxic with no evidence of behavioral abnormalities or pathological lesions. Our objective in Phase II proposal is to identify and select optimized SapC-DOPS formulations and treatment methods suitable for advancing toward planned human testing. The specific aims of Phase II are: (1) optimize protein expression and purification, and develop clinically suitable formulation; (2) conduct preclinical pharmacokinetics, stability, and brain and tissue distribution analysis in animal models to determine in vivo disposition of the nanovesicles; and (3) carry out toxicity studies in two animal models to assess safety, towards filing of the IND. Upon the completion of these studies, we expect to have compelling evidence to progress clinical development of SapC-DOPS nanovesicles as a potent new anti-cancer therapeutic (during SBIR Phase III). This research is innovative because SapC-DOPS nanovesicles offer a unique approach for slowing tumor growth and eliminating deep-seated brain tumors. Ultimately, we expect to adapt our technology for targeting different types of tumors and for developing tumor-targeted diagnostics.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     We are developing a new molecular entitity for treating glioblastoma multiforme, a deadly form of brain tumor that kills over 90% of afflicted patients. Current standards of treatment, consisting of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, have not been effective in significantly reducing morbidity. Our strategy involves using new proteolipid nanovesicles that can penetrate the tumors and selectively destroy malignant cells without harming normal cells. Success in the proposed animal models will enable us to test the product in humans.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): BioElectroMed is developing a new medical device called the PulseCure System that utilizes nanosecond pulsed electric fields to eliminate both benign and malignant skin lesions. We have used the PulseCure to treat malignant melanoma and basal cell carcinoma in mice with very high efficacy. With a single, 6-minute treatment using 100 ns pulses, we can trigger complete remission of malignant melanomas without recurrence in nude mice. During this 6 minute treatment period the tumor is only exposed to the electric field for total of 200 5s yet this stimulates pyknosis, apoptosis, DNA fragmentation and reduces blood flow to the tumor. This results in a mean tumor size regression of 90% within two weeks and complete remission within 1 month. We have developed a new suction electrode design for use on much thicker human skin and have demonstrated the efficacy of this new design on the mouse model. We also developed a microprocessor-controlled pulse delivery system for easy use in the clinical trials of the PulseCure. Here we propose to optimize the pulse parameters using the most effective suction electrode configuration to minimize treatment time and make several improvements to the PulseCure system necessary for human trials. These improvements include reducing electromagnetic interference, implementing safety features required by the ANSI/AAMI ES60601-1 and ES60601-2 standards, fabricating an adjustable arm to facilitate electrode placement on humans, developing a computer interface to record both patient and treatment data and automation of matching resistor selection and spark gap spacing. We will then conduct a feasibility study treating human skin scheduled for removal from patients during a plastic surgery procedure as well as Basal Cell Carcinomas on volunteers with Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome. Next we will conduct a Pilot Clinical Trial treating 30 basal cell carcinomas on 10 patients with Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome. If the PulseCure can reliably eliminate malignant skin lesions, it would offer a welcome, non-surgical and perhaps scar-free alternative to surgery that could improve the quality of life for tens of thousands of dermatology patients.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are developing a new medical device, the PulseCure, for treating both benign and malignant skin lesions. The PulseCure uses ultrashort electrical pulses to trigger skin tumors to self- destruct. It offers a non-surgical therapy that may be a scar-free and could improve the quality of life for tens of thousands of dermatology patients.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Periodontal disease has been recently identified as a risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality for systemic diseases such as pancreatic cancer, cardiovascular disease (atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and stroke), and diabetes, as well as for pregnancy complications such as preterm birth. It is well established that periodontal disease results from microorganisms in dental plaque biofilm. Inflammatory reactions initiated by oral bacteria and their components are implicated locally in the pathogenesis of periodontal tissue destruction, and may contribute to the development of systemic disease. While causality has yet to be confirmed, some studies have shown that oral health interventions may impact biological markers of inflammation and disease. The goal of this project is to develop a prescription antimicrobial oral rinse to reduce bacterial bioburden in the oral cavity and combat oral disease and inflammation. Current oral rinse products are either fraught with side effects such as staining and taste alterations that limit their usage to acute settings, or are ineffective. Based on preliminary studies, the oral rinse developed herein is expected to be more effective than currently available prescription products without the side effects. The development of a highly effective oral rinse may have the potential to have a profound impact on public health and achieve significant commercial success. This study is a Fast-Track proposal that combines both Phase I and Phase II studies in one application. The Phase I portion has two Specific Aims: Aim 1. Compound Oral Rinse Formulations for Use in Clinical Trials Aim 2. Evaluate Dose-Response of the Oral Rinse in a Human Clinical Trial of Gingival Inflammation and Investigate Effects on Biological Markers Indicative of Systemic Disease. The Phase II portion has three Specific Aims: Aim 1. Compound Oral Rinse Formulations for Use in Clinical Trials Aim 2. Evaluate the Oral Rinse in a Human Clinical Trial of Gingivitis to Satisfy FDA Requirements and Investigate Effects on Biological Markers Indicative of Systemic Disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent studies have linked oral bacteria to systemic diseases such as pancreatic cancer, diabetes, stroke and heart disease. Although it has yet to be proven that oral bacteria cause these diseases directly, there is some evidence that dental treatment may improve markers of disease. The development of a safe and effective mouthrinse that could remove harmful oral bacteria and potentially reduce the incidence of disease would have a significant impact on public health.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studies performed with phase I SBIR grants 1R43DK55385-01A1 and 1 R43 DK59062-01A1 and phase II SBIR grants 2R44DK059062-02A1 and 5R44DK059062-04 have demonstrated the following: a) A new hemodialysis(HD) venous needle (NVN) with three jets is hemodynamically  superior to the current venous needle (CVN) because it decreases the velocity of the  vascular access flow by 3.5 times and the turbulence by 6 times when compared with  the currently used venous needle (CVN), and unlike the CVN, it does not form an area of  annular recirculation. b) The NVN is more efficient than the CVN in the removal of BUN, it is safe(it causes equal  or less damage to cells, it does not form clots and does not cause prolonged bleeding at  puncture sites), and it is as effective as the CVN to fulfills the function of conduit to  transport blood. c) More importantly, the data from HD in sheep and patients suggest that the NVN is  clinically superior to the CVN because it causes less damage to circulating blood cells  and less generation and release of cytokines and oxidants. However, the data did not  show statistically significant superiority because the sample size was small. The proposed phase II competing renewal grant will demonstrate clinical superiority of the NVN by studying a larger number of HD patients and obtaining statistically significant data. Seventy stable HD patients will be studied. Each patient will receive one mid-week HD using the CVN and one mid-week HD using the NVN the following week. Pre and post HD plasma and intracellular IL-1 and IL-6, intracellular IL-6 soluble receptor, IL-6 gp130, superoxide and hydrogen peroxide and plasma Mandenyldealdehyde(MDA) and advanced oxidation protein products(AOPP) will be measured. Each patient will use the same HD prescription during both HD including length of dialysis, type of dialyzer non-reused, size of needles (15g), heparin, dialysate composition, and blood and dialysate flow rate. The outcomes to be compared are net changes in blood levels of all the markers in the NVN and CVN groups. Demonstrating that the NVN is clinically superior will have great significance:  a) It will show that the NVN is more useful than the CVN: The NVN would decrease the complications caused by inflammation and oxidative stress, the mortality of patients and the cost of care,  b) It will allow claiming clinical superiority of the NVN in the application for pre-market approval to be submitted to the FDA. This will facilitate marketing and sales and is necessary to obtain investments to commercialize the needle. The NVN fills a technological gap and a clinical need: the CVN is not fit for use with the 400-500 ml/min blood flow rates currently used in HD. The NVN is protected by several patents and the process to obtain a 510K from the FDA has been started.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   This project will demonstrate that the new venous needle (NVN) is a product that will  help hemodialysis patients unlike the current venous needle (CVN) that is harmful to  patients. The NVN will decrease medical complications, mortality and the cost of care of  hemodialysis patients.   The NVN fills a technological gap and a clinical need: The current venous needle (CVN)  fulfills the needs of hemodialysis with low blood flow rates but it is not fit for use with the  high blood flow rate currently used of 400-500 ml/min.   This study will enhance scientific knowledge to improve the delivery of dialysis and the  design of devices used on dialysis.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this Phase II Small Business Innovation Research application, Bioptigen, Inc. proposes to commercialize a deep imaging spectral domain optical coherence tomography (DI-SDOCT) imaging system that incorporates technology proven during the Phase I period to overcome traditional depth limits in OCT and has a maximum, artifact free imaging depth approaching 10 mm. This product will enable high-speed, high- resolution imaging of the cornea, iris, and anterior and posterior surfaces of the lens capsule that is unavailable in any other product to date. There is a proven market for perioperative OCT, and the outcome of this Phase II will be an OCT imaging product that extends the capabilities of current technology used in the clinic and enables full depth, high resolution anterior chamber imaging with OCT that can meet the exacting needs of the operating suite. Complex Conjugate Removal (CCR), the high risk element of the Phase I proposal, was successfully implemented, doubling the available imaging depth with suppression of DC noise, autocorrelation terms, and the complex conjugate artifact. This system is capable of imaging with lt 5 mm depth resolution over a 4.4 mm (depth) x 6 mm (lateral) imaging range with correction for refraction at the cornea, enabling accurate measurement of tissue microstructure and pathologies. Technical innovations proposed in the Phase II include spectrometer and probe optical design for extended depth imaging and falloff mitigation through a comb filter and are within the scope of Bioptigen's prior development experience. A subcontract with collaborators at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute will enable external technology validation and human trials in first a clinical and then an intraoperative setting.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SDOCT) is a non-invasive, high resolution optical imaging method that is often used in ophthalmic applications to better understand or diagnose disease. There are currently no SDOCT products that target the surgical market, but the ability to rapidly image the eye during surgery could greatly improve the outcome of the surgery and limit patient risk. This proposal seeks to extend the utility of SDOCT by providing a device capable of imaging the cornea, iris, and both surfaces of the lens that can be used in the clinic and in the surgical suite. This product will provide a much longer imaging depth range than any commercial SDOCT product on the market. This could greatly aid in the research of diseases whose pathology manifests as structures larger than the maximum depth range of traditional SDOCT systems. An immediate application would be monitoring the eye before, during, and after cataract or glaucoma surgery to ensure the surgery is successful.",

        "abstract": "The SPORL process consists of reacting wood chips with a solution of calcium, magnesium, or sulfite at elevated temperatures for a short time, and then size reducing the resulting material using a disk refiner to generate fibrous substrate for subsequent saccharification and fermentation. The work is a collaborative effort between industry, university, and federal agencies. Forest biomass is a very important feedstock for the future bioeconomy for the rural United States because of its availability in large quantities, flexible harvesting schedule that eases storage, and low cost for transportation due to high density and low ash content. About 30 percent of the projected annual sustainable available biomass is forest biomass based on the billion ton study. To meet local rural United States bioenergy needs and promote biodiversity, forest biomass will be an important integral part of the biomass feedstock supply. However, forest biomass, especially softwood, is very difficult to convert biochemically to fermentable sugars for cellulosic ethanol or biofuel production due to its strong physical integrity and chemical recalcitrance. The goal of this project in Phase II is to prove this commercially deployable technology for forest biomass bioconversion to produce cellulosic ethanol and lignin bioproducts at the pilot scale. The research proposed will create an opportunity for rural economic development through sustainable green energy production. While the commercial production of cellulosic ethanol is nonexistent currently in the United States, it expected that about 500 biorefineries will be built in the next 15 years to meet goal of 16 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol set by the advanced fuel standard in the EISA of 2007. The development of this future biorefining industry will take place primarily in the rural areas where large quantities of biomass feedstock are available at a low cost. Producing ethanol from cellulose promises to greatly increase the volume of fuel ethanol that can be produced in the United States. That will not only benefit the United States, but could help poorer nations by reducing fuel cost. With the ever increasing occurrence and intensity of forest fires, large volume and high value utilization of forest thinning materials is critical to mitigate the very expensive cost for forest thinning operations to reduce fuel loadings. The woody biomass form forest thinnings meet the advanced fuel standard. The SPORL technology provides a viable avenue for utilization of the thinning materials, which makes thinning and healthy forest management operation sustainable. This will enhance our biofuel resource base by providing new feedstock. Therefore, the proposed research has the potential to enhance international competitiveness of American agriculture, enhance the competitiveness and sustainability of rural and farm economics, support increased economic opportunities and improved quality of life in rural America, and protect and enhance the Nation's natural resources base and environment.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The project proposed by Tactile Display Corporation (TDC) supports the NIH/NEI mission to develop devices to aid the blind. A blind student has 2 hurdles to overcome when reading with today's refreshable braille display (RBD): the inability to read more than one line at a time because these devices only display a single line of text, and, the inability to read school materials because until recently there's been no way to get books into the proper file format for RBD display. TDC's project has 2 long-term objectives that will overcome these hurdles: (1) development of a multi-line refreshable braille display (MRBD) able to display properly formatted text, charts and tables, and, (2) development of software to convert textbooks and display them on an MRBD. The specific aims to achieve objective (1) are to complete the development of the components for TDC's braille display module (BDM). The BDM will be the basic building-block for an MRBD. The project's research design includes creation of 3D computer models for all MRBD components, production of prototype parts using Computer Numeric Control (CNC) technology, manufacture of engineering prototypes, and reviews by focus groups. On July 19, 2006 the U. S. Department of Education adopted a National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard (NIMAS) for schoolbooks. To achieve objective (2), TDC has formed an alliance with Computer Application Specialties Company (CASC) to jointly develop NIMAS conversion and display software for an MRBD. With this software, an MRBD will provide blind students access to properly formatted NIMAS textbooks in braille in all subjects. Realization of these objectives will offer blind Americans several benefits: affordable MRBD devices ( 1.00 per braille dot instead of  18.75), access to tabulated materials, full-page braille book readers and most importantly, parity with sighted peers.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports the development of a unique manufacturing method to produce novel shape memory polymers in complex shapes.  These smart materials can \"remember\" and reform to a set shape upon an external stimulus.  This continuous manufacturing process is vastly more efficient than the current state-of-the-art methods, enabling many low cost applications of shape memory polymers.  This project will develop shape memory polymer earplugs that are heat activated by the user's ear and continuously adapt and self-adjust to custom fit any size ear canal.  Current material solutions for earplugs suffer from several drawbacks, including an inability to control the force exerted by the earplug upon sensitive inner ear regions that cause pain over time.  This effort will address the technical challenges of scaling up the low cost manufacturing process and establish formulations that will enable optimization of its acoustic performance.  Human subject testing will be conducted to subjectively validate comfort and objectively validate attenuation with very differently sized ear canals.  If successful, this project will yield a device with optimized acoustic properties and comfort ready for first commercial sale.\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project is the impact of a mass-manufactured shape memory polymer device. Due to their desired properties, shape memory polymers are increasingly used in biomedical applications, but their broader adoption into mass markets has been limited by cost and geometry constraints.  If successful, this project will establish a novel manufacturing process that, through modified traditional plastics processing techniques, can mass manufacture a new class of polymers. Thus, the broad impact of this project is twofold: it will establish the first links between sound attenuation and crosslinker density in shape memory polymer earpieces, and it will lay the groundwork for future low cost shape memory devices of complex geometries.  Better occlusion and more comfortable earplugs are expected to enable higher usage of protective hearing devices in loud industrial settings.  This in turn addresses the growing problem of noise-induced hearing loss in the industrial sector, which according to OSHA, is the number one occupational disease in the US today.  In addition, shape memory earplugs may benefit other users including musicians, professional athletes and children with autism. This technology can also be adapted to similar devices including cell phone headsets, Bluetooth audio devices, and hearing aids.",

        "abstract": "Determining meat quality attributes in food animals is essential for genetic selection, sorting, and marketing. Ultrasound techniques have the potential to benefit the swine industry for improvements in both quality and yield measures by non-destructive and non-invasive means. Biotronics, Inc. has developed and markets products for evaluation of percent intramuscular fat (% IMF) in longissimus dorsi muscle and body composition traits in live pigs using conventional real-time ultrasound (B-mode) imaging technology. It has recently introduced this technology in a commercial prototype for hot carcass instrument grading. The premise of the project is that swine breeders can be rewarded financially for production of pigs resulting in higher levels of % IMF if the pork packing plant realizes premiums for their product. There is a need to continually improve accuracy and reduce bias for estimation of % IMF, especially for integration of % IMF levels into payment systems. The overall objective of this SBIR project is to significantly improve the % IMF and % lean evaluation by utilizing the new hybrid digital ultrasound technology. A unique opportunity exists due to recent availability of a programmable ultrasound scanner with access to both unprocessed, radio frequency (RF) ultrasound backscattered signals and corresponding B-mode images, and recent reports that combining parameters from both signals and images improves accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for tissue characterization. The Phase-I of this project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of simultaneously acquiring ultrasound images and RF signals from live pigs using a new generation of programmable digital ultrasound scanner and demonstrated greater than 10% improvements in % IMF estimation accuracy by combining parameters from RF signals with texture parameters from images. During the Phase-II, we will assemble a commercial prototype of the hybrid system for hot carcass instrument grading and will test the system in the packing plant by scanning carcasses at a line speed of 1200 per hour. We will refine the methods for real-time acquisition and processing of hybrid ultrasound signal, spectrum and image data. We will implement algorithms for fully automatic and accurate determination of % IMF and % lean, in near real-time at the line speed, by automatically identifying acceptable quality data frames and anatomical landmarks. Benefits of the proposed next generation system will include significant improvement in % IMF in an overall customized system design that integrates digital ultrasound and computer into one device and reduces the number of components. This will also lead to better quality control and longer lifecycle of the proposed commercial carcass instrument grading system. The Biotronics team is in unique position to lead this effort to develop the next generation ultrasound meat quality evaluation system. The proposed hybrid system has the potential to significantly improve marketable ultrasound technology and have a long lasting economic impact on all segments of the pork industry, with the ultimate benefit to be realized by the consumer.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to commercialize a predictive modeling technology that automatically adapts to changing interaction patterns between providers of higher education (colleges and universities) and consumers (prospective students). Current methods produce only retrospective static models which, due to peculiarities of the higher education recruitment cycle, require at least a one-year lag between data acquisition and application to new prospects. As a result, data mining techniques have gained only limited popularity in college recruiting. The approach proposed here employs a proprietary adaptive modeling engine (AME) to leverage real-time transactional data from a CRM system and dynamically update scoring algorithms to predict outcomes. AME relies on a logical interface and unified dimensional data model to extract analyzable record-sets accurately representing the state of underlying transactional data at any time-slice within the system's effective-dated range. The integration of these key technologies allow relationship patterns to be identified in the recruitment process as they occur and scoring algorithms to dynamically adapt to changing patterns within a single recruitment cycle. \nIt is believed that the changing demographics of college-going students will present a number of significant obstacles to the traditional college business model and could jeopardize the future financial health of many higher education providers in this county. The decade-long trend of yearly increases in demand, as represented by the number of new students entering college, comes to an end in 2009. In stark contrast to the 24% growth the market has experienced over the past decade, future enrollment numbers will remain stagnant overall, and in many localities college enrollment will actually decline. Furthermore, dramatic shifts are coming in the geodemographic, ethnic, and cultural mix of high school graduates that feed the higher education market. As competition for students increases dramatically in the face of rising attendance costs, dwindling endowments, changing demographics, and a decline in college-bound students, each college's ability to survive, much less prosper, will depend directly on its ability to identify, understand, and communicate with students in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. Those that are able to adapt this new landscape through the use of innovative tools like AME will flourish, and those who are unable to adapt will face an uncertain future of declining enrollments and financial instability.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to continue expanding the study of iridium-catalyzed aromatic C-H activation/borylation in concert with other chemical conversions as a new approach to currently inaccessible chemical building blocks that will be highly useful for variety of practical applications, including pharmaceutical, agro-chemical, materials and fine chemical development. The mildness of the Ir-catalysts and the reaction conditions under which they operate, allows for the borylation of arenes containing a variety of functional groups. Given this substrate tolerance, a wide range of subsequent same-pot reactions is possible, and currently under development. Our newly invented process that  telescopes  C-H activation/borylation with oxidations serves as a prime example of this ability to couple borylation with other chemical transformations in an efficient, scaleable way. This process provides rapid and unique access to new and highly functionalized phenolic building blocks that are currently commercially unavailable or accessible only by protracted, costly, and otherwise unattractive routes. Phenols are commercially important compounds that are extensively utilized, especially in the area of drug discovery, development, and manufacture. Even with an array of methods for their production, there are still many relatively simple examples where the established syntheses are prohibitively long and/or low yielding for practical use. In this proposal BoroPharm aims to combat these difficulties through the commercial development of proprietary technology that has been exclusively licensed to BoroPharm, Inc. Specifically, BoroPharm aims to validate iridium-catalyzed aromatic borylation/oxidation as a commercial route to pharmaceutically relevant phenols and hydroxypyridines. Based on the successful completion of Phase I objectives and industry feedback from BoroPharm's growing client base, the following specific aims will be addressed in this Phase II proposal: 1. Expand the portfolio of borylated pyridine derivatives and add quinolines,  pyrazines, pyrimidines, diazenes, imidazoles, pyrazoles, oxazoles, etc. Produce oxidized products (e.g. hydroxyquinolines) where applicable. 2. Explore new boron technologies including the formation and utilization of trifluoroborate, triolate, and MIDA derivatives. 3. Augment the phenol portfolio to make more previously unreported products available. Increase the scale to produce kilogram quantities. 4. Expand upon additional transformations of aryl boronates in the portfolio, and to produce new products where the carbon-boron bonds are either transformed or retained.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The invention of new drugs rests heavily on the chemist's ability to assemble unique compounds from molecular building blocks. In this regard, new pharmaceuticals call for new building blocks, while lower cost drugs will require more efficient and environmentally friendly routes to these key intermediates. Herein we propose to develop the next phase of a novel technology for the creation of unique and versatile chemical building blocks, the invention of which will aid the discovery and development of new medicines. This project is a continuation of a phase I grant that succeeded with positive outcomes. Herein, we will expand upon the breadth, scope and scale of the chemical platform and expand on the synthesis of novel and useful pharmaceutical building blocks.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II proposal aims at developing a new alignment-free metrological turn-key system dedicated to the measurement of optical surfaces with high measurement speed and high dynamic range. Next generation optical surfaces will need to be mass-produced with high departure from spherical shapes and high numerical aperture (Aspheric). Manufacturing these optical components is challenging because of today's limited metrology methods: contact sensors are too slow to be used in-process whereas interferometers and wavefront sensors have a small limited dynamic range and require careful alignment. The research objective is to design a prototype of a polarization based method and to evaluate its performances; speed, dynamic range, accuracy, insensitivity to alignment. The proposed approach combines an innovative polarization camera, a specific illumination, and a novel algorithm for automatic 3D shape extraction. The result of this research is to demonstrate that the proposed approach leads to very low sensitivity to alignment, fast measurement time, high dynamic range, and uncertainty smaller than current manufacturing tolerances. Preliminary simulations show that 2\" diameter aspheric lens can be measured in 40 ms, with a resolution of 10,000 points, a dynamic range of 20 mm and an accuracy of 0.25 micron root-mean-square (RMS). \nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will address the growing manufacturing of aspheric optical components used for various applications: concentrating photovoltaics (CPV) for solar power generation, optical instruments, ophthalmic lenses and consumer electronics (cameras, phones). Controlling aspheric optical surfaces using current metrology tools is a time consuming process. Contact sensors are too slow and interferometers have tight alignment requirements and low dynamic range. The commercial potential of a system insensitive to alignment, performing fast measurements, with high dynamic range and good accuracy is extremely valuable for the following reasons. The system would allow mass production of high quality aspheric lenses with systematic inspection of each manufactured component. High numerical aperture lenses would also be measured easily in-process which will drastically increase productivity. This will translate into the faster deployment of cheaper, more efficient solar power production, lighter optical systems, and better corrected contact lenses. The present project will also have the broader impact of opening the door to a new kind of metrology based on polarization sensing, which could also be applied to many other industries such as plastics, steel, glass, automotive, robotics, surveillance and medical industries in the future.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a nitrogen oxide (NOx) sensor for diesel engine and other lean-burn combustion systems. This innovation combines unique SiC-based piezoelectric bimorph microresonator chemical detection technology with NOx sensitive materials, to develop an emissions control NOx sensor capable of operating in harsh engine emissions environments.  The feasibility of the NOx sensor was demonstrated in Phase I by assembling a preliminary prototype, testing it in environments characteristic of hot engine emissions, and demonstrating 1 ppm NOx detection with 1 second response times and stable operation at 400?aC.  The Phase II research objectives are to refine the sensor, including the bimorph resonator, NOx sensitive coatings, packaging and control electronics, to achieve higher temperature operation, 5 year lifetime, and reliable detection of 1 ppm NOx in the presence of varying concentrations of other exhaust gases.  Extensive stability and life testing will be performed to identify and address potential degradation mechanisms such as poisoning, fouling, carbon deposition and materials inter diffusion. The prototype, including integrated heater, temperature sensor, control electronics and power/ data interface, will be operated in engine test stands to demonstrate performance in actual exhaust environments.   \nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in its ability to accelerate the adoption and use of automobiles that use clean diesel and renewable diesel fuels, which is a low-risk and high-impact way of reducing both polluting emissions and US dependency on foreign energy supplies.  Diesel engines typically produce up to 20% less greenhouse gas emissions than a comparable gasoline powered vehicle.  However, they also produce a significantly higher amount of nitrogen oxides (NOx), a pollutant that causes smog and acid rain.  Although the technology exists to treat and eliminate this NOx pollution, it requires a high temperature compatible sensor with sensitivity and response time that does not exist commercially today.  This NSF SBIR Phase II program will develop a NOx sensor capable of meeting the needs of the automotive industry for a diesel engine emissions sensor for both real-time on-board diagnostics and emissions reduction, bringing vehicles into compliance with new environmental regulations coming into effect in 2013.  Enabling the wider adoption of clean diesel engines will reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and dependency on petroleum, as consumers increasingly choose these greener and more cost-effective vehicles.",

        "abstract": "In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that carbon dioxide (CO2) is a pollutant under the federal Clean Air Act. The ruling allows the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate CO2 emissions. Such regulation will entail monitoring a wide variety of pollution sources, including automobile exhaust systems, industrial emission sources, and carbon sequestration sites. With presently available technologies, EPA personnel will need to perform on-site scans of possible pollution locations by tediously sampling emitted gases with point-source gas-intake measurement devices. This makes it difficult or impossible for EPA personnel to identify or quantify critical CO2 pollution sources such as smokestacks/vents or unknown leaks in large search areas. No technology currently exists that can measure and pinpoint (to within a few meters) the location of elevated CO2 concentrations from a distance.\nTo address this need, Bridger Photonics, Inc. (Bridger) proposes to develop an inexpensive, rugged, and compact sensor with high-range resolution (meter-level) for on-site CO2 monitoring and spatial mapping from a distance. The proposed technology will enable EPA personnel simply to aim the sensor toward a distant industrial emission stack, for example, to measure the emitted CO2 concentration, the distance to the source, and the spatial extent of the plume. The sensor also could be used to spatially scan CO2 sequestration or industrial sites for leaks and could provide precise three-dimensional coordinate mappings of the emission source.\nThe proposed device is based on an innovative laser source and a differential detection technique developed during the Phase I effort that were shown to be ideally suited to detect CO2. The Phase II objectives are to: (1) optimize the performance of the laser system, (2) construct a compact optical receiver for detecting atmospheric light detection and ranging (LIDAR) returns, (3) demonstrate the system performance and capabilities for detecting artificial CO2 plumes in atmosphere, and (4) design a preliminary prototype device. Additionally, in the Phase II Commercialization and Verification Options, Bridger will construct, test, and verify a device prototype.\nBridger's propriety differential detection technique and rugged, compact laser will provide distinct competitive advantages in the CO2 sensor market. The recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling combined with an emerging international effort to reduce CO2 emissions established a growing market demand for including future carbon sequestration monitoring markets. Bridger estimates a potential $50 million U.S. market for this hand-held CO2 sensor.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop an enhanced pulse oximeter prototype ready for external demonstration. The key innovation of the prototype will be the Intelligent Data Extraction Algorithm (IDEA), which during Phase I demonstrated extraction of embedded hemodynamic information from photoplethysmograms, including left-ventricular stroke volume and cardiac output. IDEA will evolve in sophistication to increase diagnostic range and accuracy. Both extended evaluation and preliminary clinical validation studies will take place in order to assess the reliability of measured hemodynamic values and trends. Close interaction with doctors will help define clinical uses for this new technology. If successful, the final prototype will enable the noninvasive measurement of valuable hemodynamics with associated error bars (confidence intervals) including stroke volume and cardiac output. Other features include resistance to strong motion artifacts, continuous and real-time operation, and utilization of existing sensor hardware.\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to solve noninvasive measurement of valuable hemodynamics that cannot be met with current technology. During anesthesia, surgery, and recovery, our IDEA-enhanced pulse oximeter can track the patient?s hemodynamic evolution throughout, warning against possible adverse reactions or ?silent hemorrhages? that do not show up in any standard monitoring equipment. In the neonatal ward, it can monitor babies born with congenital heart disease or poor blood flow. At home, it can be used to monitor patients with chronic heart conditions (the top killer in the US) and warn doctors about developing acute problems such as arrhythmias and heart attacks. In the battlefield and disaster areas, our device can dramatically improve the speed and accuracy of triage to save the lives of injured soldiers and victims. Many other medical practices would benefit from the use of noninvasive and continuous stroke volume and other hemodynamic monitoring to expand the amount of vital information available at the patient care area and eliminate the need for risky invasive procedures.",

However, biomass processing steps are currently too energy-intensive and cost-prohibitive.We are exploring new chemistry to obtain an energy- and cost-efficient way to dry algae biomass and extract energetic substrates for conversion into renewable fuels.We have discovered and demonstrated a chemical reaction that dries biomass, lyses (breaks up) algae cells, and extracts its lipids. The reaction is fast at atmospheric pressure and low temperatures, and produces greater lipid yields than conventional methods. Furthermore, the reaction is scalable, works with any algae species, does not use hazardous chemicals, and consumes less than 10% of the net energy gain.We plan to develop a laboratory-scale Pilot Plant based on the reaction demonstrated in Phase I. The Pilot Plant will accept moist algae and output: i) lipid stream, ii) a carbohydrates and proteins stream, iii) water stream. The Pilot Plant will yield engineering data, Net Energy Gain analysis and Economic Feasibility studies to help attract the necessary investors and partnerships to reach commercialization of the industrial-scale process.Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Our algae drying and extraction technology, if coupled to breakthroughs of similar magnitude in algae cultivation, could make renewable fuels cost-competitive with fossil fuels in the near future.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increased routine use of state-of-the-art imaging techniques has resulted in a higher incidence of small incidentally discovered renal masses, benign and malignant. A large proportion of patients with such masses, are within an older, more frail population and for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), 60-70% of patients now present asymptomatically. Treatment recommendations then with decreased morbidity are required for such patients, in a disease where current interventions include minimally invasive to standard surgical procedures. Recently, the impact of morphology-based diagnosis of needle biopsies on treatment decision making has been identified to have two main limitations: inability to obtain diagnostic material of adequate quantity and quality for morphologic examination, and inability to distinguish particular RCC subtypes morphologically. In the current Phase I/Phase II application, we propose to develop a novel fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-based renal cancer detection (FRCD) kit that is based not on cell morphology, but on the inherent differential genetics of renal cortical neoplasms, for commercial distribution by Cancer Genetics, Inc. Application of this test will permit diagnosis of the four predominant subtypes of renal cortical neoplasms (three malignant, one benign) that together with morphologic examination would impact all phases of clinical management of this disease. Phase I; Specific Aim 1: Retrospective validation of a BAC-based FISH probe panel in discrimination of the four main subtypes of renal cortical neoplasms in renal core biopsies. Since preliminary studies using a BAC-based probe panel designed by CGI revealed good differential diagnosis of the four histologic subtypes, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the probe panel will be validated in a cohort of 145 biopsies obtained from resected specimens with known but blinded morphology by standard pathology. Phase II; Specific Aim 1: Development of a single-copy FISH probe panel. In order to commercially distribute a FISH-based test without patent infringement of Cot-1 DNA use in hybridizations, a set of single-copy probes will be designed, propagated, labeled, and validated for use in a subset of renal needle biopsies and surgical specimens used in Phase I. Phase II; Specific Aim 2: Prospective validation of the single-copy FISH probe panel as a potential assay in the diagnosis of RCC in needle biopsies. The panel of single-copy probes will be evaluated in image-guided percutaneous renal biopsies prospectively obtained from patients with suspicious renal masses in an IRB-approved study. The accuracy of the assay will be evaluated with respect to the known but blinded morphology by standard pathology, of the 300 biopsies expected to be collected and assayed over two years. The overall goal of the project then is to develop, produce, and market a robust, sensitive, and specific FRCD kit that together with standard pathology will significantly contribute to clinical decision making in patients with renal masses and kidney cancer, impacting patient treatment recommendations and cost of care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With sophisticated imaging technologies routinely being used, kidney masses are often detected in older patients, but it unclear if these masses are malignant and need treatment, or are benign. The genetic-based kidney cancer detection kit to be developed and validated in this application that can be used on needle biopsies of the mass obtained with few complications from such patients, will help clinicians and surgeons to make better treatment decisions and prevent needless costly surgical procedures.",

        "abstract": "Efficient and environmentally friendly power generation is a national goal. While large scale power plants are demonstrating thermal efficiencies of 50%, the cost and environmental impact of increasing the size of current power plants and expansion of the grid to distribute this power are making this approach increasingly difficult and expensive. Alternative distributed power gen systems driven by available diesel systems are not environmentally friendly and require high maintenance. Small gas turbines are currently limited to approximately 33% efficiency, and are expensive as well. Fuel cell systems, although more environmentally friendly, are not currently economically viable do to extremely high initial costs. This program is dedicated to the development of a small distributed power generation system with a thermal efficiency of greater than 50% and an installed cost of no more than $375/kW. The prime power source for the system is a highly efficient, low cost advanced small gas turbine engine first demonstrated under U.S. Army sponsorship. During Phase I of this DOE SBIR project, a study of the current, advanced technology, prototype gas turbine engine design and its thermodynamic cycle has been conducted, in order to determine what changes are necessary to enhance its performance and provide an even higher efficiency system for a power generation role. The results of the analysis and design effort indicate that a high pressure ratio gas turbine combined with a bottoming cycle can be used to provide efficient distributed electrical power, and when used in a CHP system, substantially reduce the amount of energy consumed and green house gases produced. Preliminary design and analysis has verified the technical and economic feasibility of this power generation system. The results of Phase I will be the basis for final design of the critical components to be tested in Phase II. This effort includes the final design, fabrication and test of a prototype gas turbine engine core incorporating these new advanced technology components, which are the key technology step in the commercialization of the system. At present time discussions are ongoing with major OEMs who are potential partners, and who may invest in order to fabricate and test a full up system prototype, setting the stage for a successful Phase III and production launch. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The overall off the road annual diesel engine market for units in the 0.5 to 2.0 MW size is over 43,700 engines per year, including power generation, marine propulsion and auxiliary power, and mechanical applications. An advanced technology gas turbine based power system, such as the one proposed, could replace many higher pollution diesels in this market with the benefits of lower exhaust emissions and higher thermal efficiency.

Over 800,000 bone procedures are performed in the US per year, and with the aging US population, this number will only continue to grow. However, current materials, including autografts (e.g. demineralized bone matrix (DBM)), allografts, and engineered biomaterials, all fall short of clinical expectations for reasons such as cost, disease transmission concerns, bone donation issues and complications, and lack of well characterized and consistently performing products. Blood plasma-based plastics have the potential to overcome these limitations. In Phase I Carmell Therapeutics demonstrated that blood plasma-based plastics are biocompatible, biodegradable, bioactive, and form bone in a mouse calvarial defect model. In Phase II Carmell seeks to develop a putty-form of its plastic and obtain safety and efficacy data for use in a premarket approval application to the FDA. To achieve this, the putty will be designed to have similar physical properties to those of DBM-based putties while maintaining the biocompatibility and bioactivity properties of the original blood plasma-based plastic.

The ability of the product to repair a rabbit long bone radial defect will also be tested in a large, statistical study. Finally, a battery of biological tests will be performed to satisfy FDA- mandated ISO 10993 standards for the biological evaluation of medical devices.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite rapid advances in elucidating the molecular basis of human diseases, an ostensibly more difficult post-genomic challenge is the functional annotation of disease-specific signaling pathways and integration of this information into the development of novel drugs. RNA interference (RNAi) now makes it possible to use large-scale functional genomic strategies for target identification. Unfortunately, while RNAi has opened many potential avenues for improving the drug discovery process, these avenues remain only potential opportunities until we develop robust RNAi screening technologies, as well as experimental and bioinformatics tools for data validation and integration of this information into operational cell-based models. To address these issues, in Phase I, we developed second generation functionally validated (FV) human druggable genome lentiviral 15K shRNA libraries, and we have demonstrated their utility for deciphering cell- signaling pathways.  The ultimate goal of the Phase II studies is to develop and establish a cost-effective novel functional genomics platform to facilitate the discovery of therapeutic molecular targets en masse. Specifically, we propose to scale-up development of and commercialize a comprehensive set of human and mouse genome- wide FV shRNA libraries. These libraries will have improved performance and be designed for cost-effective pooled-format screening and identification of effectors by high-throughput (HT) sequencing. As supporting tools, we will develop protocols, reagents and software tools for in vitro and in vivo screening hit validation and therapeutic target prioritization. To test the performance of our functional genomics platform, we propose to use our novel RNAi resource to delineate the processes that underlie tumorigenesis in breast epithelial cells. We will perform synthetic lethality screens in a unique panel of isogenic human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) lines that comprise the most relevant breast cancer genetic alterations. Furthermore, we will validate the results of our in vitro screens in xenograft models using both fully transformed HMECs and common breast cancer cell lines. Our findings will then be combined with data collected from scientific publications and presented in a publicly available knowledge base, with the ultimate goal of developing models of signaling pathways that specifically control the proliferation and survival of breast cancer cells.  These developed RNAi screening, validation and software tools will be commercialized as products and custom services to provide the research community with highly modular, cost-effective approaches for studies aimed at understanding and integrating dynamic changes in signal transduction networks and ultimately delineating disease-specific phenotypes. As a result, we foresee that these toolsets will significantly improve the efficiency, economy and ease of elucidating and modeling disease-specific signal transduction networks and provide basic researchers with preferred, cost-effective alternatives to existing commercially available reagents and software. The proposed RNAi screening and bioinformatics strategies harbor considerable potential to systematically identify new anti-cancer targets for therapeutic intervention and to facilitate the development of highly specific drugs, biomarkers and novel therapeutic concepts.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ultimate goal of the Phase II project is to develop and make commercially available a novel orthogonal functional genomics platform to facilitate discovery and validation of therapeutic molecular targets en masse. As a first step, we propose to develop and make commercially available a set of second generation of functionally-validated genome-wide human and mouse 65K pooled shRNA lentiviral libraries with improved performance and optimized design for cost-effective genetic screens. As a confirmation tool, we will develop protocols for high-throughput in-vitro and ex-vivo validation of drug target candidates identified in the screen with pooled shRNA sublibraries. From a bioinformatics viewpoint, we will make software tools for integration of RNAi screening data with transcriptome profiling and molecular network information mined from scientific literature. The proposed functional genomics platform will be applied and validated for the discovery of novel cancer therapeutic targets in a unique collection of isogenic human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) lines, comprising the most common breast cancer genetic alterations. As a result of these studies we will reconstruct synthetic lethality pathways and make publicly available breast cancer knowledge database.

As a result, we foresee that these toolsets will significantly improve the efficiency, economy and ease of elucidating and modeling disease-specific signal transduction networks and provide basic researchers with preferred, cost-effective alternatives to existing commercially available reagents and software. The proposed RNAi screening and bioinformatics strategies harbor considerable potential to systematically identify new anti-cancer targets for therapeutic intervention and to facilitate the development of highly specific drugs, biomarkers and novel therapeutic concepts.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The studies from our Phase I SBIR (AI082728-01) demonstrated that it is feasible to develop the proposed assay, a biochemiluminescence assay that uses a novel flu virus neuraminidase substrate, for sensitive detection of influenza virus drug resistance.  The assay is now being used by a federal agency for monitoring influenza virus drug resistance during the on-going swine flu pandemic. The goal of this Phase II project is to convert the surveillance test into a drug resistance test suitable for point-of-care (POC) use (e.g., in physician's offices), i.e., a test kit that is rapid (lt 15  min for sample collection to results), simple, sensitive, specific, economic, and easy-to-use.  The POC drug resistance test will also have a secondary claim for influenza diagnosis.  Thus, the test is a combo test with both flu diagnosis and drug resistance detection functions.  Phase II activities include GMP manufacturing, preclinical and clinical studies. The data from the Phase II studies will be submitted to the FDA for clearance of the POC test for both the influenza diagnosis and flu drug resistance detection claims.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Widespread resistance of seasonal influenza H1N1 to Tamiflu, the most commonly used and stockpiled drug, raises serious issue about the effectiveness of Tamiflu stockpiled for pandemic influenza, and posts a challenge for physicians who treat influenza patients. A rapid and sensitive POC flu drug resistance test would promote rational use of the drug, thereby prolonging the effectiveness of a drug, and aid the physicians in making a better prescription decision. There is no such a test available. The primary objective of the proposed Phase II studies is to build on our Phase I efforts and develop a drug resistance test that is suitable for point-of-care use.",

Chemicals like AOs that have EA or Anti-EA (EA**) produce adverse health effects, including reproductive and behavioral disorders and some cancers. AOs have not been examined for EA**, much less AO packages reformulated to have specific levels of EA for specific commercial applications. This project will assess the EA** of 10 additional organic AOs, and 15 EA-**Free/EA**-specified formulations made from combinations of conventional, organic, water-soluble, and oil-soluble AOs that are stable when exposed to common-use stresses. These AO formulations will be used by identified partners to produce animal feeds, cereals and other foodstuffs that are EA**-free or have well-specified levels of EA** providing a clear path to commercialization and additional patents.\nThe broader impacts of this research are that fetal or juvenile mammals, including humans, are especially sensitive to chemicals having EA** at very low dosages and should not indiscriminately ingest such chemicals. Conversely, other conditions (e.g., menopausal symptoms, some cancers or abnormalities of the prostate) are ameliorated by chemicals having controlled levels of EA**. Hence, this project will minimize the risks of unintentional consumption of chemicals having EA** by using EA**-free AOs in products such as cereals and baby formulas or specified-EA** AOs in products such as fitness drinks and dietary supplements for post-menopausal women.",

The current incomplete understanding of TBI mechanisms limits the development of protection and therapeutic measures. Animal testing, in vitro study, and analysis of clinical data, while useful and necessary, are slow, expensive, and often inconclusive. Anatomy and physiology based mathematical modeling tools of small animal blast brain injury will provide complementary capabilities to better understand blast wave brain injury mechanisms, assess and improve protective armor, and speed development of better treatment protocols. The overall project objective is to develop and validate high-fidelity and reduced order multiscale modeling tools for the analysis of blast wave primary TBI mechanisms in animal models. In Phase I we developed a Virtual Rat anatomical model which was further advanced by generation of a Geometry/Mesh Virtual Rat model. We performed CoBi model validation using WRAIR shock tube data for the whole body rat front and side and the rat brain in direct impact and blast.  We developed a rat phantom for use in Phase II. In Phase II we will develop virtual mouse and pig models and databases for high-fidelity and multiscale modeling of blast wave TBI (BW-TBI).  We will adapt the CoBi tools for multiscale modeling of coupled biomechanics-physiology-neurobiology events during BW-TBI.  The model will be validated using physical phantom and animal test data. We will conduct parametric simulations to understand injury mechanisms and thresholds, demonstrate rat-pig-human injury scaling, and explore methods of TBI protection.",

Thick piezoelectric film technology is very attractive for the fabrication of thin piezoelectric element in high-frequency ultrasonic medical imaging applications.  However, it is challenging to process high-quality piezoelectric film with thickness in the range of 10-20 micrometers.  In addition, the film needs to demonstrate dielectric constant of 3000 or higher due to the need of electric matching in fabricating array transducers.  In previous Phase I project, a piezoelectric thick film with dielectric constant higher than 3000 was demonstrated.  In this Phase II project, the high-K thick film will be utilized to develop miniature high frequency single element and linear array transducers for Intravascular Ultrasonic (IVUS) imaging applications. \nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide high-K thick film to enable the application of miniature high-frequency ultrasonic transducers.  IVUS is a medical imaging methodology using a specially designed catheter with a miniaturized ultrasound probe attached to the distal end of the catheter, which is inserted into the heart or into a coronary vessel for visualizing the vessel and heart structure.  This project is expected to further miniaturize the ultrasonic transducer mounted on the catheter and provide improved resolution.  With this anticipated catheter, surgeons may view the arteries of patients more clearly and spend less surgery time.  Plus, the smaller size will make the procedure less invasive.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Today, arsenic (As) poisoning is one of the major environmental threats worldwide as millions of human beings have been exposed to excessive arsenic through contaminated drinking water. The serious toxicity of arsenic has been well documented. Worldwide, communities demand novel separation technologies for the removal of arsenic from drinking water. Conventional adsorbent technologies currently in use for remediation of metal-contaminated water have various limitations in terms of capacity, selectivity and robustness. The development of an innovative arsenic removal technology for drinking water based on a new class of fiber-based adsorbent is proposed in this SBIR program. In the Phase I program, the technical and economic feasibility of using a new class of arsenic selective ligand-anchored fiber for purification of drinking water was demonstrated. In this Phase II program, the fiber adsorbent will be further developed as the basis for an innovative arsenic removal technology for drinking water with higher capacity, good selectivity, and enhanced robustness compared to conventional technologies such as ion exchange, activated alumina, and others. The goals for this Phase II program will be achieved through the following Specific Aims: 1) Optimize functionalized fiber adsorbent for arsenic removal, 2) Elucidate mechanism of arsenic binding to functionalized ACF adsorbent 3) Perform large-scale production of functionalized fiber adsorbent, 4) Construct functionalized fiber adsorbent module and test operating efficacy, 5) Construct and evaluate pilot-scale functionalized fiber adsorbent module, 6) Summarize Phase II work, and evaluate process. This project will explore a novel technology that can be applied to the remediation of drinking water, water for medical use, such as dialysis, and groundwater contaminated by arsenic, and that can be sized to specific needs, from a hand-held pump to an industrial-sized filter capable of purifying thousands of gallons of water per day.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Arsenic (As) is identified as the number one most hazardous substance on the 2001 CERCLA Priority List of Hazardous Substances (ATSDR 2001).Today, arsenic poisoning is one of the major environmental threats worldwide as millions of human beings have been exposed to excessive As through contaminated drinking water.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is an important risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). HDL cholesterol levels are predictive of major cardiovascular events in patients treated with statins. This relationship was also observed among patients with LDL cholesterol levels below 70 mg per deciliter. Studies have demonstrated that polynucleotides, such as DNA and RNA, can be delivered to cells producing cellular changes that can be therapeutic. In order to successfully achieve gene therapy, it is essential that the genetic materials work in conjunction with an effective delivery vehicle to provide localized therapy. DNA coded to express a whole or partial protein can be delivered either directly to the organism, in situ, or indirectly by transfer to a cell that is then transplanted into the organism. SonoGene Corporation is researching the non-viral transfection of mammals as a means of gene therapy. It is proposed to develop a method for targeting the transfection of DNA plasmid to the liver to enhance apoA-I expression. The request for this grant is to support research in developing a suitable non-invasive route to induce apoA-I gene expression in the liver for the purpose of favorably altering cholesterol metabolism. We propose to inject naked plasmid apoA-I DNA into the blood utilizing microspheres or microbubbles as a delivery vehicle. The capillary endothelial cells in the liver are fenestrated and permit enhanced uptake of plasmids into liver cells. The liver is then treated with ultrasound waves that disrupt the microspheres and cause transient porosity of liver endothelial cells, allowing for the uptake and expression of plasmid DNA by the liver.

Low HDL cholesterol levels are predictive of major cardiovascular events in patients.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  An unmet need in the area of cytotoxic therapy for human cancer is the development of an agent that is highly effective, yet is relatively safe with respect to side effects. The use of most chemotherapeutic drugs in human cancer treatment is accompanied by a variety of side effects including hair loss, corrugated and twisted nail formation and hemorrhage of the mucosa of the alimentary canal. The attractive aspects of DHA-SBT-1214 are its ability to target tumor cells then, once absorbed, release the cytotoxic taxoid moiety where it will do the most damage. This is the innovative aspect of this drug development program. Such a drug should readily find a place in the armamentarium of anti-tumor drug substances. With minimal side effects, it should also lend itself commercially to combination therapy in conjunction with an anti-tumor enzyme regulator, as is becoming the common practice in modern cancer treatment. Chem-Master's mission is to develop DHA-SB-T-1214 as efficacious and safer drug for cancer chemotherapy, especially against tumors that cannot effectively be treated by Taxol(R), docetaxel, Taxoprexin(R), and other commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs. In the SBIR Phase I study, we have made significant progress toward this goal. We have confirmed that the chemical synthesis of DHA-SBT-1214 with high purity is feasible at 10 g scale based on the proposed synthetic route. We have also confirmed the remarkable efficacy of DHA- SBT-1214 against pancreatic cancer (CFPAC-1) and non-small cell lung cancer (H460) xenografts in SCID mice models in addition to highly drug-resistant (Pgp+) colon cancer (DLD-1) xenograft as well as significant activity against another highly drug-resistant (Pgp+) breast cancer (LCC6-MDR) xenograft, wherein Taxol(R) and Taxoprexin(R) showed very limited activity or totally inactive. The project proposed in this Phase II application is designed to advance our studies on DHA-SBT-1214 to treat a variety of human tumors principally associated with colon, breast, lung and pancreatic cancers as well as to perform pre-clinical toxicology studies required for IDN filing and approval. Thus, the key technical objectives in the Phase II studies are (i) further expansion of the current studies to cancer cell lines that are more refractory to other cytotoxic agents and/or to faster growing tumors; (ii) Pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) studies including half-life, distribution, metabolism and maximum tolerated dose, as well as all other pre-clinical toxicology studies necessary for IND filing; (iii) optimization of the preparative methods in 200 g scale for the reliable production of DHA-SBT-1214 in GMP and the development of validation methods for the various intermediates in the synthetic sequence.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed project is of great relevance to human health. Currently there are no really effective drug substances that can abolish or even partially inhibit the growth of human colon cancer because this particular form of cancer over-expresses the MDR phenotype. Remarkably DHA-SBT-1214, an omega-3 fatty acid- taxoid conjugate, can penetrate these cancer cells selectively and by-pass the MDR apparatus, thereafter inducing cell death. The further development of DHA-SBT-1214 as a possible treatment for colon, pancreatic, lung, breast and other forms of cancer could scarcely be more relevant in a society where many forms of this multi-variate and largely untreatable disease, seem to be increasing.",

This system will be a microarray-based bioassay platform that specifically captures distinct cell types and soluble macromolecules from a patient's blood sample onto spatially separate regions on a biosensor chip. Initial capture of macromolecules and cells can be quantified to assess the presence of specific subpopulations of leukocytes, cytokines, antibodies and other immunologically relevant molecules. Subsequent culture of the captured cells under different conditions can be used to measure the production of specific cell products in real time to assess immune cell functional capacities. The technology allows for highly parallel measurements that result in the capability to perform hundreds of individual functional cellular assays simultaneously without the use of molecular labels. The system will enable assessment of patients' immune capacity in near-real time using microliter-scaled samples of blood readily harvested with minimally invasive procedures (e.g., fingerstick capillary blood sampling). Such real-time measurements will be crucial for the ongoing monitoring of disease progression as well as the evaluation of prophylactic treatments and therapeutic manipulations that sustain and support immune mechanisms.

Central apneas and periodic breathing are the classic polysomnographic markers of strong chemoreflex mediation of sleep apnea. Recently, another variation called  complex sleep apnea  has been described, which is characterized by sustained induction of central apneas or severe periodic breathing during positive pressure titration for what seems to be an obstructive disease on the diagnostic polysomnogram.

        "abstract": "Plant virus infections cause tremendous economic losses in agricultural production each year in the U.S. Potential introduction of foreign pathogens which could threaten the safety of American agriculture has accelerated in recent years because of increasing international seed and plant trade. The first line of defense against such devastating viral diseases is the early and sensitive detection of the viruses before they are introduced into the U.S, or once in the U.S. before it has become widespread. Since there is no effective method to cure plant of virus diseases, eradication of introduced virus inoculum sources through early detection may prevent the harmful pathogens from further spreading into existing and newly planted crops, and thus reducing production costs and environmental impacts of introduced viruses. It has long been a challenging task to develop timely and accurate diagnostic tests for diseases caused by viruses or virus-like agents in plants in agriculture production. Traditional methods for detecting plant pathogenic viruses include biological assay on indicator plants, serological tests such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immuno-strips, and electron microscopy. Biological indexing assays are time-consuming taking weeks or even months to complete. Serological tests may not provide the sensitivity that is needed to detect low concentrations of viruses in seeds and plant tissues. Modern technologies such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) provide very sensitive diagnostic assays for plant virus detection. However, these molecular techniques require lab-intensive and expensive procedures of pre-sample extraction and post-PCR detection, which make it very difficult or infeasible to test large numbers of samples. By combining two widely used virus detection methods, ELISA and RT-PCR, Immunocapture Real-time RT-PCR is proposed for the detection of plant viruses in this SBIR project. The advantages of this assay system over conventional RT-PCR include eliminating pre- and post-PCR manipulations, improving sensitivity, reducing risks from contamination, and shortening the time needed for an accurate disease diagnosis. Savings on labor and materials in sample preparation significantly reduces the total cost for each test. This immunocapture Real-time RT-PCR assay will provide one of the most sensitive diagnostic tools for detection of plant viruses in many economically important crops. Sensitive, reliable and user-friendly commercial products will be developed based on this technology. It allows us to perform an entire assay in a single PCR reaction tube within a relatively short time. This cost-effective diagnostic system will be of benefit to research scientists, inspectors, growers and diagnosticians, and thus, improve crop protection, increase production efficiency and increase environmental benefits. Therefore, it will directly enhance protection and safety of the nation's agriculture and food supply, and also indirectly enhance international competitiveness of American agriculture and protect the nation's natural resource base and environment.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  An adequate medical response to the threat of pandemic influenza includes surveillance and isolation, a sufficient supply of effective antiviral drugs, and rapid development of a protective vaccine. Under optimal circumstances, production of enough vaccine to protect the US population would take 6 months. A lag time of 6 months between identification of a pandemic strain and an adequate supply of vaccine could result in devastating morbidity, mortality, and economic loss. A dose-sparing adjuvant that enabled a limited supply of vaccine to protect more people would diminish this problem.    We have identified a small lipophilic molecule that can penetrate the intact stratum corneum and activate the dendritic cells (DC) in normal mouse skin. It enables resident DC to process adjuvant-free antigens injected into the skin and causes the DC to mature and migrate to the draining lymph node where they activate naove T cells. The speed with which this topical adjuvant increases protective antibody responses, its low cost, and physical independence of the vaccine antigen, suggest that it might be an ideal adjuvant for enhancing the protection afforded by a limiting supply of influenza vaccine.    The aims of this Phase II application are to: 1) define the mechanism of action of this adjuvant; 2) determine the efficacy and optimize its use as a topical adjuvant for an influenza vaccine in miniature pigs as a model for human skin; 3) employ assays of transdermal transport across human skin ex vivo to optimize the conditions for its use as a topical adjuvant; and 4) perform pilot pre-clinical toxicity assays on this adjuvant.     If our efforts are successful, the product will be an inexpensive small molecule, applied to the skin over a vaccine injection site that will make vaccines more effective.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The best public health response to pandemic influenza is an effective vaccine, but with current vaccine manufacturing capabilities it could take years to produce enough vaccine to protect the US population. We need vaccine additives that can extend the effective dose of a vaccine to cover more people.  That is the goal of the proposed research.",

        "abstract": "The conventional process for making dry tetrahydrofuran is very energy intensive because of the need for azeotropic distillation. Substituting distillation by membrane drying can reduce the energy consumption for heating by a factor of 50. A membrane based process for purifying tetrahydrofuran with 98% less energy consumption than with a conventional azeotropic distillation process has been demonstrated. In addition, the use of a super acid catalyst that is at least seven times more efficient in driving the butanediol to tetrahydrofuran reaction than mineral acid catalysts was proven. These catalytic groups can be attached to the membrane. Therefore the membrane reactor catalyst is not corrosive and there is no need for additional processes to separate it from the reactants or products. Feasibility was shown for all key aspects of the Phase I program. Enhanced performance based on identifying and developing a whole new family of custom perfluoropolymers for both enhancing tetrahydrofuran synthesis and more broadly addressing key membrane needs of the Department of Energy has been demonstrated. Optimize and scale up the membrane catalyst and fabrication of pilot-scale membrane modules will be completed. Pilot tests will demonstrate module performance, ruggedness and durability. The modules will also be tested and demonstrated in the field in partnership with a pharmaceutical company that uses tetrahydrofuran as a solvent. Detailed engineering/economic analysis will demonstrate very significant savings in energy, operating and capital costs of the catalytic membrane process for making and purifying tetrahydrofuran over the conventional system using mineral acid catalysts and isotropic distillation.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Besides tetrahydrofuran, there are many organic chemicals that require acid catalysts for its manufacture. Hence, this is a platform technology. Its success will have a significant impact related to major energy savings in industrial processes using new membrane processes to dewater organic chemicals like tetrahydrofuran and acid catalysts needed to drive reactions that produce water, e.g., butanediol to tetrahydrofuran+water. Specific program focus will be on the reduction of costs for making high purity organic chemicals. Estimated payback time is less than 1 year.",

        "abstract": "There continues to be a need for production of fuel-grade ethanol from renewable sources. Ethanol from agricultural sources has many advantages including development of fuel independence.  While there continues to be a significant need for ethanol, the cost of agricultural based ethanol is quite severe although existing and new legislation provides significant incentives for its use. This program addresses novel routes to enhance the low-cost production by means of a novel water-ethanol separation membrane and process.  The proposed membrane process for small plants should be of great value in increasing capacity and/or reducing energy consumption for ethanol plants. Membrane processes are ideal for small applications.  Existing biomass-to-ethanol plants are at 40 million gallons per year or greater and very few are at 10 million gallons per year.  A membrane process would be the most advantageous route for operation of small scale plants.  Membrane processes are ideal at removing the minor component.  A membrane that preferentially removes water would be ideal for final drying of highly concentrated streams such as 60-90% ethanol.  The membrane and system ability to economically dry bioethanol in both existing and new bioethanol plants was demonstrated. Savings for existing plants was projected at $0.22/gal and $0.08/gal for a greenfield plant.  This program demonstrates broad value for the membrane platform to be responsive to DOE",

        "abstract": "Bio-oil is a liquid fuel made from biomass such as wood chips and low grade wood byproducts by fast pyrolysis process.  Presence of carboxylic acids in raw-bio-oil makes the bio-oil very acidic and corrosive.  Raw bio-oil has low heating value primarily because of its high water content (up to 35 %).  Oligomerization aldehydes and other compounds with an unsaturated carbon bond in raw bio-oil results in increased viscosity with aging/storage.  To summarize, quality and stability of raw bio-oil has to be improved in order to use bio-oil as a fuel in engines, gas turbines and boilers, and as a refinery feedstock to produce transport fuel.  A membrane separation process will be developed to remove all the undesirable compounds, water, carboxylic acids and aldehydes from bio-oil to substantially improve its quality and stability. Economics of this novel membrane separation process will be superior to the alternative bio-oil treatment technologies.  Novel membranes were developed to remove undesirable compounds from raw bio-oil.  By removing undesirable compounds, water, carboxylic acids and aldehydes, from bi-oil, its stability and quality was improved substantially.  The novel membrane separating process is highly economical and its payback time was estimated at less than a month.  Membrane and membrane separation process will be first optimized to enhance its separation performance.  Then, a prototype device will be built to perform the long-term stability studies and field evaluation.  Based on these results, engineering and economic analysis of the membrane separation system will be carried out for bio-oil treatment.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Bio-oil is renewable, sustainable, and environmentally benign. Bio-oil upgraded in quality and stability could ultimately reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop and demonstrate flame-resistant, polymer-composite materials based on novel benzoxazine resin chemistries. In the Phase I project, low-viscosity benzoxazine resins were synthesized and composite formulations prepared that exhibit suitable processing characteristics for use in composite manufacture, as well as good mechanical strength and flame resistance.  These successes were achieved through the development of polymer synthesis techniques, and validated by the subsequent fabrication and testing of continuous fiber-reinforced composites.  For example, the Phase I results showed that these new polymer formulations offer significantly reduced processing temperatures, which simplifies composite manufacturing processes and reduces tooling costs.  In addition, the fiber-reinforced composites produced using these materials exhibited 15-20% higher tensile strengths and 50% higher toughness values as compared to composites fabricated using the as-synthesized (i.e., not toughened) material. This finding is important and shows that composites with strengths comparable to those of epoxy-based systems, but with superior flame resistance, can be achieved with these new materials. \nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will initially be in the electronics and aerospace markets. Flame-resistant polymers and composites are becoming increasingly important systems in both of these industries. In each case, the use of fire-resistant materials offers enhanced public safety, while also improving the overall performance of the systems in which they are used. The value of high-strength flame-resistant materials is perhaps most evident in the civil aviation industry.  In this instance, the transition to composite materials offers a significant weight savings, with reductions in weight accounting for a large percentage of recent improvements in aircraft fuel efficiency, while also enhancing the flame resistance of aircraft structures.  In addition, the use of advanced materials is expected to increase steadily in electronics applications over the next 10 years, and the further development and commercialization of benzoxazine resins will provide the users of this technology with enhancements in both fire safety and system-level performance.",

Frequency-doubling crystals, such as Mg:LiNbO3 can convert 1064-nm light from an infrared laser to 532-nm (green) light. However, LiNbO3 crystals made by the conventional Czochralski technique typically cost $800 each, presenting an economic challenge for consumer applications. The approach is to grow crystals by the laser heated pedestal growth method with a novel afterheater and to pole them in situ. Phase II, enables the development of manufacturing capability for these crystals at a rate of 100,000 crystals per year at a cost of less than $22 each. In Phase III, The manufacturing capacity will be increased to 1,000,000 crystals per year and the manufacturing costs reduced below $8. The proposed cost reduction will enable manufacturers of picoprojectors to increase the brightness of their products by integrating lasers as the light sources instead of LEDs. The technical objectives are to optimize the density of Mg:LiNbO3 ceramic feedstock rods, to increase the manufacturing throughput by optimizing manufacturing yield and automating the growth apparatus. \nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enhance scientific and technical understanding by demonstrating a) a novel method of growing crystals with lower cost, higher speeds, and greater purity, and b) a way to pole LiNbO3 crystals in situ at lower cost. The project will generate a strong economic impact because many types of handheld consumer electronics devices (cell phones, PDAs, iPods, game terminals, etc.) contain digital data that require visual displays. Picoprojectors can display the content of handheld devices in large formats, but their LED illumination sources can?t generate images with enough brightness to satisfy customers. Laser illumination sources can solve the brightness problem, but lasers are too expensive, primarily because of the cost of the frequency doubling crystals.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in computational hardware and molecular modeling techniques have revolutionized our ability to simulate electrostatic interactions, which play a fundamental role in the conformational stability, structure, folding and function of biomolecules. One important near-term application of these developments drawing both theoretical and commercial interests is drug design where successful docking requires both shape and electrostatic complementarity. Currently, the continuum electrostatic description based upon the Poisson- Boltzmann Equation (PBE) offers the best combination of modeling fidelity and computational cost, however, numerical issues associated with nonlinear behavior in highly charged systems and solution convergence at the dielectric interface, have impaired accuracy and calculation time. As a result, adoption of PBE-based solvers in energy minimization, Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics codes has been limited.  In Phase I, the numerical stability of the electrostatic solution, particularly the gradient contributions from the surface, were successfully addressed using a boundary-conforming mesh so that reliably convergent and accurate force predictions are achieved. The challenge of reliable convergence for highly charged systems was also resolved. These advances were implemented on an adaptive Cartesian mesh structure that offers unique intrinsic advantages over competing grid arrangements (i.e. lattices and unstructured tetrahedral grids) with regard to multigrid implementation, mesh generation and solution adaptation. The Phase II effort builds upon these successes by providing additional capabilities focused on drug design and packaged to facilitate transition and distribution of the software tools to end-users in the medical and pharmaceutical industries. The main technical developments envisioned to support this goal are: (i) Methods will be formulated and implemented to calculate the electrostatic interaction or binding potential and energy with greater accuracy and/or speed, thus promoting higher reliability and throughput in drug screening and design efforts. (ii) Short- range forces will be incorporated to model molecular flexibility thus providing a more complete description of the molecular dynamics for drug design application and understanding of biologicial function. (iii) New methods for evaluating metrics to assess docking probability and reject decoys will be developed along with an efficient formulation for estimating the gradients/sensitivities of these metrics. In the context of drug design these gradients would indicate changes to the drug geometry and charge distribution favorable for selective binding. Our biomolecular applications will build upon strengths of our current state-of-the-art PBE solver in providing accurate and fast predictions of electrostatic solvation free energies, binding free energies, surface electrostatic potential and derived quantitative metrics for highly charged and large-scale systems such as nucleic acids and its assemblies such as nucleosome and ribosome.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research effort will develop and provide software tools and analysis and visualization techniques that: (i) are tailored towards improved protein and drug design and (ii) can be used to relate biological function of solvated biomolecules to its geometric, structural and electrostatic properties. For drug applications, the analysis will provide designers with the information needed to enhance drug affinity and specificity, ensuring it binds to target sites and rejects decoy locations, thus, ultimately, lowering drug development costs and times, and improving drug efficacy with reduced side-effects. Improved insights into the relationship between the physiochemical and geometric properties of biomolecules and their environment to biological function are useful for enhancing bioinformatics tools and achieving a better foundational understanding of the progression of diseases at the molecular level and the means to counter them.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The majority of obstetric deliveries in the US undergo continuous electronic uterine activity monitoring. Typically, an external tocodynamometer (strain gauge) is employed to provide the frequency and timing of uterine contractions. In some patients, particularly the obese, the monitor fails to detect contractions consistently. In others the monitor requires frequent repositioning by the nursing staff. The only available alternative is an invasive intrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC), with its associated increased risk of infection. The obstetric suite is subject to the obesity pandemic in the US, and these women have an increased risk for labor problems, infections and other complications. The specific goal of the proposed research is to develop a reliable, non-invasive uterine activity monitor that is unaffected by obesity and requires less nursing intervention than the tocodynamometer. The end-product will be a  Smart EHG Cable , called the eToco that converts the electrical activity of the uterus (electrohysterogram or EHG) into uterine activity signals compatible with existing monitors. The eToco system will plug into the toco or IUP port of existing monitors and provide more robust and reliable contraction curves with less nursing intervention required and improved patient comfort. Phase I results indicate that the EHG can provide such a monitor with a simple four electrode array. The electrode array will be a single mesh with an adhesive backing for ease of placement. This project proposes the following specific aims: Aim 1: Build production-equivalent prototype toco-replacement EHG hardware, software, and electrode mesh - An electrode mesh/array will be designed and prototyped based on the optimal positioning found in Phase I. In addition, production-equivalent hardware and embedded software for the eToco system will be designed and built. To support FDA clearance, a quality system will be initiated during product design. Aim 2: Clinically evaluate the mesh EHG uterine activity monitor -All data will be collected to the standards of the FDA Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and will be sufficient to provide statistical significance. The clinical study is in two parts: the first will evaluate the system in 130 patients versus the toco and IUP and the second part will evaluate the interpretation of skilled clinicians on the three signals to ensure similarity. Aim 3: Preparation for submission of FDA 510(k) for toco-replacement system - all necessary quality control systems will be implemented during this project. In addition, the 510(k) submission will be prepared. Aim 4: Initial testing of an acoustic sensor for fetal heart rate monitoring - The next generation product will include a more reliable replacement for the ultrasound FHR sensor. A prototype acoustic sensor will be tested as a novel method for non-invasive monitoring of the fetal heart rate.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The current method of non-invasive monitoring of uterine activity fails frequently, particularly in the obese patient. When this occurs, often clinicians must use an invasive intra- uterine pressure catheter that is particularly problematic in these patients since they are already at increased risk for infections. The development of an alternative, inexpensive sensor replacement technology that allows for existing monitors to non-invasively monitor uterine activity will improve diagnostic data, reduce required nursing interventions, and reduce infectious complications by limiting the need for invasive monitoring.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will create a first Real-time Economic Sampling (RES) system for quality intensive high-tech manufacturing. Focusing initially on semiconductor manufacturing, the system will allow defect inspection sampling to be optimized and adjusted many times per day across all process tools, steps, and products. This minimizes, among other things, a manufacturer's economic risk of producing bad products by adaptively focusing sampling where it gives the greatest return. The complexity of the underlying interdisciplinary models have hindered the realization of RES. Recent advancements by the applicants showed feasibility that this research will build on. There are three main research categories, 1) Risk & Optimization, 2) Cycle-Time, and 3) Yield Modeling. Categories 1 & 2 build on Phase I feasibility results where fast, yet accurate, approximations of complex factory models were established. Risk & Optimization modeling will introduce near-term risk due to factory floor events into traditional (long-run average) risk models. Cycle-time research will refine the approximations for queues with heterogeneous servers. Yield modeling will introduce novel real-time yield approximations needed for RES. The included implementation tasks will then create the first factory-ready RES system that captures the necessary intricacies of semiconductor manufacturing.\nThe proposed RES system is a \"Green Manufacturing\" enabler that creates a new market as it will be the first to recoup inefficiencies present in many process control operations. The initial focus is on semiconductor manufacturers who are limited by time-consuming off-line analysis, rigid sampling rules, and risky ad-hoc sampling adjustments. Meanwhile valuable products are being wasted due to out-of-control incidents and/or under-utilized inspection capacity. The proposed system can change this.  An RES system belongs to a fast growing segment of the semiconductor industry: process control.  Other markets can also be pursued and a societal impact due to reduced waste can become widespread.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research indicates that fewer than half of all patients with elevated low density lipoprotein-Cholesterol (LDL-C) advised to make life style changes and to take HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitors (i.e. statins) continue to follow the prescribed regimens. This non-adherence results in more cardiovascular events, decreased length and quality of life, and millions of dollars more in health care costs each year. The practical challenge is to develop adherence interventions without increasing demands on already overburdened health care providers and systems. The proposed project will integrate validated behavioral science with interactive technology to develop a highly-scalable solution-The Interactive Cholesterol Advisory Tool (ICAT)-designed to increase the initiation and maintenance of medication adherence and therapeutic lifestyle change in patients at risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) by increasing their autonomous self-regulation and perceived competence. To achieve this, the ICAT will use highly engaging and personalized multimedia technology, capitalizing on the scientifically validated, self-determination-theory (SDT) health behavior model (SDT; Deci and Ryan, 1985, 2000; Patrick, Williams et al., 2008). Specifically, the ICAT will be a virtual environment in which the patient will have a  conversation  with a virtual health care provider (the  ICAT avatar ) that will respond meaningfully to patient input and assist in developing an effective care plan based upon clinical guidelines. The ICAT therefore represents significant innovation in integrating a validated model for behavior change into a highly scalable, effective, and efficient technology tool for sustaining coronary health in a broad population. During Phase I of the proposed project, a prototype of the ICAT will be developed to deliver SDTintervention content and to customize responses based upon user input. Usability testing will be conducted at two different points during development to assess both (1) the accurate technical functioning of the ICAT and (2) the ease of use and general perception of the ICAT by users. Following successful achievement of Phase I milestones, during Phase II of the proposed project the ICAT will be fully developed to deliver a complete SDT-based intervention for use in a randomized clinical trial. One hundred (100) participants at moderate or high risk for a CV event within 10 years will compare the effects of a prescriber-plus-ICAT group (n = 50) to a prescriber-standard-care group (n = 50) on (a) reducing levels of LDL-C (primary outcome), and (b) increasing initiation and long-term adherence to statin medications, as measured using Medical Events Monitoring System CAPS (or Memscaps(tm)). Groups will then be compared on two primary dependent measures: (1) improvement in LDL-C and (2) medication adherence. The underlying hypothesis is that the prescriber-plus-ICAT group will (1) have greater improvement in LDL-C and (2) demonstrate greater medication adherence. Upon demonstration of the ICAT's efficacy in a clinical trial, there are numerous segments of the health care market for which the product will have commercial value, given its ability to reach large populations effectively and efficiently. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Fewer than half of all patients with elevated low density lipoprotein-Cholesterol (or  bad  cholesterol: LDL-C) who are advised to make life style changes and to take statin medications continue to follow the prescribed     regimen, resulting in more heart attacks, strokes and deaths and increased health care costs. This project will develop an innovative interactive technology, called the Interactive Cholesterol Advisory Tool (ICAT), which is designed to enhance patients' motivation regarding lifestyle change and taking medications for those who are at risk. The value of this tool is that it can reach a broad population of people who are at risk and play a role in sustaining their health and their quality of life.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 54,000 Americans are diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma each year. The disease kills about 14,000 Americans each year and has the highest mortality rate of all urologic cancers (about twice the mortality rate of prostate and bladder cancer). In the past, treatment of renal cell carcinoma required surgical removal of the entire affected kidney leaving the patient at life-long risk for developing renal insufficiency or complete loss of renal function if their remaining kidney was compromised for any reason. Fortunately, recent advances in imaging have dramatically increased detection of small tumors that are amenable to local resection. As a result, surgical resection of only that portion of the kidney containing the tumor (partial nephrectomy) has become the preferred approach in many patients.  This transition to less aggressive surgery has been accompanied by increased reliance on minimally-invasive, laparoscopic surgery. However, laparoscopic kidney surgery is technically demanding, primarily due to difficulties in visualizing tumor margins and navigating around anatomic structures imposed by current laparoscopic tools. As a result, the rate of significant complications (including vascular injuries and failure to obtain clear surgical margins) remains higher in laparoscopic partial nephrectomy than in comparable open procedures.  The goal of this project is development of a system enabling renal surgeons to use methods previously developed for image-guided neurosurgery during laparoscopic resection of kidney lesions. These methods allow the margins of key anatomic structures (e.g., tumors, vessels, and ducts) to be superimposed onto the laparoscopic video images. During Phase I, we built a laparoscopic instrument capable of measuring the position and shape of the renal capsule during surgery. During Phase II, we will build a second-generation refined system and will evaluate the performance of the system in a series of animal experiments.  We have assembled a highly qualified team for this project. The lead Creare engineers have experience in the development of laparoscopic technology and development of novel medical imaging technology. Our team also includes prominent surgeons with expertise in laparoscopic surgery, and biomedical engineers who have been pioneers in the development of image-guided surgery.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is development of a new technology to assist surgical navigation as a means of reducing complication rates and improving the outcomes of laparoscopic kidney surgery. Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy is a commonly performed procedure that offers tremendous benefits to the patient. Unfortunately, the risk of serious complications in this laparoscopic procedure remains higher than in conventional open surgery.",

Conductive adhesives are typically used for low?]cost assembly, but these materials represent the weakest point in the thermal path. To address this issue, TLPS conductive adhesives form metallurgical bonds with the adherent metallization and can provide an order of magnitude or more improvement in thermal performance versus existing adhesive technologies. These low?]cost, lead-free materials are designed as drop?]in replacements for existing manufacturing processes. During this Phase II project, the focus will be the formulation, characterization, and qualification of lead-free TLPS adhesives for high-volume semiconductor device manufacturing.  The primary objective of this project will be the demonstration of an order of magnitude improvement in effective thermal conductivity compared to commercial conductive adhesives for electronics packaging.  Advanced characterization techniques, along with durability studies, will be instrumental for bringing these materials to a readiness level suitable for market penetration.  \nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of new semiconductor die-attach materials suitable for the low-cost packaging of high-power semiconductor devices.  A number of industries are aggressively developing innovative product lines centered on the concept of energy efficiency and higher performance; these include hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) in the automotive sector, high-brightness light emitting diodes (HBLEDs) in commercial lighting, and concentrator photovoltaics (CPVs) for utility-scale electricity.  Further, next-generation silicon devices, particularly those based on stacked-die architectures, also require improved conductive adhesives to fully enable their performance benefits.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II (SBIR) project will develop a novel biomedical device to better treat stress urinary incontinence (SUI).  SUI is a complex disease affecting millions of Americans in a debilitating manner which significantly impacts physiological and psychological wellness.  The technology being developed is an implantable device for the treatment of SUI that will, as intentioned, be the first product to offer a universal, and more effective, solution to this multi-factorial problem.  Building on the Phase I successful demonstration of technical feasibility, the main Phase II objective is to further refine and evaluate the device in preparation for future human trials.  If successful, the device will simply and mechanically provide a reactional dynamic therapy that more closely resembles natural physiology than any other incontinence device currently available.  This process will be empowered by focused research designed to analyze and better define the exact elements underlying the pathophysiology of SUI.  This research will not only lead to a broader acceptance and understanding of the complexity of SUI, in both men and women, but also enable the company to optimize its technology.  This project will be undertaken by the grantee in collaboration with leading urologists, engineers, and experienced entrepreneurs of the biomedical industry.  \nThe broader/commercial impact of this project is advancement in understanding, acceptance, and treatment of urinary incontinence.  Urinary incontinence is one of the most common chronic ailments; affecting over 25 million Americans and accounting for an extended yearly cost of more than $19.5 billion.  Additionally, this condition is a leading contributor to the loss of self-dependency and nursing home admittance.  If successful, the technology will address a critical societal need with a device that offers a cure to underserved patients rather than a palliative compromise.  The implications of this technology extend beyond urinary incontinence and should create opportunities to advance patient treatment for conditions such as fecal incontinence, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and glaucoma.",

RSNO's are a primary carrier and reservoir of NO in vivo and are a potential pre-symptom marker for hypertensive disorders, endothelial dysfunction, cardiovascular risk and inflammation. However, the clinical significance of endogenous RSNO levels cannot be fully realized as a vascular diagnostic tool or biomarker without a quick and convenient assay for RSNO's.

The complete Communic-Aid program contains a Caregiver Guidebook with supplemental audiovisual program (DVD), and a Family Activity Book. Communic- Aid will also include a Facilitator's Guide for healthcare staff to use when implementing Communic-Aid with families in a support group format. Caregivers of children with an LTI face many significant and important questions, including if, how, and when to talk to their child about their illness, upcoming treatment procedures, prognosis, or even impending death. Other concerns center around how to interact and communicate with their child's healthcare team to advocate most effectively for their child and their family. Research consistently shows that open and honest communication between family members about illness and death benefits the family of a child with LTI and improves the coping and quality of life of the dying child and his or her parents and siblings (Steele, 2002; Kreicbergs, Valdimarsdottir, Henter, and Steineck, 2004). Despite evidence supporting the benefits of open communication about the child's illness, death, and dying, very few resources exist to teach caregivers how to facilitate open and direct communication about the illness, death and dying within the family context, or to providers on how to best support this type of family communication. Communic-Aid will meet this need by supporting caregivers as they cope throughout the illness process and improving communication between caregivers and the health care team. During the Phase II project, Danya proposes to complete development of all product components, including the Family Activity Book, Audiovisual program, Facilitator's Guide, and the last 2 modules of the Caregiver Guidebook.

Once product development is complete, we will conduct a rigorous evaluation of the product components to see what effect, if any, Communic-Aid has on caregivers' willingness to use open communication techniques with the child, other family members, and the healthcare team as well as caregivers' self-efficacy in using these techniques. Providers will participate in a qualitative review of the Caregiver Guidebook to ensure that the materials are appropriate for and relevant to families and sensitive to cultural and religious diversity. The results of this evaluation will be used to make improvements to the product before        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Research consistently shows that open and honest communication between family members about illness and death benefits the family of a child with a life-threatening illness and improves the coping and quality of life of the dying child and his or her parents and siblings (Steele, 2002; Kreicbergs, Valdimarsdsttir, Onelvv, Henter, and Steineck, 2004). Despite this clear benefit to the child and family, there are currently no existing comprehensive programs to teach and support caregivers in facilitating open and direct communication about the illness, death and dying within the family context, or to teach providers how to best support this type of family communication. Communic-Aid will fill this unmet need in the pediatric hospice and palliative care field, and ultimately contribute to public health by improving the coping skills and quality of life for these children and their families.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) affects over 1 million US individuals a year and at present there are no preventative therapeutics other than direct percutaneous coronary intervention. DecImmune's long-term goal is to develop therapeutics to reduce the severe lethal reperfusion injury that follows removal of coronary artery blockage. This goal is based on our identification of a novel pathway that is activated by reperfusion of ischemic tissues and development of a peptide mimetope (N2) and monoclonal antibodies that block inflammation. The current proposal is a resubmission of an application that follows from our completion of the milestones of an earlier Phase I grant. The revised application addresses the concerns of the reviewers and includes substantial new results such as a more detailed and complete protocol and an increased number of pigs to enhance statistical power. Our earlier studies demonstrated that the novel pathway we identified in rodents is conserved in humans. Therefore, in order to move the potential therapeutics to clinical trials, we propose to extend our observations in a pig model. Given the high degree of physiological similarities with the human vascular system, pigs represent a good animal model. Successful achievement of the goals of the Phase II application will lead to testing of the therapeutics in Phase I clinical trials.

In spite of advances made in thrombolytic therapy and angioplasty, up to 25% of men and 38% of women die within one year following a heart attack. A significant factor in the high morbidity and mortality is due to the damage that is caused to the cardiac tissues by acute inflammation at the site of ischemia and reperfusion. The goal of this project is to develop a therapeutic compound that will inhibit the acute inflammation that occurs at the site of ischemia in patients following a myocardial infarction, minimizing the amount of microvascular damage and protecting viable cardiac cells in the infarct zone. Studies described in the application will extend our testing of the inhibitors to a swine model of acute myocardial infarction.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project investigates end-user programming for ensembles of robots. The project focuses on the development of an accessible end-user programming environment so that middle and high school students can create their own custom ensembles or blocks of robots and observe how the blocks' behavior affect an entire robot. Building powerful and correct intuitions about the behavior of complex systems is important for scientists and engineers, but with today's technologies it is difficult for children to acquire and integrate these ideas into their mindset. Through exploratory play with the proposed robotics construction kit, which embodies a distributed processing scheme for embedded microprocessors, children can build and observe complex systems acting in the real world. Although end-user programming environments exist for software systems, and even for a few robotics toys, no competing approach to end user programming tackles distributed processing for modular robotics. The project aims to build three experimental systems: a text-based environment, a visual programming language, and a 'cellular automata' interface. Testing with local middle school students will determine the benefits and drawbacks of each approach. \nThe broader/commercial objective of the project is to give children a vehicle to explore how complex global behaviors emerge from local effects. Designing and building complex systems exposes children to a variety of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) concepts. The programmed kit, without the end-user programming component proposed here, already introduces these important concepts. The addition of an intuitive, low-threshold, high-ceiling approach to reprogramming individual modules will add extensibility to this already powerful model of complexity. A commercial version of kit will be released in three phases: to science centers and children's museums initially, to a core community of technically savvy enthusiasts, and finally to the public through retail channels. Several science centers have expressed serious and persistent interest in acquiring initial versions of the kits and incorporating them into robotics education programs and exhibits. In addition to the project's primary objective, the design and testing of end-user programming for distributed embedded computing can inform other applications of this technology in the rapidly growing area of modular robotics.",

        "abstract": "We propose to create a discrimination engine for the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) based on the concept of manifold learning algorithms.  Manifold learning algorithms have come to prominence within the computer vision community as a type of feature extraction algorithm which does not require specific features to be learned a priori.  High dimensional sensor data is input to these algorithms which find a lower dimensional representation of the same data, illustrating differences between potential target types.  The algorithm can explore regions of the data space for which there are no feature extraction algorithms.  We propose to apply these algorithms to high resolution range profiles of target features and embed these results in a novel inference engine to create an on-line discrimination system.  Our team consists of staff who have contributed to the development of a prototype system based on these algorithms, as well as radar engineers who can build complex simulated data modeling real objects.

        "abstract": "In today's Urban-Warfare Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) environment, current sensor platforms have a limited operational capability due to power consumption and recharge times. Many times these sensor packages are found to be unsuitable for many battlefield environments due strictly to their endurance limitations. Much of the research done to date has concentrated on minimizing the size/power consumption of these sensor platforms (ground-based and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)) in order to minimize the battery power required to complete a mission.  There is now another possible solution, the development of a unique and innovative power system that will enable sensor platforms to provide long-endurance 24/7 operation to support non-traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (NTISR).  DRA is developing a power harvesting technique that utilizes existing overhead power lines to supply unlimited power to ground-based sensors platforms, as well as providing a self-refueling capability for a new class of UAS that will allow unlimited operational time with little to no \"return-to-base\" cycles required for refueling.  With this innovative approach, these new platforms will be able to perform C2ISR-type missions with virtually unlimited persistence.  BENEFIT:  Persistent ISR has been identified numerous times as an area of critical importance to the Department of Defense (DOD) and other organizations.  Development of sensor platforms that can supply extreme endurance through an autonomous recharging capability would be marketable to the DOD, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and to various commercial sectors.  These platforms could be used in urban warfare, law enforcement, security in remote areas, immigration control, power line/pipeline maintenance, as well as for many other applications.   The development of the Phase II prototypes will provide an opportunity to demonstrate representative power harvesting sensor platforms that are capable of performing NTISR for a nearly indefinite period of time in the field.  The engineering aspects and results will be transferable to a future phase of ground-based platform developments as well as UAS sensor system developments that contain fully autonomous power line sensing and landing capability.  Autonomous operation of a UAS sensor platform could be transitioned into many possible commercial sectors and military programs. A few of the commercial applications that would benefit from a sustained surveillance presence include border patrol, Agriculture, Merchant Marine & Shipping, Entertainment/News/Media applications, Railway/Pipeline/Power line monitoring, Commercial/business security, Aerial Surveying, and Search and Rescue Support.",

The proposed effort will retire risk in the following areas: survivability, energy extraction optimization, and power takeoff.The Centipod Project is transformational because it provides a viable method for delivering utility scale power supply heretofore not possible with wave energy, and it can be realized rapidly by its short development time. Its viability is based on its competitive LCOE and power quality, which will be attractive to utilities targeting RPS compliance with renewable energy. Up to five-day forecasting enables efficient resource planning for utilities. Resource utilization estimated at 160MW per square mile, among highest of renewables. The U.S.-based Centipod will also have excellent export markets, particularly Europe, where wave energy is actively being pursued. The impact of Centipod is enhanced energy self-sufficiency and a reduction in emissions.

Both in vitro and in vivo studies support the potential usefulness of BACPTDP in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The significant responses seen with BACPTDP in the human PANC-1 xenograft model vs. other CPT controls are reviewed in support for the pre-clinical studies proposed in this application. The specific objectives of this Phase II study will be to: 1. Synthesize 7-butyl-10-aminocamptothecin dipeptide (BACPTDP) in 10-20 g quantities - sufficient for  preclinical studies and formulation studies. 2. Conduct mouse and dog toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies. 3. Formulate the drug as a lyophilized powder. Document stability and potential clinical usefulness. 4. Develop and assay tissue/blood biomarkers as indicators for BACPTDP absorption and efficacy  (pharmacodynamics). 5. Prepare the IND for future Phase I studies. Upon completion of these studies an FDA IND submission will be made.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: BACPTDP is a novel camptothecins that was originally designed at Duke University to be used in the treatment of hypoxic, poorly vascularized tumors that possessed acidic environments. Studies conducted in the Phase I grant in pancreas, colon, ovarian and lung cancer xenograft models and reviewed herein, support our decision to move the product forward and ready it for clinical trials.

Two instrument technologies were developed during the Phase I effort: (a) an  Airshield  device that attaches to an endoscope to prevent fogging and fouling of the optics of the endoscope during periodontal surgery and (b) a rotary device for removing granulation tissue through the small surgical openings used for minimally invasive periodontal surgery.1, 2 This study will consist of safety studies for the two instruments and a clinical study that will measure the effectiveness of the surgical system when used during surgery on humans as well as measure the outcomes of the minimally invasive surgical procedures. The safety study will measure the possibility of the Airshield introducing air into the surgical tissue (referred to as tissue emphysema) and the possibility that the granulation tissue removing instrument might scratch or damage the tooth surface. The tissue emphysema study will be performed on slaughterhouse animal heads and the granulation tissue removing study will be performed on extracted human teeth. Both of these studies will be performed at the facilities of Dental Designs of Dallas. The human clinical study will be performed at the Periodontal Department of Baylor College of Dentistry. Minimally invasive regenerative surgery will be performed on thirty patients using the surgical system developed during Phase I. The long term outcomes and patient improvement resulting from the surgery will be analyzed. Many health benefits are associated with developing an easily used instrument system for performing periodontal regenerative surgery. MIS has been shown to result in less patient pain, faster healing, and improved long term health results.3, 4 Additionally, an easily used instrument system for MIS will increase access to care and reduce treatment costs by making it possible for non-specialist to perform MIS.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Phase II project entitled Instrument System and Technique for Minimally Invasive Periodontal Surgery (MIS), is aimed at creating a surgical instrument system that will facilitate the performance of very small incision periodontal surgery designed to re-grow tissue (bone, ligaments, gums, etc.) lost to periodontal disease. Small incision surgery in medicine, when compared to traditional invasive surgical techniques, has been shown to result in less pain, more rapid return to routine activities, and improved long term post surgical results. The use of minimally invasive periodontal surgery has been shown to have similar benefits and will likely result in these same patient and public health benefits for patients with periodontal disease.",

(DRW) aims to market a high-performance triplex rapid test (DRW HIV- Ab/HCV-Ab/HBsAg Triplex Rapid Test; DRW-HTRT), which can simultaneously detect for anti-HIV antibodies (HIV-Ab) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), anti-HIV antibodies for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis surface antigen (HBsAg) for hepatitis B virus (HBV). The test will be useful as a diagnostic test in the United States and Europe, and as a pre- and post-donation screening test in blood banks in developing countries especially those that process less than 10,000 donations per year and are located in regions of high prevalence for HBV, HCV and HIV. This simple and inexpensive but highly sensitive triplex rapid test was developed by DRW with funding from the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The project is a competing renewal application that proposes to conduct pre-clinical and clinical studies on the DRW-HTRT, with the ultimate aim of meeting the requirements for pre-market approval (PMA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Pre-clinical and clinical studies to evaluate test performance for HBsAg detection will be based on FDA's 1)  Review criteria for assessment of HBeAg and antibody to HBeAg in vitro diagnostic devices  (FDA 1991) for the performance evaluation on HBsAg detection; 2)  Guidance for Industry-Adequate and Appropriate Donor Screening Tests for Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) Assays Used to Test Donors of Whole Blood and Blood Components, Including Source Plasma and Source Leukocytes  (FDA 2007). For evaluating the test performance on HIV-Ab detection, we will follow FDA's draft guidance of  Points to Consider in the Manufacture and Clinical Evaluation of In Vitro Tests to Detect Antibodies  (FDA 1989). For evaluating the test performance on HCV-Ab detection, we will follow FDA's guidance - Guidance for Industry:  Lookback  for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV): Product Quarantine, Consignee Notification, Further Testing, Product Disposition, and Notification of Transfusion Recipients Based on Donor Test Results Indicating Infection with HCV (FDA 2007). Results of the pre-clinical studies will be presented to the FDA for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application that, when approved, will allow the DRW-HTRT to be used in clinical studies. The clinical studies aimed at a PMA submission to the FDA will be carried out at four sites in the U.S. and one site in Italy. Because of the usefulness of the DRW-HTRT for pre- and post-donation screening in resource-limited settings, additional evaluations will be conducted in Egypt, Guinea and Italy. FDA approval of the DRW-HTRT will not only pave the way for commercialization of the product in the U.S., but will also demonstrate the principle that tests used in developing countries should be of the same high quality as those used in developed countries.

Clinical studies of the DRW HIV-Ab/HCV-Ab/HBsAg Triplex Rapid Test (DRW-HTRT) will make FDA-PMA approval possible, and hence availability of the test to the US market, where it will be useful in settings where a rapid and immediate test result is needed, such as emergency rooms, in the battlefield, or for healthcare workers immediately after needle stick injury. The test will also be useful in developing countries where ensuring the safety of the blood supply requires the availability of cheap, effective assays that do not rely on sophisticated equipment.

Large Autostereoscopic Multiview 2D/3D Switchable Desktop Monitor Principal Investigator: Jesse Eichenlaub Topic 51: Scientific Visualization and Data Understanding, Subtopic a) Collaborative Data Analysis and Visualization.  Scientists and engineers must view increasingly complex computer generated multi- dimensional data sets and simulations based on those data sets, often in collaborative environments where several researchers at remote locations are viewing the data.  This is true in energy related fields such as oil and gas exploration and efficient engine design.  Such data sets are usually rendered in three dimensions, and due to their complexity it is often necessary for researchers to view them in stereoscopic (3D) form to gain the sense of depth required to see where various points, structures, and other representations are positioned and oriented relative to one another.  At present, researchers typically wear 3D glasses to view such representations.  This tried and true stereo viewing technique has many limitations, including its inability to render distortion free images for more than one person in one position. Autostereoscopic displays also exist, but existing models either introduce observer position restrictions or else sacrifice the resolution to create 3D images.  The goal of this Phase II project is to build prototype autostereoscopic (3D without glasses) displays capable of two to three times the 3D resolution of existing autostereoscopic 3D images.  The displays will allow several observers to observe immersive high resolution 3D images from across a wide area.  The Phase I program proved the feasibility of both the innovative autostereoscopic technology and its compatibility with existing PC technology.

The proposed work is expected to result in a safe and efficacious fungicidal lead with a novel MOA that will be highly beneficial to growers, consumers, and the environment and economically attractive to commercial partners.

Various recent developments have enhanced the effectiveness of solids NMR methods incorporating Magic Angle sample Spinning (MAS), and considerable additional progress in such techniques continues. Yet, the fact remains that stationary (non-MAS) high-power methods, such as PISEMA, have been more fruitful thus far in yielding structures of large, complex, helical membrane proteins. Preliminary work recently published by several leading research groups has demonstrated the value of advanced 3D methods that cannot be carried out using any commercially available probes, and can only be marginally implemented on home-built probes in mid-field magnets in a few laboratories. Several of the world's most prestigious and successful researchers in macromolecule structure determination by solids NMR methods have voiced the need for major increases in RF field strength, as required for significantly improved spectral resolution, along with dramatically reduced RF sample heating, in triple-resonance 1H/13C/15N probes.  This Phase II proposal seeks funding to complete the development of an ultra-high-power triple-resonance probe for fields up to 1 GHz with order-of-magnitude reduction in RF sample heating and more than a factor of two improvement in each of the remaining three most important and technically demanding specifications simultaneously: RF field strength, spectral resolution, and S/N. The net result is expected to be an order of magnitude reduction in signal acquisition time for many techniques in biological macromolecules. The Phase I effort demonstrated the feasibility of the approach based on a prototype 5-mm probe for 500 MHz and simulations at 900 MHz. The Phase II, 4 mm, 900 MHz probe is expected to demonstrate the following: (1) ability to generate sustained rotating-frame frequencies above 110 kHz at the three resonances simultaneously, (2) static spectral resolution below 0.02 ppm, and (3) S/N on 15N better than 50:1 on 70 lt L of natural- abundance formamide. Achieving the desired RF field strengths will require 4 kW RF pulses for 15N (91 MHz), 1500 W RF pulses for 13C (226 MHz), and 350 W RF pulses for 1H (900 MHz).  The approach will be compatible with operation in narrow-bore (NB) magnets at the highest fields anticipated in the coming decade - to 1.0 GHz. The proposed work builds on earlier work in reducing RF sample heating and improving power handling and resolution in MAS probes; and it adds proprietary, novel technologies to achieve record-shattering power handling. Initial field testing of the Phase II 900 MHz triple-resonance PISEMA probe is expected before the end of the first year at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Florida.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is strong medical and scientific interest in determining the structures of the 15,000 membrane proteins in the human body over the next decade, though available NMR and X-ray methods work poorly and have yielded only a few such structures over the past decade. There are more than 5,000 high-field NMR systems installed world-wide, and annual NMR equipment sales are currently ~ 300M. The proposed ultra-high-power NMR probe development is expected to enhance the ability to determine molecular structures of large, insoluble, membrane proteins by advanced NMR methods by an order of magnitude in many cases.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several hundred thousand people in the USA each year require artificial blood vessels,  grafts , to be placed in their legs because of failing circulation. Sixty thousand of these patients require artificial prosthetic grafts. Unfortunately, many of the artificial grafts become occluded in just a few years (almost 40 % fail within a year), leading to leg amputation. The overall goal of this program is to improve the lives of people requiring artificial vascular grafts by decreasing the need for amputation. In addition to improving quality of life, there will be a substantial reduction in cost to the medical system. In earlier phases of this SBIR program, a  smart graft  was successfully developed and tested; a smart graft not only carries blood, but also measures the blood flow and, by means of an implanted transceiver, wirelessly transmits these measurements to a base station outside the body. The base station alerts a physician to an impending graft occlusion if the smart graft's measurements show impending occlusion. The purpose of this Renewal proposal is to bring the development of the smart graft to the point of readiness for human trials, the last step before commercialization To do so, the smart graft will be enhanced by adding pressure measuring to flow measuring, improving the validity of its measurements. (It also allows doubling the battery-life). The improved smart grafts will be implanted in dogs along with a controllable stenosis, already developed for this program. By monitoring the flow and pressure in the graft as the stenosis is increased causing the graft to occlude, the changes in flow and pressure that show impending graft failure can be determined. These signs of imminent graft failure will be validated in the final part of the program in which smart graft life in one leg of a dog will be compared with the survival of a conventional graft in the other leg. The trial is designed to show that smart grafts will significantly increase graft life and therefore reduce amputations. In addition, the trial will demonstrate the safety of the smart graft, i.e. its biocompatibility and lack of side effects. With proof of graft efficacy and safety, human trials of smart grafts will be able to begin. Smart grafts will lead to far fewer amputations, both improving care and also reducing costs.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The artificial grafts needed to correct poor circulation in the legs frequently become occluded, which leads to amputation of the legs. We have developed a new graft that alerts the physician that the graft is occluding to allow timely intervention, and thus prevents graft failure. Reducing the number of amputations both improves quality of life and reduces costs.",

        "abstract": "Oscillating Wave Surge Converters (OWSC) have shown great promise as a cost-effective means of harnessing the power of ocean waves yet little is known about the effects of different paddle geometries on critical performance factors including power production, survivability, and ecological impact. As a consequence, widespread commercialization of OWSC technologies will be delayed until such information is well understood. The overall objective of this project is to develop an OWSC that, through dynamic shape-adjustment of its energy-absorbing paddle, can maximize power production across a broad range of wave conditions and, when necessary, shed excessive energy when extreme loads are encountered so as to improve device endurance and safety while minimizing environmental disturbances. In Phase 1 we began the process of gathering needed information by developing a numerical modeling tool for predicting the response of various OWSC paddle configurations in different wave conditions. We then proceeded to conduct a total of 960 wave tank experiments using fifteen different paddle geometries to validate the tool and determine performance end-points, i.e., most responsive/least responsive paddle shape. At the conclusion of Phase 1 we were able to verify the effectiveness of varying paddle volume as a means of modulating power generation and as a means of minimizing exposure to destructive forces while, at the same time, maximizing the effectiveness of a power take-off (PTO) system. In Phase 2 our plan is to: a) improve our numerical analysis capabilities by building a time-domain, panelmethod tool for use in further design/analysis work; b) develop and test a means for our OWSC to dynamically transition between most responsive and least responsive paddle shapes; c) incorporate a PTO system which transforms mechanical power provided by the paddle: (i) into working-fluid flow; and (ii) directly into electricity; and d) conduct further wave tank and ocean tests to verify performance and finalize the design that will be commercialized in Phase 3.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  In Phase 3, we will be prepared to immediately commercialize our OWSC device into a specific target market where we have already identified a pilot customer. The public benefits will include: a) the establishment of performance, integrity and safety values for OWSC paddles across normal, severe and extreme operating conditions; and b) materials cost and quality benchmarks against which further improvements can be made; leading to; c) more-rapid commercialization of a technology that will reduce U.S. dependence on foreign energy resources, speed compliance with renewable electricity standards (RES), and reduce risks associated with climate change.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We are developing a high-resolution, low-dose, direct-conversion digital x-ray detector for intraoral dental radiography. The detector will improve intraoral dental imaging with reduced dose, high resolution, and low detector cost. It can be incorporated into existing dental radiography equipment, replacing film-based or scintillator-based systems. The dose efficiency of current scintillator-CCD or scintillator-CMOS photodiode array x-ray detectors is compromised by inefficient conversion of x-rays to light, transport of the light to the detector, and conversion of the light to electric signal. We have successfully developed a new direct x-ray converter material, polycrystalline mercuric iodide (HgI2), which is a high-Z large- bandgap compound semiconductor with outstanding charge collection properties. The proposed detector is a thin film of polycrystalline mercuric iodide for direct conversion of incident x-rays into charge, grown directly onto a CMOS readout. Dose reduction will be achieved due to the very high sensitivity of mercuric iodide films. We expect to sell or license our detector technology to existing intraoral dental imaging equipment vendors.  In Phase I of the project, we grew polycrystalline HgI2 directly onto our small- area CMOS readout chip, which we specially designed for compatibility with HgI2. We measured the imaging performance of the prototype device. In this Phase II we will scale the CMOS chip up to dental Size 2, place the CMOS readout into a package suitable for intraoral use, further modify the HgI2 deposition to improve spatial resolution, and complete and test a full product prototype. The product we will develop will help dentists detect hairline cracks and other high-resolution features while patients will benefit from a reduced lifetime x-ray dose.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will produce an improved x-ray detector for intraoral dental radiography. The detector will reduce the x-ray dose that dental patients receive during their exam while providing dentists with high resolution images at a low cost. The semiconductor-based detector can be incorporated into existing dental radiography equipment, replacing film-based or scintillator-based systems.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses the deteriorating situation with respect to our nation?s infrastructure system, particularly bridges.  A solution is critically needed to monitor the structural integrity of such systems in order to identify potential failures ? such as the Minneapolis I-35W Bridge collapse ? before they occur.  Existing solutions for structural state sensing are expensive, labor intensive, non-scalable, and unreliable.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of an innovative, cost-effective, non-intrusive, and scalable structural monitoring technology known as Active RF Test (ART).  The investigators developed a prototype of a thin, mechanically flexible, patch-like wireless sensor that can be easily attached to distributed points of a structure.  ART sensors are batteryless, with their energy supplied through an in-network RF energy radiation mechanism.  Based on the Phase I success, Phase II will (1) optimize the architecture and enhance the capabilities of the ART sensors; (2) develop cost effective processes for high-volume production of the sensors; (3) develop analytical tools that generate a map of installation locations for ART sensors on a structure; (4) develop detection/diagnostics models based on the sensors; and (5) conduct a field evaluation of the ART system on two highway bridges.\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is protecting the US infrastructure against aging, structural malfunction, and failures.  Aging infrastructure poses a significant societal challenge:  recent reports indicate that the US transportation infrastructure has 601,027 bridges, of which 71,419 are structurally deficient.  Unique features of the proposed ART technology ? such as easy installation, low cost, scalability, energy self sufficiency, and durability ? make it an ideal response to this challenge.  The attachment of ART patch sensors will be non-intrusive to a structure, the installation effort will be minimal, and no drilling will be required.  The mechanical flexibility of the ART patch sensors will allow adaption to complex geometries, including bearing plates, gusset plates, joints, support cables, and truss systems on a bridge.  Finally, ART technology features a multipurpose solution that can be tailored to structural integrity monitoring needs of different types of structures, including bridges, pipelines, dams, airframes, and offshore platforms.  The 71, 419 structurally deficient US bridges alone represent a commercial market of $2.8 billion.  The potential to address other structures, along with the potential for international sales, would enhance the opportunity.",

        "abstract": "A present challenge facing the fusion energy community and particularly the ICC community in its support of the main line tokamak program is the ability to generate increased power levels for pulsed magnets, arc plasma sources, radio frequency heating, and current drive schemes, at reasonable cost. Continuous wave (CW) tube based power supplies are typically large and expensive, making them prohibitive for smaller experimental facilities or not cost effective when only pulsed input power is required.  Continued research and development of next generation solid state power supplies could allow for multiple applications with a single well developed, low cost module that could be configured in many ways.  The proposed work will continue to develop, build, and test a modular solid state power supply based on Insulate Gate Bi-polar Transistor (IGBT) technologies, technologies that have seen a dramatic increases in operational parameters over the past decade.  In this effort, Eagle Harbor Technologies would continue the Phase I work, which successfully developed a modular, low cost, high power IGBT based system that can be assembled in multiple ways to address a wide range of applications.  In the Phase I program a low cost IGBT modular system prototype was successfully modeled, designed, built, and bench tested. The testing results demonstrated the prototype could be arranged in both parallel and series configurations for both high current and/or high voltage operation.  The prototype cost was shown to be significantly lower than older generation power supplies for similar applications.  In the Phase II work plan we will upgrade the Phase I IGBT modular prototype and fully characterize its nominal operational parameters in preparation for commercialization of the system.  Additionally, two full power supply units that represent the greatest need to the ICC community will be built and tested to demonstrate system performance and cost benefit.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  There are a large number of applications where a suitable low cost, highly configurable, high current, high voltage, solid state pulsed power supply would be beneficial.  These include the noted applications in the fusion science community including wave heating schemes, active feedback and control for plasma stabilization systems, current drive, plasma arc sources and ignitron replacements.  Other areas of interest include suitable pulsed power supplies for linear accelerators, high voltage trigger systems, in-space electric thrusters, pulse width modulation amplification, and semiconductor fabrication applications.",

We aim to take advantage of the unique voltage and power properties of solid state lighting (SSL) to create a novel lighting power and control system that addresses cost, energy usage, complexity, and comprehensive coverage.  For solid state lighting, Redwood Systems sees cost-savings opportunities by centralizing power conversion in an electronic appliance capable of powering or dimming up to 64 light fixtures over low-voltage wiring (e.g. Category 5 cable).  Through this centralized power conversion, costs associated with electrical conduit, circuit relays, switches, and light ballasts/drivers will be reduced.  With this new network infrastructure in place, we can also more easily install commission and automate the discovery and configuration of per-light motion and ambient light sensors to reduce lighting energy consumption by 50-75% with comprehensive daylighting, occupancy sensing, scheduling, demand response, and user tasking features.  In Phase I, basic validation of the power, control, and communications architecture was validated.  Successful integration of software and hardware to permit powering and control of commercial office space was demonstrated. In addition, the ability of the system to gather data was shown.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this fast-track SBIR project entitled  Paragraph and Essay Writing Instruction for Struggling Secondary Writers  is to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a total of four interactive multimedia (IM) software programs to be used to teach complex writing skills to struggling writers in secondary schools. The foci of the four programs will be (1) basic paragraph-writing skills, (2) advanced paragraph-writing skills, (3) basic essay-writing skills, and (4) advanced essay-writing skills. The lessons within each program will include an introduction to the program and the targeted writing skills, a description of how to use a targeted writing strategy, demonstrations, practice activities, and feedback. The Phase I project will focus on the feasibility of this medium for teaching complex writing skills to struggling writers. Measures will focus on (a) student use of the program, (b) student knowledge of writing skills, (c) student writing skills related to writing topic, detail, and concluding sentences within a paragraph, and (d) student satisfaction. During Phase I, an informal and a formal pilot test will be conducted to determine the feasibility of the prototype program. During each of the three years of Phase II, at least one informal pilot test and one field test of one new program will be conducted. A pretest-posttest control-group design with random assignment of students to groups will be utilized in each field test to determine the effects of each instructional program on student knowledge, performance, and generalization of the writing skills to complete writing tasks. The programs resulting from this project, because they will be designed to include instructional methods that have been found to be successful with at-risk students, should enable these students to respond successfully to the writing demands of their courses and minimum competency tests. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is relevant to public health because the number of individuals with low literacy skills is substantial. Low literacy has been associated with dropping out of school and such poor adult outcomes as under-employment and unemployment, criminal activity, and poverty (van Der Veen and Preece, 2005). Moreover, individuals who drop out of school have more mental and physical health problems than individuals who complete high school (Carter, 1998). Students who are at-risk for dropping out of school often have writing skill deficits. Only about half of their sentences are complete sentences. They do not know how to organize and write basic paragraphs and essays, and they are not able to respond to the writing demands of their required courses. A large number of these students will either drop out of school or continue to struggle with writing tasks throughout their school careers and into adulthood. The empirically validated IM products that will result from this project will address the potentially devastating effects that low literacy can cause in children's lives and in society at large. Indeed, about a third of all students and half of all blacks, Latinos, and American Indians are currently failing to graduate from high school on time (Freudenberg and Ruglis, 2007). Since writing skills are needed for success in secondary and post-secondary educational settings and work settings, this project has the potential to help many individuals to succeed and have a better prospect for mental health. The instruction would be used to help struggling writers learn to create a variety of paragraphs and essays. The instructional programs that will result from this project will be usable as literacy intervention programs based on individual needs. In addition, the proposed programs will serve as a model for the development of future IM programs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chemicals, biological materials and particulates are continuously released into the atmosphere and water supply. Major spills are obvious and are immediately remediated. What is unknown is how many sub ppm contaminations the public is inundated with on a daily basis and how these low level contaminations affect community health over time. The NIEHS seeks to establish large scale long-term biomonitoring programs to accurately determine current contamination issues and develop models to predict long term health implications. To amass the enormous amount of data in this undertaking, fieldable devices will be developed to rapidly provide the desired information with high levels of precision. The data collection has to be very inexpensive per measurement or the undertaking will fail from cost issues alone. In this program, we are developing an inexpensive Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) reader to monitor contaminants in the vapor and aqueous phases. Our preliminary demonstration is for the detection of pesticides in the air surrounding farmworkers during harvesting seasons and on surfaces of farmworker dwellings, and of pesticide metabolites in farmworker urine samples. In the Phase I program, we successfully demonstrated that pesticides in the vapor phase could be detected at CDC relevant concentrations and that pesticide metabolites could be detected in synthetic and real urine samples at biologically relevant concentrations. In the Phase II program, a high resolution automated SERS reader will be taken into the field for pesticide analysis. SERS vapor spectra and urinalyses will be collected in the 2011 and 2012 harvesting seasons. Precision, accuracy and cost effectiveness will all be demonstrated. The Phase II results will allow the SERS reader to transition into other pesticide analysis programs as well as progress to other biomonitoring programs of relevance to the NIEHS.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will allow NIEHS and other monitoring agencies of public health to define long-term health effects of low pesticide levels on the population as a whole. The sensors developed will allow for a direct correlation between external pesticide concentrations a person is exposed to and the actual ingested concentration, measured as metabolites in urine. The sensor developed herein can be used for all pesticides/crops and can be modified to monitor other environmental contaminants as well.",

        "abstract": "Stored nuclear waste must be retrieved from storage, treated, separated into low-and high-level waste streams, and finally put into a disposal form that effectively encapsulates the waste and isolates it from the environment for a long period of time.  Not all of the waste, however, is effectively removed in the tank during bulk retrieval.  Some remain in the tank bottom and walls, and also in the ancillary piping.  Removal of residual waste is necessary in order to prevent the remaining waste from possible leaching into the environment.  Compact, remote detection techniques are therefore needed that can provide chemical identification of the residual waste so that appropriate dissolution steps can be implemented.  A novel, compact fiber optic Raman probe with a telescope focusing and Raman collection front optics will be developed and use as a standoff detection and mapping tool for residual wastes in nuclear waste storage tanks.  The compact size of the telescope Raman probe will allow remote deployment in the tight portals of nuclear waste storage tanks.  A prototype of the all-fiber optically coupled telescope was completed and fully characterized for measuring Raman spectra of likely residual waste compounds at up to 70 feet, a typical internal tank dimension.  The prototype was provided to DOE/SRS who demonstrated it successfully with several mixed waste materials at similar standoff distances, and made recommendations for further improvements in Phase II.  The Raman telescope will be further developed to incorporate video, autofocus, shielding for high radiation environments and accommodation with typical storage tank openings.  A field portable, ruggedized spectrograph will be developed optimized for the telescope and Raman excitation laser, enabling a high sensitivity and wider spectral range for enhanced compound identification.   A database of >100 high resolution, full range Raman spectra will be developed of likely residual tank contaminants, supported by chemometric software for spectral matching.  Commercial applications and other benefits:  The fiber optic Raman telescope probe inspection instrument will be useful to the environmental monitoring community as well as first responders.  In Hazmat operations, such a device can be used to characterize hazardous chemicals such as chemical spill at a standoff distance and will provide valuable information for the safe handling or remediation of these chemicals.",

        "abstract": "Competing cost, load growth, reliability, security and environmental issues are pushing power system design, operation and control to new levels of complexity.  What is needed is a multidiscipline, multi-fidelity integrated analysis and information management approach that can be used to combine new technology together with legacy systems in a reliable and cost effective way.  Risk assessment and simulation for renewable generation development is a good example of this type of problem.  This problem will be addressed through development of a new model-based real-time renewable generation operations risk assessment analysis and mitigation system that will include live data links to Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and web based state-of-the-art Photo Voltaic performance data services.  The prototype system will be tested using existing integrated transmission and distribution models for a real power utility system.  The system includes a significant level of Photo Voltaic (PV) sites and will be modeled to a level of detail that includes one-to-one correspondence with real system components, and all customer connections with 13 months of historical hourly load data.  In addition to providing new risk monitoring and analysis capability, the system will be used to develop and test new PV performance and customer load forecasting, which is a significant source of renewable resource use uncertainty.  Successful concept development and testing of Graph Trace Analysis Approach (GTA) based operations risk monitoring, mitigation and visualization using a test model and data.  Develop and implement a prototype model-based operations management risk analysis, mitigation and visualization system that can be used either by itself or as part of an integrated smart grid solution.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The Graph Trace Analysis software to be used for the project is uniquely suited for development of a new renewable resource risk assessment approach that can be implemented as part of an integrated design, operation and control analysis and information management solution.  GTA is currently being used by leading industry, academic and government research organizations to address complex system analysis and information management problems that previously could not be solved.  The web based services that will be integrated with the new system is a leader in renewable resource monitoring and analysis.  Combining capabilities from these to next generation type capabilities, and then refining them using real system data will significantly increase problem size, level of detail and complexity of renewable resource related analysis that can be performed for both design and real-time operations.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is directed at developing a real time process control system for improving manufacturing of thin film products such as thin film solar panels, solid state lighting, touch screen displays, optics and telecommunications. Photovoltaics are a vital component of the renewable energy mix but they need to be more efficient to be competitive against existing fossil fuel approaches. The system will be able to dynamically control and correct the film deposition process in order to keep each product within its targeted specification, reducing and even eliminating rejects. It allows manufacturing of more consistent and uniform solar panels resulting in higher solar conversion efficiency, reduced cost and increased manufacturing yield. The objective of this Phase II is to further develop and improve the prototype system developed under Phase I and IB and validate it for two most common thin film solar panel manufacturing configurations. This project will complete the hardware / software development and validation for monitoring film growth for amorphous silicon solar panel manufacturing. Phase II will remove technical risk allowing fast commercialization of the monitoring system. Additional development will be performed to finalize the control component of the system. \nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to advance the scientific understanding of how thin films grow during deposition. It will help thin film solar panel manufacturers to develop higher quality products. The system will improve production accuracy, reduce production flaws and make the manufacturing process less susceptible to process parameter drifts and errors,especially for advanced thin-film products. The commercial impact of the project is that manufacturers will (i) increase solar panel efficiency and manufacturing yield, (ii) reduce manufacturing cost, and (iii) increase revenue and profit. The proposed technology provides an innovative platform solution that can be further improved in order to achieve waste-free thin film manufacturing with little human interaction. This system, if adopted by only 30% of the thin film manufacturers will result in roughly $1 billion in savings by 2015. The societal impact of the project is to help make solar panels a competitive source of energy against existing fossil fuel approaches. The system will allow manufacturers to meet the market demand for lower cost solar products which will accelerate PV adoption worldwide thus helping to reduce global warming and reduce our dependence on oil.",

        "abstract": "Fresh fruit, vegetables, and flowers are transported and stored in refrigerated containers. As the produce ripens, ethylene gas is produced, which further ripens the product and can lead to premature spoilage. Most fruits and vegetables emit ethylene gas which promotes ripening. Certain species, such as apples and bananas, produce more ethylene than others. Elevated ethylene levels can significantly reduce storage time; concentrations as high as only 1 ppm can destroy an entire container of produce in one day. The current ethylene removal industry uses single-use potassium permanganate adsorbent blankets or sachets, or a removal device that has a limited lifetime (3&#61485;8 months). Other devices that are on the market or currently being developed include biofilters, ozone generators, and photocatalytic and electrocatalytic devices. Disadvantages of these devices include very strict storage requirements, the potential of contamination by the ethylene-destroying bacteria, the need to employ complex systems to produce ozone, and high manufacturing costs of the photocatalytic device and nanoporous gold electrocatalysts. The goal of this Phase II program is to optimize the adsorbent, complete the design and fabricate a bench top, multi-bed unit. The research will be focused on long-term testing (months instead of days), extended testing under high humidity conditions, testing at concentrations below 1 ppm, testing mold spore kill efficacy of the adsorbent, and evaluation in atmospheres with fluctuating concentrations of ethylene. Engineers at Eltron will be called upon to finalize the design and subsequently build the multi-fixed bed system, which is optimized towards our primary adsorbent and the optimal conditions found during the research. Major benefits of the new system include the ability to regenerate the adsorbent (long lifetimes without having to replace the active species), use of relatively inexpensive materials (no platinum, ruthenium, or gold), and a simple device design, making it inexpensive to manufacture and simple to use. The low maintenance design of the device will allow for increased storage time and reduce spoilage, resulting in reduced costs to all parties along the supply chain - grower, transporter, distributor, and consumer. A renewable ethylene adsorption system would be able to reduce ethylene concentrations within refrigerated dock-side storage containers, refrigerated train cars and grocery store storage refrigerators at minimal long-term cost, and would eliminate the cost and hassle of frequently changing disposable adsorbent beds. By the end of the Phase II program, a prototype low-cost device for the removal of low concentrations of ethylene will have been fabricated, evaluated in a lab setting and in a real-world setting by Ethylene Control Inc., who has already expressed interest in this technology. During Phase II, partnerships for the commercialization of the device will be initiated in order to bring the product to market as soon as possible.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Soft x-ray microscopy shows enormous promise as a technique for imaging cellular structures at resolutions well beyond what can be achieved in optical microscopes, and with much simpler sample preparation than is required for electron microscopy. In addition, the lower radiation dose required (compared to electron microscopy) allows tomographic investigation of subcellular structures in three dimensions. Existing synchrotron based microscopes have shown the potential of the soft x-ray microscope as a research tool, but they have the disadvantage of being tied to a massive light source at only a few national laboratories. A suitably bright, compact, low cost light source is the enabling innovation needed to realize a commercial biological soft x-ray microscope. In a Phase I NIH SBIR program (2R44RR022488-02) Energetiq demonstrated a unique, compact light source that generates the required x-ray wavelength and intensity for imaging. In the following Phase II NIH SBIR program (5R44RR022488-03) Energetiq constructed a  proof-of-principal  microscope. With three months left to go in the Phase II program, nearly all major program goals have been met, and we are on track to completing the rest of the program goals on schedule and within budget. In the proposed Phase II Renewal program, Energetiq will focus on significantly shortening exposure time through increasing the source brightness and will work with an existing manufacturer (Xradia, Inc.) of x-ray microscopes to integrate the Energetiq source with their microscope, thus accelerating the point at which a commercial instrument will be available in the market. The ultimate goal will be a new commercial tool for researchers to use in studying subcellular structures.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Biologists have a need to image whole biological cells at high resolution and in their hydrated state. Currently available commercial, integrated microscopes satisfy one of these requirements but not both. Soft x-ray microscopy in the so-called 'water window' allows resolution to 20nm for fully hydrated cell samples, and can produce 2-D and 3-D tomographic images. The ability to resolve subcellular structures in hydrated cells, and to create those images in minutes rather than days, could lead to more rapid advances in drug discovery, disease diagnosis, disease treatment and in the understanding of fundamental cellular processes. The proposed program will enable the widespread adoption of this technique by researchers.",

Energid Technologies proposes a new harvesting approach that combines robotic technologies with the efficiency of mass removal methods. It uses a system of many cameras and flexible picking mechanisms that are integrated and controlled through a powerful computer infrastructure. Objectives during the project are the following: refine the existing design of the picking mechanisms and end effectors, explore new end effector types, refine and implement a vision system, design and implement a high-level control system, and build a full prototype including picking mechanisms mounted on a truck.

This technology will enable the development of multiple commercial products to address the immediate needs of citrus growers. It will ultimately help growers of other crops as well. The approach will allow a reduction in system cost and maintenance costs to the level of commercial viability.

        "abstract": "Recovery boilers are a key component of all kraft pulp mills and are often the production bottleneck in such mills. Formation of deposits on the outside of heat transfer tubes can cause plugging of the gas passages within the convective sections of the boiler leading to unscheduled outages and lost production. High pressure steam lances (sootblowers) used to clean the outside of these heat transfer surfaces consume as much as $1 million in steam per year per boiler, but the lack of adequate real-time inspection capability in large sections of the boiler prevent effective and efficient use of these sootblowers to remove deposits leading to excessive steam usage. The proposed project will demonstrate and develop a terahertz measurement/imaging system that can be used to produce clear images at all locations within the interior of an operating kraft recovery boiler and quantitative measurements of the thickness and size of saltcake deposits on heat transfer tubes, allowing for more efficient use of sootblowing steam to remove deposits and potential savings of ~0.01 Quads of energy worth more than $50 million per year nationwide. The energy savings is accompanied by reductions in pollutants associated with the production of that saved energy, amounting to ~8,000 tons of SO2, 5,500 tons of NOx, and one million tons of CO2 per year nationwide. In Phase I, we successfully demonstrated terahertz imaging of boiler tubes inside a kraft recovery boiler and showed that this technology has the ability to measure the size and thickness of saltcake deposits on those tubes. We demonstrated that visibility in the boiler environment is substantially better in the terahertz range than in the infrared where current boiler imaging systems operate. And, we demonstrated that the terahertz imaging system can detect differences in the optical properties of saltcake deposits at different frequencies offering the potential to measure deposit chemistry in-situ in real-time. In Phase II, we will develop the capability to quantitatively measure the thickness of deposits in real-time, we will develop a miniaturized, low-cost version of the imaging system, and we will conduct tests in a recovery boiler to demonstrate the ability of this technology to provide quantitative data that can be used as feedback to a sootblowing control system to minimize sootblowing steam usage.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  While the proposed project is focused on kraft recovery boilers, there is also a great need for these same capabilities in many other industrial process operations such as coal-fired boilers, biomass boilers, cement kilns, and spray drying applications such as skim milk dryers where deposits on the dryer surfaces can present an ignition hazard.",

Preliminary results clearly demonstrate that by modifying the drift gas with chiral molecules, ion mobility spectrometry can provide a novel and rapid separation technique for chiral compounds. Similar to chiral chromatography and capillary electrophoresis, the ability of chiral ion mobility spectrometry to examine enantiomeric mixtures is based upon the interaction of analytes with neutral chiral modifiers.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project addresses the pressing need to develop technologies to produce all types of transportation fuels from renewable sources.  Specifically, the goal of this project is to create a complete, sustainable, and cost-effective technology that converts algae into conventional jet fuel at a sufficiently low cost as to be competitive with fossil-derived fuels.  The proposed technology converts raw, low-cost algae into aviation fuel that meets or exceeds all current performance specifications.  This project applies completely new chemistry with environmentally benign engineered catalysts that allows conversion of both triglycerides and free fatty acids found in algal oil into long-chain branched paraffins that are ideal traditional jet fuel components.  Phase I of this project successfully demonstrated some of the key chemical reactions involved in the transformation of triglyceride oil to jet fuel.  Phase II will focus on developing and optimizing the remaining key steps in the process and preparing the process for large-scale piloting and commercialization.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:   The proposed process is designed to be competitive with existing jet fuels made from petroleum both in terms of performance and price. No modifications to the turbine engines or the infrastructure are required to use this product.  Airlines will benefit from low, stable fuel prices and society benefits from reduced pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.  This technology allows a fundamental shift away from reliance on imported oil for vital civilian and military aviation needs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The CFTR gene encodes a chloride channel that regulates ion flow across epithelial cell membranes. Most CF patients have a mutation that deletes phenylalanine 508 (?F508) and prevents CFTR from being properly processed and delivered to cell membranes. Failure of CFTR to reach the cell surface in the lung disrupts the composition and quantity of the airway surface liquid, and through mechanisms not yet fully understood, begins a cascade of events that leads to chronic airway infection and inflammation and lung destruction. Despite improvements in the lives of patients with CF, it remains a lethal disease, and current treatments are directed at secondary manifestations rather than the underlying defect. Several studies have demonstrated that the ?F508-CFTR channel retains chloride channel function when it is experimentally delivered to the cell membrane. Thus, the ?F508-CFTR channel has become an important therapeutic target for pharmacological intervention. However, two barriers limit progress toward new treatments. First, lack of an animal model that develops lung disease is a major impediment to understanding disease pathogenesis and the development of effective therapies. Mice with CFTR knockouts and with the ?F508 mutation have been developed, but they fail to exhibit the airway infection and inflammation that cause most of the morbidity and mortality in patients. Second, the ?F508-CFTR protein from other species shows differences in its processing compared to human ?F508-CFTR. Thus, studies focused on understanding CF and developing new treatments require a new animal model expressing the human ?F508-CFTR. In this application, we propose to produce such a model. We will use pigs for this project, because in contrast to mice, the structure, physiology, and biochemistry of their lungs and airways closely resemble those of humans. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop and commercialize a porcine model of CF carrying a human CFTR transgene bearing the common ?F508 mutation. A  humanized  ?F508 pig would be the ideal model in which to develop and test CF drugs and a valuable tool for answering persistent questions about CF pathogenesis. This proposal outlines the development of such a pig by first stably introducing the entire human CFTR gene bearing the ?F508 mutation into the genome of pig cells lacking endogenous pig CFTR expression. The transgenic cells will then be used as nuclear donors for somatic cell nuclear transfer. The resulting pigs will be characterized molecularly, biochemically, and electrophysiologically to determine ?F508-CFTR expression and function. To validate the human ?F508-CFTR transgenic pig as a relevant model in which to test new therapies, pig airway cultures will be established, and compounds known to partially rescue the processing of ?F508-CFTR in human tissues will be tested. This project will generate an animal model that will provide the CF industrial and academic community with an opportunity to better understand the disease and its pathogenesis and to develop and test new therapeutics and preventative strategies. Thus, this work will accelerate the discovery of novel therapies for this lethal disease.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among drugs that cause widespread human suffering, none is more destructive than ethanol. The estimated annual cost of ethanol abuse in the United States is  185B. A new breath-based toxicological tool with superior capabilities dedicated to understanding the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ethanol is needed to combat alcohol abuse and understand its origins. Current devices used to measure ethanol in human breath rely on technologies that are several decades old, which limit the sensitivity and specificity of ethanol detection and poorly separate ethanol from confounding analytes in breath. We propose to develop a new generation of  evidential  (generates high quality data that is directly introduced into courts as legal evidence) breath-based ethanol sensors to combat ethanol abuse in the 21st century. A multi-disciplinary team (physicians, engineers, chemists, addiction experts, and forensic toxicologists) will collectively develop a miniature gas chromatograph metal oxide sensor (mGC-MOS) device for real-time, point-of-use detection of ethanol and other analytes. NIAAA SBIR Phase I support was used to 1) design and construct a mGC-MOS to detect ethanol in real-time, 2) demonstrate the mGC-MOS has outstanding specificity and accuracy, and can readily discriminated between ethanol and other analytes (e.g., acetone, methanol), which commonly interfere with the function of present sensor technologies, and 3) establish mGC-MOS accuracy in humans intoxicated with ethanol in the University of Florida (UF) General Clinical Research Center (GCRC). We now propose to expand this work to refine, construct, and examine the performance characteristics of the next generation breath ethanol analyzer, an evidential mGC-MOS. To that end, the following 3 specific aims will be achieved:  Specific Aim 1: Design and build an improved mGC-MOS device with a single GC column (vis- -vis current dual column configuration) that accurately and precisely measures ethanol concentrations in real-time. (Milestone: 10/31/2010).  Specific Aim 2: Demonstrate that the mGC-MOS meets or exceeds evidential breath analyzer performance using established industry standards as enumerated by the Organisation Internationale de Metrologie Legale. (Milestone: 12/31/2010).  Specific Aim 3: Validate and use the mGC-MOS as a research tool to investigate the pharmacokinetic/dynamic and cognitive effects of a moderate dose of alcohol in older and younger social drinkers. (Milestone: 03/31/2012).  The mGC-MOS being developed will not only 1) provide a superior dataset from ethanol PK/PD clinical studies, but also 2) improve testing in law enforcement and workplace settings by bringing the power of evidential ethanol breath analysis to point-of-use environments, while markedly lowering the cost of evidential testing (lt  1,000 mGC-MOS system versus gt 100,000 current units). Our long term goal is to expand the utility of this novel mGC-MOS technology in order to effectively address other major medical problems, including drugs of abuse, medication adherence, and functional interrogation of CYP-450 enzyme competency.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current devices used to measure ethanol in human breath rely on technologies that are several decades old, which limit the sensitivity and specificity of ethanol detection and poorly separate ethanol from confounding analytes in human breath. We propose to develop a new generation of portable,  evidential  breath-based ethanol sensors with superior capabilities to understand the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ethanol and to combat ethanol abuse in the 21st century.

Cellulosic biomass provides a readily-available, high-volume feedstock for biofuel production.  Successful completion of the objectives will optimize unpurified ZM3 for use as a cellulose synergist in scaled-up conditions for commercialization purposes.  \nBroader impacts associated with developing strategies to decrease the costs and improve the efficiency of the production of ethanol from cellulosic biomass include numerous societal benefits resulting from reduction of petroleum use.  Conversion of cell wall biomass from renewable forestry and agricultural feedstocks into biofuels enables the efficient use of waste materials.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Current practice is to set up trial crystallization screens and periodically review the results to see if a crystal or promising crystal-like precipitate has appeared a process that often takes weeks or months. Most outcomes are precipitated protein or clear drops, and the conditions that led to those results are removed from further consideration. We are developing an alternative screening approach, the self-association behavior of the target macromolecule as measured by fluorescence anisotropy as a diagnostic for the likelihood of crystallization under the test conditions. Dilute solution properties are known to be a diagnostic for crystallization (George and Wilson, 1994; George et al., 1997; Wilson et al., 1993; Wilson et al, 1996; Tessier et al., 2002; Tessier et al., 2003; Garcia et al., 2003a; Garcia et al., 2003b; Bloustine et al., 2003). Concentration vs. anisotropy data for a macromolecule-precipitant combination was originally proposed for determining the likelihood of that solution producing crystals, although based on Phase I results intensity vs. concentration data is also a strong indicator. Data acquired in Phase I shows that this approach can  find  lead crystallization conditions from solutions that give clear drops or precipitate in screening assays. The applications of the instrument and methodology to be developed will be to rapidly conduct crystallization screens within 2-24 hrs, using a minimum amount of protein ( 0.03 mg), with a higher probability of finding lead conditions. Higher success rates will greatly facilitate structure-based drug design, particularly for target proteins that are difficult to obtain, and contribute to the understanding and treatment human disease.  The Phase II proposal's objectives are to substantially improve the present instrument and methodology, progressing from the currently required 4.5 mg to 0.03 mg of protein/96 condition screen, and validate this method with extensive testing. This will be the basis for a macromolecule crystallization business operated on a fee-for-service basis. Experience with the Phase I instrument has indicated where improvements can be made in the plate set-up process, data collection optics, and electronics and the initial Phase II work will be to implement those improvements. Subsequent testing will first be with model proteins. For each model protein the concentration vs. anisotropy and intensity data obtained will be compared with crystallization screens set up in parallel, to define the signature curves indicating crystallization or potential crystallization outcomes and the extended data range over which crystallization conditions can be recovered. All anisotropy-derived leads will be tested with optimization screens. Subsequent testing will be to challenge the methodology using previously uncrystallized soluble and membrane proteins from the same source. The model and test protein data will be used in the subsequent development of software for data analysis. Projected Phase III efforts include developing incomplete factorial screens that can make full use of the quantitative data obtained by this method.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful crystallization and X-ray data analysis provides important three-dimensional information on the macromolecules structure-function relationship. Many proteins that are potential drug targets or key components in diseases are only available in trace quantities, or are difficult to obtain. This proposal is to continue development of a new approach to macromolecule crystallization, using a minimum amount of protein, and giving quantitative data that can subsequently be analyzed to determine those conditions which will give crystals and those that can be brought to crystallization conditions, thus giving a higher success rate.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many craniofacial surgical procedures involve both functional and aesthetic reconstruction for successful completion. The need for soft tissue fill for additional functionality and contouring is an aspect that can have lower priority during reconstructive craniofacial surgeries. Following the major tissue reconstruction, this secondary phase of the procedure is of critical importance to the long term outcome. The current methods of using autologous fat as a fill material, lead to unpredictable and non-reproducible end tissue volume and physical properties. These were key factors in Luna Innovations' Phase I research plan that demonstrated in vitro and in vivo feasibility of an innovative approach to process tissue to achieve a more effective and reproducible volumes and tissue viability during autologous free fat transplantation (AFT) and tissue engineering. The goal of the Phase II is to refine the preliminary results and develop a clinically relevant standard procedure to process a patient's adipose tissue mechanically and/or chemically to force out the lipids prior to transplanting, where the body will convert the tissue back to functional, healthy adipose. This technology has promise to improve the clinical outcomes of end volume and texture with increased predictability and reproducibility over currently used AFT practices. Ultimately, the clinical system will consist of a fully automated and programmable bioreactor to perform the tissue processing that will produce more effective, more predictable and more reproducible soft tissue reconstruction while eliminating any rejection and allergic reactions.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Many reconstructive challenges associated with craniofacial procedures are characterized by a lack of soft tissue 'fill' and/or symmetry. The goal of this Phase II proposal is validate a method for in vitro mechanical delipidation of adipose tissue in preparation for autologous free fat transplantations and design the necessary fully-automated bioreactor. The novel methodology will lead to a more effective and reproducible enhancement and augmentation. Once commercialized, this technology has great medical potential in reconstructive and cosmetic applications as well as wound healing.",

This Phase II project will demonstrate a unique approach to growth of GaN thick films and fabrication of freestanding GaN wafers and substrates with low densities of dislocations and low wafer bow/warp in an efficient manner. This Phase II research includes crystal growth of GaN thick films, fabrication of GaN wafers and substrates, and extensive characterization of GaN wafers. If this Phase II project is successful, high-quality freestanding GaN substrates of large diameters will become widely available commercially at an affordable price, which will enable volume production and commercialization of high-performance GaN-based light emitters and ultraviolet light detectors. \nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in the areas of GaN-based light emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, and ultraviolet (UV) light detectors.

Unfortunately, Li-ion systems still do not meet the energy density and cost goals for emerging EV markets including PHEVs.  A new strategy to meeting these goals includes selecting high capacity battery materials, currently incompatible with conventional assembly of Li-ion cells in the discharged state, and using them in novel Li-ion cell designs.  To achieve such a goal, a method by which Lithium can be introduced into the cell must be developed.  During the Phase I project the feasibility of using a unique source of lithium for Li-ion cells assembled in the charged state was demonstrated and used in the design and construction of new high capacity, long life Li-ion cells.  For Phase II the technology will be further optimized and scaled for the development of several new Li-ion battery systems.

Big-box retail stores and industrial space use high wattage metal halide lights today, but the lack of color consistency has been leveraged by Light Emitting Diode fixtures who offer to provide a very consistent color at a higher cost and lower efficiency.  The accent and commercial spot lighting markets are dominated by inefficient Tungsten-Halogen lamps.  Energy-efficient replacement technologies for incandescent spot lighting do exist but have been slow to gain acceptance because of large variability in lamp color and high initial cost.  The proposed project will create an automated color modification system for metal halide lamps to reduce their color variations to equal that of incandescent lamps.  Warm color metal halide sources can be made to fall within a single color oval (no perceived color differences).  This color correction will enable market acceptance of the unique metal halide systems which outperform incandescent, ceramic metal halide and light emitting diode systems in cost-of-light.  Software and programming which demonstrate the feasibility of the color correction algorithm.  Real-life manufacturing process and variability were integrated into the simulation.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): According to the American Diabetes Association, there are more than 16 million people in the United States with known diabetes. Diabetic patients commonly demonstrate impaired wound healing. Approximately 20 percent of patients with diabetes will develop foot ulceration in their lifetime. Diabetic foot ulceration (DFU) represents a major problem that can significantly impair the patient's quality of life, require prolonged hospitalization, and may involve infection, gangrene, and amputation. It has been estimated that for each new foot ulcer the attributable cost for a middle-aged diabetic man in the first two years is approximately   30,000. The cost of DFU to the healthcare system is over one billion dollars per year in the United States. A well- established reason as to why diabetic wounds are tough to heal is that they do not progress through the normal healing phases. Instead, it is thought that diabetic wounds are caught and remain trapped in the initial inflammatory phase of wound healing. FirstString Research, Inc. (FSR) is a biotech company located in Charleston, South Carolina. The founders of FSR, Drs. Robert Gourdie and Gautam Ghatnekar are co inventors of a class of novel bioengineered peptides - we refer to as ACT peptides. Phase I funded studies in the diabetic C57BL/KsJ-m+/+Leptdb (db+/db+) mouse model have provided strong evidence for efficacy and potential of the ACT1 peptide in the treatment of diabetic wounds. The peptide effects a significantly faster closure rate. Subjective parameters such as redness and overall appearance were also substantially improved in ACT1 treated wounds. ACT1 peptide did not show any adverse reactions or safety concerns in our Phase I SBIR studies, as evaluated by a complete necropsy and histopathological evaluation. Moreover, to enhance our ability to understand and anticipate issues associated with the safety and efficacy of ACT1peptide, we will also use gene microarray and computational approaches to analyze effects on key signaling pathways involved in wound healing. Of particular interest will be changes induced in angiogenic signaling that provide basic mechanistic insight into the regeneration of skin vascular pattern in wounds treated with ACT1 peptide. Our market research has indicated that present therapies and drugs for wound healing in diabetes and chronic wounds in general are predominantly symptomatic, empirical, unpredictable, and largely ineffective. Our ACT1 peptide potentially offers a mechanistically based solution to not just faster wound closure but also significant cost savings and more importantly improving the quality of life in diabetic patients. In this Phase II application, Dr. Paul Ehrlich, Director for the Wound Healing Research Laboratory in the Division of Plastic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Hershey Medical Center at Penn State University and Dr. Indu Parikh, President and CSO, BioMarck Pharmaceuticals, Durham, NC have agreed to assist us in achieving our aims.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diabetes is a debilitating condition that threatens the quality of life of not just the people suffering from the disease but also family members and loved ones. Approximately 20 percent of patients with diabetes develop foot ulceration in their lifetime and they demonstrate impaired wound healing. A well-accepted reason for the poor healing of the diabetic or chronic wounds in general is that they are 'stuck' in the inflammatory phase. This technology provides promise for reduced inflammation and faster healing of diabetic wounds thereby improving the quality of life and saving millions of dollars in health care related costs.",

        "abstract": "Chemical treatment such as buffered chemical polishing (BCP) or electropolishing (EP) followed by high pressure rinsing (HPR) of niobium (Nb) superconducting RF (SRF) cavities is expensive and complex multistep process.  Furthermore, the cavity RF surfaces after the treatment still have numerous bubbles and pits that result from welding.  These quench-producing weld defects together with the particulate contamination, result in significant scatter of the multi-cell Nb SRF cavities performance characteristics.  This scatter is the major problem in the current manufacturing of the Nb SRF cavities.  FM Technologies proposes a new chemical-free processing for multi-cell Nb SRF cavities using an internal electron beam (IEB).  Specifically, FMT proposes to develop a new electron gun system that will perform electron beam melting over the entire interior surface of Nb SRF cavities to produce a smooth surface, free from voids, bubbles, and other imperfections.  This will allow manufacturing of the Nb SRF cavities without the above chemical treatment procedures and increase the cavities high gradient performance.  In Phase I, 30 Nb samples were surface melted by an electron beam, beam parameters were determined to achieve a quality Nb surface (qualified by HIROX, AFM, SEM and EBSD).  A complete Nb SRF cavity, without chemical etching, was electron beam melted at the interior surface and RF tested in the superconducting range. Several electron gun designs were evaluated.  Phase II is aimed at building and testing a complete prototype computer controlled electron beam interior cavity surface melting system.  Many Nb samples will be surface melted and beam parameters established to achieve a high quality surface (qualified by HIROX, AFM, SEM and EBSD).  Single and multi-cell Nb SRF cavities will have the interior surface melted by this system at FMT, without chemical etching, Jefferson Lab (J-lab) will perform RF testing on these cavities.  Commercial applications and other benefits:  When developed the chemical free surafce processing using IEB will benefit first J-lab's CEBAF and Fermilab's Project X. Also, light sources, require 1.3 - 1.5 GHz SRF structures.  Furthermore, IEB will produce much broader impact because it can be implemented into manufacturing of many other types of RF devices including both superconducting as well as normal conducting RF cavities.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke and heart attack are the leading causes of mortality and grave morbidity. The goal of this Fast-Track STTR grant application is to enable preclinical investigation of WE-thrombin, a bioengineered protein C activator enzyme for the treatment of severe, acute thrombotic diseases, in particular ischemic stroke. WE- thrombin is a fundamentally new  thrombosis-specific  agent that may act in part by increasing the surface concentration of endogenous activated protein C (APC), which is an anticoagulant, profibrinolytic, and cytoprotective enzyme. Unlike any other antithrombotic drug, WE-thrombin is virtually inactive in the center of the blood stream or in static wound blood. WE-thrombin is a well-defined and far-advanced drug candidate, with antithrombotic efficacy and hemostatic safety verified in definitive primate studies. The proposed research will generate information for an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for WE- thrombin. Existing antithrombotic and thrombolytic drugs, such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) cause bleeding and, thus, cannot be used at their fully effective doses. In addition, TPA needs to be administered within the first 3 hours following onset of ischemic stroke. Since only a small percentage of stroke patients qualify for treatment in this narrow time frame, TPA is seldom administered. Thus, relevant to the mission of NIH, there is an urgent need for better drugs for stroke and other acute thrombotic diseases. The project addresses this need directly with WE-thrombin, which has shown outcome benefits compared to TPA in treating experimental acute ischemic stroke in preliminary studies using mice. Phase I has been designed to create pharmaceutically acceptable formulations of WE- thrombin that can be administered beyond the 3-hour treatment window of TPA in stroke. The 3 specific aims of Phase I are to develop a stable, injectable formulation of WE-thrombin (Aim 1) and to determine its efficacy (Aim 2) and safety (Aim 3) in comparison to TPA when administered in mice with advanced experimental acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Demonstration of efficacy and safety of WE-thrombin in AIS is the milestone that will move WE-thrombin development into Phase II, during which pharmaceutical GMP- grade (good manufacturing practice) WE-thrombin will be obtained and evaluated in vitro (Aims 4 and 5) and subsequently tested in IND-enabling studies to determine its dose-limiting toxicity and potential side effects (Aim 6). Successful completion of Phase II will be defined as a preclinical safety and efficacy data package - and sufficient amount of formulated drug that is suitable for clinical studies. After Phases I and II, an IND application will be submitted, and upon FDA approval, WE-thrombin will be taken into clinical development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blood clots that block blood flow can cause acute heart attack and stroke that both remain among the three leading causes of death and severe chronic disability in the U.S., in part due to limited safety of clot-preventing and clot-removing drugs. The relevance of the proposed project to public health is that it is intended to develop a therapeutic agent (product) for safely interrupting and/or removing blood clots in acute thrombotic diseases. The new recombinant therapeutic enzyme - WE-thrombin - is a first-of-its-kind thrombosis-specific drug candidate that has the potential to represent a breakthrough in antithrombotic therapy for ischemic stroke. WE- thrombin has already been shown to be effective in treating experimental blood clots (thrombosis) in large primates - it is now intended to offer a safe and effective alternative to existing drugs that all had failed to fundamentally improve the morbidity and mortality of stroke, primarily due to their bleeding side effects.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Battery-powered implantable systems are now being used in a wide array of therapeutic and prosthetic applications such as cardiac pacemakers/defibrillators, drug pumps, and more recently, neurostimulators for Parkinsons, pain relief, middle-ear implant and cochlear implant. For most of these applications, the energy-density and life of currently-available batteries are insufficient to enable fully-implantable systems and the battery frequently remains external. In Phase II, Front Edge Technology (FET) proposes to continue the development, it commenced in Phase I, of an advanced rechargeable battery for fully implantable hearing prosthetics devices such as cochlear implants and middle-ear implants. Relative to the state- of-the-art rechargeable batteries, the proposed battery has three times the energy density, three times the battery life and half the recharge time. During Phase II, FET will produce high capacity batteries by stacking high energy density Phase I cells in a novel manner such that overall high energy density is maintained. Sufficient quantities of batteries will be produced to support extensive in-house testing and evaluation by both a major cochlear-implant manufacturer and an implantable battery manufacturer. Previously in Phase I, FET successfully demonstrated (i) ultra-high energy density single layer cells (800Wh/L) (ii) very long cycle life (gt 4000 cycles) and (iii) relatively fast recharge (6 minutes). Proposed Commercial Applications: Our initial battery will be designed for cochlear implants, which have current annual sales of approximately   425 million and expected to grow by approximately 20% annually. Upon completion of the cochlear demonstration battery, we will pursue the other implantable neuromodulation applications, which have current annual sales of  1.6 billion and expected to grow to  10 billion in 10 to 15 years. In addition to neuromodulation applications, our battery technology will be suitable for rechargeable batteries for hearing aids, currently estimated to be a  5 billion dollar industry.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infection with influenza virus causes a highly contagious disease of the respiratory tract. Influenza represents a unique therapeutic challenge due to both seasonal antigen shift and drift. Conventional approaches for therapeutic targeting of influenza pathogens have consistently faced obstacles arising from the development of resistant strains and a lack of broad-spectrum application. The overall goal of this project is to develop broad- spectrum Host Oriented Therapeutic antibodies that are active against all strains of influenza including those that are resistant to current antiviral therapies.    Phase I of this project has been successfully completed. Our original proposal centered upon a newly- developed approach, Random Homozygous Gene Perturbation (RHGP), which can simultaneously knockdown both copies of a target gene and identify those target knock-outs that are well-tolerated in normal cells but inhibit influenza infection. We applied RHGP to identify a set of host-oriented targets that prevent influenza killing of host cells and validate these targets. We further emphasized one particular pathway, based on the RHGP discovery of Nedd4 Binding Protein 2 (N4BP2) and WWP2, a member of Nedd4 family. This investigation allowed us to demonstrate that Nedd4 is exposed on the surface of influenza-infected cells but not on non-infected cells. This unique discovery positions us with an opportunity to develop a broad-spectrum inhibitor of influenza infection, which could act both as a therapeutic and prophylactic therapy to combat seasonal or pandemic forms of influenza.    The specific aims of Phase II are to 1) Create human scFv libraries and screen the candidate antibodies using Nedd4 protein and the peptides. We will isolate approximately 200 different Nedd4-specific scFvs, from which we will select at least 10 different candidates that demonstrate immunoreactivity against a broad-spectrum of seasonal influenza variants and other potential pandemic variants. The leading ten scFv candidates will then be constructed into full-length human IgG1. 2) Evaluate the safety and antiviral activity of the antibody candidates to identify a lead candidate for IND-enabling studies through ADCC, CDC and direct antiviral activity. 3) Optimize the lead candidate to enable the nomination of a Clinical Candidate that has the greatest potential for becoming a successful IND.    We believe the concept of selective targeting of influenza-infected cells has exciting prospects and that it is feasible to develop a therapeutic monoclonal antibody that is applicable to a broad spectrum of seasonal and pandemic influenza strains.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Conventional approaches for therapeutic targeting of the influenza virus have consistently faced obstacles arising from a high viral mutation rate and a lack of broad-spectrum application. The overall goal of this project is to develop broad-spectrum Host Oriented Therapeutic antibodies that target Nedd4, a molecule that is selectively exposed on the surface of influenza-infected cells. These antibodies are expected to be active against all strains of influenza, including those with resistance to current antiviral therapies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) is a global threat to public health and poses an unprecedented challenge to drug development. HIV-1 drugs that directly target virus often fail due to rapid emergence of drug resistance. Functional Genetics (FGI) used a proprietary technology, Random Homozygous Gene Perturbation (RHGP) and discovered novel host gene targets that block HIV-1 infection without observable deleterious effect on cell survival. Unlike viral-targets, treatments relying on cellular targets are expected to retain broad spectrum efficacy against all HIV variants including drug-resistant viruses. In addition, by removing the selective pressure on the virus, host targeting circumvents drug resistance development. The identified targets in Phase I studies were validated using a siRNA approach and also shown to be commonly necessary for infection by both CXCR4 and CCR5 tropic HIV1 viruses. These results demonstrate the power of FGI proprietary RHGP technology to identify host targets(s) in human genome that block viral infection and at the same time are non-toxic.  In the Phase II proposal, we will develop novel targeted intervention against HIV using monoclonal antibody therapeutics. We will focus on one particular host target,  Robo1 , which is essential for the life cycle of HIV-1. To this end, we have discovered that Robo1 expression is activated in primary CD4+ T lymphocytes by HIV-1 infection. As a result, Robo1 uniquely appears on the surface of live, viral producing cells. Robo1 antibodies exhibited anti-HIV-1 activity in human PBMC assays. Robo1 thus can be targeted by monoclonal antibodies to block HIV life cycle and/or to eliminate infected cells via normal host defense mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). We will conduct phage-based screening of human scFv libraries to identify antibody candidates that selectively recognize HIV-1 infected but not uninfected cells. These leading scFv candidates will be built out into full- length human IgG1 antibodies and using molecular evolution approach, the binding affinities of lead antibody candidates will be enhanced by several orders of magnitude. Their broad spectrum anti-viral abilities will then be evaluated including direct inhibition of viral replication and/or mediation of ADCC and CDC effects in vitro and efficacy in humanized mice. Antibody lead(s) will be further scrutinized through cell-based, animal-based and tissue cross-reactivity assays. Based on antiviral activities and iterative improvements, we will nominate a lead Robo1 antibody candidate for IND-enabling studies. We believe the concept of selective targeting of HIV- infected cells has exciting prospects and that it is feasible to develop a therapeutic monoclonal antibody against a broad spectrum of HIV isolates.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most current AIDS drugs target the HIV virus and therefore enable the development of drug resistance through viral mutation. The Phase I project seeks to identify human host targets (as opposed to HIV virus targets) that will prevent the HIV virus from using the host's cellular mechanism for its life cycle. The overall goal of Phase II is to develop Host Oriented Therapeutic antibodies using targets identified from Phase I. These antibodies are expected to be active against all variants of HIV, including those with resistance to current antiviral therapies.",

        "abstract": "Cypripedium is a genus of temperate terrestrial ladyslipper orchids of excellent garden size, forming clumps or 12 - 18 inches in diameter or more, with very showy flowers. Many species are easy to grow in northern gardens (USDA zones 2-7) and have excellent horticultural potential. Today, several nurseries grow a few species and hybrids from seed, although a number of garden-worthy species have not yielded to propagation by seed germination. Several exceptionally garden-worthy hybrids have been developed, but as with the hybrids of many orchids and other flowering plants, vigor and flower appearance varies from specimen to specimen. At present no method of vegetative mass production of superior cultivars is available for Cypripedium. The goals of this research are 1) further optimization of methodology to rapidly induce plantlet formation from callus derived from a wide range of horticulturally superior cypripedium hybrids, and 2) development of grow-out methodology that results in the survival of a large percentage of plantlets into flowering plants within four years from deflasking. Success in this program will allow large scale production of cypripedium cultivars for provision of superior cultivars to the floricultural market. Orchid production is valued at $140 million wholesale in the U.S. Unlike tropical orchids, which are optimally produced in southeast Asia, cypripedium are optimally produced in the northern U.S. While many floriculturally important orchids including the Cattleya alliance, Cymbidium, and Phalaenopsis are mass produced using in vitro micropropagation techniques, ladyslipper orchids have thus far not yielded to micropropagation using commercially relevant methodology. Unlike the seed of many epiphytic orchids, seed of terrestrial orchids is difficult to germinate due to the introduction during seed maturation of growth inhibitory factors that enable seed to survive the harsh weather conditions of winter. Only beginning in the 1980s has germination from seed of some species of cypripedium become routinely practiceable, and the first generally successful protocols for seed germination and maturation of seedlings appeared in the mid-1990s. Indeed, while hybrids of many orchid genera have been registered since the mid-1800s, the cypripedium hybrid was registered in 1991. The availability of uniform, vegetatively mass-produced offspring of commercially important orchids such as Cattleya, Cymbidium and Phalaenopsis dramatically transformed the worldwide markets for hybrids of those species. The market for orchids in the U.S. has been rapidly growing, from $47 million at the wholesale level in 1995 to $144 million in 2005. Virtually all of these orchids are produced using vegetative micropropagation. Today, most mass production of these tropical species occurs outside the U.S., particularly in southeast Asia where the climate dramatically reduces production costs. In contrast, Cypripedium grow in temperate climates and require prolonged freezing conditions during the winter. This makes many regions of the U.S. particularly attractive regions in which to establish commercial production.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Tandem repeat sequences (STR) are distributed widely in the human genome. These sites exhibit high levels of length polymorphism as a result of their relative instability during DNA replication, i.e., the tendency for slippage to occur between the template and newly synthesized strands causing deletion or addition of repeat units. Changes in STR repeat number can lead to heritable genetic predispositions and disease. However, their variability makes them ideal markers for genetic studies. One class, the microsatellites containing 4 base pair repeat units, has been selected by the FBI as the basis for a genetic identification system, termed CODIS. Current analysis systems require a 1-2 day assay and employ electrophoretic separation of DNA fragments that contain the STR locus for accurate sizing and identification of the repeat number. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a simple, cost-effective and automatable assay system for STR analysis that allows human identification in less than 3 hours from sample to result by avoiding the need for PCR amplification, target DNA denaturation and electrophoretic separation. In Phase I of this proposal a single locus (TPOX) was used to demonstrate that accurate microarray based STR analysis is technically feasible and sufficiently rapid. In Phase II we will expand this assay to include at least 6 other CODIS loci, convert the technology from an in solution to an immobilized format and attempt to increase assay speed and convenience further by eliminating the PCR step. Our approach to achieving these goals utilizes Gene Check's RecA mediated ligation (RML) technology in which the extreme precision of RecA mediated homology searching in double stranded DNA is used to catalyze specific base pairing of oligonucleotide probes at the STR locus with subsequent ligation into specific products that reflect the length of the STR locus. Gene Check has discovered that RML can operate efficiently when one of the oligonucleotides is immobilized to a microarray slide, making high order multiplexing of the RML-STR technology feasible and practical. Signal amplification methods will be employed to allow genotyping directly from double stranded genomic DNA. Success in this project will produce an STR panel that can immediately be used in forensic applications as well as in human paternity and identity testing. The RML-STR system can readily be adapted to livestock, companion animal and wild animal parentage and identity testing and has potential application to diagnosis of medical conditions related to microsattelite sequence expansion.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Gene Check proposes to utilize its RecA mediated ligation technology for STR genotyping (RML-STR) in a microarray format to allow robust, rapid, low cost and automated STR genotyping. This system will be useful for personnel identification in everyday police investigations as well as in a variety of other forensic and non-human identification applications. Medical applications include tissue typing and genetic analysis of triplet repeat associated disorders.",

Advanced diffuse optical tomography (DOT) algorithms require good a priori knowledge of the boundary geometry of the diffuse medium being imaged to provide accurate forward models of light propagation within this medium. To date, there is no known technique for automated extracting complete 3600 3D boundaries with accurate and real-time in vivo performance. To address this pressing need in the small animal imaging community, Technest Inc. in collaboration with Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), Harvard Medical School (HMS), and Tufts University propose to use a novel 3D camera ring system for small animal DOT imaging. Instead of using a single camera and a motion stage to acquire multiple images of the animal body surface, the camera ring can simultaneously acquire multiple (16) surface images in vivo and automatically generate 3D surface model of the animal. The 3D model provides accurate geometric boundary information for the DOT subsystem. The distinguished advantages of our proposed imaging system include:   Automated complete 3600 coverage of small animal (mouse) body surface;   High speed and In vivo imaging capability;   Minimal post processing;   Coherent integration of 3D surface data with multi-spectral DOT imaging modality;   Compact and low-cost design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed 3600 3D Camera Ring enhanced DOT system represents a new image modality that has a direct impact on preclinical molecular imaging in the area of non-invasive optical imaging.

Nano-cellulose networks produced by the bacteria Acetobacter xylinum are biomaterials with unique hydrogel-like properties and biocompatibility that are ideal for cartilage tissue replacement.  This technology is based on a new biofabrication process, in which bacterial motion is precisely controlled in an electric field to form nano-cellulose networks of desired morphology. Earlier feasibility studies have demonstrated bacterial cellulose deposition at the nanoscale during biaxial motion of bacteria in an electric field and the ability to control the assembly of cellulose layers into any desired three-dimensional architecture and control biomechanical properties. This Phase II project will develop a microweaver bioreactor for fabrication of customizable meniscus implants based on radiology images from patients. The structure and biomechanical properties will be evaluated in knee-model and compared with native meniscus. Biocompatibility and long term performance will be evaluated in large animal model studies. \nThe broader/commercial impact of this Phase II project, if successful, is the availability of meniscus implants that mimic the structure of the natural meniscus to address knee-joint failures, estimated to affect 15+ million people worldwide each year.  Each year, in the US, more than 1 million people undergo meniscus surgery. Irreparable meniscus injuries often progress and lead to osteoarthritis. Currently, there is no satisfactory solution for irreparable meniscus injuries.  The potential market for a meniscus implant is more than $3 billion. By developing a meniscus implant that can substitute for the injured native meniscus, it will be possible to prevent osteoarthritis and its related huge economic costs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Portable Gas Perfusion System for Pancreas Preservation. A Phase II SBIR program is proposed to further develop the novel pancreas preservation technique and system for future implementation with human pancreata for clinical islet transplantation. Methods to enhance preservation of pancreata with resulting improvements in islet yield and quality, and ultimately in clinical outcome, are urgently needed to move the field of islet transplantation forward for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Arterial persufflation of the pancreas during storage to provide oxygen throughout the organ at the capillary level was shown in Phase I to be feasible, promising and superior to the current state-of-the-art. Persufflation is a term for perfusing an organ with a gas stream to provide oxygen. In Phase I, pancreata were preserved for up to 24 hours and had superior quality (by histology, microscopy and quantitative islet quality measurements) to those stored with the standard two layer method. This SBIR Phase II program plans to concurrently provide the advanced engineering equipment and the advanced research demonstrations of the effectiveness of pancreatic persufflation as a superior organ preservation technique. The project combines the expertise of Giner, Inc., an engineering RandD firm, and the University of Minnesota Schulze Diabetes Institute, a leading pancreatic islet transplantation center. The Specific Aims of the Phase II program are to: 1) fabricate persufflator prototypes; 2) develop an integrated, portable persufflation system: the Pancreas Preservation System; 3) demonstrate that persufflation during cold preservation can extend pancreas preservation time; 4) demonstrate that persufflation after standard cold preservation can improve islet quality; 5) fabricate 10 integrated, portable persufflation systems; and 6) demonstrate Pancreas Preservation System with shipments. The Ph II work now includes persufflation of human pancreata, as very promising preliminary work with human organs was performed in Ph I. Inclusion of human pancreata testing in Ph II research effort brings persufflation preservation closer to the final clinical application in human islet allotransplantation. Porcine pancreata are also used in some tasks, as they remain an excellent model and their procurement can be scheduled; there is also a long term clinical application in human islet xenotranplantation. The oxygen persufflation system will be reliable, easy-to-use, transportable, and will provide a complete, patented system for standardized use in the islet transplantation community. The overall project goal is to provide commercial equipment for pancreas storage and shipment with a new persufflation preservation protocol. Furthermore, the oxygen persufflation system can be readily adapted for use in preservation and transport of other organs, including the liver, kidney and heart. Customers for this product will include transplantation centers, islet isolation centers, and Organ Procurement Organizations.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Phase II SBIR project continues to develop technology for improved preservation of donor pancreata by oxygenation. Pancreatic islets are isolated from donor pancreata and used in allogenic islet transplantation, an experimental procedure for treating severe cases of Type-I diabetes. Improved pancreas preservation (increased storage time, increased islet yield and quality) is important to the clinical outcome of islet transplantation.",

Ammonia is considered an important pollutant due to its role as a precursor in fine particulate matter formation and its impact on ecological nitrogen balance. Therefore, various federal agencies such as the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) have shown strong interest and support to develop, test and verify appropriate ammonia monitoring instrumentation. There is a wide range of potential applications for an inexpensive and selective ammonia monitor because of the impact of ammonia on human health and the need to control ammonia emissions to the atmosphere.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT  Among inhibitors of Gram+ DNA polymerases IIIC and IIIE, several compounds are active against multiple strains of the anaerobic Gram+ bacterium Clostridium difficile (Cdiff). The compounds appear to be selective for Cdiff compared with other Gram+ anaerobes and aerobes, and a lead compound - 2-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)- 7-(5-morpholinylpentyl)guanine or 359E - is active orally in protecting hamsters from lethal Cdiff infection. The compounds of interest are poorly absorbed orally and too weak to be developed for systemic use against Gram+ aerobe infections. Compound 359E and analogs are tertiary amines, readily form water soluble salts, and are highly effective against Cdiff in vitro and in vivo. Given the increasing prevalence of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), including that from highly virulent, toxin-overproducing and/or antibiotic- resistant strains, the need for new and selective antibacterials to treat this disease is growing. Our phase II results strongly suggest that development of the lead compound or an alternative as an oral treatment for Cdiff diarrhea in human patients will result in a novel, first in class drug to treat this emerging infectious disease.  The specific aims of the competing renewal of this project are focused on preclinical development of 359E or a closely related lead compound (LC). The aims are to: 1, scale up and begin process development for 359E; 2, determine the mechanism of action, selectivity, anticlostridial spectrum, and resistance development of 359E; 3, determine oral safety, anti-clostridial efficacy, and absorption of 359E in the hamster; 4, synthesize and screen analogs of 359E as backup LC compounds, and designate a candidate for development (CD). Once this has occurred, IND-enabling studies will commence. These include: 5, in vitro ADME studies; 6, preclincal analytical, toxicology and toxicokinetic studies; 7, safety pharmacology and genotoxicity studies; 8, cGMP production of the CD. Once all preclinical studies have been completed, aim 9 will encompass preparation an IND application for the CD as oral treatment for CDAD.  Incidence of CDAD is on the rise in the United States and Europe, and Cdiff is the major identified infectious cause of nosocomial diarrhea in patients to whom antibiotics had been previously administered. Vancomycin and metronidazole are first-line therapy for treatment of CDAD, but there have been reports of treatment failure and CDAD recurrence after treatment with metronidazole, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has discouraged vancomycin for treatment of CDAD in hospitals to minimize the risk of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and staphylococci. Various treatments are in clinical trials and preclinical development for Cdiff infections, ranging from direct-acting antibacterials to vaccines and compounds to neutralize Cdiff toxins. The results of our phase II studies indicated the strong likelihood that a DNA polymerase III inhibitor will be an effective and non-toxic oral treatment of CDAD.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adherence of pathogens to their host cells is the obligatory first step of infection and is frequently mediated by specific molecular interactions [1][2]. Virulent Campylobacter species, Vibrio cholerae, enteropathogenic E.coli (EPEC), enterohemorrhagic E.coli (EHEC) and pathogenic strains of Norwalk virus, the leading bacterial and viral causes of human infectious diarrhea [3], adhere to gut epithelial surfaces through binding to 1(1,2) fucosylated cellular receptors[4][5]. 1(1,2) fucosylated glycans, which are abundant in human breast milk[6][7], have been shown both in vitro and in vivo effectively to prevent binding and infection by these pathogens[4][5]. These molecules therefore represent a new class of agent with potential to prevent infectious diarrhea, a condition that is the cause annually of over 2 million deaths worldwide [8]. However the production of 1(1,2) fucosylated glycans as anti-infective agents in sufficient quantities to impact global diarrhea incidence remains a significant challenge. Chemical syntheses are possible, but are limited by stereo-specificity issues, product impurities, and high overall cost[9][10][11]. In vitro enzymatic syntheses are also possible but are limited by a requirement for expensive nucleotide-sugar precursors. Glycosyn Inc.lt s broad goal is to develop ways to manufacture 1(1,2) fucosylated glycans cheaply and in bulk through microbial fermentation, and three classes of potential anti-infective products are envisaged: 1) purified 1(1,2) fucosylated oligosaccharides, 2) yeast strains expressing 1(1,2) fucosylated glycans on their cell surface, and 3) purified 1(1,2) fucosylated glycoproteins. [[[The goal of the studies outlined in this application are to produce in the dairy yeast Kluyveromyces lactis an example of the first of these product classes, namely a purified 1(1,2) fucosylated oligosaccharide, 22-fucosyllactose (22-FL), in sufficient amounts to test this moleculelt s efficacy as a single agent in in vitro and in vivo infection models. Glycan synthetic pathways in Kluyveromyces lactis will be engineered through a combination of endogenous gene manipulation and the introduction of heterologous genes encoding desired activities. Specifically, K.lactis will be engineered to synthesize the key precursor sugar, GDP-fucose, and subsequently to make 22-fucosyllactose in the cell cytoplasm. A subsequent goal is to increase the yield of 2lt -fucolsyllactose recovered from K.lactis to approach levels that will be required for commercialization. To achieve this the production of 2lt fucosyllactose will be increased by manipulating cellular levels of synthetic enzymes and precursor pools, balancing 2;-FL production with overall cell viability and growth performance under bioreactor conditions.]]]        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Worldwide, infectious diarrhea[12] is responsible for approximately 20% of all mortality in children under the age of 5, and for an estimated 2 million deaths annually[8]. In the developing world bacterial infections cause more than 50% of all cases of diarrhea, and of these, infections by Campylobacter and diarrheagenic E.coli together account for about half. Campylobacter is the most common cause of culture-proven bacterial gastroenteritis in both developed and developing countries, and is responsible for 400 to 500 million cases of diarrhea each year. By far the highest incidence of Campylobacter infections is in children lt 5 yrs of age[13][14][15].  Unfortunately, prevention and treatment options for bacterial diarrhea are limited. Vaccines are currently unavailable, and if developed, would be costly and of limited availability in rural poor populations where unmet need is highest. Moreover vaccines are typically pathogen-specific, but infectious diarrhea can be caused by numerous diverse pathogens. The use of antibiotics for treatment of diarrhea is also becoming increasingly problematic, since such use is driving the emergence of resistant strains. For example, clinical isolates of Campylobacter are now often resistant to quinolones [16] and erythromycin-resistant strains are rapidly emerging [17]. Conventional antimicrobial agents are designed to inhibit a pathogenlt s replication and growth, yet they do nothing to make a pathogenlt s environmental niche unavailable. Thus emerging resistant strains are readily able to proliferate and spread. Research is needed to develop new classes of anti-infective agent that are both broad-acting and that use a different approach to avoid the development of resistance; for example novel anti-adhesion agents such as those described in this application. The anti-adhesive 1(1,2) fucosylated oligosaccharides described here will not drive resistance, since they exert no selective pressure on pathogens by merely depriving them of their environmental niche. Moreover these anti-infectives will simultaneously target multiple enteropathogens, including C.jejuni [4], ETEC E.coli [18], Vibrio cholerae [19][4] and others [5][20].",

        "abstract": "America's dependence on foreign oil has severe economic, national security and environmental consequences. The development of alternative fuels and renewable energy can alleviate these problems. The USDA has established research on renewable energy as a high priority. Cellulosic ethanol from bioenergy crops like switchgrass has the potential to become an important component of America's effort to reduce its dependence on foreign oil. As an additional benefit, replacing fossil fuels with biofuels will lessen the buildup of greenhouse gases. To gain access to commercial markets, biofuels must become cost-competitive with fossil fuels. This will require improvements in refining technologies to efficiently convert cellulose to ethanol along with improvements in the agronomic productivity of biofuel crops, particularly under conditions of limiting nutrients and water. Roots play a critical role in the growth and development of all plants. In addition to providing anchorage, roots are the primary site of nutrient and water acquisition. To perform these tasks, the primary roots extend into soil and produce additional branching roots that originate from internal tissues. The network of the different types of roots on a single plant is known as its root system architecture. It is well established that plant root system architecture is correlated with agronomic productivity under limiting conditions.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence in the United States of metabolic disease resulting from inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) is estimated to be up to 1 in 3500 infants, and the impact on families where diseases are undetected in newborns can be devastating. Although the benefits of newborn screening for such diseases has been demonstrated, technical challenges are limiting their broader application. Two specific challenges have been identified by the American College of Medical Genetics, that could significantly improve newborn screening, are i) the discovery of new biomarker tests for IEM diseases for which tests are currently nonexistent and ii) the improvement of biomarker screening for current tests that have high false-positive rates. To address these two challenges, we propose to leverage the full range of metabolite measurements that are currently available from high-throughput data acquisition methods and predict biomarker signatures that are superior to single biomarker screens using our proprietary computational in silico metabolic modeling platform. Classical development of new screens has been data-driven, requiring hundreds of thousands of patient data points for a statistical analysis. This top-down approach has led to the two shortcomings mentioned. Our computational platform offers a mechanistically-based calculation of biomarkers using a bottom-up pathway-based approach to reconstruct the full metabolic content of human cells and then determine the functional and physiological impacts of IEM diseases. Using this approach, we can directly calculate multiple candidate metabolite biomarkers in human biofluids that change with a given IEM disease and predict entire disease biomarker signatures. In our Phase I effort, we developed the computational models and methods needed to predict biomarker signatures for a subset of IEM diseases and produced extremely promising results (approximately 90% accuracy in predicting known biomarkers for the collected set of diseases). We now propose in a Phase II effort, to i) expand the in silico model we currently have of the human hepatocyte metabolism to increase its scope and application to IEM diseases, ii.) advance and validate the biomarker signature computational algorithm to increase its accuracy with focused enhancements, and iii.) generate new biomarker signatures for targeted IEM diseases and utilize retrospective and prospective data to confirm the new biomarker signatures. These validated biomarker signatures will then be commercialized through partnerships with commercial laboratories currently performing newborn screening and/or with vendors of the measurement equipment. Success in generating new biomarker signatures for diagnostic screens is supported by our team of scientists who have been working in the field of metabolic modeling for over a decade, as well as our scientific, clinical, and commercial contractors. The developed biomarker platform of this Phase II program also has significant implications in the areas of identification and validation of biomarkers for cancer (and resulting products for use as diagnostics, therapy selection, and monitoring aids), toxicology and safety testing, and drug discovery",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Each year, there are over 10,000 newborns diagnosed with hydrocephalus in the United States. Hydrocephalus, an excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the head, is a lifelong disease with no known cure. Fortunately, hydrocephalus can be managed with CSF shunts which redirect excessive CSF elsewhere in the body. Unfortunately, 30-40% of shunts fail in the first year and blockages are the most common cause. Therefore, to reduce the risk of sustaining permanent brain damage or blindness, rapid diagnosis of shunt failure is critically important. The current protocol for detecting shunt failure is time-consuming and expensive since it relies on symptom diagnosis, brain scans, and percutaneous shunt tapping. Consequently, our ultimate objective is to develop an ambulatory system that can rapidly detect shunt failure without brain scans and invasive procedures, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. To accomplish this, shunts will be mounted with micro-miniature pressure sensors that are implantable, communicate outside the body wirelessly, and require no batteries. The sensors are strategically placed in the shunt using innovative packaging techniques, thus requiring no additional invasive surgical procedures for implantation. Wireless communications are performed through a low-power (microwatt) mutual inductive coupling between a handheld reader and the sensor. Building upon the successful Phase I feasibility project, the Specific Aims of the proposed Phase II project are to: (1) Optimize the wireless pressure sensor and readout electronics for in vivo ambulatory use. Sensor enhancements will be implemented and verified through modeling, microfabrication, and performance characterization. (2) Establish biocompatibility of sensor materials. All constituent sensor and packaging materials will be examined for biocompatibility using an in vivo, statistically significant animal study. (3) Demonstrate accurate intracranial pressure (ICP) measurements and detection of shunt failure. Wireless sensors will be acutely and chronically tested against standard, commercially-available, wired ICP probes using an in vivo canine model. For demonstration of shunt failure detection, wireless sensors will be examined in both an in vitro setup and an in vivo canine model for 12 months. Successful completion of the Phase II project would provide a clear pathway for Phase III commercialization. The ultimate product implementation will give hydrocephalus sufferers and their families a sense of security by providing them with an ambulatory system that can rapidly detect current shunt failures and predict future ones.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:         Each year in the U.S., there are over 10,000 newborns diagnosed with hydrocephalus ( water on the brain ), a lifelong disease with no known cure that can fortunately be treated with a shunt that redirects fluid in the brain to another location within the human body. The shunt, consisting of two catheters and a pressure regulated valve, however, are prone to malfunction, putting the hydrocephalic patient at risk of sustaining permanent brain injury. The ultimate goal of the proposed SBIR project is to apply novel technologies to develop a system which can monitor shunt functionality, resulting in better patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs.",

        "abstract": "Prior to injection into a proton accelerator, GeV energy Hydrogen negative ions must be ionized with good efficiency.  Presently used carbon foil strippers become radioactive and produce uncontrolled beam loss which limits the performance of high intensity proton sources.  Laser assisted stripping of the electrons is an alternative method which has been demonstrated in proof-of-principle experiments.  Laser excitation of the neutral atoms prepares the atoms for subsequent ionization in a magnetic field, and for this megaWatt peak powers are required.  6 This proposal describes a Fabry-Perot cavity which is capable of storing energy (stacking laser pulses) when resonant with the incident laser light. This power recycling multiplies the incident laser power to create fields that are sufficiently intense (MW peak powers) to excite the hydrogen atoms with high probability.  The research in Phases 1 and 2 examines the mirror requirements for the extremely high circulating power, the cavity configuration to create a sufficiently large diameter beam, and ultra-high vacuum-compatible design.  7 In phase 1, we made sure that the mirrors would be able to operate with the kW of average circulating light power in the cavity without deformation from absorbed power that would reduce the circulating power.  This was done by measuring the fractional power absorption of mirror coatings near 355 nm, and finite element models of the mirror thermal expansion.  The large mode size required was modeled and designed, and the cavity design tested and shown to perform well.  Mirror damage thresholds were measured.  8 In phase 2 we will build a prototype cavity, and lock a high-power pulsed laser to the cavity to attain MW peak pulse powers.  We will quantify the mode distortion from absorbed power, and examine the performance of different mirror coatings.  Attention to the materials used and the design will allow ultra-high vacuum cleaning techniques to be used to avoid mirror contamination issues.  9 Power buildup cavities for short-pulse lasers is a rapidly developing field, with applications in commercial spectroscopy systems for gas and molecule detection and recognition in industrial and medical systems, scientific spectroscopy, compact particle accelerators, cavity-dumped systems for short-pulse power increase in scientific uses, as well as part of the process of the stripping of electrons from Hydrogen atoms in particle accelerators.  10 power buildup, Fabry-Perot, 355 nm, mirror absorption 11 Very High power laser beams for multiphoton processes and saturation of weak resonances in atoms and molecules may be attained by stacking pulses in a power buildup resonant Fabry-Perot cavity, taking into consideration the problems posed by very high powers such as mirror damage and distortion, and vacuum contamination by attraction of contaminants into the beam.  Use of low absorption mirror coatings on selected substrate materials, along with ultra-high vacuum cleaning processes, allow the pulse stacking to multiply the laser power to megaWatt levels for use in Hydrogen ionization",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) combine to form an urgent healthcare challenge facing the aging population of 21st Century America. In the U.S. during 2008, one person received an ADRD diagnosis every 71 seconds; by 2050, that number will be one every 33 seconds. Authorities cited in the body of this application report ADRD are the third most costly disease sets in the U.S. In spite of ongoing research efforts, at present there is no way to prevent onset of ADRD, and death is the only certain cure. Caregiving options are complicated because the cognitive and physical declines of those with late-stage ADRD differ for each person, and no single care routine or protocol is predictably effective. Further, the challenges associated with late-stage ADRD care cause immense stress and increased burden to Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs). Many medical directors and other ADRD facility professionals often lack either the preparation or the time to respond to CNAs' requests for help in managing patient care with those in late-stage ADRDs. Various authorities experienced in ADRD care, however, suggest measurable positive effects result when CNAs receive ongoing education and skill training in this area. This Phase II effort aims therefore to educate CNAs in the knowledge and skills they need to care effectively for those in late-stage ADRD decline and to do so through an innovative, Internet-based training program presenting 10 topical module hours of challenging, informative, application-based curriculum. This product exceeds traditional passive methods of CNA education and in-service training and provides instead multi-media features such as interviews, care models, real-life streaming videos, and online interaction. Through this training program, CNAs gain convenient, 24/7, private access to an entire team of intervention consultants and therapeutic support specialists experienced in managing late-stage ADRD-related care. The dispersed effects of improved CNA practice may also facilitate a multi-level intervention with power to affect in many positive ways the care recipients themselves as well as their loved ones. In addition to its strong commercial potential, the proposed Phase II training product has the capacity to benefit public health in venues as diverse as long-term care facilities, assisted-living facilities, community colleges, military and veterans' hospitals and services, medical offices, healthcare agencies, and both rural and urban healthcare settings. During Phase II, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) will test efficacy of the completed intervention, and commercialization will be undertaken during Phase III. Given the applicant organization's collaboration with the national office of the Alzheimer's Association, one of the parallel benefits of all phases of this effort may well be the reduction of both direct and indirect costs of ADRD to U.S. health care systems.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed effort is relevant to the nation's public health because during 2008, 5.2 million Americans of all ages have Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), which translates to one ADRD diagnosis every 71 seconds (Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures, 2008, p. 8). The economic cost of ADRD includes  148 billion in direct costs to Medicare and Medicaid (not including the costs paid for by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, private health care, and long-term care insurance), and an estimated  267 billion savings to the national healthcare system because 9.8 million family members deliver at least 70 percent of the care for those with ADRD at home without reimbursement instead of in nursing homes. Further, late-stage ADRD care is strongly associated with psychosocial costs to caregivers, who must respond directly to residents in the cognitive declines characteristic of late-stage dementia (Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures, 2008).",

        "abstract": "The current state of the art of soybean processing requires heat processing to eliminate anti-nutrition factors and make the protein available for digestion. The proposed research will investigate the opportunity to process a new soybean variety that has been traditionally bred (not genetically modified) to eliminate and/or significantly reduce these anti-nutrition factors. This research will investigate applying new and new-to-this-use, simpler, ambient or cool, less energy intensive processing in combination with these new soybean varieties to create feeds and feed ingredients with improved protein quality. Applying ambient processing technologies to these soybeans to deliver the next generation of soybean food ingredients and/or feed components is a key step in realizing the full commercial benefit of this material. Proof of concept work has been conducted in various university labs using bench-top processes (Herkelman, 1992) that must be validated with research and development using small pilot-plant and commercial scale processes. In this Phase II project we will again use small-scale processing to further the validation of the concept with the next generation of low trypsin inhibitor soybean and reduced oligosaccharide soybean. We will complete digestibility studies on the second generation RTI soybean in poultry and swine and with reduced oligosaccharides (ROS) soybeans in poultry. This will be followed by controlled, lab-scale feeding trials in swine and poultry research facilities at collaborating universities to validate the acceptability of ambient processed soybeans in monogastric diets. Then, in year two, we?ll scale up to pre-commercial feeding trials with livestock feeders as larger quantities of these soybeans become available ? to demonstrate commercial viability in preparation for commercial rollout in 2012-13. This will scale up to truckload quantities and allow validation of both commercial processing and feed efficacy. In summary, this research and development will demonstrate and validate the combined benefits of reduced trypsin inhibitor (RTI) soybeans, low oligosaccharide (LOS) soybeans, and ambient, non-thermal temperature processing to create a new generation of soy ingredients for feed (and possible future food) use by means that require less energy use than conventional soy products.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has been shown to be one of the best technologies for the evaluation of cardiovascular pathologies. The broad application of this promising technology is expected to significantly improve the treatment of patients with heart disease in general and ischemic heart diseases in particular. However, widespread adoption of this beneficial technology has been held back by the lack of both software infrastructure and specific soft- ware sequences that take advantage of this infrastructure to provide a complete ischemic examination that can be performed rapidly in the clinical environment. The aim of this application is to develop a commercial robust cardiovascular subsystem that will enable the broad application of this technology to the clinical realm.  Under previous NIH grant support through Stanford University, we have established real-time rapid imaging sequences for the assessment of wall motion and perfusion. We have also established the utility and accuracy of rapid coronary imaging sequences for the assessment of proximal coronary anatomy. Our goal in this proposal is to integrate these methods into a robust ischemic heart disease system to realize the clinical potential of cardiac MRI in the evaluation of coronary artery disease.  During Phase I of this proposal, HeartVista developed and tested the alpha version of the cardiovascular software infrastructure that provides an integrated environment for rapid cardiovascular imaging. This package includes real-time evaluation of myocardial function under stress conditions, volumetric perfusion imaging, high resolution examination of myocardial viability in real-time and high-resolution examination of the proximal coronary anatomy. We installed the system at selected alpha sites and collected patient data.  Generally, our methods concern obtaining adequate temporal resolution, spatial coverage, and contrast production for stress imaging using customized pulse sequences and hardware to reduce data acquisition time,  7 developing a underlying real-time imaging platform that allows the seamless real-time integration of receiver coil  functions, pulse sequences, and post-processing and display that optimizes the workflow for studying patients  with ischemia. This proposal focuses on developing and validating this combined examination to provide the clinician a robust and intuitive complete ischemic evaluation package that can be performed comfortably in less than 1 hour.  During Phase II of this proposal, we will continue the development of our product based on the feedback obtained during Phase I and we will conduct a clinical study to demonstrate the non-inferiority of our product compared with conventional cardiovascular MRI examinations in robustness and diagnostic accuracy.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ischemic heart disease remains the number one cause of mortality in the United States. Current diagnostic techniques have significant shortcomings that can result in inaccurate diagnoses. The reduced accuracy leads to a large number of unnecessary procedures. Given the enormous number of these procedures, even a modest improvement in diagnostic accuracy will have a large public-health impact.  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has been shown to be one of the best technologies for the evaluation of cardiovascular pathologies. It is the only imaging modality that could provide all of the important parameters of ischemia evaluation in function, perfusion, viability and coronary anatomy in a single examination. The broad application of this promising technology is expected to significantly improve the treatment of patients with heart disease in general and ischemic heart diseases in particular. However, the adoption of this beneficial technology has been held back by the lack of both a software infrastructure and specific software sequences that take advantage of this infrastructure to provide a complete ischemic examination that can be performed rapidly in the clinical environment.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Liver toxicity is the leading cause of pre-launch and post-market attrition of pharmaceutical compounds (i.e. Rezulin, Prexige). Significant species-specific differences in organ functions now necessitate supplementation of animal data with assays designed to assess human responses to drugs. Adherent cultures of primary human hepatocytes are considered to be the gold standard for evaluating preclinical drug metabolism, enzyme induction, and liver-specific toxicity. However, hepatocytes display a rapid (hours) decline in liver-specific functions under conventional culture conditions utilized routinely for drug development. Recently, a robust model of human liver tissue has been developed with optimized microscale architecture in an industry-standard multiwell format that retains liver-specific functions for 4-6 weeks in vitro. Hepatocytes in this microscale platform secrete liver-specific products, display functional CYP450 and conjugation enzymes, secrete molecules into the bile canaliculi, and maintain high levels of expression of liver-specific genes relevant for evaluating drug disposition. The primary objective of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to further develop and optimize these microscale human liver cultures and couple them with miniaturization strategies and assay technologies for cost-effective high-throughput in vitro screening. Since drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a leading cause of acute liver failures and the high attrition rate of pharmaceuticals, we will optimize our miniaturized human livers specifically for the in vitro screening of genotype-specific and clinically-relevant drug disposition and coupled DILI. The technologies we develop here may find broad utility in the development of several classes of therapeutic compounds (drugs, biologics), in evaluating the disposition and injury potential of environmental toxicants, in fundamental investigations of liver physiology and disease, in the identification of new biomarkers, and in personalized medicine for liver disease. In the future, continued combination of microtechnology with tissue engineering may spur the development of other tissue models and their integration into the so-called 'human-on-a-chip'.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The studies proposed in this project are aimed towards developing a miniaturized human liver microarray for high-throughput screening (HTS) applications, specifically for evaluating drug disposition and drug-induced liver injury, a serious challenge for patients, regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical/biotech industry. In the future, our miniaturized micro-liver HTS system may eliminate problematic compounds much earlier in the drug development pipeline towards reducing patient exposure to unsafe drugs. The technologies we develop here may also find utility in assessing the injury potential of environmental toxicants, in basic research, and in personalized medicine for patients with liver disease.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lack of effective therapeutics for CNS malignancies led to our long term scientific interest in brain cancers and to our previous discoveries and preclinical development of two other small molecules of distinctly different classes (a topoisomerase II inhibitor-WP744 and an inhibitor of tumor cell metabolism-WP1122) specifically directed at the treatment of CNS malignancies. Currently, WP744 is in Phase II clinical trials following a very successful Phase I study. We have subsequently focused our interest on the unique molecular target Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) and obtained funding through a Phase I SBIR grant. Our very promising results, supported by our numerous publications, led to the selection of WP1066 for further preclinical and clinical development leading to submission of this Phase II SBIR grant proposal.  STAT3 is a molecular hub controlling the transcription of a wide array of genes important to the survival and proliferation of tumor cells. P-STAT3 is among the most frequently activated oncogenic proteins in multiple solid tumor types and has been shown to be persistently activated in most human cancers. More specifically, a large body of data has demonstrated activation of the typically quiescent p-STAT3 pathway is crucial to tumorigenesis and a predictor of poor prognosis in many malignancies including gastric, renal, breast ovarian, squamous, hepatocellular carcinoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, melanoma and gliomas. In addition to regulating growth and proliferation, STATs are intimately involved in the regulation of immune function. We have identified a number of profound immunological suppressive factors including Tregs, immunosuppressive cytokines, and microglia that induce T cell anergy in the microenvironment of cancer cells. This finding suggests that even if a vigorous systemic immune response were generated to an antigen target, upon encountering the tumor microenvironment these responses would be rendered functionally inert. Currently available immune activators are insufficient to overcome this immune tolerance and immunosuppression. However, a novel small molecular inhibitor of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has demonstrated marked immune activation properties in this setting in vivo, and could be employed to potently synergize with immunotherapies for patients with cancer.  Our novel small molecule inhibitor of the STAT3 activation pathway, WP1066, possesses drug- like characteristics, is orally bioavailable, crosses the blood-brain barrier, and demonstrates in vivo activity, including immune activation, in a variety of preclinical tumor models. Given this high degree of efficacy we propose studies focused on IND-directed preclinical development of this novel, first in class drug to treat CNS malignancies.  The specific aims of this proposal are focused on completion of preclinical testing of WP1066 in order to rapidly start the first in man clinical trials and include: 1) scale-up synthesis and process development for the production of API, 2) further determination of the mechanism of action, selectivity, possible resistance mechanisms of WP1066, 3) determination of the oral safety profile and absorption of WP1066, 4) synthesize and screen putative metabolites of WP1066 for safety and efficacy, 5) development and validation of a quantitative analytical methodology, 6) defining the ADME, 7) determination of dose-scheduling and performing safety pharmacology, toxicology, and toxicokinetic studies, and 8) writing the IND application for WP1066 as a treatment for CNS malignancies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite multimodality therapeutic strategies employed over the past three decades, the overall survival time for glioblastoma multiforme is still less than 14 months. Due to the invasiveness of these tumors and their association with critical brain structures, complete surgical ablation is not possible and adjuvant therapy, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, while required still has minimal impact on the disease. Results from our SBIR Phase I studies indicated the strong likelihood that an inhibitor of STAT3 activation (such as WP1066) would be an effective inducer of cancer cell death and positive modulator of immune activation in the local environment of CNS tumors.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcoholic Liver Disease (ALD) is caused by excessive long term consumption of alcohol via increased oxidative stress, reduction of oxygen to liver tissue (hypoxia), altered fat metabolism, increased pro-inflammatory signaling molecules (or cytokines), and increased inflammation. ALD begins with increased fat deposit in the liver. With continued excessive alcohol consumption, disease severity increases as the inflammatory component accelerates, leading to the disease states referred to as alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) or alcoholic hepatitis (AH). Persistent alcohol consumption then leads to extensive liver cell death and fibrosis (scarring). Extensive fibrosis results in cirrhosis and ultimately liver failure necessitating liver transplantation. It is estimated that more than 2 million people in the U.S. have ALD and in 2006, chronic liver disease with cirrhosis was the 12th leading cause of death in the U.S. with ~46% of deaths directly related to alcohol (National Vital Statistics Reports, 2007). The overall cost of health care expenditures associated with alcohol consumption was estimated at  26 billion in 1998 in the U.S. (NIAAA website). Cardax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Cardax) is developing a novel, proprietary, orally bioavailable small molecule, Heptax, which exhibits robust anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant activity in relevant animal models of ALD. The compound accumulates in cellular membranes including those of liver mitochondria where much of the pro-inflammatory oxidative stress occurs. Animal studies with oral Heptax as well as human exposure through diet or dietary supplements of the active metabolite have demonstrated an unusually benign safety profile. The goal of this Fast Track Phase I/II SBIR grant is to advance the preclinical development and understanding of Heptax for the treatment of Alcoholic Liver Disease (ALD). Specifically, the grant proposes: 1) 7 day and 4 week toxicity studies of Heptax; 2) expanding the understanding of Heptax in various animal models of liver disease; and 3) pilot plant production (including process development) of the kilogram quantities of Heptax necessary for these studies. The 4 week toxicity study reports would be suitable for inclusion as part of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA to begin human clinical trials. Company personnel are highly qualified to supervise and coordinate this activity. Cardax also has significant in-house bioanalytical capability and will transfer its proprietary bioanalytical methods to the independent contract laboratories that will perform the bioanalysis required by the FDA. Cardax will provide oversight and validation. The additional animal efficacy work will be undertaken in collaboration with experienced investigators with Cardax personnel supplying oversight, co-design, and review capabilities.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alcoholic Liver Disease affects more than 2,000,000 people in the U.S., resulting in significant illness and death with minority groups disproportionately affected. Current treatments are expensive, can have significant side effects, and are only marginally effective. A safer, more efficacious, and economical therapy for this disease would represent a major medical breakthrough for this under-served population.",

        "abstract": "The DOE Office of High Energy Physics (HEP) seeks superconductor development technologies in support of magnets for use in accelerators, storage rings and charged particle beam transport systems.  HEP is interested in improved current lead and current distribution systems based on high-temperature superconductors, such as magnesium diboride (MgB2), for application to superconducting accelerator magnets. MgB2 offers the possibility of the fabrication of long-length strand and cables from inexpensive starting materials using conventional metalworking processes.  An important advantage of MgB2, especially when high radiation exposure is included, is that its critical temperature (Tc) of 39 K provides a high thermal margin.  The two main objectives of the Phase II program are (1) developing MgB2 conductors for meeting the superconducting and mechanical specifications for low field, high amperage, current distribution applications for HEP and (2) demonstrating short lengths of model current distribution sub-cables using the improved conductor design developed in this project.  Wires were fabricated using hot isostatic pressing for improving connectivity and current density.  Strands doped with TiC were fabricated for improving flux pinning and critical currents. Strands with modified strand geometries were demonstrated and one wire bend test was performed to understand and improve strain sensitivity of MgB2 conductors. One model MgB2 cable was fabricated.  We have planned an integrated materials development program that invests significant effort in improving the critical currents of MgB2 superconductors through various methods that aim to improve connectivity.  We will also investigate making wires with nano-powder additions to improve properties and with higher copper content to improve stability.  Modifications to strand geometry and a series of bend tests will be performed to understand and improve the strain sensitivity of MgB2 conductors. Finally, we aim to demonstrate the actual fabrication of MgB2 sub-cables with reacted wire.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The wire and cables developed under this program will have wide ranging benefits.  Improving MgB2 will accelerate the wire being developed for commercial applications such as MRI systems, fault current limiters, transformers, generators, motors and military applications.  Also, magnesium diboride strands with high Tc (thermal margin) and radiation tolerance may find other near-term accelerator applications in the winding of muon colliders, light-source wiggler and undulator magnets.",

Therefore, the IB Neuro 1.0 product makes available, for the first time, advanced and proven algorithms for the analysis of MRI perfusion data in a robust and easy-to-use fashion.  Given this early success, the specific objectives of this Phase II proposal are to extend the functionality of IB NeuroTM in three important ways. First, additional tools will be added to enable comparison of imaging data across studies. This capability is especially important for the most efficient and accurate evaluation of both standard treatments (such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy) and for the newly available and promising biologic agents that target a tumor's new blood vessel growth (angiogenesis). Second, the Company's patented dual-echo perfusion technology will be developed as part of IB Neuro 1.1. With this proprietary technology DSC (dynamic susceptibility contrast) and DCE (dynamic contrast enhanced) perfusion data can be simultaneously collected while using only a single dose of contrast agent. IB Neuro 1.1. will incorporate the tools to generate relevant perfusion parameters including CBV (cerebral blood volume), CBF (cerebral blood flow) as well as Ktrans, a marker of vascular permeability. A third objective is to incorporate the functionality necessary to more specifically support the evaluation of perfusion data for the evaluation of stroke. Each of these product development objectives will be accomplished in the context of receiving frequent feedback from the Company's luminary sites. This will position the Company for the multi-center trials planned for Phase III.  Overall the technological niche of IB, which is to develop advanced imaging analysis tools that plug into existing vendors' systems, will enable advanced imaging options to become more widely available to clinics and therefore patients in a cost-effective manner. The result will be to provide the best and most state-of-the- art patient care on a more widespread basis. This has the potential to shift current clinical practice paradigms with regard to how treatments are planned and monitored, as none of these proven advanced technologies have been previously available on a wide-spread basis.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this Phase II SBIR proposal is to enable the Company, Imaging Biometrics LLC, to continue its development and distribution of innovative and proven perfusion and diffusion analysis software for the evaluation of brain tumors and stroke. While stand-alone options are available, the primary approach is to develop the software to plug into existing vendors' systems. With this approach the best and most up-to-date image analysis software can be made available on a widespread and cost-effective basis, which has the potential to shift current clinical practice paradigms for treatment planning and monitoring.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sophisticated ventricular assist devices (VADs) are now routinely used for bridge to recovery, or bridge to transplant in heart failure patients. However, the success of the VADs' applications in adults has not been translated into that in pediatric application, due to the delays in the miniaturization process of these devices. To date, the need of VADs for infant and child with congenital or acquired cardiovascular disease has largely been unmet. Hundreds of infants and children die each year in the United States while waiting for a donor heart. The goal of this  Fast Track  SBIR application is to develop long-term implantable miniature VADs for infant and child, built upon the success of the current CircuLite Synergy device. The Synergy device is a unique proprietary and patented miniature VAD. Through a decade of development, it has been refined to be the smallest implantable blood pump, only of the size of an  AA  battery. The device is currently undergoing the CE Mark Trial in Europe and pending USFDA IDE submission. The goal of the Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of using the current CircuLite micro-pump (1.5-3 L/min flow) for child (5-35 kg) by modifying the inlet housing of the device for left ventricular apical insertion, while the Phase II project is to demonstrate the feasibility of further modifying the micro-pump (redesigning the impeller or reducing the pump size) to achieve a reduced flow of 0.3-1.5 L/min for use in an infant (lt 5 kg). The milestone of the Phase I project will be the delivery of a child VAD that has undergone short-term animal studies. In Phase II, we will further test the child VAD in long-term animal studies and freeze its design for future preclinical GLP studies. Meanwhile, we will develop the infant VAD and complete its short-term animal studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To date, the need of long-term circulatory support for infant and child with congenital and acquired cardiovascular disease has largely been unmet. The goal of the proposed project is to develop two innovative circulatory support systems for children and infants based upon the unique proprietary and patented CircuLite Synergy Pocket Circulatory Assist Device. The success of these two devices will potentially benefit thousands of infants and children with congenital and acquired cardiovascular disease who otherwise would die each year in the United States while waiting for a donor heart.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a continuation of a successful Phase I SBIR, this Phase II application is directed towards the further development of a novel immunocytokine, named 20-2b, for improved therapy of B-cell lymphomas. In the United States, there were 65,980 new cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and 19,500 deaths from this disease in 2009. Of all B-cell NHL, 55% are of the DLBCL type, only half of which are curable. The remainder comprises indolent lymphomas (45%), none of which are curable. For 75% of all NHL patients newly diagnosed and a higher percentage of those alive at any time with evidence of disease, there remains a need for more effective treatments for these diseases, especially the incurable indolent types. Interferon-alpha-2 (IFNa2) is indicated for the therapy of a variety of hematopoietic and solid tumors. Combination therapy of NHL using IFNa2 and the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (MAb) rituximab is more effective than either agent as a monotherapy. However, the therapeutic potential of IFNa2 has not been fully realized primarily due to its short circulating half-life and systemic toxicity. Fusion of IFNa2 to a MAb markedly increases its circulating half-life, allowing less frequent administration of a single agent at a considerably lower dose than given for each agent in combination therapy. Targeting with an anti-CD20 MAb results in an increased and durable local concentration of IFNa2 at the sites of NHL while limiting its systemic concentration. This approach would significantly limit or eliminate many side effects and may result in an efficacy that is far superior to what is achievable using combination therapy. 20-2b was generated using the Dock-and-Lock (DNL) method to comprise 4 IFNa2b groups site-specifically tethered to the humanized anti-CD20 MAb, veltuzumab, for targeted delivery of IFNa2b to NHL. Successful product and process development, as well as extensive biochemical and biological characterizations of 20-2b were accomplished during Phase I. These very encouraging results reinforce Immunomedics commitment to the clinical investigation and ultimate commercialization of 20-2b. Initial clinical trials will be performed in relapsed/refractory indolent lymphoma, with additional expansion to other forms of NHL once these initial safety/efficacy studies are completed. To fulfill these clinical goals, this Phase II application will be concerned primarily with the finalization of the manufacturing process and the completion of regulatory requirements, which include qualification of master cell banks, validation of the cGMP manufacturing process and production of cGMP lots of 20-2b sufficient for performing safety testing in Cynomolgus monkeys and initial clinical trials. Upon completion, an IND for Phase I clinical trials will be submitted to FDA. Because the safety and efficacy of both IFNa2b and veltuzumab are well established from extensive clinical investigation, there is considerable potential for clinical and commercial success of 20-2b in NHL therapy.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The prototype construct investigated in this project, 20-2b, is a candidate therapeutic biologic agent for the treatment of B-cell malignancies including NHL and CLL, which may be refractory to the current front-line therapies. The lessons learned from this project may eventually lead to the development of additional MAb-IFNa for therapy of a variety of hematopoeitic and solid tumors.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although IQP-0410 possesses a favorable pharmacokinetic, safety pharmacology and toxicity profile, we believe that additional enhancement of biological activity is possible through additional development activities with lead molecules defined as the most active reverse transcriptase and virus entry inhibitors defined in our Phase I SBIR studies. Structure-activity relationship data obtained with the pyrimidinediones from our Phase I SBIR project indicates that a second generation pyrimidinedione may also be expected to meet and potentially exceed these necessary properties for a next generation NNRTI. A number of initial lead compounds with greater entry and RT inhibitory potential and stability have been identified for further development. Based on the results of our Phase I proposal as well as our experience with the development of our current clinical candidate pyrimidinedione IQP-0410, we intend to employ traditional medicinal chemistry to improve the solubility and stability of a new select pyrimidinedione, which will be defined according to parameters including antiviral activity, metabolism, and preformulation characteristics. Upon selection of our second generation pyrimidinedione inhibitor, we will employ formulation science to better deliver the potent, stable and more soluble pyrimidinedione to enhance bioavailability and pharmacokinetics. It is our expectation that this Phase II SBIR effort will yield a significant improvement in the therapeutic utility and potency of our next generation clinical candidate.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the currently approved NNRTIs (nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz and etravirine) are highly potent, significant improvements in therapeutic utility are still required. A new generation of NNRTIs must be developed which will allow once per day dosing, exhibit significantly reduced toxicity, be amenable to dosing in women of child bearing age, and possess a significantly higher genetic barrier to resistance selection. The primary goal of this proposal is to define and begin IND-directed development of a second generation pyrimidinedione clinical therapeutic candidate from among the highly active lead compounds defined during the course of our Phase I project. These selected lead pyrimidinediones have been prioritized based on their relative potential to inhibit both reverse transcription and virus entry and all are sub-nanomolar to low nanomolar concentration inhibitors of HIV-1. Detailed biological evaluation of these molecules will be combined with efforts to optimize the formulation and delivery of a new lead molecule, as well as the use of medicinal chemistry to improve the solubility, stability, and bioavailability of the selected compound. Comparative evaluation of compound metabolism and protein binding will also be utilized to help prioritize and define the next generation pryimidinedione clinical candidate possessing highly optimized pharmacokinetic properties and the highest possible potency against wild type, NNRTI-resistant and MDR viruses.",

        "abstract": "Oil and coolant drips, leaks and spills from vehicles, machines, oil transfer units and a myriad of business and personal activities account for nearly 36% of petroleum waste that is polluting the Nations surface water, ground water, surface soil and sub-soil. (U.S. Department of the Interior Minerals Management Service, 2009). The usual clean up method of these drips and spills, on a hard surface, is the use of clay granules or polypropylene sheets. Clay is inefficient as an absorbent and poses expensive and potentially harmful disposal challenges. Polypropylene sorbents are more efficient but are expensive and are made from petroleum that, thus, creates its own disposal problems. While no hard data exists, antidotal evidence indicates that as much as 60 to 70 percent of the clay based and polypropylene sorbents sold are not disposed of in accordance with local or Federal laws. The use of clay or polypropylene based absorbents both do their part to deplete non-renewable resources that have other uses. For instance, polypropylene is manufactured from crude oil. Few would argue that crude oil has better uses than as a waste oil absorbent. Clay mined for use as an absorbent, like crude oil, is also a finite resource. As an example, Oil Dri Corporation of America, the largest supplier of clay based absorbent, notes in their 2008 Annual Report that they anticipate their clay reserves will last only about 40 years based on 2008 mining rates. (Oil Dri Corp. p.14) In the same document they point our that the clay, sometimes called fuller's earth, is also used for cat litter, bleaching and clarifying tasks, as carriers for agricultural chemicals and as a purifying agent in animal feed. (Oil Dri Corp. p.12) The replacement of clay based absorbents with renewable stover granules would extend for many years the supply of fuller's earth for other uses. Thus, the extensive use of clay, diatomaceous earth and polypropylene based absorbents present economic and environmental problems on several levels. Their widespread use also creates the opportunity to develop effective solutions to these problems. At a macro-level, the opportunity for this project is to displace ineffective and hazardous absorbents (clay, diatomaceous earth and polypropylene) with a highly absorptive, bio-based absorbent. In order to capturing a significant portion of the United States' $2 Billion absorbent market (Magnani 1998) the Applicant's research concluded that the newly developed absorbent would have to be designed so that consumers would not have to change their spill clean up practices in any way. Thus, the opportunity of this research project presents is to continue the development of a modular agglomeration system which transforms delicate corn stover fibers into highly absorptive, free flowing, granules uniquely capable of displacing inefficient clay absorbents in the market place.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of every five adults in the United States (46.4 million people) is affected by arthritis. Increasing the number of days individuals are free of arthritis pain is one of the Healthy People 2010 objectives. Although there are a variety of medical treatments and medications available, self-management is a critical component in helping arthritis sufferers learn how to identify, avoid, and help manage their pain. Unfortunately, clinicians face significant time pressure, leaving little time for desired patient-provider education and collaboration. This is an important omission as tailored advice (e.g., specific exercises to reduce pain) from health providers could enable behavior change and improve outcomes. Therefore, widely accessible and tailored interventions that address motivational issues are needed to facilitate self-management education among arthritis patients. Because of its reach across demographic groups, the Internet is an excellent vehicle for offering a self- management program to arthritis sufferers. We propose to develop an interactive, online pain self- management program for adults who suffer from pain associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, Ankylosing spondylitis, and other arthritic conditions (e.g., psoriatic arthritis) using principles from Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1977, 1997). This online health intervention, painACTION: Arthritis, will provide clinically reliable information about diagnosis, treatment, and management of arthritis, written for health consumers in a clear and engaging manner to help increase their skills and confidence to use self- management strategies. Moreover, it will be designed to complement and connect to our other SBIR- supported pain online health interventions (chronic back pain, migraine pain, neuropathic pain) to be a more comprehensive resource for those seeking pain management assistance. The most unique aspect of painACTION: Arthritis is that it includes three technological innovations -- a Web 2.0-enabled platform, a Custom Recommendation Engine, and Dynamic Lessons - to help people self manage their arthritis pain. In Phase I we accomplished two important objectives: 1) established the feasibility of painACTION: Arthritis as an intervention and a technical project and 2) generated preliminary plans for the content, design, and technical development of painACTION: Arthritis. In Phase II we will produce the program and test its efficacy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: One of every five adults in the United States (46.4 million people) is currently affected by arthritis and this number is expected to continue to grow to 67 million over the next twenty years. In 2003, 128 billion was spent on arthritis treatment in the United States alone. During the Phase I project we worked with consultants, people with arthritis pain, health professionals, and technical staff to: a) establish the feasibility of creating an online self management program for people with arthritis pain and b) develop plans for content, design, and features for a fully functional painACTION: Arthritis program. In Phase II, we propose to create painACTION: Arthritis then conduct a study to find out if it helps people with arthritis pain to increase their self management skills and functioning.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II application proposes to continue development of the ASI-MV-CAT, a Computer Adaptive Testing edition of Inflexxion's popular Addiction Severity Index-Multimedia Version (ASI-MV). Built on the ASI, probably the most widely used adult assessment for substance use problems in the US, the ASI-MV provides a reliable, valid and cost-effective version for all clinical and research purposes. The Internet connectivity of ASI-MV Connect allows automated collection of data in a manner that is compatible with clinical and administrative systems. The ASI-MV is currently used at more than 500 sites throughout the country and is administered nearly a hundred thousand individuals annually. Despite its substantial commercial success, the current version of the ASI-MV suffers from some of the psychometric problems inherent in the ASI itself. Developed more than quarter century ago, concerns have mounted about the psychometric performance of the ASI, particularly as evaluated in light of modern thinking. Furthermore, profound changes in the nature of the substances abused, patient populations, and treatments have occurred during the past 25 years. Thus, the ASI and, by extension, the ASI-MV do not meet all critical assessment and treatment needs of administrators, researchers, and clinicians. The ASI-MV-CAT is intended to update the ASI and to provide the option for brief, but state-of-the-art, assessment. The ASI-MV has amply demonstrated the feasibility of using computer- mediated administration of the ASI. Based on principles of Item Response Theory (IRT), a computer adaptive testing (CAT) version of the ASI-MV will permit improvement in several, related measurement concepts: (1) scaling and dimensionality of derived scores, (2) interval measurement of clients' problem severity, (3) overall adherence to scientific measurement principles and hence, (4) applicability of measurement data to statistical analyses. CAT also permits a quick ASI screening or follow-up assessment that could potentially reduce administration time 50% to 80%. In Phase I, the Specific Aims were accomplished utilizing a large database of ASI-MV Connect assessments (N = 23,400). A comprehensive examination of the psychometric (classical test theory-CTT and IRT) status of the existing ASI items for all ASI domains was conducted. While some domain items performed better than others, each domain was found to require updating and improvement. Two pools of potential new items were generated for the employment and psychiatric domains. Phase II will see the completion of four Specific Aims: (1) development and qualitative evaluation of new pools of items for the remaining ASI domains (medical, alcohol, drug, legal, and family/social), (2) comprehensive psychometric analyses of the entire item bank on a large number of clients in treatment for substance use disorders and a community, non-clinical sample, (3) creation of a fully functioning prototype of an ASI-MV-CAT, and (4) empirical tests of validity and sensitivity to change of the ASI-MV-CAT. These steps will result in a new and more powerful version of the ASI that will represent a significant advance in the evolution of this important tool.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ASI is the gold standard assessment for individuals in substance abuse treatment. Since its creation, changes in the substances abused, patient populations, treatments, and psychometric standards suggest the need for an updated version. The proposed ASI-MV-CAT would address this need and permit flexible and efficient administration options, updated content, and could be rapidly disseminated. The ASI-MV-CAT will have major public health importance and significant commercial potential.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II proposes the development and testing of an online CME program for primary care physicians called Managing Addiction and Pain in Primary Care (MAP-PC). Multiple studies have supported the utility of opioids in the treatment of acute pain and pain related to cancer, but they continue to be under-prescribed by physicians for chronic pain. Many physicians are concerned about possible abuse by patients, potential liability, and censure by regulatory agencies. The reluctance to prescribe opioids is particularly evident among primary care physicians (PCPs), who treat a high proportion of pain patients. An improvement in the ability of primary care physicians to adopt pain management and addiction medicine principles would lead to more appropriate use of opioids, along with more successful pain treatment outcomes in patients, especially those with potential or past substance misuse/abuse. The promotion of Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) for opioids by the FDA will likely require further development of continuing education programs for physicians. Unfortunately, there is a lack of such training for physicians treating chronic pain patients. With the advent of the Internet and business logic (decision branching) software, there is technology available to engage and educate physicians seeking to build pain treatment skills. Using this technology, MAP-PC will help physicians: (1) increase pain management and addiction medicine skills with pain patients at risk of opioid abuse or misuse; (2) make informed decisions about the appropriate use of opioids for their patients; and (3) manage clinical challenges that arise during the course of pain treatment with opioids. In Phase II, we will complete the development of MAP-PC and the study measures. The efficacy study will involve randomization to two conditions: (1) Experimental (MAP-PC) and (2) Control (online text-based CME). The Experimental and Control groups will undergo a baseline assessment, post-intervention, and three-month follow- ups. Phase II involves testing the hypotheses that, relative to the control condition, physicians exposed to MAP-PC will: (1) improve expertise in managing opioid risk in chronic pain patients, (2) enhance self-efficacy in managing opioid risk in chronic pain patients, and (3) improve clinical practice behaviors with respect to identifying and addressing opioid risk issues in pain patients. We will also test the secondary hypotheses that, relative to the control condition, physicians exposed to MAP-PC will perceive significantly: (1) fewer barriers to prescribe opioids for chronic pain patients, and (2) reduced reluctance to prescribe opioids for chronic pain (changed beliefs). Finally, we will test user satisfaction with and acceptance of MAP-PC.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain is often under-treated due to primary care physicians' ambivalence about prescribing opioid medications for fear that the patient might abuse or become addicted to the medication. This is particularly true for patients with potential or past substance misuse/abuse. This research project will culminate in the development and testing of an interactive Continuing Medical Education (CME) course, Managing Addiction and Pain in Primary Care (MAP-PC), that teaches primary care physicians about pain management and addiction medicine skills with pain patients at risk of opioid abuse or misuse. If successful, this program can enhance public health by helping physicians to offer needed treatment to chronic pain patient while managing the risk of opioid misuse/abuse more effectively.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substance abuse research indicates that: (1) addressing medical and psychosocial problems associated with substance abuse and dependence leads to better outcomes; (2) treatments are now shorter due in part to rising healthcare costs, and it is difficult to address these issues effectively during treatment, making medical and psychosocial ( wraparound ) services following treatment essential; (3) counselors may lack the knowledge to effectively integrate these services; and (4) referrals to these services have been underutilized and clients may lack the motivation, knowledge, or skills to follow up with the referrals when they are made. To address these deficits, we are proposing the development of ASI-MV Solutions, which will provide tailored motivational feedback and skill-building lessons to clients to address specific psychosocial and medical problem areas. We expect that ASI-MV Solutions will have seven modules (Alcohol, Drugs, Medical, Psychiatric, Legal, Employment, and Family) corresponding to domains of the ASI-MV, a Web-enabled interactive version of the ASI administered in treatment settings. Substance abusers who have high severity scores on ASI-MV subscales will be directed to corresponding interactive lessons and local resources on ASI-MV Solutions. To demonstrate the feasibility of the program concept, the Phase I study focused on the Employment domain. All feasibility criteria were met and findings indicated: (1) Proposed content was based on highly positive findings from concept mapping, as well as usability and acceptance testing with clients and experts. Ratings of potential effectiveness and appeal were high. (2) Usability testing indicated that the program was usable by the target audience, the skills and outcomes were relevant to the target audience, and the program was regarded as potentially very helpful to the treatment process. We surpassed feasibility benchmarks for both clients and experts. (3) Our technical/design team produced a demonstration program that was perceived by key stakeholders as highly usable and engaging multimedia program, as well as determining the necessary technologies to produce the complete program in Phase II. In Phase II we will develop ASI-MV Solutions content, complete the ASI-MV Solutions program, field test the program, and conduct satisfaction and acceptance testing of the program with clients and counselors.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Making referrals to medical and psychosocial services for substance abuse clients has proven difficult due to lack of access to services, inadequate counselor knowledge, and lack of motivation and skills among clients. Inflexion is proposing the development of ASI-MV Solutions, which will educate clients about employment, legal, psychiatric, relapse prevention, medical, and family issues, as well as include resources and strategies for counselors. By linking learning modules to client results on the ASI-MV, an online interactive version of the ASI administered in treatment settings, we will be able to offer clients important tools to address key recovery issues and encourage counselors to make appropriate referrals to medical and psychosocial services.",

        "abstract": "The SmartGrid requires the eventual large-scale integration of distributed energy technologies such as Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs). While the near-term impacts from PEVs are not expected to put a major strain on the capacity of the grid, the timing at which the charging occurs creates uncertainty, which could impact peak demand, associated energy costs, and grid reliability. Some studies predict that adding new charging infrastructure to existing distribution networks can overheat distribution assets reducing asset life and impacting system reliability. Finally, distributed energy sources such as solar PV systems will be co-located with Plug-in Electric Vehicles and could become much more efficient while increasing grid reliability if integrated with PEV-based storage and intelligent load controls. Current systems are not integrated and do not have distribution level visibility or control. In order for SmartGrid operators to accommodate emerging Plug-in Electric Vehicle systems will require flexible control schemes to manage the interface between: the PEV systems, Distributed Energy Resource (DER) systems, load control applications, and utility distribution automation and operations. A significant opportunity exists for distribution-level integration of PEVs with distributed renewables such as solar PV, and demand response creating synergies that could accelerate the expansion of all of the integrated technologies via smart controls. The proposed PEV Smart Controller Agent is designed to enable adaptive, flexible, and secure control schemes such as smart charging of PEV integrated with distributed solar and demand response at the MicroGrid and home level. The proposed solution uses a virtual agent system hosted in a secure IBM cloud-computing environment eliminating the need for redundant and expensive hardware (premiselevel communication gateways) providing a pathway for commercial and technical scalability.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The proposed agent-based system (GridAgentsTM) enables adaptive, self-healing, and semiautonomous control systems that can respond rapidly at the local level to assist with integrating Plugin Electric Vehicles (PEV) with distributed renewables and demand response into active networks and optimized aggregations (MicroGrids) on the distribution system to support PEV smart charging and other SmartGrid functions. The immediate benefits include accelerating the adoption of distributed renewables, increased distribution system reliability, lower cost deployment, and interoperability. Other benefits include the ability to enable high-penetration distributed renewables on the SmartGrid solving one of the major issues of renewable generation (distributed solar) variability on the grid.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women often sleep poorly during pregnancy and almost always sleep poorly after delivery. This sleep disturbance differs significantly from traditional insomnia even that associated with a medical condition. However, pregnant women and new mothers are very reluctant to use pharmacological sleep aids as they may have an adverse effect on their unborn child or their own ability to respond to their newborn's needs. A technologically based Sleep Enhancement Training system created to help Air Force pilots overcome disturbed sleep and fatigue due to jetlag is being modified for and will be tested with pregnant women to determine if it can improve their sleep during these periods in a randomized controlled study. A preliminary feasibility study comparing objective (actigraphy) and subjective measures of sleep in twenty nine pregnant women, when compared to a similar previously measured untreated sample, showed an increase of 55 minutes in postpartum sleep along with other objective and subjective improvements. Recent research indicates that women who experience poor sleep or sleep less than 6 hours per night in the few weeks before delivery are at higher risk for birth complications (Lee and Gay. 2004) and research also suggested that poor sleep pre delivery was associated with negative psychological consequences after delivery (Wilkes and Shapiro, 1992). Poor postpartum sleep is legendary and has been associated with fatigue, difficulties caring for the newborn and even postpartum depression (Ross, Murray, and Steiner, 2005). Each year four million women give birth in the U.S. The ability to improve sleep without pharmacological agents during this time can potentially improve birth outcomes and have a significant positive impact on quality of life for a crucial part of the U.S population during a very trying time. It is anticipated that the successful evaluation of this approach will lead to commercialization of an effective. easy-to-use, low cost, non-pharmacologic sleep improvement program for expectant parents. Successful commercialization of such a product through birth education classes and OB/GYN physicians can have a significant impact on the health and quality of life for new parents and their children.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pregnant women have difficulty sleeping before delivery and after the child is born. A special audio/video and written material  Sleep Enhancement  program is being tested that could train mothers to sleep better during this difficult time and therefore enable them to take better care of their infant.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project aims to facilitate the use of flexible laparoscopic ultrasound transducers during minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in order to reduce injury rates. During a standard laparoscopic procedure, the surgeon operates through small incisions in the abdomen while viewing the internal anatomy on a remote video monitor, creating an eye-hand-instrument spatial coordination problem. Because of this, many injuries occur during MIS procedures. Laparoscopic ultrasound provides a more thorough understanding of the anatomy, offering complementary anatomical information to the laparoscopic camera image and thereby decreasing the risk of injury. However, its use aggravates the inherent spatial coordination problem of conventional MIS, since the same anatomical features appear very differently between the two imaging modalities. Precisely placing interventional instruments such as needles becomes particularly difficult without extensive experience.This problem is addressed with the guidance system of this project, which shows the surgeon how his instruments are positioned with respect to features in the ultrasound scan. The dynamic stereoscopic imagery of the Phase I system shows the current position and orientation of the needle as well as its future trajectory, integrated with the live ultrasound image. Both needle and ultrasound scan are presented to the user in their actual spatial orientations. In Phase I, a prototype system was developed and its efficacy tested. The results were stunning: two expert users increased their placement accuracy from 60% without our guidance to 100% with it; while two novice users (who had never before held an ultrasound probe) improved from 5% accuracy without our guidance to 100% with it. In other words, the novice users were not able to place the needle into a feature in the LUT video without our system, and with it they could not miss. In this Phase II project, we propose to (1) investigate new capabilities that will increase the usefulness of the system; and (2) to continue refinement of the prototype so that, at the project's conclusion, it will be ready for clinical trials with human subjects. It will be tested both quantitatively and qualitatively in multiple animal studies. We will also test its usability in a clinical setting, as well as experimentally evaluate the usefulness of the novel features developed throughout Phase II.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop an advanced stereoscopic visualization system for minimally-invasive surgery that facilitates the use of laparoscopic ultrasound during MIS interventions, in order to reduce patient injury rates. The system offers three-dimensional guidance for accurate placement of needles or other interventional instruments into structures seen in the laparoscopic ultrasound image, so that the surgeon can conduct the procedure more easily and more safely.",

        "abstract": "Daily, approximately 321,000 underfired charbroilers in approximately 700,000 U.S. food service operations account for 94 percent of current restaurant emissions, equivalent to more than 285 tons of particulate matter (PM) and more than 41 tons of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), a significant source of environmental air pollution adversely impacting health. Grease emissions from one underfired charbroiler are approximately 2.15 MT/yr. This large, installed base requires a retrofit implementation approach with new emissions control technology. Conventional technologies are either too capital intensive to install, too costly to operate and maintain, or have inefficient overall filtration performance.\nA new cost-effective, high-efficiency emission control system was developed that integrates a novel self-cleaning inertial filter (already commercialized for metalworking oil mist elimination) with a proprietary water mist evaporative cooler for VOC condensation and a clean-in-place (CIP) continuous grease removal system for long-term unattended operation. Technology attributes and benefits include: compactness, ease of maintenance and service, enhanced worker and customer safety, reduced capital and operational costs, elimination of contaminated media disposal in landfills, and long service life.\nThe project objective is to demonstrate that a full-scale self-cleaning aerosol grease filtration system with integrated blower, evaporative cooler, and CIP components can cost-effectively reduce both PM and VOC grease emissions by at least 70 percent.\nA full-sized pre-commercial prototype will be tested extensively to compare grease PM removal efficiencies with competitive technologies and demonstrate grease VOC removal with H2O mist evaporative cooling. Integrated spray nozzles in the prototype that periodically spray a commercial degreaser will allow intermittent and continuous operation without grease build-up.\nAchieving grease emissions reductions of approximately 70 percent nationally would decrease pollution by more than 483,105 MT/yr, significantly reducing smog in major urban areas.\nAll Phase I project technical objectives were achieved, establishing full-scale PM removal efficiencies of more than 99 percent, significantly better than current technologies (sub-scale VOC removal efficiencies were approximately 42% via evaporative cooling, resulting in more than 70% reduction in total grease emissions).\nInnovaTech anticipates that full-scale combined PM and VOC grease removal efficiencies will exceed 70 percent, establishing the highest performance standard in the market. Retrofit/installation and operating costs will be minimized for affordable and sustained technology implementation. Integrated CIP will lower routine service and maintenance costs.\nEconomies will be gained in long-term sustainable process efficiencies; reduced operation, maintenance, and disposal costs; decreased filter cleaning and replacement downtime; enhanced worker (OSHA and NIOSH) safety; environmental friendliness; and greater compliance with EPA PM2.5 emission requirements.\nAlthough the potential U.S. restaurant grease emission control market is worth more than $2B, the technology also can improve emission compliance of industrial process gas streams including: agriculture (pesticides), power generation, transportation, construction and mining, petrochemicals, and so on.",

        "abstract": "The U.S. poultry industry produces two billion pounds of feathers each year, which are considered waste biomaterials and currently converted into low value protein for use in animal feed. In Europe, feathers are autoclaved or burned and then buried as a waste material due to regulations prohibiting animal by-products in feed. A more appropriate use for feathers is to utilize their unique structural properties as strong, lightweight fiber. Feathers are made of the protein keratin, which can be used to enhance the strength and modulus of polymers. The Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC), a division of the USDA, has developed several processes for feathers, each process dependent upon the market application. The production and processing of chickens is the number one agricultural activity of Maryland?s Eastern Shore. Not only does the sale of chicken products generate direct value to the regional economy, chickens consume the majority of crops grown in the region as feed. A viable poultry industry is vital to the region?s economy. The processing of chickens generates many by-products besides the various meat options; creating value for these by-products improves the bottom line of the industry. One of the major by-products is feathers; in the Delmarva region, approximately 580,000,000 chickens are processed annually, producing nearly 155 million pounds of feathers. Currently, the primary use of feathers in this region is as a source of protein for animal feed, while in other areas feathers must be disposed of in landfills. Developing alternative uses and markets for feathers may be critical to the poultry industry as it is anticipated that the Food and Drug Administration may issue rules restricting their use as an ingredient in chicken feed similar to actions taken for cattle relative to mad cow disease. The biodegradable pots market survey is based on a specific need of the nursery industry. A major environmental issue currently facing the $11.2 Billion nursery and floriculture industry is the recycling and disposal of plastics, especially nursery containers, being used in the production of flowers and ornamental plants. Because of the resins used and the formulations in the production of nursery pots, it is difficult to put them into the current plastics recycling stream. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, more than 29 million tons of non-biodegradable plastic waste ends up in landfills each year. A 2004 study by Penn State University?s College of Agricultural Science estimates that 320 million pounds of plastic are used to produce nursery pots, cell packs, and flats each year. There are several companies that produce biodegradable pots out of a variety of materials from wood to plant starch to cow manure. A Phase I SBIR completed in January, 2010, by Cronus, LLC, proved the feasibility of producing feather keratin based biodegradable plastic pots. The partners on this project were the USDA Beltsville Agriculture Research Center (formulations), Chesapeake Microproducts (feather processing); and the Horticultural Research Institute (market analysis).",

        "abstract": "Greenhouse farming is an absolute necessity to revive and create local agriculture industries in northern climatically challenged regions with short growing seasons. Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) has made significant strides in greenhouse farming technology. State of the art CEA farming utilizes direct control of lighting, temperature and CO2 in a hydroponics environment. Key advantages of CEA greenhouse farming include reduced use of pesticides, faster and higher quality growth, minimal transport costs to local customers, and \"vine ripened\" produce with minimal spoilage and contamination risks. For CEA greenhouse farming to be adopted in rural northern climates, progress is needed to reduce greenhouse-operating costs. While temperature does play some role, lighting continues to be the most significant limiting factor in the growth of several specialty crops. Providing adequate amounts of photo synthetically active radiation (PAR) has been shown to increase greenhouse production capacity to a level capable of supporting large market demand. The challenge for northern climates is to implement such supplemental lighting systems at a cost that makes CEA greenhouse farming competitive with large out of state centralized farm and ship sources. In Phase 2 Cycloptics is combining recently available high intensity discharge (HID) bulb technology with its patent-pending, optimized reflector designs to achieve unprecedented plant growth lighting energy and cost savings. The new HID bulbs feature small emitters and high PAR efficiency relative to previous HID bulbs, making them ideal for compact and highly energy efficient growth luminaires. Cycloptics can design both direct and indirect lighting reflectors for these HID bulbs that can be precisely engineered to a highly uniform distribution over large arbitrary patterns and depths. HID bulbs have up to now been problematic as PAR luminaires for growth applications. Plants nearer the source tended to be burned, while others were not getting enough light. The design and optical performance of Cycloptics reflectors allow them to be placed closer to the plant canopy, enabling smaller volume highly efficient energy curtains for cooler months. The innovative compact reflector design will translate to less shadowing of natural lighting in warmer months. It is the combination of target efficiency, compactness, and HID lamp energy efficiency that ultimately yields the energy and cost savings for the proposed luminaire.",

        "abstract": "Johne's disease (JD) is a significant problem in animal health, and this is underscored by its identification by the USDA as the most important infectious disease in ruminants and one of the priority diseases for 2009/2010. Infection with MAP usually occurs after birth and infected calves go through a short period with mild or no symptoms during which they shed the bacteria in feces. This short period, which usually goes unrecognized, is followed by a long incubation period of two to five years in which the animals are presumably healthy, non-shedding, and without any symptoms hinting toward the development of JD. Following the incubation period, MAP-infected cattle develop disease with the characteristic symptoms of chronic diarrhea (with shedding) and weight-loss, loss of milk production, and finally death. There are no specific tools for the prevention or treatment of JD. The only effective control measures are culling the infected animals and/or instituting good herd management practices. Either approach depends on quickly and accurately identifying MAP-infected animals, and separating them from the rest of the herd before they spread the disease through fecal shedding. There is a strong demand from diagnostic laboratories for a test for Johne's disease with no batch-to-batch variation, no extra pre-absorption step, and a higher sensitivity. In this Phase II proposal we present an integrated plan for the final evaluation of the Lipid-ELISA. The proposed experiments will provide essential data on the specificity, sensitivity, stability, and robustness of the Lipid-ELISA assay. The strengths of the Lipid-ELISA as a diagnostic test for Johne's disease are that it is a simpler test without the need for pre-absorption of sera, high reproducibility due to the use of a synthesized lipid antigen, and that it has excellent specificity and better sensitivity than the existing serodiagnostic tests. Eckstein Diagnostics will determine the final sensitivity and specificity of this newly designed diagnostic test for Johne's disease using defined and field study sera from several regions within the US. The test will also be used in a 2-year field study of dairy farms in Northern Colorado. Furthermore, Eckstein Diagnostics will define stability, repeatability, suitability and ruggedness of the diagnostic test kit. Eckstein Diagnostics will file for a sales license with USDA for the US. The licensed diagnostic test will be made available for purchase. It is anticipated that licenses will be obtained in the USA and Canada, several countries within the European Union (Germany, France, Great Britain, Ireland, Spain, Greece, Italy, and The Netherlands), as well as in Australia and New Zealand. The test will be used within the latter countries for sheep instead of cattle.",

        "abstract": "This project will develop an extensible, globally scalable High Definition (HD) standards-based platform for remote collaboration (EVO-HD) at low cost, packaged for widespread corporate, research and at-home use over existing and future-generation broadband networks. Based on the successful results with a recent prototype built during Phase I of the program, where we were able to send several HD video streams using a single mass-market low cost PC, we are confident that we can develop and deploy standards-based HD videoconferencing and remote collaboration end points, embedding many high frame rate HD streams and a wide variety of shared content in a real-time 3D immersive collaborative environment. We will also integrate these multi-HD sessions into a highly capable autonomous system infrastructure that scales from a few to hundreds of end points, at low cost. The EVO-HD system would be alone in its class in terms of scalability, minimal operational burden and cost due to: 1) its built-in field tested and proven end-to-end intelligence (based on autonomous agents), 2) its automatic real-time topology and data flow optimization, 3) its ability to integrate across a wide range of home and work environments (including low cost mass market desktops, laptops and room-based systems), and 4) its unique user interface in which many interactive video streams, documents, remote desktop areas, and other information are presented live on 3D surfaces using OpenGL  technology. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  During Phase II, we will build a full EVO-HD collaboration system by enhancing our unique video codec architecture and leveraging recent mass market developments that have sharply lowered the cost of a) HD video cameras, b) large LCD and plasma screens, c) capture and graphics cards with powerful GPUs, d) libraries supporting HD resolution, e) multi-core CPUs in mass market PCs that, together with the GPUs and libraries, as well as software tools to optimize threaded applications, can easily support one or several HD streams. The creation of low-cost HD Television (HDTV) systems running EVO-HD for remote collaboration, would thus represent a breakthrough that meets the needs for widespread collaboration and remote high quality Telepresence of the worldwide research community (during Phase II), and subsequently all sectors of society including both the business and consumer markets during Phase I",

        "abstract": "The number of women farmers in the U.S. has been rising over the past several decades, with the rate of growth accelerating between the 2002 and 2007 Censuses of Agriculture, to nearly 1 million female farm operators in 2007. Between 1980 and 2002, the number of women-operated farms had increased by 86%, a rate far surpassing growth in U.S. farms overall. These data underscore the need for agricultural tools & equipment that are appropriate for women. In general, tools & equipment function best and are safest and easiest to operate when they fit the user. Because women's and men's bodies are markedly different - women, for example, tend to be shorter and to have 40-75% less upper-body strength & 5-30% less lower-body strength than men - agricultural equipment designed for men will not \"fit\" or be optimal for the vast majority of female users. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that some of women's anatomical and physiological characteristics may place them at particular risk for farm injuries and musculoskeletal disabilities, the leading cause of disability for people in their working years. Despite women's key role in agriculture & the importance of appropriate tools, there appear to be no agricultural tools or equipment on the U.S. market that were designed explicitly for women. Instead, virtually all tools and equipment seem to have been designed either for men or for some \"average\" user whose size, weight, strength etc. were heavily influenced by the average man's. Through this project, Green Heron Tools will research and design safer, more user-friendly alternative(s) to the traditional full-size walk-behind rotary tiller, a vital piece of equipment on small farms of the type most often operated by women. Rotary tillers were the highest priority for redesign cited by women farmers & market growers providing input to Green Heron Tools during its Phase I SBIR project. The scientific design process will be based on data about women's anatomy and physiology, and will incorporate input already obtained from women farmers; state-of-the-art knowledge related to ergonomics, human factors & fuel/energy efficiency; and latest technology & materials. Anticipated benefits include: 1) A reduction in agriculturally related injuries and disabilities among women farmers, leading to a decrease in lost productivity, missed work days and health care costs; 2) Improved quality of life for women farmers; 3) An increase in productivity of women farmers, leading to enhanced viability of farming for women; and 4) The potential for the U.S. to become a world leader in producing agricultural equipment appropriate for women. The resulting tillage equipment is also expected to be safer and easier to operate for some men, particularly older men and those of smaller stature.",

Musicians and audio engineers have access to terabytes of music loops and sound effects. However, musicians are limited to searching for sounds using text-only keyword searches. This is a mundane, inaccurate, and exhausting process that ignores the files' actual audio content. The proposed solution provides a unique \"find-something-that-sounds-like-this\" search engine. Media production software and hardware is too complex, tedious, and labor-intensive for both novice and advanced users. The proposed sound platform adds capability that was previously missing - recognizing an input sound and automatically choosing the best parameters for the user. This project uses a signal processing and machine learning platform to perform novel experiments for classifying audio streams in real-time, improving recognition accuracy, and retrieving sounds from large collections. Commercial-quality software development kits for offline and real-time sound recognition will be developed. This project integrates state-of-the-art machine learning, digital signal processing, and information retrieval techniques. \nIf successful, the platform will be able to listen to an audio signal and understand what it is listening to - as human listeners can identify and classify sounds. This innovative technology will be licensed to audio and music technology software and hardware manufacturers. The platform is suited for long-term discoveries and innovation, with demonstrated commercial interest from biomedical signal processing, security/surveillance, and interactive gaming companies. In the first chosen market, (sound engineering) the platform will have direct cultural benefits for musicians, music hobbyists, and audio engineers. It will allow music creation and audio production to become a completely creative task - minimizing the tedious technical issues that hinder the creative process, and lowering the barriers to entry for novice musicians and creative professionals.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a robust, high-speed inorganic resist platform to revolutionize the manufacture of semiconductor devices with feature sizes < 30 nm. At present, there is no demonstrated organic or inorganic resist that satisfies all of the requirements - high speed, low line-width roughness (LWR), sufficient etch resistance - for patterning devices at these feature sizes. A fundamentally new approach, relying on depositing extremely high-quality oxide films from aqueous solution and very efficient photon-induced network-forming reactions, is being pursued. The approach has enabled the production of extremely small feature sizes and linewidth roughness, enabling optimization within a uniquely high-performance triangle of sensitivity, linewidth roughness, and resolution.  Resist deposition, resist formulations, exposure conditions, and processing parameters will be examined in detail to simultaneously address International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) roadmap requirements for 193i and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography.  Anticipated results include 26-nm line/space (L/S) resolution at 3 nm LWR with 193-nm exposures and double patterning, and 22-nm L/S resolution at 1.2 nm LWR with EUV exposures. This resist platform will also lead to a high-resolution electron beam resist with unprecedented sensitivity.\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project is to develop high-performance resist materials to fill critical unmet needs for semiconductor manufacturing with features smaller than 30 nm. The material being developed addresses two of the ITRS \"difficult challenges\" for lithography: an EUV resist that meets 22-nm half-pitch requirements, and the containment of cost escalation of the extension of 193 nm patterning.  The resulting product will serve a quickly growing market with a combined opportunity of $250 million in 2015.  Success in the project will have a considerable impact on continued productivity gains in the ITRS roadmap, which supports the electronics industry.  New levels of device performance will be enabled, providing broad societal impacts through the introduction of advanced electronics, while enhancing prospects for domestic employment in advanced materials and semiconductor manufacturing. The broader scientific and engineering research communities will benefit from new techniques to build and study novel devices at the extreme end of the nanoscale.  Finally, solution processing with aqueous materials will reduce the use of toxic solvents and permit a smaller carbon footprint from reduced reliance on vacuum process equipment.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further develop and commercialize a new class of durable, water-resistant nanocomposite coatings identified and explored during the Phase I project.  The unique processing conditions used to make these nanocomposite coatings produce a virtually invisible, conformal, nanometer-scale film that is comprised of surface bound nanoparticles and offers superior water barrier properties while still permitting through-film electrical connections.  The newly developed coating has the potential for great commercial impact and can be thought of as a \"game changer\" for certain consumer electronic markets.  The innovation and research plan for Phase II centers on two critical issues for commercial integration: 1) the overall processing efficiency of the material and 2) issues of long-term reliability and chemical interaction with existing platforms.\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be felt in a number of consumer, military, and medical products.  It is estimated that about 1.2 billion mobile handsets are produced annually and that 8% of all the damages that occur to handsets are from liquid ingress.  If fully adopted by the industry, this coating could reduce the liquid ingress damage to nearly zero, resulting in significant savings to consumers. Additionally, medical hearing aids would benefit from the oleophobic protection provided by this material, and its use would result in a decrease in the number of units returned annually for corrosion, water damage and ear wax contamination (this number currently stands at 11 million).  Finally, the integration of our protective coating into other existing electronics products will add significant value to these products and will make them more durable and attractive to consumers globally.",

        "abstract": "US federally funded research and international research is connecting elderberry (S. nigra and S. canadensis) to the treatment of diabetes, cancer, heart disease, AIDS, herpes simples virus HSV-1 and influenza types A and B. Many of these studies have focused on the presence of high levels of antioxidants present in the berries of these perennial shrubs. Today, consumers understand the important role antioxidants play in human health and value of local and organic agricultural products. Virtually all elderberry-based nutraceutical products available in the United States rely on imported Sambucus nigra (the European elderberry). Retail sales of three imported elderberry syrups are among the top 10 of 662 herbal supplements available for adults. In 2008, Austria, a country the size of Maine, produced 19,200,000 pounds of elderberries. [Even if Maine were to meet just 5% of Austria's current elderberry production, more than $2.2 M USD could be generated for Maine's small and mid-sized farms.] To date, the US has not recognized the opportunity to develop commercial scale production of elderberries for national and international markets. As a result, two major issues can be identified: 1) US manufacturers of elderberry-based products are dependant on imported raw product due to inadequate domestic supply; 2) imported raw products in the form of juice concentrates do not carry forward the full phytonutrient profiles of the raw fruit due to degradation during processing resulting in inferior products. This Phase II project seeks to capitalize on an opportunity to provide increased revenue for small and mid size farms by supporting domestic elderberry production for high-value niche markets thus significantly decreasing manufacturers' dependence on imported elderberry products and increase competitiveness by offering consumers superior US produced elderberry products for national and international markets. Phase II has two objectives: Objective 1: Establish a reliable supply of US grown elderberries by supporting a growers' network of small and mid-size farms for commercial scale organic elderberry production. Objective 2: Conduct prototype development of nutraceutical products utilizing US grown elderberries. This project will apply innovative processing technologies to previously identified superior varieties of US grown organic elderberries. Anticipated Phase II results are increased US elderberry production supported by a growers' network, and Phase III commercialization of two organic elderberry-based nutraceuticals for national and international distribution. At the completion of Phase II, Eldertide will be well positioned to introduce a full line of elderberry-based nutraceutical products that leverage rapidly growing consumer interest to provide substantial income opportunities for small and mid-size farms.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on scaling and developing a desktop-specific distributed grid to provide enterprise grade, highly available virtual desktop systems that are cost-competitive with PCs. To accomplish this objective the research and development will focus on three key areas. First it will focus on multiple ways to scale the solution including ways to distribute large desktop templates across the grid, develop self-managing software to automatically update, patch and repair the software that manages grid and support a hierarchy of grids that can be geographically distributed. Second, it will develop multi-tenancy mechanisms to securely house multiple customers on a grid thus making this a viable solution for managing and economically providing desktops as a service from a cloud. Finally, additional work to support multiple hypervisors and remote protocols will be developed to address market requirements for cost-effective virtualization technologies and to provide good user experience when deploying the solution across a cloud.\nThis takes advantage of a sizable and growing demand for virtual desktops that offer lower management costs and superior data security.  Existing solutions on the market are 4 to 10 times the cost of regular PCs and require highly skilled personnel to operate, thus hampering their adoption. Kaviza?s approach, if successful, reduces that costs drastically and makes it possible for the desktop IT staff who procure and manage PCs today, to be able to install and deploy proposed solution within their budgets.  Kaviza's solution, if successfully deployed, also has the potential for broad economic and environmental impact. First, it can reduce PC power consumption by up to 75% making offices more \"green\". Second, its lower cost and simpler management will make it possible to broadly deploy computational resources and bridge the digital divide.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to bring improvements to OS update technology. These improvements would allow system administrators to apply OS patches faster than current practice, which would significantly hinder botnets and other attackers by reducing the window of vulnerability during which systems are running software with known problems.  The current state-of-the-art requires that computers reboot to apply kernel updates. Since rebooting is disruptive, many system administrators delay performing security updates.  Security would improve if administrators could apply updates immediately, as hot updates, without the need for reboots or disruption.  Although programmers have long been capable of making ad hoc modifications to running programs, hot update technology has not seen widespread use because of key technical problems. In particular, constructing hot updates has always required extensive programming effort, which is expensive and risky. \nIf successful, this project will impact the state-of-the-art of software updates. Most directly, this research has the potential to deliver a change that the IT industry wants - a way to apply security updates without rebooting. More generally, this research aims to improve the field's technical understanding of how to automatically apply traditional source code patches to a running program, such as the kernel. This problem has broad applications in debugging, profiling, instrumentation, and education. This research can lead to the creation of a hot update service, provided to companies on a per-machine, per-month basis, for a subscription charge. Companies who subscribe machines to this service would, without any ongoing effort, be able to transparently receive hot updates that solve software problems, without reboots or other disruption. This distribution of hot updates would improve security and reliability while decreasing machine maintenance costs. This offering has the potential for wide appeal across the IT industry.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objectives of the Phase II research are to develop a simple and cost-effective method for large-scale production of anti-microbial N95 respirator masks. The work proposed will accomplish the necessary steps to scale our production of a Light Activated Anti Microbial (LAAM) fabric coating to manufacturing. Significance: Influenza and other enveloped viruses are responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide each year and cost the US economy over&nbsp; 70 billion each year in medical costs and lost work. A new approach to preventing the spread of viral infections in general, and influenza in particular, would be of benefit. Influenza enters the body through the nose or throat. As a precaution, to themselves and patients, caregivers wear personal protective equipment (PPE) such as a respirator masks to minimize contact transmission onto facial skin or airborne inhalation of pathogenic organisms. Case-control studies conducted in Beijing and Hong Kong showed that wearing masks in public was independently associated with protection from SARS in a multivariate analysis. However, a study performed by the CDC showed definitive evidence of the transmission of virus particles from PPE to other people and surfaces in a hospital setting. Thus, opportunities exist for simple, efficacious decontamination methods that reduce the risk of infection through handling a contaminated respirator and that do not compromise respirator effectiveness. Approach: The LaamScience, Inc. (LSI) value proposition is that a mask with the LSI antimicrobial coating on its surface is self decontaminating and will reduce the risk of transmission to the wearer, to other people, and to other surfaces. Innovation: Using our proprietary technology, LSI is developing antimicrobial coatings useful for a durable, self-decontaminating, and cost effective N95 respirator mask with a broad spectrum of viral inactivation. Importantly, the mechanism of inactivation will not lead to microbial resistance. We are developing a non-leaching fiber treatment binding photoactive dyes that inactivate viruses upon illumination with conventional lighting. Candidate dyes have been chosen that generate the most singlet oxygen [the active antiviral agent] per unit light intensity for light sources simulating solar, incandescent, and fluorescent lighting. In the Phase I portion of this grant, we established efficacy against influenza virus and Staphylococcal bacteria in light intensities equivalent to typical hospital room lighting and gt99.9% microbial inactivation in less than an hour. We also completed physical integrity testing, bench testing and performance testing for submission of the N95 mask for NIOSH certification. The Specific Aims for this Phase II project are to: 1) Continue refinements of the antiviral chemistry used in fabrics to increase antiviral activity and to aid in the large scale production of antiviral fabrics at a commercially feasible scale and cost. 2) Build a pilot plant for fabric manufacture and generate a validation manufacturing plan. 3) Demonstrate that the optimized antiviral coatings on the filtration medium do not interfere with the ease of use, fit and comfort characteristics of the mask/respirator.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Influenza spreads rapidly throughout the world in seasonal epidemics. The World Health Organization estimates that influenza epidemics cost the US economy&nbsp; 71-167 billion per year and that 250,000-500,000 people die every year from influenza epidemics. Influenza enters the body through the nose or throat. Groups most at risk are health care workers, hospital patients, and the young and geriatric population. In closed settings, [e.g., hospitals, child-care centers, military barracks, college dormitories, nursing homes] infections spread rapidly. Masks and respirators are intended to reduce the wearer's exposure to small airborne particles including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The goal of the research is to transition the manufacture of antiviral fabric and respirator masks from the test lab to large-scale manufacturing.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective of this Phase II research is to design, fabricate, and surgically evaluate a robotic catheter for endocardial ablation procedures. Phase I research successfully demonstrated the feasibility of this concept through the development of a tele-operated catheter prototype with shape memory alloy (SMA) actuated bending segments. Phase II research will build upon the achievements of Phase I to produce a catheter with full ablation capabilities, enhanced maneuverability, computer-controlled ablation modes, and contact stability during ablative energy application. This technology has the potential to transform ablation procedures by providing unprecedented access and maneuverability to open spaces within the heart. Cardiovascular disease is rapidly becoming a worldwide epidemic, claiming more lives in the United States each year than the next six causes of death combined. As the treatment of cardiovascular disease transitions toward minimally-invasive approaches, many procedures now utilize catheters for quick and easy access to intracardiac anatomy. While catheters have proven effective in a number of endovascular procedures (angioplasty, stent deployment, AV node ablation, etc.), their effectiveness in navigating open spaces inside the heart is limited. The development of SMA-actuated robotic catheters will be an enabling technology for such procedures. In Phase I, our multidisciplinary research team (consisting of engineers, surgeons, electrophysiologists, and industrial collaborators) developed a robotic catheter prototype with dual bending segments and promising capabilities. This tele-operated device uses computer- based controls to interpret joystick commands and to actuate the SMA tendons for accurate tracking of the commanded tip position. This prototype exhibits high mobility and precise positioning of the catheter tip, two desirable attributes of ablation catheter technology. The successful refinement of this technology will significantly enhance the efficacy of endocardial ablation procedures. The proposed research will also advance scientific knowledge and understanding of SMA-actuated surgical technologies. It is anticipated that the robotic catheter will be a lower-cost alternative to other robotic surgical systems, making it more accessible to patients and reducing overall healthcare costs.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A novel internally actuated robotic catheter will be developed for endocardial ablation procedures. This technology has the potential to transform ablation procedures by providing unprecedented access and maneuverability to open spaces within the heart.

Assay output is a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermogram that is a characteristic signature for an individual's plasma or serum. The characteristic pattern provides a quantitative measure of the manifold components comprising an individual's plasma/serum, thereby providing an entirely new metric with which to analyze the fluids. The goal is completion of the necessary R&D objectives required to build a prototype diagnostic assay based on the plasma thermogram technology platform. Activities and experiments are directed at automating and optimizing laboratory assay capabilities; defining essential assay parameters and quantitative metrics; and testing and validating the prototype assay. \nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the radical alteration of treatment paradigms, improved patient outcomes and reduced costs of patient care for complex diseases like autoimmune diseases. As many as 24 million people in the USA are affected by autoimmune disease. Convenient, quantitative and cost-effective diagnoses for numerous diseases, including targeted autoimmune diseases are not readily available. Early differential diagnosis between these diseases is an important unmet medical need and critical for timely and accurate treatment of disease and its complications. In addition, early accurate diagnosis potentially mitigates the costs and inconvenience associated with redundant administration of the current immunological, serological, clinical and pathological tests.  Thus, a non-invasive blood assay like the plasma thermogram test that can differentially diagnose autoimmune diseases will be highly beneficial. The company will establish a CLIA (Clinical Laboratories Improvement Act) laboratory from which to market and sell the plasma thermogram test.  A central laboratory offers a fast, low cost and high revenue business model for introducing new diagnostic tests into the marketplace.

        "abstract": "Modern agriculture has relied almost exclusively on the honey bee for managed pollination services. Honey beekeepers currently face numerous problems including Varroa mites, American foulbrood, Africanized bees and most recently colony collapse disorder. These problems have led to a shorter supply of colonies and consequently higher rental prices in the United States. It is sensible to have more than one pollinator available to growers in case shortages become worse in the future. The blue orchard bee, Osmia lignaria, is a solitary, native bee that has been shown to be an excellent pollinator of several crops including almonds, cherries and apples. Almonds are the United States? largest specialty export crop and their production depends on bee pollination. Domestication and large-scale management of blue orchard bee is still developing, but there are already several business entities working with this species as an alternative pollinator. One of the management difficulties experienced with this bee is that many will fly away from their emergence site, and not return. It is not uncommon to lose up to half of the emerging females to such dispersal. In cooperation with USDA-ARS, AgPollen LLC conducted three blue orchard bee nest attractant field studies in 2009 with Phase I SBIR funding. These trials demonstrated that extract of a bee nest product could increase nesting by up to 2.7-fold compared to the control. Fractionation of the extract showed that free fatty acids and hydrocarbons were the most active in attracting bees to nests. A test of several free fatty acids found in the extract showed that three of them could increase nesting, and one of them increased nesting 8-fold compared to the control. The research proposed here will expand upon these results to optimize which chemical or chemical blend can most improve nesting success. This research will be a cooperative effort between AgPollen LLC and USDA-ARS. Jordi Bosch (CREAF, Autonomous University of Barcelona), an expert on Osmia species, has agreed to provide consulting services. Karin Anderson, postdoctoral researcher (AgPollen), will conduct the research under the direction of James Buckner (USDA-ARS), Theresa Pitts-Singer (USDA-ARS), Stephen Peterson (AgPollen) and David Moreland (AgPollen). Chemical extractions and analysis will be conducted at the USDA-ARS Biosciences Research Laboratory in Fargo, North Dakota, and field bioassays will be conducted at the USDA-ARS Bee Biology and Systematics Laboratory in Logan, Utah and at AgPollen field sites in California. Suterra, a leader in pheromone technology will provide assistance in formulation and release technology under a subcontract to this project. Paramount Farming Company, has agreed to cooperate on this project. The product developed from this enabling research would greatly enhance the rate of commercialization of blue orchard bee in almond production systems. By multiplying blue orchard bee populations more rapidly, orchardists will benefit from an alternative pollinator sooner, which will in turn help to secure an important segment of United States agriculture.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has identified falls-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) in older adults as a significant and unrecognized public health issue; with 8000 deaths from falls- related TBI in older adults and 56,000 hospitalizations, at a mean cost of  16,006/ 19,191 for women/men gt64 years reported in 2005; prompting a public service campaign4. The challenges of maintaining independence in mobility and physiologic conditioning for wellness while avoiding injury due to impaired balance can contribute to the downward spiraling to frailty and loss of independence. The very deficits associated with many chronic conditions with aging that lead to mobility and balance difficulties, often contribute to cognitive changes that limit the effectiveness of rehabilitation and safety training and overall awareness of self-limitations15. Some of the increase incidence in and mortality from TBI is associated with anticoagulation therapy, including aspirin and the 2 million new users of warfarin each year12. To address this challenge, with the support of NIH Phase I SBIR funds, a new lightweight, un-obtrusive medical headgear with over 90% impact force reduction using was developed using advanced composites. The goal of the research component of the Phase II proposal is to 1) optimize material characteristics using data from Phase I impact testing and conduct numerical modeling using finite element analysis, 2) conduct biochemical evaluation of these advanced materials on designer-enhanced prototypes, 3) perform clinical trials with qualitative analysis based on indepth interviews and focus groups on patients, family members and staff to develop tools to evaluate compliance and decisions to use the product and 4) Develop a standard for headgear protection for patients at risk of same level falls.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Falls-related traumatic brain injury has become a significant and unrecognized public health issue. There is a need for a new lightweight, attractive, unobtrusive medical headgear that can be customized to the style, needs, comfort and protection to provide higher compliance and application to patient populations that includes older adults with balance impairment, dementia, active seniors on blood thinners, acute care hospital cases at very high risk for falls to reduce the health consequences of falls-related traumatic brain injury. Outcomes tools to evaluate the effectiveness of social marketing and academic detailing will be developed.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research project, presented as a  fast-track  SBIR proposal, deals with a new gene expression-based approach to the diagnosis and biological characterization of lung cancer in current and former smokers being evaluated for the possible diagnosis of lung cancer. Allegro Diagnostics is developing a portfolio of lung cancer biomarker products that are based on the principle that inhaled substances, cigarette smoke in particular, cause a  field of injury  throughout the lungs and airways, and that the global gene expression measured in easily accessible large airway epithelial cells obtained at bronchoscopy reflects biologic events occurring in the distal lung, where cancer develops. The first of these products, and the focus of this SBIR proposal, is BronchoGen, an 80 probe-set biomarker of lung cancer in current or former smokers. The immediate goals of the SBIR proposal are to evaluate the effect of new and improved reagents that have appeared in the past year on the BronchoGen test characteristics, to transfer the BronchoGen test to a commercial laboratory from the academic laboratory in which it was developed, and are to further validate the biomarker's accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in a sample of 400 patients. The ultimate product of these studies will be a CLIA-approved lung cancer biomarker that will be submitted for FDA approval. Multiple sites throughout the country and two high-volume international sites will provide samples of bronchial epithelial cells from patients in whom bronchoscopy is being done to evaluate the possibility that a patient has lung cancer. Airway epithelial cell samples will be placed in a new RNA preservative that is effective when stored at room temperature for several weeks, sent by Federal Express to a commercial laboratory specializing in gene expression array studies, and CEL file results transported to Allegro Diagnostics for analysis and correlation with a computerized database that stores important clinical data, including ultimate diagnosis, the clinical process of diagnostic evaluation, staging of the cancer (if present), cell type and ultimate outcome. The initial product of these studies, BronchoGen , will reduce the costs and risks of unnecessary diagnostic procedures diagnosis, and risks of invasive procedures, and the amount of time between the suspicion of lung cancer and cancer diagnosis, by avoiding additional diagnostic procedures that often occur after non-diagnostic bronchoscopy. With BronchoGen , physicians will receive a lung cancer 'present or absent' statement, together with a statistical explanation of the biomarkers positive and negative predictive value and accuracy and sensitivity. The project goals of developing more timely and accurate diagnostics for lung cancer are directly aligned with NCI's mission to reduce the burden and eliminate adverse outcomes of cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Allegro Diagnostics is developing a  toolbox  of products focused on the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death in the United States and the world. The focus of this SBIR, and the 1st of these products, is BronchoGen, a gene-expression based biomarker for use in patients undergoing bronchoscopy for the diagnosis of lung cancer. BronchoGen will decrease the amount of time between suspicion of lung cancer and lung cancer diagnosis, and will reduce the costs of diagnosis, treatment, and screening programs in people at high risk for the disease.",

In Phase II, we propose commercial scale trials in collaboration with citrus growers in Florida, Texas, and California. A&K technology selectively removes male moths of the target species from the ecosystem with negligible impact on other organisms by combining the selectivity of pheromones (0.024 g/ha) with the toxicity of insecticide (21 g/ha) in a hydrophobic bait that precludes run-off or drift, thus preventing ecosystem contamination and damage.",

The goal of the project is to enable such individuals to fully participate in the spoken language community. The need for language and speech intelligibility aids is pervasive in today's world. Millions of individuals live with language and speech challenges (such as 36 million Americans with hearing deficits), and these individuals require additional support for communication and language learning. The Phase I research developed and tested the behavioral science and technology for iGlasses. Building on this research, the proposed research is to complete and bring to market an innovative intervention that can bring spoken language and culture into the lives of individuals who are currently marginalized because of hearing loss or other speech/language challenges. The proposed research will advance the state of the art in human machine interaction, speech, machine learning, and assistive technologies. \nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will benefit the deaf and hard-of-hearing populations as well as the scientific community by providing a research and theoretical foundation for a speech aid that would be naturally available to almost all individuals at a very low cost. It does not require literate users because no written information is presented as would be the case in a captioning system; it is age-independent in that it might be used by toddlers, adolescents, and throughout the lifespan; it is functional for all languages because it is language independent given that all languages share the same phonetic features with highly similar corresponding acoustic characteristics; it would provide significant help for people with hearing aids and cochlear implants; and it would be beneficial for many individuals with language challenges and even for children learning to read. Finally, regardless of the advances or lack of advances in speech recognition technology, it will always be more accurate and effective to pick off the fundamental acoustic features of speech than it is to recognize entire phonemes which are more complex combinations of these basic properties.",

Such a platform will have a broad impact on organizations of all sizes by empowering nonprogrammer business process owners to quickly and easily deploy applications that capture the business processes of their organizations. Preliminary results from Phase I engagements shows that the platform has the maximum impact on enabling externally-facing Customer Relationship Management (CRM) for Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs), which use the applications to facilitate and streamline interactions with customers and partners, achieve lower process management and customer/partner servicing costs, increase customer/partner satisfaction and grow revenues. \nApp2You has the potential to operate as an equalizer between large companies and SMBs with limited time and money available to for their IT infrastructure, since it enables the latter to obtain applications for their processes despite limited resources. Phase II will expand the impact by systematically reaching SMBs and promoting the use of the platform, making its use even simpler, and also finding additional verticals, such as forms distributorships and form abandonment cases, where forms-driven workflows can generate values. Finally the Phase II project will create enhancements that facilitate successful collaborations between business process owners and ad hoc information technology staff.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The CDC's FluSurge simulation shows that there will be a shortage of ventilators within the United States when the H5N1 flu virus mutates to airborne human-to-human transmission and the pandemic arrives. In the United States, it is estimated that nearly 85% of the 105,000 ventilators are in use at any time resulting, leaving in than 16,000 available to respond to a flu attack. However, for the suspected moderate to severe H5N1 Avian flu scenario, the need would    be for over 65,000-742,500 ventilators conservatively costing  500 million to  6.2 billion to procure.    Shared ventilation is a fundamentally unique approach which breaks the boundaries of current 1 ventilator to 1 patient mindset. The proposed project is to demonstrate and commercialize a next generation, largely disposable ventilator systems, which in its initial form, can use virtually any available ventilator and can provide ventilation for up to 6-8 patients without worries about cross contamination. In addition, each patient is provided individualized respiratory settings, including: oxygen concentration (Fi02), tidal volume and minute ventilation, and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP). Furthermore, the system would significantly conserves oxygen, an equally scarce resource during pandemics, and cost ~1/3rd of any available alternative. Filing a 510k submission to the Food and Drug Administration is the final deliverable of this Phase I/II proposal. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) FluSurge simulation of likely pandemic scenarios highlights a nationwide shortage of more than 725,000 ventilators. In New York State alone, over 100,000 deaths are forecasted to be directly and indirectly caused by this lack of ventilators leading The New York State Department of Health to study the medical and ethical issues of ventilator rationing as the only solution. Medical Conservation Devices (MCD) provides an innovative approach to resolve two major shortages (ventilator availability and oxygen supply) anticipated during a pandemic scenario by making it possible for one ventilator to support multiple patients with individualized respiratory control without cross contamination.",

        "abstract": "Next generation heat exchangers will operate at higher pressures and temperatures than current models in order to increase cycle efficiency, reduce fuel consumption and emissions. Ultra-supercritical coal-fired boilers can generate electric power with low emissions while burning high-sulfur coal and can increase efficiency from ~28% to >46%. The problem lies in the materials that are currently used. Current materials solutions include nickel-based superalloys, but these are prohibitively expensive. This project has sought to bypass this issue through the development of microcomposite coatings that are resistant to erosive wear, creep and gas corrosion at elevated temperatures. During the Phase I project, several aluminide coating formulations were evaluated for durability in simulated operational environments. One of the major obstacles that had to be overcome was the mismatch of the coefficient of thermal expansion between the coating and the substrate. This hurdle was overcome through the use of ceramic additions to the coating that enabled the CTE of the coating to match the substrate. These ceramic additions were both manufactured into the coating material and developed in-situ during the coating process through controlled thermite reactions to form a fine dispersion of alumina in an aluminide matrix. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The Phase II will continue to study the use of exothermic reactions to improve coating properties and to generate durable coating materials. Additional work in the Phase II project will explore the development of additional coating compositions to further improve erosion resistance and to meet the environmental conditions in other applications. The work will culminate in the cladding of a boiler tube section for evaluation in a sub-scale supercritical boiler testing facility.",

        "abstract": "The coating of steel sheet by continuous hot dipping in a molten metal bath of zinc or in a Zn-Al melt is the most efficient and economical method for providing corrosion protection to steel sheet. However, the processing of metals in liquid metal results in the reaction of the liquid metal with the tooling and can result in dross build-up and damage to the work piece. In order to address this, self-lubricating, nanocomposite coatings are being proposed to minimize adhesion of the liquid metal to the tooling as well as to reduce system wear and corrosion. The addition of solid lubricants to the metal-working tooling can decrease contact and dynamic friction which results in reduced adhesion of the work material to the tooling. The addition of ceramic nano-particles serves to enhance the wear and mechanical properties of the coatings. During the Phase I project several coating compositions were evaluated for wear and liquid metal corrosion. Initial wear properties were evaluated using ASTM G-65 Rubber Wheel Sand Erosion testing. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The coatings were evaluated for liquid metal adhesion and corrosion by immersion of coated coupons in a zinc bath. During the Phase II project, coating composition and application parameters will be optimized, coating durability in other liquid metal and metal-working environments will be studied, and a set of zinc pot roll bearings will be coated for testing in a galvanizing plant. Coating durability will be evaluated using a sub-scale zinc galvanizing simulator where both the pot roll face and bearings can be tested. Test parameters will be determined by an industry panel. Nano-composite coatings containing solid lubricant materials can be used in a variety of applications including die-casting, metal forming, metal trimming, diesel engines, and aerospace applications.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a new method for primary production of magnesium from its oxide ore using Solid Oxide Membrane Electrolysis.  Unlike other primary metal processes, this approach emits no direct CO2, has no chlorine, and is fully continuous and automated.  Published third party cost modeling has indicated that its costs are lower than all existing and proposed new processes.  Building on an earlier feasibility demonstration using experiments and mathematical and cost modeling to show that the approach can produce oxygen as well as magnesium at high current efficiency and at costs close to the published cost model, this Phase II project will develop new anode tubes to further reduce energy costs, and build and test the first self-heating electrolysis cell.  If successful, the self-heating cell will not require energy beyond that needed for electrolysis and will be the smallest possible pre-production modular unit capable of producing magnesium.\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project begins with substantial reduction of the cost and environmental impact of magnesium metal production.  Magnesium is the lowest-density engineering metal and third most abundant metal in the earth's crust, and its stiffness-to-weight, castability, and recyclability make it the best material for motor vehicle weight reduction.  Automobile makers are seeking to increase the magnesium alloy content of vehicles from 10-15 lbs/vehicle to 350 lbs/vehicle by 2020, replacing 650 lbs/vehicle of steel and aluminum parts.  This will increase fleet fuel economy by 1.5-2 miles per gallon, reducing annual petroleum import expenditures by about $20 billion.  If successful, this project will address the biggest barrier to widespread magnesium use in vehicles, which is its price stability and availability.  This could lead to a new magnesium economy taking full advantage of its light weight and ease of manufacturing in products from cellphones to laptops to trucks.  With broader usage, the versatile process resulting from this development project can likely reduce the cost and environmental impact of reducing metal oxides, leading to a new industrial ecology of primary metals production.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children in the United States. Child safety seats provide increased protection for children in motor vehicles and have been observed to reduce death and injury rates by more than 70%. A child must be properly belted into a properly installed child safety seat to achieve maximum protection. Several large studies have observed that only 10% to 20% of children are correctly harnessed into correctly installed seats. One of the most common errors involves the installation of the child safety seat in the vehicle. In most vehicles manufactured prior to 2002, a child safety seat is attached using the vehicle safety belts. In vehicles newer than 2002, a child safety seat may be attached using the Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children (LATCH) system. LATCH is designed to make installation of child safety seats easier by providing two lower anchors at the seat bight (the intersection of the seat back and cushion) onto which a rigid or flexible strap from a child seat is attached. Regardless of attachment modality, a seatbelt or flexible LATCH strap must be aggressively tensioned (greater than 30 lbs. typically) to achieve proper installation. Recent studies have observed from 50% to 100% of inspected child safety seats held in place by safety belts were too loose. Similarly, the most common error associated with LATCH installations has been observed to be a loose lower anchor strap, which was observed in 30% of installations. Loose child safety seat anchors increase the relative movement between the child safety seat and the vehicle thus increasing the likelihood of impact of the occupant, in particular of the head, with vehicle interior. The objective of this project is to develop an inexpensive power-retractable flexible lower anchor strap for child safety seats. This powered anchor strap will reduce the physical strength and agility required to properly tighten a child safety seat. We hypothesize that a powered anchor strap will increase proper child safety seat installation rates, thereby reducing motor vehicle crash injuries and deaths among children.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves an improvement to child safety seats. The available market for the proposed powered child safety seat anchor strap exceeds 2.3 million units annually. There are approximately 20 million children under 4 years of age in the United States. All are required by law to ride in child safety seats.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and commercialize an intelligent software power management data center solution.  The current default power management can seriously degrade server performance as much as 40% under certain loads. As a result, the default power management is currently not deployed and most servers in the data center are wasting significant energy. The proposed product encourages users to enable the unique power management capabilities to save up to 35% energy under normal load. The approach allows users to set the expected service-level and bound the impact of power management on server performance. For example, users can set a policy of < 10% performance loss and the software will save as much energy as possible without violating the policy. \nData center operators require energy efficient servers in the data center. Data centers in the U.S. and abroad provide the technological backbone for the Internet and e-commerce. As of 2005, data centers accounted for 2% of total U.S. energy consumption. Data center managers cite power consumption as their largest concern today since: 1) energy costs to run servers are now typically greater than acquisition costs; and 2) excessive energy use produces heat that reduces system reliability.  If successfully deployed, the proposed approach has the potential to address an emerging market pain point and to make a significant positive economic impact.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to further the development of nanomaterials-based, high permeability, energy-efficient membranes for desalination of water. Membrane-based reverse osmosis (RO) is the dominant desalination technology in many parts of the world, although it provides just a small fraction of potable water demand. This is in large part due to the energy intensiveness of the technology. It is widely acknowledged that improvements in membrane permeability can bring about significant reductions in the energy requirements for seawater RO of between 30-50%. The RO membranes developed under Phase I demonstrated significant improvements in permeability over state-of-the-art membranes, while maintaining a high salt rejection.  Phase II aims to scale the process developed in Phase I to produce spiral wound cartridges of an industry standard form factor. The membranes then will be tested to determine their future performance in a large-scale municipal desalination plant.\nThe broader impact/commercial impact of this project is that the technology is expected to bring RO desalination closer to cost-parity with existing methods of water production.  Also, the superior membrane performance achieved in Phase I demonstrates the promise of nanomaterials in RO membrane development. Scaling this process up to the pilot scale will help demonstrate the commercial viability of the technology. In addition, this project is expected to enhance the understanding of the science behind water and ion transport through membranes on the nanometer-scale, an area of current academic interest.",

        "abstract": "Hawaii has year-round growing conditions and abundant agricultural land, yet it still imports more than 85% of its food. More than 2.3 million pounds of Agaricus mushrooms, a mushroom family that includes Portobello and Crimini, were imported each year in 2006 and 2007. Currently, these mushrooms are not produced in Hawaii. Increasing the production of locally grown food products would not only reduce the state of Hawaii's carbon footprint, it would minimize the dependency on imported food, and promote sustainable long-term solutions for Hawaii's small and mid-size farms/food producers. OCR is committed to bringing the cultivation of Agaricus mushrooms to small farms in Hawaii. However, an Agaricus mushroom industry in Hawaii is not economically feasible until local materials can be substituted for conventional substrate materials currently used in mainland mushroom production. It is also important to determine whether a renewable material can be substituted in any proportion for peat, which is the current (non-renewable) \"gold standard\" for mushroom casing. Expansion by OCR into mushroom cultivation, using local materials, is a logical extension of OCR's current recycling efforts, as green wastes compose a substantial portion of municipal wastes in Hawaiian landfills. This Agaricus mushroom cultivation project has the potential for providing small and mid-sized farms with an income stream while diversifying their year-round crop base regardless of what else they are producing. It will allow them to address a valuable high-demand local mushroom market with the freshest-possible products and will introduce an entirely new crop into Hawaii's agricultural industry. It will also have a positive impact on the environment as a recycling activity, and will provide farmers with spent mushroom compost to use as a soil amendment for their existing field crops. OCR's success with this USDA project will serve as a model for additional innovative recycling projects nationwide, and should lead to other high-value agricultural applications for small and mid-sized farms. The potential benefits are substantial if local sources for substrate and casing can be developed: Agaricus mushroom cultivation would be a new farming industry for Hawaii, one that could reduce Hawaii's imported food dependency. Agaricus mushrooms are highly perishable and sensitive to heat; therefore, they have to be flown in and kept refrigerated before consumption. A domestic source of fresh Agaricus mushrooms would reduce imported fuel dependency for Hawaii's population of over 1.4 million, and provide a source of mushrooms for its influx of tourists. Hawaiian production of Agaricus mushrooms would contribute to Hawaii's economic diversification at a time when it is even more important to think about energy conservation and protection of the environment.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a platform for photon beam enhanced and electron beam induced nanoscale processing.  Focused electron beam induced processing is a nanoscale process generally capable of about 10nm resolution and 1nm has been demonstrated.  However, materials deposited via focused nanoscale electron beam induced deposition (EBID) contain significant amounts of residual contamination due to insufficient by-product desorption from the precursor molecules.  In addition, electron beam induced etching (EBIE) is typically limited by desorption of the resultant electron beam induced etch product, thus is prohibitively slow.  This project will address these limitations by developing an instrument capable of delivering a pulsed photon beam to facilitate desorption of contaminate by-products for the EBID process, and accelerate desorption of etch products during the EBIE process.  The objective is to design and construct a platform capable of precise delivery of photons over a broad spectroscopic range for nanoscale processing and simultaneous microscale imaging in standard scanning electron microscopes (SEM) or dual ion and electron beam systems.  Finally, requisite pulsed electron-photon-mass transport synchronization strategies will be developed for advanced nanoscale prototyping, editing, and sample preparation. \nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the development of a new tool to enable improved rapid prototyping of nanoscale devices by offering a cost-effective solution for nanoscale synthesis compatible with widespread SEM and dual beam platforms.  This will accelerate the research efforts on next generation nanoscale devices with new and/or enhanced functionality, which is expected to benefit many facets of society ranging from physical to life sciences.  This project may also improve the understanding of critical photon-electron-substrate-vapor interactions which will ultimately lead to a directed assembly approach capable of depositing 3-dimensional, complex and multi-component materials with nanometer scale lateral resolution and atomic scale z-dimensional control.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a hand-held controller for motor-powered surgical instruments.  The controller will enable automated operation of the surgical instrument, including biomechanically informed algorithms, that decrease trauma to tissues during surgery.  This controller will be first deployed on a new thoracic retractor, an instrument used to pry apart the rigid tissues of the chest to provide surgical access to organs inside the chest, e.g. the heart and lungs.  Thoracic retractors are used in two common thoracic procedures for surgical access: (1) thoracotomy, in which an incision is made between the ribs and the thoracic retractor pries apart the ribs, and (2) sternotomy, in which the sternum is bisected and the thoracic retractor pries apart the two halves of the thoracic cage.  Current thoracic retractors are simple mechanical jacks developed in the 1930's, and they severely traumatize the tissues of the chest by, for example, breaking ribs and tearing ligaments.  The controller developed in this SBIR will enable automated retraction of the thoracic tissues, including an algorithm that can both detect that a fracture is about to occur and then avert that fracture, thereby greatly decreasing trauma to the thoracic tissues.  \nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is both to improve patient's lives by decreasing the trauma of surgery (decreasing both post-surgical pain and complications) and to decrease the cost of health care by reducing the amount of medical care a patient needs after surgery (both decreasing the length of hospital stays after surgery and reducing the incidence of expensive complications).  Nearly 600,000 people have a sternotomy or a thoracotomy each year in the US, and recovery from these procedures is frequently marked by significant post-operative respiratory dysfunction and pain.  The new surgical instrument controller being developed in this project will improve post-surgical recovery for all of these patients.   Importantly, this is the first application of biomechanically-informed algorithms to surgical retraction, and we anticipate their applicability to many more surgical procedures, generating both significant commercial opportunity and significant improvements in health care.",

To this end, therapeutic biological devices addressing the neglected physiologic component of renal replacement therapy are rapidly being developed. Transfer of this innovative technology to the clinical setting will require the manufacture of devices using a large number of cells of human origin. Cells will be derived from human transplant discards using enhanced propagation (EP) techniques developed in the Phase 1 component of this proposal. Although the availability of human tissue remains limited, development of the EP protocol has greatly enhanced the amplification of renal cell progenitors, removing cell availability as the limiting factor to the clinical application of renal cell therapy. The overall goal of this proposal is to optimize the protocols necessary for the isolation, propagation, cryopreservation, differentiation, integration and maintenance of human EP cells in a bioartificial renal epithelial cell system (BRECS) with regard to manufacturing. Devices seeded with EP human renal epithelial cells (HRECs) will be used to demonstrate efficacy in a well established porcine model of sepsis. A broad panel of efficacy markers will be monitored in vitro using a whole blood bioassay and results correlated with therapy outcome in the septic pig model. Data will be used to develop release criteria for cells isolated and maintained under EP protocols relative to efficacy and to satisfy the potency requirement of the Biologic License Application. The targeted initial population for BRECS therapy will be acute renal failure patients with sepsis induced Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). The feasibility of maintaining the device and extracorporeal circuit will be demonstrated over the projected 7 day clinical time course of required renal support for this clinical target. Data derived from the successful completion of the Phase II proposal will be used for an Investigational New Drug (IND) submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a Phase I/II clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of biotherapeutic devices seeded with HREC derived from enhanced propagation protocols.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-term goal of this research is to develop and optimize the generation and qualification of enhanced propagation (EP) protocols for the isolation, expansion and maintenance of human renal epithelial cells (HREC) for use in biologic applications, thus eliminating the issue of limited tissue/cell sources for generation of HRECs. The specific application targeted in this research proposal is for the assessment of utilization of EP HRECs in a bioartificial renal epithelial cell system (BRECS) that effectively adds therapeutic value to a variety of disease processes, including the treatment of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis. Severe sepsis with SIRS occurs in 200,000 patients annually in the U.S. and has a mortality rate of 30-40%, even with use of intensive care units and broad spectrum antibiotics. Successful completion of the planned studies in this proposal will allow for an unlimited cell source for use in the BRECS application. This device would greatly reduce the multiorgan effects of sepsis and SIRS, thus improving the clinical outcome of patients affected by these disease processes.",

During the Phase II program, the basic system will be expanded in several steps. The final goal is to produce a mobile system that can be integrated quickly into a wind tunnel and produce near-real time pressure and deformation data. If an existing VMD system is available, it may be desirable to simply synchronize data acquisition with this system, and therefore, an external control capability is essential. Combining pressure and deformation data quickly, a process we refer to as data fusion, is essential for productive wind tunnel tests. Rapid data fusion will enable understanding of the flow while the model is in the tunnel, and therefore, facilitate quick and accurate decisions as the test evolves.

We used rational design to isolate compounds that bind to critical insect chemosensory proteins, and are isolating those compounds capable of altering insect behavior. In response to citrus grower demand we have isolated small molecules that have the potential to alter the foraging behavior of the agriculturally and economically significant insect, Apis mellifera (European honeybee). Our final products will be repellents capable of protecting citrus from unwanted pollination. The technologies utilized here are applicable to the development of control products for other insect pest species, including insect carriers of human disease and insect pests of economic, agricultural, or domestic significance.\nThe broader impacts of this research are avoiding the use of insecticides and expanding our ability to control insect behavior. The initial insect targeted, the European honeybee (Apis mellifera), provides essential pollination that adds an estimated $14 billion annually in value to US crops. However, unwanted honeybee pollination severely decreases the value of mandarin crops, leading to the need for an effective bee repellent that is safe for bees and humans alike.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to conduct basic and applied biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent on data produced by new and emerging technologies. This data has an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Researchers are therefore dependent on computing and computational tools to be able to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data. Tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are common goals of many, if not all, biomedical research programs. Sound analytical and statistical theory and methodology for class pre- diction and class discovery lay the foundation for building these tools, of which the machine learning techniques of classification (supervised learning) and clustering (unsupervised learning) are crucial. Our goal is to produce software for analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies. Ensemble techniques are recent advances in machine learning theory and methodology leading to great improvements in accuracy and stability in data set analysis and interpretation. The results from a committee of primary machine learners (classifiers or clusterers) that have been trained on different instance or feature subsets are combined through techniques such as voting. The high prediction accuracy of classifier ensembles (such as boosting, bagging, and random forests) has generated much excitement in the statistics and machine learning communities. Recent research extends the ensemble methodology to clustering, where class information is unavailable, also yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy and stability. In theory, most ensemble techniques are inherently parallel. However, existing implementations are generally serial and assume the data set is memory resident. Therefore current software will not scale to the large data sets produced in today's biomedical research. We propose to take two approaches to scale ensemble techniques to large data sets: data partitioning approaches and parallel computing. The focus of Phase I will be to prototype scalable classifier ensembles using parallel architectures. We intend to: establish the parallel computing infrastructures; produce a preliminary architecture and software design; investigate a wide range of ensemble generation schemes using data partitioning strategies; and implement scalable bagging and random forests based on the preliminary design. The focus of Phase II will be to complete the software architecture and implement the scalable classifier ensembles and scalable clusterer ensembles within this framework. We intend to: complete research and development of classifier ensembles; extend the classification framework to clusterer ensembles; research and develop a unified interface for building ensembles with differing generation mechanisms and combination strategies; and evaluate the effectiveness of the software on simulated and real data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The common goals to many, if not all, biomedical research programs are the development of tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. These programs often rely on new types of data that have an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Our goal is to produce software for the analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies to enable researchers who are dependent on computational tools to have the ability to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the western societies. The plasma level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), the good form of cholesterol, is negatively correlated with the risk of heart disease, myocardial infarction, and coronary death. However, current composite risk score tests such as the Framingham tests identify only 1/3rd of individuals at risk, and HDL-C contributes very little to these composite risk scores. Phase I studies demonstrated that the protein composition of HDL measured by MALDI-MS differs markedly between patients with established CAD and age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. Phase I also established that CAD subjects could be distinguished from age- and sex- matched healthy subjects with a high sensitivity and specificity using HDL protein signals. The goal of the proposed work is to demonstrate that the HDL protein signals can be used to improve the accuracy of composite MI risk scores. This goal will be met through experiments that measure banked samples and new samples collected from 400 subjects who will be monitored for adverse events during the period of the project.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance to public health: Our overall hypothesis is that pattern recognition MS analysis of HDL will be a powerful tool for detecting people at risk for myocardial infarctions (Ml). Each year, more than a million Americans have an Ml, of whom half die. However, our ability to identify subjects at increased risk for these events is severely limited. Therefore, the availability of diagnostics that could accurately predict risk in time to ward off an MI would have an enormous impact on health care costs and public health.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of complex biological phenomena and disease progression has led to the realization that changes in the expression of genes underlie many of these processes. Developing reagents that can selectively alter the expression level of any desired gene has been a goal of both scientists and clinicians for years. Historically, the most common approach was based on antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that encompass a broad variety of mechanisms that have in common an oligonucleotide designed to base pair with its complementary target mRNA leading to either degradation or impaired function of the mRNA. Classically, ASOs were designed to interfere with translation of the target mRNA or induce its degradation via RNase H. Currently, greater excitement has focused on RNAi which uses a distinct mechanism where oligonucleotides trigger an endogenous pre-existing gene suppression pathway that is fundamental to cellular gene regulatory networks. In spite of its general success, some mRNAs are only modestly downregulated (2-fold) by RNAi and others may be refractory. Further, certain off-target effects can arise leading to unexpected consequences, underscoring the need for additional methods. The rapid rise of the RNAi field has led to an increased appreciation, of direct relevance to the present proposal, that regulatory sequence elements in mRNA 3' ends (i.e., 3'UTRs) control the expression of that gene. Here we present a progress report from a Phase 1 SBIR on the development of a new gene silencing technology which we call  U1 Adaptors,  that uses oligonucleotides annealing to specific sequence regions within the 3'UTR to inhibit pre-mRNA processing. In this Phase 2 proposal, we plan to continue the optimization work begun in Phase 1 and expand to perform high throughput analysis of U1 Adaptors to establish site selection criteria and create an algorithm and design tool to assist with application of this technology to new gene targets with ease. We further propose to test the specificity of the method using whole genome microarray analysis. We intend to focus on use of this technology in genes which appear to be difficult to suppress using RNAi methods. Finally, we propose to study use of U1 Adaptors in complex genes having more than one polyadenylation site or alternative splicing involving the terminal exon. We believe this new technology will make a significant addition to our gene silencing toolkit and may even aid emerging oligonucleotide- based therapies, although that is beyond the scope of this proposal.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The commercialization of this new U1 Adaptor mediated gene silencing technology will be a significant addition to the scientific research community's  gene silencing toolkit . Because this method exploits a distinctly different mechanism compared to more common gene silencing approaches, it has the potential of enhancing these traditional technologies when used in combination with them via additive effects. This may aid in the development of emerging oligonucleotide-based gene silencing therapies by improving sensitivity and efficacy.",

To scale up this process without losing the unique and valuable properties of core-shell nanoparticles, a wet chemistry route with laser for selective polymerization will be utilized to coat each metal nanoparticle with a polymeric shell.  \nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide high-dielectric constant nanoparticles for the development of nanocomposite to meet future energy storage needs of supercapacitors.

Thus far, however, higher-throughput next-generation sequencing systems are relatively expensive, have relatively long run times and produce relatively short reads thereby limiting their use for diagnostic applications.  In this Phase II application, we propose to combine the novel chip fabrication techniques developed in Phase I, the innovative sequencing by synthesis chemistry exclusively licensed from Columbia University, and an automated prototype sequencing instrument to produce an advanced sequencing by synthesis system. This system will be higher throughput and significantly more cost effective than other competing next-generation technologies.  During the project, high density chips will be fabricated, the sequencing instrument and chemistry will be optimized and an E. coli genome will be re-sequenced.  This system will be capable of producing large amounts of quality sequence data faster and at a lower cost than any other near-term next generation sequencing system.  This will make next-generation DNA sequencing technology more accessible to the broad research community.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Health management of older adults can be improved through convenient and objective assessment of their gait. Although a number of quantitative measures of walking, such as the variability of steps taken, have been shown to predict the risk of falls, these measurements are difficult to obtain outside the laboratory. It would be helpful to obtain accurate and objective measures in the clinic or even in the home during normal activities of daily living. Long-term monitoring could even be used to track compliance to a rehabilitation program or to determine when the dosage of medicines should be adjusted, all without requiring frequent visits to the clinic. Unfortunately, current devices for long-term monitoring are limited to simplistic data such as step count, and there is no convenient means to accurately measure the gait variables most indicative of mobility, balance, and fall risk. Miniature sensors are rapidly improving in accuracy and power economy, offering great potential for field-based activity assessment. Simple accelerometer-based devices have been miniaturized, and wireless systems can provide rough estimates of running speed and distance accurate enough for casual use, while remaining unobtrusive enough to wear conveniently for long durations. New microchip technologies make it feasible for highly accurate, inertial sensor systems to be packaged similarly for daily use. A major barrier for gait measurements is the need to eliminate drift errors that occur with these devices when estimating stride length and other quantities related to mobility. This project seeks to develop sensor fusion algorithms for this purpose, and integrate them with wearable inertial measurement sensors. The Specific Aims of this project are to: 1. Implement drift reduction algorithms and software for integrating inertial sensor data to accurately estimate gait parameters. 2. Develop wireless sensor and receiver unit hardware for field-based gait monitoring, with miniature packages suitable for long-term use. 3. Perform accuracy and usability testing on younger and older adults, to characterize device specifications in realistic environments.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Falling and related injuries greatly limit mobility in older adults, and their risk can be reduced substantially with exercise, rehabilitation, and other interventions. It is currently difficult, however, to monitor mobility in the home and for long durations, either to assess compliance to an intervention or to determine dosage of medicine. This proposal seeks to develop new technology to enable accurate, long-term measurements of gait and mobility in the home.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Education Center for Adoptive Parents Online (ECAPO) Adoption has undergone dramatic change in the past 30 years, due largely to the complexity of contemporary adoptive relationships, which increasingly involve international, multi-ethnic, multi-racial, and foster care placements. Adoptive youth experience consistently high rates of behavior problems and psychological maladjustments. These adoptive youth issues occur at a disproportionately higher rate than among non-adoptive youth. Experts see parenting competence as the primary mediating factor in reversing this trend, yet many adoptive parents lack competence and confidence in their ability to parent effectively. There is a compelling need for accessible, research-based training that enhances adoptive parents' competence and ensures the long-term healthy adjustment of adopted children. Affirming this need, the recently enacted Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption compels treaty signatories to require training for prospective adoptive parents. Many states now require Hague standards to be applied to all adoption cases. The central aim of the proposed project, The Education Center for Adoptive Parents Online (ECAPO), is to address these deficiencies and enhance the competence of adoptive parents, ultimately advancing the long- term healthy adjustment of adopted children. To that end, we will develop and formally evaluate an interactive online media-based program to meet the needs of adoptive parents. Materials will be grounded in a strong conceptual framework and will target factors known to buffer the effect of risk factors on adopted children's adjustment. ECAPO will contain a unique set of skill-building instructional components delivered via an innovative web delivery platform (IRISedOnline) that will enable adoption service providers to incorporate ECAPO into existing websites to augment and improve services for adoptive families. In Phase I, the first program module was developed and satisfactorily evaluated for feasibility. Phase II efforts will focus on developing and evaluating the complete program. When completed, ECAPO will be organized into 6 basic modules and 2 additional informational modules addressing specialized topics, and will provide over 10 hours of adoptive parent training as required by the Hague Convention of 2002. The program covers content that topics experts have identified as particularly salient to adoptive families: (1) Understanding adoption (issues of attachment, identity, race, culture, etc.); (2) Communication within the family about adoption-related issues (developed and evaluated in Phase I); (3) Communication with extended family, the outside world, and school about adoption-related issues; (4) Promoting adopted children's resilience in the family context; (5) Remedial parenting and counteracting risk in the adoptive context; and (6) Cultural competence in raising the transracially and/or transculturally adopted child. The two additional modules will cover (a) foster care adoptive parenting, and (b) information on adoptive parenting for blended families, siblings, special needs, kinship adoption. Six tasks will guide the development of the Phase II program: (1) convene a development team to draft a content outline and align content with instructional delivery, (2) conduct key informant interviews and facilitate focus groups, (3) produce Phase II program assets, (4) design and develop enhancements to the delivery web site, (5) upload the program to the website and conduct usability testing, and (6) enroll participants and evaluate program efficacy by conducting a large randomized controlled trial with 330 participants comparing outcomes from the intervention group to those of a control group.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The consistent and disproportionate rate of behavior problems and psychological maladjustment among adopted youth poses a significant public health concern. Experts say this concern can best be addressed by providing adoptive parents with the education and training they need to effectively deal with complex adoption-related issues. This project will create and conduct a randomized controlled trial of an online training resource that is accessible, empirically sound, and provides adoptive parents with needed knowledge and skills to mediate the effect of risk on their adopted children's development.",

ISC proposes development of the Frequency Modulate Micro Gyro (FM Gyro). Unlike conventional micro gyros which produce amplitude modulated (AM) signals, the FM Gyro produces output signals that are intrinsically frequency modulated (FM). A micro gyro element that generates FM signals would provide a new way to combat the electronic noise issue. In the Phase I, a baseline FM Gyro design has been developed.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People infected with HIV are a significant part of the U.S. workforce and they are growing in numbers. Indeed, surveys suggest that working adults are concerned about contracting HIV, consider their employer a credible source of HIV/AIDS-related information, and want HIV prevention programs offered at the workplace. There are also many sound business reasons to implement workplace HIV education and prevention programs. Treating HIV is expensive, leading to higher health insurance premiums. No single disease has resulted in more workplace lawsuits than HIV/AIDS. And common misperceptions regarding transmission can lead to co-worker fear and reduced on-the-job productivity. Despite this, only 15% of worksites offer HIV/AIDS education programs with most focusing exclusively on occupational exposure issues.  This dearth of worksite programs is primarily due to the inadequacy of currently available resources. They are time-intensive to implement, do not rely on accepted behavior change principles, and cannot be tailored to fit the unique needs of individual worksites and their employees. The ISA Group proposes to fill this void by developing a web-based HIV workplace prevention and policy development program for employers and their employees. This multi-media program will guide senior management through a step-by-step workplace policy development process. If a policy is already in place, or is subsumed under a more general life-threatening illness and disability policy, an interactive tool will assess its adequacy as it relates to HIV/AIDS issues (e.g., compliance with federal, state, and local laws; confidentiality; workplace discrimination; etc). This policy will then serve as the foundation for all workplace HIV prevention efforts. For supervisors, the program will increase their understanding of the HIV workplace policy, develop their skills to effectively respond to an employee infected with HIV/AIDS, and help them foster positive workplace norms for HIV prevention education. For employees and their families, the program will provide training in empirically validated HIV prevention techniques.  In Phase I, a prototype of the program was developed and tested with 27 potential users. Quantitative benchmarks to proceed to Phase II were met and exceeded. In Phase II, we propose completing development of the WorkWell program and testing its effectiveness in a two-part study. First, recruit 25 policymakers at US companies who have not yet implemented an HIV workplace policy and assess their knowledge of HIV workplace policy and their intentions to implement such a policy before and after reviewing the Policy Development module. Second, randomly assign 600 working adults to review either the WorkWell program or the print-based CDC BRTA program materials. The impact of the Supervisor Training, Preventing HIV, and Family Education modules will be assessed one- and four-months after program review on both primary and secondary outcome measures.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to develop a web-based HIV workplace prevention and policy development program. For businesses this will allow them to realize gains in worker productivity, reduce the likelihood of lawsuits, and reduce their health care costs. For employees and their families, the skills contained in this program will help them reduce risk behaviors and, ultimately, prevent the spread of HIV/STDs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of liver transplantation, patient and graft outcomes have incrementally improved. Whole liver or segmental liver transplantation have been performed in patients suffering from different endstage liver diseases. The infusion of isolated hepatocytes has been investigated as an alternative to solid organ grafting. Transplantations of allogeneic hepatocytes have been successfully performed to alleviate symptoms of genetic defects and liver failures. They were curative in some cases and provided reprieve in other cases until solid organs became available. General immune suppression regimens have been used to protect allogeneic liver tissues from rejection. Though successful, they are fraught by many grave side effects. Most prominently they impair the protective functions of the immune system. Therefore, major efforts are being made to introduce novel therapeutics that protect allogeneic grafts with similar, if not improved efficacy, yet that are less toxic, highly specific, do not suppress protective immune responses and have to be provided transiently. Isogenis bases its technology on the natural veto immune inhibitory phenomenon. Isogenis' engineered veto uses the surface expression of the CD8 1-chain to transform cells into specifically immune suppressive entities. Isogenis believes that its veto technology will change the paradigm of immune suppression from systemic (general) to tissue specific (tissue centered). Isogenis' scientists established the overall feasibility of the veto approach with engineered antibodies and different veto vectors (VV) that mounted the CD8 1-chain on the surface of different tissues. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Isogenis established that mouse hepatocytes transduced with a VV were protected from rejection in immune competent allogeneic recipients. In addition a novel architecture of Adenoviral gene transfer vectors was developed. It allowed the design of a clinical VV as a fully deleted Adenoviral vector that could be produced without a helper virus. For Phase 2 of this SBIR, Isogenis proposes to (I) to optimize hepatocyte transduction and transplantation protocols and (II) to establish a nonhuman primate (NHP) hepatocyte transplantation model to test the functionality, pharmacology and toxicity of clinical VVs. As the pre-clinical stage of product development is being completed with this project, data necessary for the filing of an investigational new drug (IND) application will be collected for the transplantation of veto-engineered allogeneic human hepatocytes. Discussions with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about VVs and their use in transplantation have been initiated. A collaboration between Isogenis' basic scientists (VV production, mouse studies) and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's clinical researchers (NHP studies, transduction of human cells) has been established to perform the planned studies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Liver and hepatocyte transplantations have successfully been performed in patients suffering from different acquired and genetic liver diseases. General immune suppression regimens have been used to protect allogeneic liver tissues from rejection. Though successful, they are fraught by many grave side effects. Most prominently they impair the protective functions of the immune system. Isogenis has been developing novel therapeutics that protect allogeneic grafts with similar, if not improved efficacy, yet that are less toxic, highly specific, do not suppress protective immune responses and at best have to be provided transiently.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are the myelinating cells of the central nervous system and play a critical role in white matter formation. Serious clinical disorders affect central nervous system white matter during early development. These conditions include periventricular white matter injury (PWMI), which affects up to 20% of very low birth weight premature infants. PWMI is due to loss of Pre- oligodendrocytes (PreOLs), which are proliferative cells that develop into myelinating OLs.  Presently, we are unaware of pharmacological approaches that specifically target PreOLs, resulting in increased proliferation of these cells. Because white matter injury is the leading cause of nervous system injury in premature infants, developing new treatments for PWMI will have a major clinical impact.  Under Phase 1 of this SBIR, we proposed to use high-throughput screening to identify compounds ( hits ) that would stimulate PreOL proliferation. These studies proved to be highly successful, as we identified diazoxide as a stimulator of PreOL proliferation, and we observed that this compound promotes myelination in a murine model of PWMI. Diazoxide acts by activating KATP channels, and we were able to demonstrate KATP channel component expression in PreOLs. We also found that other KATP activators stimulate PreOL proliferation. Thus, we achieved the major goal of our Phase 1 proposal.  In Phase II studies, we propose to extend our study of diazoxide in preclinical, proof-of-concept studies involving cell culture and animal studies. We will: (1) Define OL-stage specific responses to diazoxide. (2) Evaluate protection against PWMI in animal models. (3) Assess long-term effects of neonatal diazoxide therapy.  The long-term goal of this work is to develop novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of white matter injuries in premature infants. Support from the NIH through the SBIR program will serve to strengthen the productive academic/industrial collaboration established between scientists at Yale University (Dr. Rivkees) and JS Genetics (New Haven, CT) to discover novel drugs. Ultimately, research such as this will lead to important discoveries with significant public health benefit and commercial value. We also anticipate that these studies will lead to the development of novel approaches for treating and preventing white matter injury in the tens of thousands of premature infants born and hospitalized each year.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this work is to assess the utility of diazoxide as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of white matter injuries in premature infants.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Fragile X Syndrome (FRAX) is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation in males. FRAX is caused by the expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the FMR1 gene. In normal individuals, the 5' UTR of the FMR1 gene contains 5 to 45 CGG repeats; however, individuals with FRAX have over 200 repeats. Presently, Southern Blot analysis is used to determine the size of the repeat segment and methylation status of the FRAX gene. This test only detects the gross size of CGG repeats and is labor intensive and expensive. PCR and gel electrophoresis is typically used to determine the size of the CGG expansion. This approach is limited, as PCR reactions typically fail to amplify long stretches of CGG expansions (gt25 repeats) and molecular weight determination by electrophoresis via capillary or slab gels is labor intensive.  In our Phase I SBIR award, we developed a novel, highly efficient and accurate screening test for diagnosing FRAX. In Step 1, Whole Genome Multiple Displacement Amplification using 7-deaza-2-Guanosine (7-deaza GTP) nucleotide analog is incorporated into multiple copies of the CGG FMR1 expansion. In Step 2, Site Specific Multiple Displacement Amplification (SSMDA) using 7-deaza GTP is performed to weaken the GC base pairings, making the GCC expansion more accessible to Taq DNA Polymerase in real-time PCR. In Step 3, SSMDA is followed by quantitative assessment of the numbers of CGG triplet repeats using TaqMan real-time PCR without the need for sizing by gel electrophoresis or Southern blotting.  We hypothesize that using this new molecular-based method, we can develop an effective, rapid and low-cost screening test for FRAX with broad commercial application. In this Phase II application we propose to:  SA1: Optimize our assay for CGG repeat copy number determination using a large number of DNA samples with varying degrees of CGG repeats.  SA2: Test our assay in a clinical FRAX diagnostic laboratory.  SA3: Test our assay in blood spots for potential newborn screening.  We anticipate that this Phase II application will lead to the optimization and implementation of a test that is suitable for low cost high-throughput screening for FRAX. As such, this test has the potential to markedly change how we currently screen for FRAX. These studies will involve the combined expertise of JS Genetics, which has been developing novel DNA-based diagnostic tests, and Dr. Bai-Lin Wu of Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, who an extensive track record of developing clinical DNA diagnostic studies and in clinical laboratory testing of FRAX.

This includes understanding the hazards and effects, properly identifying items of protective equipment, gaining knowledge of how to don (put on) them correctly, how to perform essential roles and responsibilities while wearing protective equipment, hazards to be aware of when wearing it, how to properly doff and dispose of it and how to properly decontaminate oneself. The Phase II technical approach will focus on applying the Instructional Systems Development (ISD) methodology to the design, development, testing and evaluation of the prototype course. PROTECT e-learning components will include a web portal, learning management system (LMS), instructional content (lesson materials) and intelligent tutor exercises. At the web portal, SSP will be able to access the PROTECT e-learning course through which they will gain the training necessary to protect themselves properly and still perform their duties effectively when responding to a WMD / HAZMAT (Avian Flu / Pandemic Flu) incident. The course will be learner centered and instructional materials will focus on doing rather than telling. Through the exercises the learner must apply the knowledge learned in the lessons to solve real-world problems he/she is likely to encounter.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this Fast Track SBIR is to develop and evaluate a series of curriculum supplements, entitled Attitude Boost, which aims to improve students' positive attitudes toward science, with the goal, in turn, of improving scientific literacy and academic performance on science subjects, particularly those related to drug abuse education and prevention. Attitude Boost will be theoretically-based, standards-driven multimedia product that will include a student CD-ROM with at least five interactive self-paced modules on topics like the scientific method and its applicability to daily tasks and the work of scientists and its value to society. A teacher implementation guide will provide background information on the impact of attitudes on science performance and later outcomes, methods for implementing the curriculum supplement in the classroom, links between Attitude Boost and other science curricula, and approaches for assessing student outcomes. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has invested in the development of many public domain curricula on the science of drug abuse, particularly the Brain Power  series, in large measure because promoting science literacy is a core component of its mission. Indeed, individual science literacy is linked with healthy decision making about drug use and other health topics. It is also essential that the general public understands the effects of drugs on the brain and body in order to effectively address issues of abuse, addiction, and treatment in communities. Effective science education also promotes a new generation of productive researchers in science fields and U.S. competitiveness in research and development. Attitudes toward science have been found to be a strong predictor of achievement, but attitudes generally decline during late elementary school. Attitude Boost will link with NIDA's other science education curricula to improve student performance on these specifically, as well as science writ large. In Phase I, KDHRC will develop a prototype product and evaluate its effectiveness in changing student knowledge and improving attitudes. In Phase II, KDHRC will complete product development and conduct a controlled quasi-experimental evaluation to explore these research questions: 1) To what extent does completion of the Attitude Boost CD-ROM prior to participating in a science education curriculum result in better performance on that curriculum? 2) To what extent are there age, gender, ethnic/racial or other differences in responses to the Attitude Boost materials? KDHRC proposes a Fast Track because our project partners, advisory board, commercialization partners, and project procedures are in place, and there is an unmet need in the market for this product. Following product completion and evaluation, the Attitude Boost curriculum supplements will be marketed to schools nationwide. The results of the evaluation will be disseminated through the academic literature and practitioner-oriented briefs to add to knowledge about optimization of science attitudes and performance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE It is critically important for people to be scientifically literate in order to make fully informed medical, political, economic, and social decisions concerning individual and societal welfare. Attitudes toward science generally begin to decline in late elementary school, and science performance and aptitude suffers in turn. Therefore, the objective of the Attitude Boost project is to develop easy-to-implement curriculum supplements to improve student attitudes toward science, thereby increasing scientific literacy.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this Fast Track application, KDH Research and Communication, Inc. (KDHRC) will develop a school-based, science education curriculum specifically on prescription and over-the-counter (Rx/OTC) drugs, tentatively entitled POP-D (Proper use of Over-the-counter and Prescription Drugs). Because Rx/OTC abuse has many distinctions from illegal drugs, including common motivations for use, innovative tools are needed to stem rising rates of abuse. Therefore, in POP-D, science education approaches will be infused with best practices in prevention to create an innovative model to reach youth. The goal of this theory-based product is to increase accurate knowledge about Rx/OTC drugs, their impact on the body and brain, and effects of abuse. In Phase I, KDHRC will create a prototype of the POP-D curriculum, which will ultimately consist of a Teacher's Guide with interrelated lesson plans, parent materials for a school to conduct an outreach and education on the topic of Rx/OTC prevention, and multimedia materials for 7th and 8th grade youth. A quasi- experimental evaluation of the prototype will be conducted to assess feasibility. In Phase II, we will complete and rigorously evaluate POP-D to determine its ability to change knowledge, attitudes, norms, intentions, and behaviors in participating students. Results of this project will contribute to the literature on best practices in Rx/OTC education and prevention. After finalization of the product in Phase II, the curriculum will be disseminated to schools and communities throughout the United States. In 2005, 2.1 million teens abused prescription drugs (NSDUH, 2006), and research indicates this number will increase due to the wide availability of these drugs and myths about their safety. For instance, 57 percent of teens in a national sample state that prescription pain relievers are easy to get from their parents' medicine cabinets (NSDUH, 2006), and roughly 40 percent of 10 teens state that prescription medicines are safer to use than illegal drugs (PATS, 2006). To date, there are very few resources to educate youth about prescription drugs. Public Health Relevance: The proposed curriculum will contribute to the literature and best practices on this important topic by developing and evaluating a theory-based, science education and prevention curriculum for seventh and eighth grade students, their teachers, and parents.",

        "abstract": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules stipulate that corrective action be taken for drinking water distribution systems that exceed the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for total trihalomethanes (TTHMs), 80 &mu;g/L. Currently, real-time or even periodic monitoring of drinking water is not economically feasible. Available methods use gas chromatography and are expensive and plagued with long delay times between sample collection and results. Laboratory analysis requires sample collection, packaging and shipping, tracking and recordkeeping, and disposal of samples. A sensor allowing rapid response, real-time measurement of TTHM concentrations in water systems would be ideal for identifying contaminant &quot;hot spots&quot; and allowing system operators to implement mitigation strategies and monitor changes.\nA team including the principal investigator developed such a sensor in the 1990s--the RCI sensor. This sensor was fabricated from a mixture of rare-earth elements sintered in a silica matrix, a procedure very similar to that used for the heated metal oxide sensor (HMOS). Unlike HMOSs, this RCI sensor was extremely sensitive to chlorinated organic vapors and not at all sensitive to hydrocarbons. The sensor was very effective but relatively large and expensive. The goal of this project is to develop and demonstrate feasibility of a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) version of this sensor, a prototype analyzer, and simple analytical method that can measure TTHM at concentrations below the EPA-regulated level of 80 &mu;g/L in water. The MEMS approach will yield a modern sensor with a tiny economical footprint and high performance.\nKWJ recently has developed a MEMS platform on which multiple classes of chemical sensors can be fabricated, including the RCI sensor, and there is opportunity to leverage this work with this SBIR project. In Phase I of this SBIR project, KWJ developed a MEMS planar sensor chip with the rare-earth sensory coating and demonstrated that it is responsive to THMs at low ppb levels. In Phase II, KWJ will integrate the sensor into an analyzer and develop a method for effective monitoring of TTHMs in drinking water that will save significant time and materials and provide a new field capability for environmental protection.\nIn Phase I, KWJ fabricated and tested a MEMS planar version of the sensor, demonstrating the ability to detect less than 5ppbv CHCl3, less than 15ppbv CHBr3 in gas phase, and less than 10 and 20 &mu;g/L, respectively, in water without pre-concentration. The Phase II research effort will focus on optimizing the sensor and sampler design. KWJ will build, instrument, develop, and validate a simple sensor-method with a target of less than 1 &mu;g/L for all THM species. The resulting analyzer will make analytical quality monitoring of drinking water for TTHMs possible virtually anywhere, at any time, on-the-spot, and at low cost. Additional applications made possible will include pool and spa as well as industrial water and groundwater monitoring.",

Laser Tissue Welding compared to Radiofrequency ablation for surgical treatment of liver neoplasms  A Clinical Safety and Efficacy Study Twenty patients will be treated with laser tissue welding and 20 randomized controls will be treated with open radiofrequency ablation (deep tissue coagulation) for treatment of primary and metastatic liver malignancies. The objective of this study will be to obtain a clinical safety and efficacy profile about laser tissue welding therapy in human subjects. I A. Safety will be assessed by tabulating the frequency of adverse events, such as postoperative morbidity due to secondary hemorrhage and hematoma; secondary infection and intra-abdominal abscess; prolonged biliary leak; compromised liver function, septicemia and mortality. I B. Efficacy will be determined by comparing treatment and controls with respect to the objective response rate based on the number of patients who achieve complete hemostasis, the time to hemostasis per cm2 area covered, intraoperative and postoperative blood loss (per day and number of days, blood product transfusion use (intraoperative and postoperative), postoperative bile leakage (per day and number of days); total operating room time, ICU stay, hospital stay and hospital costs.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed at the development of a wall shear stress sensor based on micro-optical resonators. The core element of the sensor, the micro-optical stress gauge (MOSG), consists of a micro-optical spherical resonator and optical fibers through which tunable laser light is coupled into and out of the sphere. By monitoring shifts of the resonator spectrum, that are a function of the deformation of the sphere, forces can be measured over more than four orders of magnitude with minute deformation of the resonator (< 1 nm). This capability allows a MOSG to be incorporated within a shear stress sensor in which the motion of a floating element in contact with the fluid is minimal. In Phase I, a breadboard version of the sensor was fabricated and successfully tested in a model flow between two parallel plates, where measurements were in close agreement with computational predictions. Phase II research will focus on advancing the technology by improving measurement rate, sensitivity, and dynamic range, along with decreasing vibration susceptibility, and improving robustness. Sensor prototypes will be tested on high shear industrial mixers with the aim of commercialization for the process mixing market.\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will include the advancement of the understanding of the fundamental processes occurring in boundary layers of flows. For non-Newtonian or otherwise rheologically complex fluids, wall shear stress cannot be reliably calculated or, especially for non-transparent flows, measured. The proposed sensor fills a need for shear stress measurement in the fields of fluid dynamics, aerodynamics and medical research. The largest impact is expected to be in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries that are suffering from an inability to scale and predict processing equipment performance. Knowledge of wall shear stress will provide means to improve process control, quality and throughput of products including drugs and other pharmaceutical products, foods, paints, inks and dyes, cosmetics, and many others.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II proposal is a continuation of our Phase I award,  Lentiviral Vectors for TCR Immunotherapy Targeted to Melanoma.  We have successfully achieved the milestones laid out in our initial application. We generated a lentiviral gene vector capable of expressing a T cell receptor (TCR) specific for the tyrosinase:368-376 epitope, and demonstrated the activity of this cloned TCR in in vitro and in vivo models. The targeting of the melanoma-associated differentiation antigen by T cells transduced with this specific TCR will create a new therapeutic option for patients with melanoma. According to the American Cancer Society melanoma is currently the sixth most common cancer in men and the seventh most common cancer in American women. In this proposal we will generate clinical grade TCR vector, transduce patient-derived T cells, and then initiate a phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety of this procedure. Recent findings from the NCI indicate that a transient lymphopenia induced by chemotherapy is essential for therapeutic effect. The trial we propose will be the first to try this procedure outside of the confines of the NCI, and will establish a new paradigm for the treatment of melanoma in the hospital setting. Secondarily this grant will move product development for the lentiviral vector expressing this TCR another step forward in the critical path of product development, and further key corporate goals of Lentigen to become the leader in clinical application of lentiviral vector technology. It is clear that immunotherapy will be a key feature for effective control of melanoma, a type of tumor for which current therapies do not offer satisfactory results. Lentiviral vectors have been evaluated in Phase I trials in HIV/AIDS. This proposal will be the first to use lentiviral technology in the treatment of melanoma. Our milestones will be 1) To generate GMP grade lentiviral vector, establishing release criteria for clinical use, and 2) to transduce patient T cells with this vector and infuse them according to our phase I FDA clinical trial- designed to evaluate the safety of transduced T cell infusion in lymphodepleted patients. In summary, Lentigen Corp. along with Dr. Michael Nishimura and his clinical team at the Medical University of South Carolina are uniquely positioned to provide a comprehensive evaluation of engineered human T cells in a clinical setting that can be generalized to other centers treating this life-threatening malignancy.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel and improved immunotherapy for melanoma, a tumor for which current therapies do not offer satisfactory results. This therapy will feature the activation of immune cells that will be manipulated in the laboratory and infused back into the patient in order to eliminate melanoma tumor cells. Because of its great potential to offer a solution for those patients failing other therapies, this therapy will have significant relevance for cancer patients with melanoma and health care providers in the United States and worldwide.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Results of recent Free Electron Laser (FEL) studies have shown that under certain conditions pulsed 6-7 5m radiation can affect scission of soft tissues with unprecedented precision and minimal damage to tissues immediately adjacent to the scission sites. Subsequent clinical work has successfully employed this FEL output in several pilot human neurosurgeries. Until recently, only facility-sized FELs had been able to produce the required light pulse characteristics, but such facilities are incompatible with general clinical use. Light Age, Inc. has developed and built a table-top, solid state-based laser source, having the output characteristics of the FEL. In Phase I, this laser was installed at Vanderbilt University, where comparative tissue studies have been conducted. These studies have confirmed the substantial equivalence between the new laser source and the FEL, with respect to in-vitro tissue ablation. These results indicate that this new laser source should be suitable for wider clinical use in a variety of surgical procedures for which the FEL has been demonstrated to be effective. The new laser system is based upon a robust tunable solid-state laser source (alexandrite) and a two-stage Raman conversion process. The alexandrite pump laser technology is already employed in routine medical application throughout the world; and the Raman convertor technology has been employed in a variety of scientific laser systems. In this proposed Phase II effort, in conjunction with collaborators at Vanderbilt, further work will be conducted to develop and demonstrate a compact medical device suitable for routine neurosurgical application. Our Phase II work features advanced laser development and surgical demonstrations on live pigs. Because the approvals and facilities for human studies are already in place, this technology can move quickly into clinical trials in later follow-on studies. The ability of this laser technology to be integrated into a compact and reliable computer-controlled system provides an exciting opportunity to extend the fruits of the FEL research into general clinical practice, with promising near and long-term benefits for neural, retinal, and other precision surgeries. The importance of this work has been heightened due to the recent federal funding reduction that has led to the shut down of the FEL operation at the Keck facility. Now, the only way clinical development of the surgical procedures can proceed is through the work proposed here.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The purpose of this program is to develop a clinical laser that serves as a routine tool for surgeries, especially in the optic nerve, brain, and spine, where extreme precision is needed and where inadvertent damage to adjacent tissue is unacceptable. The resulting surgical tool will be compact and relatively inexpensive, and thus suitable for use by clinics around the world. The advanced surgical procedures that would result can be readily introduced into most hospitals and specialty clinics at reasonable cost and for general human benefit.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this proposal is to develop an inexpensive, handheld device that can be used by primary caregivers (such as general practitioners, internists, and endocrinologists) and in screening settings to reliably screen at-risk diabetics for retinopathy and provide immediate results. This device has the potential to save the sight of thousands of diabetics who have undetected diabetic retinopathy by identifying their condition and allowing timely referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation and treatment. The device works by measuring the implicit time of the 30 Hz flicker electroretinogram, which has been repeatedly shown to correlate well with severity of diabetic retinopathy. Because the device measures implicit time, it will record from skin electrodes placed near the eye. The device will automatically detect good electrode contact. Pupil size will be automatically measured and the light intensity will be adjusted to provide an optimal retinal stimulus. Proven algorithms will be used to measure the implicit time from the elicited waveform, and the results will be displayed to the caregiver along with an estimate of the reliability of the measurement.  LKC Technologies already possesses most of the technologies necessary to develop this device, notably compact low noise, saturation-resistant digital patient amplifiers, sophisticated circuitry for controlling the light output of LEDs, and proven analysis algorithms. In Phase I, a proof-of-principle prototype was developed by modifying an LKC UTAS visual electrophysiology system with an off-the shelf pupillometer and custom software. Data were recorded to assess the robustness of the algorithms for measuring signal quality and extracting implicit time and to determine optimal stimulus parameters. In Phase II, a complete handheld prototype instrument will be constructed, and data will be collected from a large population of diabetics in a screening environment to demonstrate the effectiveness of the device. An additional study will recruit patients with varying levels of diabetic retinopathy to evaluate the usefulness of the device over a wide range of retinopathy.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance Twenty-four million people in the United States suffer from diabetes; five million of them have some degree of diabetic retinopathy - the leading cause of blindness in working-age adults. Although  493 million is expended annually for healthcare related to diabetic retinopathy, another 18,000 people in the United States will go blind this year from the disease. Many diabetics do not know that they have diabetic retinopathy because there is no quick, easy, inexpensive, and widely available screening method. This project proposes to develop a compact, easy-to-use, cost-effective device that would allow diabetics at risk for retinopathy to be evaluated quickly and inexpensively in primary care or screening environments and referred for treatment to preserve their sight.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer and central precocious puberty - linked through improper gonadal steroid levels - are most common in either the elderly or youth populations. Similar gonadal steroid problems also connected to endometriosis. Some traditional methodologies for treating these illnesses involves daily injections of medicine, which can become painful or be forgotten, result in under-dosing. Los Gatos Research is developing an alternative method for delivering time-controlled drug formulations that is practically pain free. Furthermore, the novel technology provides an extended, programmable release platform that helps patients avoid the need to remember to take medication (particularly important for portions of the elderly population) and offers the potential to use less medicine to produce the same effect due to the ability to customize the delivery to the individual patient. The technologies developed in this proposed project enable programmable, microfluidic transdermal patches to provide a means for delivering large molecular weight drug formulations that is controlled, painless, and direct. The specific aims of the Phase II project include upgrading the unique programmable transdermal patches, testing and validating their performance capabilities, optimizing them for rapid, controlled delivery of medication to control gonadal steroid levels, and conducting initial pre- clinical trials of the patches.",

As a result, industrial high-temperature processes release excessive toxic emissions, pollutants, and greenhouse gases and consume excessive energy during operation.  The proposed project will yield a novel, robust instrument capable of accurately measuring several critical (off-gas) exhaust emissions (pollutants and greenhouse gases) in real time with unprecedented speed and reliability.  The proposed instrument will be developed, tested and deployed in two steel manufacturing plants in Phase II to monitor several gases simultaneously to help increase process efficiency and significantly reduce hazardous and toxic gas emissions.  An instrument based on tunable narrow-bandwidth mid-infrared lasers and open-path absorption spectroscopy will be developed and demonstrated to provide measurements with unprecedented speed, specificity and robustness for monitoring and control of industrial efficiency, unwanted pollutants and greenhouse gases.  In Phase I, the instrument was demonstrated in a high enthalpy, high velocity flowfield generated by heterogeneous combustion processes.  In Phase II, in collaboration with several industrial partners, the instrument will be deployed for long-term measurements of multiple pollutants and greenhouse gases and temperature in steel production plants and incorporated into a closed-loop system for real-time process control.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): G-Protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large family of proteins expressed on the surface of eukaryotic cells. They are the major pathway for transducing extracellular signals into a diversity of intracellular responses. Because of their accessibility and physiological significance, GPCRs are the targets of approximately 30-50% of drugs on the market. GPCRs are of particular significance for mental health, since they include the receptors most neurotransmitters and are the targets of many antipsychotic and antidepressant medications, as well as drugs of abuse. However, further understanding of GPCR function is hampered by a lack of detailed structural information. The current proposal seeks to hasten the path to GPCR structure determination and structure/function studies. In Phase I we developed new tools for high-throughput cloning and membrane expression of GPCRs in E. coli. Phase II research will be centered on 10 human GPCRs implicated in brain function and mental health. We will seek to express milligram quantities of the proteins, using different transmembrane guides and indicator fusion partners. We will evaluate the proper folding of GPCRs by assaying ligand-binding activity. GPCRs that can be expressed to high levels in active form will be subject to an iterative process of solubilization, crystallization trials, and structural stabilization efforts, until suitable crystals are obtained. If necessary, we will use genetic schemes to develop modified E. coli strains for improved GPCR expression. We will also develop a system for mammalian cell expression of GPCRs that are inactive or poorly expressed in E. coli. This method will be based on cytoplasmic expression from a linear shuttle vector; importantly, the vector will be useful for bacterial expression as well. Anticipated products include novel bacterial and mammalian expression systems; bacterial and eukaryotic membrane fractions expressing GPCRs for ligand screening; GPCRs with fluorescent tags for assay development; contract expression of GPCRs for structural studies; and structural data from GPCRs for structure-based drug design.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) are a major pathway through which cells respond to external signals, such as light, odors, hormones, or neurotransmitters. However, these proteins are difficult to express, and their detailed structure is not known. In this Phase II proposal, we plan to produce large amounts of brain-derived GPCRs to analyze their crystal structure. These studies will generate novel protein expression systems as well as structural data that can be used for basic and clinical studies of GPCRs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The goal of this Phase II proposal is to develop systems for transient, stable, and transgenic expression of nearly any DNA sequence, particularly those that are impossible to clone into current vectors. Primary targets include genes containing long trinucleotide repeats, toxic ORFs, and very AT-rich regions of up to 50 kb. The systems will be based on a novel linear cloning vector. Variants will be developed for conventional transfection of eukaryotic cells and for generation of transgenic cell lines. In addition, we will incorporate the linear vector into a simple and robust method of transient expression, based on a modified Vesicular Stomatitis Virus ( VSV-T7 ). Together these methods will allow mammalian expression and analysis of nearly any DNA sequence, in vivo or in vitro, including those that contain highly repetitive regions, have a high AT or GC content, or encode proteins that are toxic or deleterious to bacterial or mammalian hosts. This system will significantly expand the repertoire of genes that can be expressed and studied in mammalian cells, including cDNAs that have eluded cloning in high-throughput projects. Expression of otherwise toxic or unstable DNAs may lead to important advances in basic research and medical science. The systems described here will facilitate research on human Repeat Expansion Diseases, such as Fragile X Syndrome, Muscular Dystrophy, Friedreich ataxia, Huntington's Disease, Spinocerebellar ataxia, etc. They will allow cloning and expression of large eukaryotic genes, e.g., to analyze alternative splicing and co-express multiple proteins. They will also allow expression of proteins from pathogenic organisms, which often have very AT-rich genomes, such as Plasmodium sp., Pneumocystis carinii, and others.

        "abstract": "DOE is seeking innovative approaches to hybrid solar technologies that combine electrical and thermal energy generation. Such approaches promise to significantly increase the total operating efficiency of solar panels and reduce system costs and size with the cogeneration of heat and electricity; also, they will offer secondary benefits such as load shifting and cooler running PV cells/modules, hence increasing the conversion efficiencies. A new Solar Photovoltaic Holographic Cogeneration (SPHOC) system based on unique spectrum-splitting, sun-tracking spectral and angle multiplexed holographic concentrator (SAM-HOC) technology is proposed. SAM-HOC is the key SPHOC component. The SAM-HOC efficiently separates visible sunlight for the standard PV cells/modules from the thermal, or near infrared (NIR) portion of the solar spectrum, and diverts it to generate thermal or electric energy. Each angularly multiplexed SAM-HOC will receive sunlight from a select angle from sunrise to sunset, thereby eliminating the need for a mechanical solar tracking system.  In Phase I, SPHOC feasibility was demonstrated by theoretical analysis, computer modeling of holographic optical elements (HOEs), and with a compact experimental prototype. The HOE spectral characteristics, including efficiency peak wavelengths and bandwidths of the prototype samples were studied via laboratory experiments, performance tests, and analysis of test results. Our successes firmly established SPHOC feasibility. Findings demonstrated that the proposed technology also has significant advantages over existing technologies. The advantages include the highly stable spectral characteristics of volume holographic multilayer polymer film, compact packaging in a single module that concentrates the wavelengths responsive to solar silicon and thermo PV cells, tunable bandwidths over the visible to NIR spectrum, and scalability in array fabrication to cover a large area.The goals of Phase II is to complete the SPHOC development to mature the technology so that the holographic optical elements will be mass producible and superior to state-of-the-art technologies in performance and cost. The successful completion of this project will yield not only a new compact, chromatic dispersion-compensated multiplexed HOE concentrators designed to receive the solar illumination from sunrise to sunset, without a mechanical solar tracking system but rather with easily configurable band centers and bandwidths. With no complex mechanical tracking system, the SPHOC technology will provide significant value to solar PV technology. These technologies are readily compatible with mass production techniques such as contact copying (contact printing of holograms) using roller (web)-based machines, which may lead to rapid commercialization of SPHOC holographic optical elements.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  This technology represents a huge market potential in the areas of alternative energy sources such as PV-powered farms and irrigation systems, heating water and generating electricity for field kitchens where no conventional power source is available and power supplies for solar automobiles, solar windows, and wireless/wired electronics. Its high concentration capability drastically lowers the required solar cell material, increasing the total operating efficiency of solar panels by reducing heat and allowing cells to run cooler on solar panels, and, correspondingly, the cost per watt, which make this an important component in the move to energy independence.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogenic fungus that predominantly infects immunocompromised patients. It is the most common cause of infectious pneumonic mortality in HIV patients, organ transplant recipients, and cancer patients. A. fumigatus infection in HIV-infected patients is most pertinent due to the exceptionally high mortality rate (gt75% die within the first year of infection). Treatment is complicated by the fact that patients are often too fragile for invasive or toxic therapies. A first-line treatment for aspergillosis is amphotericin B (AMB) but it is both highly nephrotoxic and insoluble. Its nephrotoxicity can be a significant contributing factor to mortality and is dose limiting. Thus, AMB presents an array of challenges to its therapeutic application. In response to this problem, Lypro- Biosciences, Inc. has developed NanoDisks  (ND), a novel preparation of lipid and protein for the solubilization and delivery of hydrophobic drugs. NDs are 8 - 15 nm diameter disc-shaped structures composed of a lipid bilayer circumscribed by a stabilizing apolipoprotein or peptide mimetic. When AMB is incorporated into NDs (ND-AMB), there is a dramatic increase in AMB solubility and reduction in its toxicity. Furthermore, ND-AMB can be safely dosed to levels at least 10-fold greater than that of AMB deoxycholate (Fungizone - the conventional form of the drug). In comparison to a leading commercial liposomal formulation of AMB (AmBisome), the minimal inhibitory concentration of ND-AMB against A. fumigatus is 25-fold lower in vitro and in an animal model of systemically disseminated candidiasis, ND- AMB is effective at a 6-fold lower dose. Moreover, ND-AMB has a rapid onset of therapeutic effect in comparison to AmBisome, a critical parameter in the clinical treatment of aspergillosis, as patients are normally not diagnosed at an early stage of infection. The combination of enhanced potency, reduced toxicity, and rapid onset of therapy make ND-AMB an ideal therapeutic for the treatment of aspergillosis. In the proposed project we will test the hypothesis that ND-AMB is a fast acting, potent and safe therapy for treating and preventing disseminated aspergillosis in mice. Because patients with pulmonary aspergillosis are less capable of taking in inhaled therapies, the efficacy of intravenously (i.v.) administered ND-AMB will be examined against established Aspergillus infection. Parameters of antifungal potency, safety, and distribution will be determined, yielding a clinically relevant dataset for assessment of ND-AMB effectiveness. Because the normal route of Aspergillus infection is through inhalation of conidia, prophylactic measures directed to the lung may be most effective. We will test the hypothesis that inhaled ND-AMB can serve as an effective prophylactic for the prevention of aspergillosis. Through this proposal we will extend previous SBIR studies into clinically relevant scenarios, testing the ability of ND-AMB to remediate and prevent aspergillosis, a significant threat to the health and lives of HIV-infected patients.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aspergillus fumigatus infection in HIV-infected patients has an exceptionally high mortality rate (gt75% die within the first year of infection). Patients are often too fragile for invasive or toxic therapies. A first-line treatment for aspergillosis is amphotericin B (AMB) but it is both highly nephrotoxic and insoluble. Its nephrotoxicity can be a significant contributing factor to mortality and is dose limiting. We believe our efforts to reformulate AMB into AMB-containing NanoDisks (ND) have transformed it from a marginally effective treatment to a potent cure. Results from this study are essential for the development of ND- AMB into an improved i.v. and inhaled AMB-based therapy for the treatment and prevention of aspergillosis; a serious health issue for HIV infected patients, wherein median survival is 3 months. Intravenous and inhalable ND-AMB will bring to bear an effective cure and preventative to a deadly disease.",

        "abstract": "During Phase I, M4 Engineering integrated a prototype system into OpenMDAO, a NASA GRC open-source framework.  This prototype system was a proof-of-concept that M4 physics based modules could be integrated in OpenMDAO.  The results generated in OpenMDAO compared well to the results generated in another framework, ModelCenter.  Phase II will be a demonstration of enhanced system functionality with the integration of additional modules and design tools.  The integrated objects will perform discipline-specific analysis across multiple flight regimes at varying levels of fidelity.  The process will also deliver system-level, multi-objective optimization.  Phase II will also showcase a refined system architecture that allows the system to be less customized to a specific configuration (i.e., system and configuration separation) as well as additional example problems.  By delivering a capable and validated MDAO system along with a set of example applications to be used as a template for future users, this work will greatly expand NASA's high-fidelity, physics based MDAO capabilities and enable the design of revolutionary vehicles in a cost effective manner.  This proposed work compliments M4 Engineering's expertise in developing modeling and simulation toolsets that solve relevant subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic demonstration applications.",

        "abstract": "People with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) experience poor nutrition, obesity, and other serious health problems at significantly higher rates than those in the general public. The incidence of obesity among people with IDD is 50%, almost double the rate exhibited by mainstream Americans. Similar discontinuities exist with diseases such as diabetes and hypertension within this population. There are genetic, metabolic, and pharmacological reasons for these elevated rates and previous attempts to improve the health of people with IDD, employing exercise routines and education, have been neither efficacious nor sustainable. Recent programmatic interventions focusing on diet and the nutritional intake of people with IDD have been much more successful in improving their quality of life and dietary patterns, as well as reducing the rate of serious secondary medical conditions. A Phase I study at a social service agency that residentially supports people with IDD, found that caregivers in group homes experienced significant increases in their knowledge, attitudes and behaviors towards nutrition and healthy eating. And through using these web-based interventions and the documentation from the Mainstay nutrition program, the people with IDD supported by the caregivers have experienced material improvements in Healthy Eating Indexes, Body Mass Indices, health status indicators, as well as more cost-effective, diverse meals and menus. The Phase II randomized trial will occur over a larger sample size that is more geographically dispersed. It will test the differing impact of a range of revised interventions on the knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of the staff that support people with IDD, along with measuring the nutrition, health and operating parameters mentioned above among the individuals with IDD. In this way, we will determine the tradeoff among efficacy, cost and implementation outcomes for various intervention alternatives. The results of the larger trial will have significance to the quality of life and quality of health for the five million people with IDD in the nation. In addition the outcomes will influence policy for the organizations as well as the state and federal government entities providing services and funding to this population.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to further develop novel bisphosphonate conjugate MBC-11 and other novel compounds as treatment for prostate cancer (PC) and PC-induced bone disease. MBC-11 is the anhydride formed between arabinocytidine (AraC)-59-phosphate and etidronate and is the lead product of our proprietary technology which employs conjugates of known chemotherapeutic agents with bone targeting bisphosphonates to address the limitations of conventional therapies for tumor-induced bone diseases. This targeted delivery design enables the concentration of a chemotherapy agent in bone while also maintaining low systemic levels. We hypothesize that such conjugates will have a wider therapeutic range than currently available therapies. As an added benefit, the drugs also strengthen the bones and may reverse the deterioration of bone associated with cancer. We further hypothesis that this approach may use the skeleton as a drug depot from which drug release may provide systemic benefit. Encouraging results from our Phase I in vivo proof-of-concept studies demonstrated that MBC-11 preserves bone structure comparably or better than the standard of care zoledronate, and significantly reduced pain. The proposed studies will examine the effects of MBC-11 and a library of bone-targeted chemotherapic compounds in models of PC and PC-induced bone disease. The most promising compounds will be further investigated for dose response in treatment and preventative settings, mechanism of action (direct uptake into cancer cells) and be characterized in a number of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters. Recent evidence suggesting unique sensitivity to cytarabine for PC carrying ETS gene fusions warrants the testing of MBC-11 in this large subpopulation of prostate cancers. The specific aims of this Phase II project are: (1) To develop synthetic procedures for the preparation of novel bisphosphonate-chemotherapeutic conjugates and to synthesize sufficient amounts of required compounds for the proposed studies. (2) Screen the novel compounds for tumor burden reduction in NOD/SCID-hu-HAB models of prostate cancer induced bone disease (CIBD), assess dose response on select lead compounds in treatment and preventative forms of the CIBD models and assess the ability of novel leads to use the skeleton as a depot to address primary and non-osseous metastases in PC models. (3) Measure critical toxicology and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters using the lead compound. The successful completion of this Phase II project will guide the further development of this promising concept, greatly aid in obtaining investigational new drug approval, and lead to eventual clinical application. It is anticipated that this technology will ultimately result in therapeutic agents that will significantly improve cancer patient care resulting in increased quality of life and survival.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prostate cancer results in 30,000 deaths annually in the US; 85% die with metastatic bone cancer. One of the major clinical features is the development of cancer induced bone disease, characterized by progressive and devastating bone destruction, bone pain, pathological fractures and hypercalcemia. Therefore, a great need exists to develop drugs that can prevent or reduce the spread of cancer to bone. The long-term goal of this research project is to develop more effective therapies, designed to deliver anti-cancer drugs to bone while also providing a potent bone-protecting ingredient, for cancer-induced bone diseases.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a water disinfection system based on an electrochemical generator that produces ozone directly into process water.  Because of its excellent disinfection and oxidation qualities, ozone is widely used for drinking water and process water purification treatment.  Ozone has been proven to deactivate resistant microorganisms such as Cryptosporidium Parvam and Giardia Lambia that have caused a large number of epidemics in the United States through drinking and process water.  To enable wider adoption of ozone as an disinfectant, improvements in ozone generators are needed that are safer to operate than the corona arc discharge systems and that are more cost effective to install and operate.  Building on demonstration of technical and economic feasibility during Phase I, this Phase II project will develop an electrochemistry based water disinfection system for commercial deployment.  The Phase II program will focus on finalizing the electrocatalyst formulation, optimizing the module design for performance and cost, incorporating the reactor module into a packaged end-use product, and evaluating the process for disinfecting water in field applications using strategic partners. \nThe broader/commercial impact of this project is an improved and lower cost disinfection system that will prevent the vast outbreaks of contaminated water that harm the general public.  These occurrences push the utmost urgency for advanced quality control methods, especially in food manufacturing.  With the wider adoption of ozone generation systems, both water and food-borne diseases would diminish due to its effectiveness as a disinfectant against Lysteria, Salmonella, E. coli, and any other pathogens found in fruits, vegetables, meats, and seafood. Contributions to the scientific and technological field will be realized by the improved electrochemical reactor design and catalyst development that enables an ozone disinfection system that is low in cost and energy efficient.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is mounting evidence that blue light, like UV light, presents a hazard to the eye of the aging population.1-9 Yellow intraocular lenses (IOLs), which absorb blue light, mimic the transmission characteristics of an aged human crystalline lens and aim to protect lipofucsin-containing retinal pigment epithelial cells from being damaged by blue light. Recent studies indicate that a blue-light-absorbing IOL may reduce the risk for macular degeneration or its progression.2,3,6-11 Most importantly, a recent European Eye Study(October, 2008) involving 4753 participants aged 65 or older found a significant association between blue light exposure and neovascular or early AMD in individuals in the quartile of lowest antioxidants levels in their blood stream; the study concluded that the general population should use ocular protection and follow dietary recommendations for key antioxidant nutrients.12  Accordingly, yellow IOLs are increasingly used by surgeons; approximately half of the IOLs used in the US are blue-light-blocking.  However, two recent intra-individual comparison studies13-14 in humans found that yellow IOLs have lower visual acuity and poor color vision perception compared with the clear lens (non-yellow) counterpart under low light conditions. Recent studies also suggested that patients with yellow IOLs may suffer from disrupted circadian rhythm.15  AuriumTM, a photochromic hydrophobic acrylic IOL, is designed to provide all benefits of a yellow IOL without any of its compromises. The design was based on the fact that blue-light intensity in outdoor sunlight is about 10 times stronger than indoor light wherein blue-light is weak and often necessary for good vision (Fig. 1).16 AuriumTM remains clear indoors while outdoors, where both UV and blue light are intense and harmful, it turns yellow and blocks both UV and blue light. Figure 1. Blue Light Intensity: Sunlight scale is on right; indoor light scale is on left  All SBIR Phase I experiments have been successfully completed: AuriumTM is biocompatible and photochemically stable; AuriumTM meets all ISO requirements for IOLs and a CE Mark has been obtained. Now we apply for a SBIR Phase II grant to obtain an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) for the US market.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Approximately half of 3 million cataract procedures in the US use yellow intraocular lenses (IOLs) which reduce the risk of or slow the progression of macular degeneration, 1-7 a major cause for blindness among population over 50.17, 18 Yellow IOLs achieve this by blocking hazardous blue light in addition to UV but they also lower night vision and color perception for patients.12,13 AuriumTM, a photochromic IOL preserves all the benefits of a yellow IOL without any of its compromises and may become a standard for future IOLs.",

This enterprise robust product, named  SocioWorks  , is intended to meet emerging needs in markets for applying Social Network Analysis (SNA) to solve problems and generate new knowledge in the health domain. SocioWorks will be designed to enable and facilitate observing, understanding, working with, and changing relationship-based organizational knowledge and processes in hospitals and other health care systems. It will support social network-based clinical and public health intervention research and programs, and it will serve as a tool for patients and families to better perceive themselves and the social structures they are embedded within. SocioWorks will have value to communities, for example to help families adjust to caregiving needs for a relative and to scale related research and intervention up to the policy level to support such caregiving. This project seeks to develop and integrate tools to take advantage of, and extend, understandings of how peer, family, team, organizational, and other social structures influence and are part of health processes and outcomes, and, to support scientifically guided change. While this project will focus on developing SocioWorks for applying to aging issues, the utility in all realms of health will be equally promising. Network analysis has expanded in some branches of health research in the past several years, and has been recognized in aging research as important for some time. As such, the utility of network studies for intervention is becoming clearer. Different levels of data (i.e., individuals, providers, institutions like hospitals, and public health systems/management) can be gathered as well as linked together in the proposed SocioWorks software infrastructure. As proposed for this web-based software, interventions will work not only at the level of social organization at which they are directed, but can also be incorporated into interventions at other levels as well as integrated with research and analysis across the various levels of social organization. Integrated network analysis would help people at any of the levels identify which social network types or features are associated with which kinds of health behaviors and outcomes, plus provide the basis for developing specific ways in which to address social constraints and opportunities related to health aspects of aging. SocioWorks will facilitate using social network approaches in diverse settings and multiple sites by giving users significant capabilities to author and manage their projects, protocols, procedures, assessment items, and data to meet their specific needs. SocioWorks will provide protocol-based task scheduling and tracking functionality for social network research projects and programmatic applications, such as Patient Safety and Quality Improvement programs in hospitals. SocioWorks will provide tools for multi-site research collaboration, rule-based sharing of study information and data sets, and security management.

        "abstract": "Recovery and recycling of acetic acid from aqueous streams is an important industrial separation that is high cost and energy intensive when performed by conventional technology.  This makes acetic acid recovery a tantalizing target for a more efficient, lower cost, simpler approach such as membrane technology.  However, the required separation performance, combined with the need for robust chemical and thermal stability of the membrane materials, makes the use of membrane technology for acetic acid recovery very challenging.  In this project, perfluorinated polymer membranes are used to dehydrate acetic acid using two new membrane processes.  The membranes are stable in hot acetic acid/water mixtures and have good selectivities for separation of water from acetic acid.  The proposed membrane processes will lower energy costs by more than 50% compared to conventional separations.  In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed technology.  Stable membranes were made that met the permeation criteria required for an economical process.

Most heart transplant recipients are monitored for the development of organ rejection with a series of endomyocardial biopsies during the first twelve months after operation. This procedure is invasive, painful, and potentially hazardous. There is a clinical need for a test to provide the same information about heart transplant rejection as an endomyocardial biopsy, but without its invasiveness, pain, or hazards. A solution to the clinical problem: The Heartsbreath test is an intrinsically safe, painless, and non-invasive breath test for heart transplant rejection that employs volatile biomarkers of oxidative stress. In multicenter clinical studies, the Heartsbreath test was sensitive and specific for Grade 3 heart transplant rejection (now known as Grade 2R). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Heartsbreath test for clinical use with a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE). The marketing problem: Even though FDA has approved the test for clinical use, the Heartsbreath test is not yet employed in clinical practice because it is not yet reimbursed by insurers. Medicare has not approved a National Coverage Determination (NCD) of the Heartsbreath test because of its HDE status. A solution to the marketing problem: Medicare now offers a pathway to insurance reimbursement of the Heartsbreath test through its program National Coverage Determinations with Data Collection as a Condition of Coverage: Coverage with Evidence Development . This program offers a pathway to an NCD for the Heartsbreath test by developing and capturing additional patient data. Experimental plans: We will validate the accuracy of the Heartsbreath test as a predictor of Grade 2R (formerly known as Grade 3) heart transplant rejection, in order to fulfill Medicare NCD requirements. We will perform a cross-sectional multicenter study of 1,000 anonymized patients who have received a heart transplant during the preceding 12 months. We will perform a Heartsbreath test on these patients prior to an endomyocardial biopsy performed as part of their regular clinical care, and compare the results of the two tests. The long-term aims of the research are a. Scientific: To validate the accuracy of the Heartsbreath test as a breath test for heart transplant rejection b. Commercial: To obtain Medicare NCD for reimbursement of the Heartsbreath test, and market the test nationally and internationally. The importance of the research: In clinical practice, the Heartsbreath test could provide a completely safe and non-invasive ancillary test for heart transplant rejection that would reduce the pain and morbidity associated with endomyocardial biopsy, while also reducing the costs of clinical care PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Heartsbreath test is an FDA-approved breath test for heart transplant rejection that employs breath biomarkers of oxidative stress.

        "abstract": "The ultimate goal of the project is to develop a blood test that will significantly improve early detection of lung cancer. A high-performance multiplexed immunoassay platform will be used to evaluate biomarkers that have been associated with lung cancer in research reports. The technology enables this with a very limited amount of sample volume that is available for high quality samples.    Mesoscale proposes to apply its Diagnostics electrochemiluminescence (ECl) detection technology to the development of quantitative and highly multiplexed assays for cancer biomarkers. Assays will be carried out using ECl based detection in an array-based multiplexed format on a fully automated high-throughput immunoassay instrument. This platform will be able to simultaneously measure up to 75 biomarkers using only 30 ul of sample (serum, plasma, ductal lavage, saliva and urine), will have ultra-sensitive detection capabilities (analytical sensitivity <  1 pg/ml), a dynamic range of 8-logs, and a throughput of 100 to 200 samples per day. As part of the proposed program, we will develop 50 cancer associated biomarker assays for this assay platform. When selecting assays we will focus on biomarkers that have been identified as important by the Clinical Proteomics Technologies for Cancer (CPTC) initiative and CPTC investigators, giving highest priority to biomarkers for which CPTC is developing antibodies. Assay reagents for running the cancer biomarker panels will be provided in a complete consumable kit that will include a 96-well assay plate containing up to 25 immobilized capture antibodies per well (larger assay panels are achieved by spreading the arrays of capture antibodies over multiple wells), and an auxiliary reagent plate containing lyophilized detection antibodies and assay diluents. The assay platform will enable the measurement of numerous cancer associated proteins, and will provide an important tool for the selection and validation of cancer-specific diagnostic biomarkers.",

        "abstract": "A number of sensors and control systems have been developed for use within power systems; however the effects of high temperature, corrosive/oxidizing atmospheres, and abrasive media have limited their use in gas turbine engines, boilers, solid oxide fuel cells and other harsh environments. Improved sensor packaging and encapsulation is needed to enable on-line sensing for component sensing & diagnostics and structural heath monitoring.  The inability to monitor the actual component in real time leads to higher operating and maintenance costs and decreases equipment availability which directly affects the reliability of the US electric supply.  Sensors will also provide enhanced control enhancements and enable more efficient turbine operation which will decrease emissions and reduce fuel costs.  New sensor packaging concepts are proposed to (1) encapsulate low profile temperature and strain gages with moisture-corrosion barrier coatings and (2) to improve lead-wire connections to sensors using Direct Write processes to enable robust sensor routing and attachment, and (3) to attach fiber optic sensors to components using Direct Write processing for use in ultra supercritical boilers.  Commercial applications and other benefits:  High temperature sensors are in high demand, spanning a range of industries including power generation, commercial and military aviation, aerospace structures and transportation.  Steam turbines, gas turbines, and boilers used in the power generation industry are examples of critical equipment that must operate at top performance to provide the low cost electricity that drives the U.S. economy.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Feeding problems are a frequent harbinger of nascent neurological damage and are a major obstacle in transitioning infants from hospital nursery to discharge. Severe problems often require repeated hospitalization and tube feeding. Refractory feeding problems contribute significantly to the high cost of health care. Dysfunctional sucking in the newborn, in the absence of any focal neurological symptoms, is known to correlate with developmental delay evident at 24 months of age. It is estimated that 57-92% of infants with brain damage have dysphagia and are at higher risk of long-term malnutrition, growth failure and higher mortality rates. Early, accurate diagnosis would be of great help to these infants, as they would receive the most appropriate treatment at an earlier age. We describe a novel device (an Orometer) and data analytical system (Suck Editor) that we have developed to quantify nutritive sucking behavior and the results when it is used to test normal full-term infants, premature infants, infants with feeding problems and serious illness. We examine an intriguing result in a small sample of infants with submucosal cleft palate and velopharyngeal insufficiency. We posited that a quantitative and permanent record of infant sucking comparable to EEG, EKG or EMG might be of value in supplementing the current scoring systems tools used to assess an infant's feeding competence prior to discharge and perhaps of value for predicting long-term outcome, and now plan to test that hypothesis. Work conducted during our Phase I and Phase II SBIR grants has established that the Orometer is portable, noninvasive, and that it produces durable and reliable records of pressure changes which occur during infant feeding. It has already been proved to be a valuable tool for documenting oral-motor behavior; the records it produces are a useful supplement to subjective feeding observations. We will endeavor to bring it to market quickly for these sound reasons alone, but we have reason to believe that when larger populations are studied, it will prove capable of far more. This proposal seeks to refine the product design of the Orometer to a market-ready modular form; test our existing prototypes in two clinical centers in targeted populations-of-interest; perform expanded clinical trials in two clinical centers; and finally obtain sufficient data to support FDA approval for the re-engineered device. We will endeavor to establish additional uses for the Orometer. Finally, we describe specialized extensions of this device which hold research potential. These designs will extend and quantify simultaneous observations of suck, swallow and breathing, and allow serious researchers to study the coordination of all three vital functions in new depth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research is important because it will produce a product to help clinicians observe infant feeding more accurately, leading to improved care for young infants with feeding difficulties. For premature infants, clinicians will use objective measurement to improve their understanding of when such infants can thrive in a home environment, leading to shorter hospital stays, lower costs, less trauma for families, and improved childhood nutrition.",

The software will provide multi-scalar information about multiple individual neurons in close proximity, including dendritic spines. Providing this innovative functionality will help research in important fields such as neurodegenerative diseases, learning, and memory. NeuroAutomatica will enable sophisticated and detailed analysis of neuronal structure that is currently unavailable. Furthermore, it will increase the pace of research technology by automating some analyses which are now painstakingly manually performed.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent research has pointed to the importance of the smallest element of a neuron's architecture-the dendritic spine-where it is hypothesized that critical structural changes occur to underlie changes in cellular function responsible for processing a continuous influx and storage of information. Thus, dendritic spines have become a central target in research focusing on learning and memory and, in particular, on the prevention of cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, new advances in imaging and physiological experiments have led to investigations into neuronal circuits. Our proposed software will enable the structural analysis of these networks. NeuroAutomatica will accelerate the pace of discovery and understanding in basic neuroscience research by providing an observer independent software system capable of accurately and efficiently reconstructing neurons, including dendritic spines, in dense networks.",

        "abstract": "The cost of electricity generated by concentrator photovoltaic systems is strongly dependent on the efficiency of the solar cells in the solar concentrator system.  The efficiency of these solar cells is limited by the fact that the electrical contacts used to collect current from the solar cell are on top of the cell and partially shadow it.  The top-surface electrodes prevent as much as 10% of the collected sunlight from reaching the active area of the solar cell.  The problem is further exacerbated as the concentration level is increased.  This problem is being addressed by developing a novel method for producing solar cells in which all electrical contacts are made from the backside of the solar cell. The backside contact is combined with an epitaxial liftoff process to facilitate the formation of the contacts and to reduce the manufacturing cost. The cost advantage is realized by multiple reuses of the expensive GaAs substrates, which significantly decreases the raw material consumption.  In Phase I, a complete fabrication process was developed for producing backside contact interconnects in epitaxial liftoff-based solar cells. Detailed device simulations of the backside contact solar cell device show excellent performance under high concentration and a relative performance improvement of more than 10% at 500 suns compared with a conventional topside contact solar cell.  In the Phase II project, the backside contact fabrication process will be extended to fabricate high-efficiency, triple-junction, inverted-multijunction-metamorphic epitaxial liftoff devices that are optimized for operation at high concentration.  A process will be developed for attaching backside contact solar cells to submounts and these submounts will be tested in a solar concentrator test bed.  The goal is to achieve a peak efficiency of >44% at 500 suns.  The backside contact solar cells will also be subjected to reliability testing.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The high efficiency cells to be developed in this project will be used in concentrator photovoltaic systems for utility and commercial electricity generation. The cells should result in a decrease in the cost of solar-generated electricity.  Concentrator photovoltaics are projected to account for several gigawatts of generating capacity by 2020.  Increased availability of low-cost solar power generation should result in reduced emission of greenhouse gases, increased domestic energy production, and increased national energy security.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of using VNS stimulation paired with tone presentations to completely reverse the effects of tinnitus in a rat model of the disease. The Specific Aim of Phase II is to accumulate data for the submission of an IDE application for testing the safety and efficacy of our therapeutic VNS device in humans. Approximately 12 million individuals in the United States have been diagnosed with tinnitus of which ~1 million have severe tinnitus interfering with their daily activities. Although many advances have been made in symptomatic treatments, these treatments are unable to eliminate the tinnitus sensation in most patients. Our therapeutic device will use a PC based software package to allow for computer controlled VNS to be paired with the presentation of tones. This system will be easily deployable as a laptop PC driven rehabilitation therapy device. We have partnered with Texcel (East Longmeadow, MA) to use their StimX VNS stimulation device and software to deliver our therapy in the clinic. The Texcel system is currently in clinical trials for an unrelated indication. While we have proven the feasibility of pairing tone and VNS to reverse tinnitus in rats in Phase I, we must now investigate stimulus parameters more thoroughly in order to develop a rational protocol for humans. VNS parameters have translated well from rats to humans for epilepsy, depression, and learning. It therefore seems reasonable to use a rat model of tinnitus to set the first order parameters for treating tinnitus in humans. Along these same lines, it seems reasonable to use a rat model to evaluate several possible clinical confounds that might occur. In addition, while obtaining FDA approval for testing therapies in humans does not require a mechanistic explanation; experience has shown this to be very useful; we will investigate such a mechanism at a very high level. In parallel to these animal studies, we will be developing the software needed to drive the StimX device at the appropriate parameters for tinnitus therapy. The software is not currently designed to stimulate at our desired parameters. Finally, we will test the software modification and our proposed initial clinical stimulation protocol for efficacy in a rat model of tinnitus. If this final test is successful, we will then assemble and file an IDE for clinical testing. Filing this IDE will conclude a successful Phase II study. We expect to start a clinical trail within 90 days of concluding this Phase II study. If VNS-induced plasticity is effective in treating tinnitus in patients, the technology may also be useful to treat other neurological conditions, including stroke, chronic pain, and epilepsy by pairing each of these conditions with appropriate external cues to retrain pathologically altered neural circuits.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This is a Phase II SBIR application to develop a therapy for tinnitus. Our Phase I studies demonstrated that our overall therapeutic approach can induce lasting and complete reverse of tinnitus using a safe and inexpensive method of vagal nerve stimulation paired with presentation of sounds. Tinnitus is a devastating disease for millions of Americans. Severe forms of tinnitus are debilitating and untreated.

        "abstract": "To date there are several approaches for incorporating sensing capabilities into RFID. Active tags use batteries to power their communication circuitry, sensors, and microcontroller. Active tags benefit from relatively long wireless range and can achieve high data and sensor activity rates. However, the batteries required by active tags are disadvantageous for device cost, lifetime, weight, and volume. In contrast, passive sensor tags receive all of their operating power from external RF transmitting sources and are not limited by battery life. One attractive feature of passive sensor tags is the prospect of permanently embedding them in objects for structural monitoring. Another is their suitability for applications in which neither batteries nor wired connections are feasible, for weight, volume, cost, or other reasons. A limitation of purely passive sensor tags is the requirement of proximity to a RF transmitter. Since lower power consumption is one major trend in RF circuit design, a self-powered system by means of energy harvesting becomes very attractive. It can serve as the enabling technology for novel applications such as ambient intelligence. Using a power harvesting technique for wireless rechargeable battery smart sensor and enhanced RFID are the key elements for successfully distributing sensors across sensor networks.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disease definition: Adhesions, fibrous scars abnormally conjoining adjacent tissues, are primarily caused by surgical procedures. They can arise in many areas of the body as common sequelae of abdominal, gynecological, thoracic, and cardiac procedures [1-5]. Adhesions can cause not only pain and discomfort, but also loss of organ function and even death. While the technology described herein will effect prevention of all adhesion types, the high-need, high-burden abdominal (specifically small bowel) adhesion prevention application will be the focus of this grant submission.  Burden of disease: Abdominal adhesions occur at high frequency and have tremendous associated burden of disease. Adhesions form in conjunction with virtually every abdominal surgery. Multiple studies cite that, of those patients who have abdominal surgery, up to 93% will develop adhesions [6, 7].  Transforming Growth Factor-21 and other cytokines are known to initiate adhesion formation through activation of mitogen activated protein kinase activated kinase (MK2). MK2 is implicated in the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and collagen type I up regulation that promotes adhesions. The proposed MK2 inhibitor peptide therapeutic (MK2i) inhibits these scar inducing activities, thus offering the potential of becoming an effective targeted therapy to prevent adhesions [8]. The primary objective of this proposal is to commercially develop MK2i for the treatment of adhesive disorders; the following study plan, outlined below, has been constructed to meet regulatory requirements mandated by the FDA for IND submission. The following aims will be completed as part of this work: 1. Conduct preliminary safety testing of MK2i in vivo.  a. Develop an immunoassay for MK2i.  b. Conduct pharmacodynamic studies to determine the effect of MK2i on major physiological systems.  c. Monitor pharmacokinetics (metabolism and distribution) after intravenous injection of MK2i. 2. Conduct final safety testing of MK2i for IND (Investigational New Drug) submission to FDA.  a. Produce MK2i under GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) conditions.  b. Conduct acute, subacute, and genetic toxicity testing of GMP grade MK2i. 3. Prepare IND submission for advancement into Phase I clinical trials. Through these rigorous product development activities in preparation to begin clinical trials, a therapeutic that can be sprayed or otherwise directly applied into the abdomen during invasive or minimally invasive surgery will be on the path to becoming a reality.",

Preliminary results in melanin expressing cell cultures, demonstrate high and selective binding to melanoma cancers. Organ distribution studies in mouse tumor models showed high accumulation in tumors and rapid elimination through the renal and hepatobillary systems. Early human testing, of a similar compound in this series, also demonstrated high uptake and retention in tumors of metastatic melanoma patients. However, process development studies of this earlier lead compound indicated it was too unstable to scale up to high radioactive concentrations. Ioflubenzamide I-131 is a radio-iodinated benzamide molecule with extremely high selective binding to melanin expressing melanomas and low non-target organ accumulation. The molecular target specificity, high tumor accumulation and retention are ideal properties for an agent to effectively treat melanoma metastasis. Preliminary preclinical efficacy studies demonstrated complete tumor remission after two treatments (0.68 mCi) with ioflubenzamide I-131 in a SK-Mel-3 human melanoma xenograft mouse model (about 100 mCi/m2 as a human dose equivalent). The first six month phase of this proposal will focus on generating CMC documentation necessary to support an exploratory IND application to the FDA. The second phase of the proposal will be initiated after the protocol has been accepted by the FDA. This 18 month phase 2 portion will focus on executing and completing a clinical imaging study in 12 (male and female) subjects with confirmed metastatic malignant melanoma to determine safety and organ dosimetry. The justification for requesting Fast Track consideration is to establish the proof-of-principal and select a therapeutic starting dose for a therapy escalation study. The innovation in this proposal is the exciting promise for a potential curative treatment of metastatic melanoma. Following successful completion of the SBIR program, Molecular Insight will develop a clinic protocol to determine dosage and efficacy for an industry sponsored NDA to the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The incidence of malignant melanoma is rising faster than that of any other types of cancer in the United States. A radiopharmaceutical, capable of being labeled with cell destroying radioisotopes and exclusively targeted to melanoma tissue, would provide a drug specific for the treatment of metastatic disease. The successful development of an I-131 labeled molecular targeting radiotherapeutic agent for malignant melanoma would introduce this therapeutic technique to a now incurable disease and bring considerable attention to the field of therapeutic radiology. Molecular Insights desires to test a new molecular targeting agent: ioflubenzamide I-131 in subjects with confirmed melanin positive metastatic melanomas, to determine its potential as a systemic radiotherapy agent. The rising incidence of malignant melanomas, the early and wide-spread occurrence of metastases, and the poor response rates for current therapies, creates an essential need and valuable commercial opportunity to effectively treat patients with metastatic melanomas.",

The feasibility to generate heat in embedded flaws, surface flaws, surface cracks, and subsurface cracks in glass/epoxy composite samples and to thermographically detect those flaws was demonstrated.  The energy and transmissibility of the sound waves used to excite the flaws was demonstrated at a flaw to excitation transducer distance of 24 inches for samples up to 2 inches thick.

This service product for kinase profiling is widely accepted in the drug discovery community for kinase inhibitor development. Based on these skills, RBC is developing a new assay platform using gold standard radioisotope assays for the large family of histone methyltransferases (HMTs). During Phase I, RBC has successfully developed over 13 methyltransferases by using our low cost radioisotope based format. These assays have been validated internally and by customers. We have conducted a trial HTS by using one of the enzymes and identified a few pan-methyltransferase inhibitors that are under further evaluation in both large panel profiling and in cell based assays. Eventually, these compounds could be used as research tools for epigenetic research, which is lacking reference compounds. In Phase II, we propose to expand this technology to add an additional 20 methyltransferases (Aim 1). In Aim 2, HTS campaigns using a 45,000 compound library of diverse structures against the RBC panel of methyltransferase will establish a database to drive structure-activity relationship (SAR) models. In Aim 3, all the individual hits will be profiled for in vitro selectivity and potency, candidates with good activity and clean structures will be further evaluated in cell based assays for methyltransferase inhibition, and lead compounds will go through further SAR studies. Through Phase II funding, RBC will be able to provide HTS and profiling service to cover majority of the human methyltransferases and providing tool compound for research activities. By the end of this funding, RBC will be the major driving force for providing most of the tools needed for epigenetic drug discoveries. After Phase II, RBC will looking for potential collaborations to further SAR studies on the inhibitors that we have discovered in the Phase II screening process. As a result of this funding, drug discovery labs will have access to a new class of industrial grade screening and profiling assays that do not exist today, and protein production in this area will be upgraded as well.

        "abstract": "An effort is underway by the U.S. DOE to develop cost-effective and environmentally sound technologies in order to help to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  There is a significant need for economical methods to characterize potential sequestration reservoirs as well as determine the extent, location and nature of leaks from reservoirs both to assure that CO2 is effectively sequestered for long periods of time, and to reduce the likelihood of local environmental impacts.  Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) is a geophysical tool that has been used successfully to image the electrical resistivity of the subsurface, and is especially sensitive to pore fluid content.  ERT is capable of monitoring movement of sequestered CO2 by measuring the change in the electrical resistivity of the subsurface, both in the saturated and vadose zones.  Our ERT system under development consists of many, inexpensive, self-contained units that communicate with each other through a distributed wireless network.  The capital expense of such a system would be relatively small.  The operating expenses, once the system is automated, would also be small.  In the Phase I project, the prototype system design was completed, a preliminary version of a new survey design strategy was implemented and a strategy for employing multiple, simultaneous current sources was developed.  The new strategy will increase signal to noise levels and enhance target resolution.  In Phase II Year 1 we will complete fabrication of the prototype system and operation software and adapt imaging routines for the multi-source strategy.  We will complete all design upgrades and perform unit as well as full scale field tests in Year 2. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits There is a significant need for cost-effective methods to monitor CO2 sequestrationreservoirs in order to reduce the likelihood of local environmental impacts. This project will develop a cost-effective method of monitoring sequestration reservoirs for potential leakage pathways and for reservoir integrity using a geophysical method, Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT)",

        "abstract": "Intense muon beams have many potential commercial and scientific applications, ranging from low-energy investigations of the basic properties of matter using spin resonance to large energy-frontier muon colliders.  However, muons originate from a tertiary process that produces a diffuse swarm.  To make useful beams, the swarm must be rapidly captured and cooled before the muons decay.  General statement of how this problem is being addressed.  This is the overall objective of the combined Phase I and Phase II projects.  A promising new concept for the collection and cooling of muon beams to increase their intensity and reduce their emittances is being investigated, namely, the use of a nearly isochronous helical cooling channel (HCC) to facilitate capture of the muons into RF bunches.  The muon beam could then be cooled quickly and coalesced efficiently to optimize the luminosity of a muon collider, or could provide compressed muon beams for other applications.  Optimal ways to integrate such a subsystem into the rest of a muon collection and cooling system, for collider and other applications, will be developed by analysis and simulation.  The application of quasi-isochronous helical cooling channels (QIHCC) for RF capture of muon beams was developed.  Innovative design concepts for a channel incorporating straight solenoids, a matching section, and an HCC, including RF and absorber, were developed, and its subsystems were simulated.  Additionally, a procedure that uses an HCC to combine bunches for a muon collider was invented and simulated.  The Phase II research will refine the QIHCC by continuing to develop the design concepts. Difficult design aspects such as matching sections between subsystems and intensity-dependent effects will be addressed.  The bunch recombination procedure will be developed into a complete design with 3-D simulations.  Commercial applications and other benefits:  Bright muon beams are needed for many commercial and scientific reasons.  Potential commercial applications include the use of muon beams to screen cargo containers for homeland security, low-dose radiography, and muon catalyzed fusion.  Scientific uses include low energy beams for rare process searches, muon spin resonance applications, muon beams for neutrino factories, and muon colliders as Higgs factories or energy-frontier discovery machines.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to improve the size, robustness, patient throughput and image quality of Computed Radiography systems. Operational efficiencies are increasingly driving the industry toward digital imaging. Computed radiography equipment is generally less expensive than digital radiography systems, but is perceived as offering somewhat lower image quality, and a lower patient throughput. Our technology would provide a more compact and robust system that would address the mobile market, as well as enable computed radiography to compete more effectively on an image quality and throughput basis, while maintaining its cost advantage in terms of capital expense. We propose to apply a technology that has recently become available, i.e. Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) arrays in the laser scanning source. VCSEL arrays can be fabricated monolithically on a single chip with a very precise spacing and good performance uniformity. The array can replace the flying spot scanners which use a single laser and a rotating mirror. This will result in a more compact and more robust scanner. In addition, the technology enables a linescan mode of operation. This ability shifts the normal trade-offs between scan speed and image quality to a more favorable point. Such linescan units have been demonstrated with discrete lasers, but the manufacturing of such systems is challenging. Our Phase I project demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by building a 2.5cm scanner which included the VCSEL array, driver I.C.s and lensing on a board, and demonstrated the ability to resolve 5 line pairs per millimeter. This proposed Phase II project will build two full width (35cm) scanners, the first with a 1005m laser pitch, and the second with a 505m laser pitch. Both prototypes will be integrated into and evaluated in real CR systems. Performance will be evaluated in terms of MTF, NPS, and DQE, and performance comparable to, and subsequently better than, existing systems will be demonstrated.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project develops a new stimulating laser scanning technology for computed radiography which will result in a compact, robust unit with improved efficiency and image quality. A successful project would result in a cost-effective alternative for digital imaging, while maintaining high image quality. The technology is expected to be particularly beneficial to portable units, to be used bedside, in clinics, or even transported to skilled nursing facilities, and to improving the operational efficiency by dramatically improving scan and digitization times.",

        "abstract": "Friction is one of the major reasons for failure of gears and bearing surfaces used in traditional and nonrenewable energy systems such as power generators and wind turbines, and in other vital industries such as transportation, mining and construction. A recent Department of Energy report noted that reliability of wind turbine gearboxes is one of the major challenges to delivering an efficient wind energy platform, and that comprehensive solutions are needed to address design and lubrication of gearboxes. The annual cost of friction- and wear-related energy and material losses is estimated to be 5 to 7 % of the GNP of industrialized nations. Addressing the critical need for improved lubrication is one of the grand challenges the US faces in attempting to increase use of nonrenewable energy sources, reduce dependence on foreign energy sources, and increase productivity.  The objective of this SBIR project is to scale up and optimize production of advanced lubricant additives. These additives provide advanced lubrication due to the ability of the nano-size lubricating agents to get into the intricate spaces between mating surfaces, where they react with the surfaces to form a durable lubricating film that sustains high loads and reduces friction and wear. Further, these advanced additives are more environmentally friendly than those currently used for these applications. The process for making the nano-additives will be scaled up to commercially-viable production levels, optimized and tested to demonstrate friction and wear reduction and increased lifetime when used in oils and greases for wind turbines and other systems.The first phase was successful in demonstrating the feasibility of scaling up the production level to an industrial scale, and performance tests showed that critical characteristics and tribological performance factors of the nano-additive were maintained. Working with a leading wind turbine manufacturer, tribological tests demonstrated the desired performance. Collaboration with a leading lubricant manufacturer identified performance and cost targets as well as process routes.  A pilot production facility will be prepared and optimized, scaling up to commercially-viable production levels. Key tests will be performed to demonstrate consistent performance meeting the demanding requirements for lubrication of wind turbine gear boxes.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  These additives address major needs of the manufacturing industry for providing predictable and extended reliability along with major energy savings in severe friction and wear conditions. The first critical application of interest is in gears for wind turbines and related mechanical joints. This is one of the immediate ",

We propose to develop a patented microemulsion of propofol in which the lipophilicity of propofol is leveraged to serve dual roles as both the lipid oil core of the microemulsion and a pharmacodynamically active agent to cause anesthesia. Previously, we demonstrated that these microemulsions had favorable anesthetic properties. In summary, we synthesized propofol microemulsions and learned their physical boundary conditions and stability when subjected to environmental changes; narrowed these formulations to 5 promising microemulsions and studied their properties studied in rat; learned that some microemulsions had anesthetic kinetic properties similar to Diprivan; used the leading formulation in pig and dog to demonstrate that there are no changes in blood coagulation; demonstrated in pig that the formulation had similar pharmacokinetics to Diprivan, the FDA reference labeled drug; showed that the propofol microemulsion inhibited the growth of various species of bacteria; and constructed a plan to produce GMP-grade propofol microemulsions. To take the next step, a FDA IND must be obtained prior to beginning clinical studies. Therefore, the following Aims will be achieved: Specific Aim #1: Execute preclinical studies of the MicrofolTM formulation sufficient for IND submission. These studies to include: (a) 28-day acute toxicity dog study; (b) comparative single dose toxicokinetic (TK) studies and modeling in the dog of Diprivan(R) (RLD) and MicrofolTM (test article); (c) parental tolerance study in rabbits; and (d) evaluation of the test article to induce hemolysis in whole human blood.

        "abstract": "Camelina seed production is expanding throughout the semi-arid portion of the wheat belt and is proposed for intercropping between rows in vineyards and nut orchards. These markets and the market need for small maneuverable harvesters for research plots and breeder blocks have created a need for an inexpensive, but efficient, camelina harvester. The Seedster has the potential for meeting the demand for a camelina harvester that is inexpensive, variable width, maneuverable, has quick seed unloading and rapid cleanout. In Phase I Native Seedsters, Inc. (NSI) tested the basic Seedster technology which consists of counter-rotating brush and combing drum. The space in-between the brush and comb creates a 'pinch-point' where seed is plucked from the plant inflorescence. The first harvest of camelina with a Seedster resulted in a product that was 50% (by weight) seed, 40% seed capsule halves and 10% stems. In commercial camelina seed production the receiving elevators allows only 4.5% tare. To improve upon the purity of Seedster harvested seed a screening device was designed and tested. This device consisted of semi-cylindrical 9/64\" round-hole screen which housed a 9\" auger. During the second year of the Phase I project the seed purity was improved from 50% to 97% with the addition of the screening device. Although Phase I met or exceeded 4 of the 5 Performance Goals, the seed recovery efficiency was still not high enough to be competitive. In Phase I, the 40\" Test-Bed Seedster capture only 59% of the total seed from stands yielding 1,100 lbs/acre and 70% of the seed in stands yielding 550 lbs/acre. The seed loss was attributed to a) seed shatter upon initial contact with the main brush, b) seed carry over on the combing drum and c) seed that 'stalled out' in the dislodgement chamber and fell back out the pinch-point because of insufficient airflow to carry the seed all the way to the seed hopper. In the Phase I Test-Bed the majority of the airflow for transporting the dislodged seed to the seed hopper was created by the main brush, with supplemental air and direction created by the air assist brush. In Phase I this airflow was insufficient to transport all of the heavy, rounded camelina seed to the seed hopper. In Phase II, a 60\" Test-Bed Seedster will be assembled that is capable of configuration and reconfigurations to address these seed losses. The air-assist brush will be replaced with a tangential flow fan, positioned behind the combing drum to direct and propel all dislodged seed from the dislodgement chamber into the collection hopper, eliminating carry-over on the combing drum. The combing drum will be adjusted forward, thus making the distance between the pinch-point and the point of initial contact closer, reducing initial shatter. Various brush bristle densities and various combing drum surfaces (greater static friction) will be tested for maximizing seed dislodgement. An 8/64\" round-hole screen will be tested in the screening device to try to improve seed purity to 99%. If the Phase II Performance Goals are met the Seedster will be a viable camelina seed harvest alternative for many farmers and researchers.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In our Phase 1 application, we described an endothelial specific receptor, Robo4, that is expressed in mature vessels and is upregulated following endothelial injury. Robo4, following activation by its protein ligand, Slit2, reduces agonist induced vascular leak in vitro and in vivo. We provided evidence of Slit2's efficacy in animal models of acute lung injury and described the limitations of Slit2 as an actual therapy due to challenges in protein purification and its inherent instability. The overall objective stated in our Phase 1 application was to develop a new class of biologic agent to block the noncardiac pulmonary edema of ALI/ARDs. Our specific aims were to identify a more stable, more easily purified fragment of Slit2 and to test this fragment in in vitro and in vivo models of acute lung injury. We accomplished these aims with a fragment we will refer to as SlitD1-D2Fc and now propose to advance its development by completing the steps necessary to transition from laboratory to larger-scale production and advancing animal testing for safety, dosing, and efficacy. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: Establish a stable cell line and develop a master cell bank for larger-scale production of recombinant Slit2D1-D2Fc;  Aim 2: Convert pilot purification methods to process appropriate for larger scale production of Slit2D1-D2Fc; and Aim 3: Conduct initial pharmacokinetics and safety testing for Slit2D1-D2Fc in rodents and optimize dosing regimens in murine models of endotoxin-induced ALI and systemic sepsis, a condition that often presents with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress. The primary milestone for our Phase 1 project was the identification of a stable fragment of Slit2 that would lend itself more easily to purification. This has been accomplished with Slit2D1-D2Fc. Furthermore, we advanced our understanding of the mode of action of Robo4 receptor antagonists and our confidence in their efficacy in multiple models of acute lung injury and sepsis, including mortality reduction in animals infected with the H5N1 virus. These studies suggest that activation of Robo4 may provide a common platform for treating multiple infectious agents ranging from endotoxin exposure and gram-negative sepsis to pandemic influenza. Our objective now is to advance the development of SlitD1-D2Fc to the point that it can be transitioned to an outside manufacturer, prove its safety, confirm our hypotheses regarding dosing, and illustrate efficacy in treating both ALI/ARDS and sepsis, conditions that often present hand in hand. Simply put, our objective for this Phase 2 project is to advance SlitD1-D2Fc to lay the foundation for an IND application.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) result from a common pathogenic process: pulmonary injury and infection trigger an inflammatory response that results in the release of growth factors and cytokines that increase endothelial and epithelial permeability, permit efflux of inflammatory cells, protein and water from the vascular system into the alveolar space, and suffocate the patient. Slit2D1-D2Fc prevents the increase in endothelial and epithelial permeability and halts the course of events leading to death.",

However, clinical and technical difficulties associated with surface stimulation, such as discomfort caused by stimulation of cutaneous pain receptors and the need for skilled personnel to place the surface electrodes on a daily basis, have prevented it from becoming the standard of care. Percutaneous electrical stimulation is a promising treatment option, as demonstrated by clinical studies, but there are no commercially available systems. During the Phase I project period, the design concept for a novel percutaneous electrical stimulation system was completed and its technical feasibility was demonstrated. The objective of this Phase II project is to complete the design and development of the electrical stimulator and assess its usability, safety, and efficacy in a technical and clinical validation study. The specific aims of this project are to 1) complete the development of the stimulator housing and construction, 2) complete the development and testing of the stimulator's miniaturized circuit board and associated embedded software, and 3) conduct a clinical study to validate the usability, safety, and efficacy of the Neuropill System in eleven subjects with post-stroke shoulder pain. Our long term goal is to commercialize a safe and effective therapy for post-stroke shoulder pain. At the conclusion of this Phase II project, we will have completed the development of an innovative technology and evaluated its usability, safety, and efficacy for the treatment of post-stroke shoulder pain. Ultimately, the findings from this development effort and clinical validation study will enable us to design and initiate the larger clinical studies necessary for commercialization.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Present treatment options for post-stroke shoulder pain, affecting almost one third of stroke survivors, are either ineffective or have technical barriers preventing their widespread use. Percutaneous electrical stimulation is a promising treatment option, as demonstrated by clinical studies, but there are no commercially available systems. The Neuropill System is intended to provide electrical stimulation therapy to significantly reduce post-stroke shoulder pain, while offering significant advantages in comfort, patient compliance, and ease of use.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Novel Polymer Coatings to Prevent Biofilms on Urinary Stents and Catheters Bacterial infection and subsequent encrustation of urinary stents and catheters is a persistent problem in clinical urology and leads to significant patient morbidity and mortality. Most implanted stents become infected at some point, requiring retrieval and re-implantation if the initial treatment duration did not correct the underlying condition. Indeed, more than 90% of patients who have a long-term catheter develop bacteriuria within a month. Considering that about 100 million urethral catheters and urinary stents are inserted each year, millions of device-associated infections occur annually. Various surface modifications to urinary devices have been developed to prevent bacterial adhesion, such as silver-coated surfaces, control-release antibiotics, and surface modification to change hydrophobicity. These approaches have enjoyed varying degrees of success, but all suffer from numerous limitations. Clearly, development of a highly efficacious, long-lasting technology for preventing bacterial infections of urinary stents and catheters would dramatically benefit patients' well-being and quality of life and substantially reduce health care costs. A novel biomimetic strategy to produce surface coatings that repel cells and macromolecules has recently been developed. This strategy was inspired by the unique protein glues that marine mussels secrete for adhesion to various underwater substrates. In brief, antifouling polymers have been coupled to the amino acid L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), a key component of so-called mussel adhesive proteins (MAPs). The resulting constructs have greatly reduced protein adsorption, mammalian cell attachment, and microbial attachment to metal and metal oxide surfaces. DOPA is believed to be responsible for anchoring the antifouling polymer to the substrates. In the research conducted in our Phase I feasibility study, we have demonstrated that DOPA-mimic polymers can be successfully synthesized and applied to urinary stent and catheter material surfaces and that the polymer-coated surfaces exhibited a significant reduction in bacterial adhesion compared to uncoated controls. This proposal outlines the synthesis, characterization, and evaluation of two polymers selected from the Phase I study. The two candidate coating polymers will be synthesized in a larger scale to provide sufficient material for the testing, and to determine manufacturability. Application conditions for the coatings will be adjusted to optimize their ability to reduce bacterial adhesion. Long-term, the in vitro efficacy of the candidate coatings will be determined by incubating coated samples with bacterial inoculums for extended periods. Additional experiments will be performed to determine the biocompatibility of these coatings and to test the efficacy of coated urinary stents and catheters in pilot animal models.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacterial contamination and encrustation of urinary stents and catheters is a persistent problem in urology, and often leads to urinary tract infection and retrieval and replacement of the implanted devices. Coatings that are designed to prevent bacterial adherent will largely prevent this problem, improving the quality of life for patients and reducing healthcare-related costs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this application is to develop an imaging device for the early detection, diagnosis and quantification of the degree of midperipheral retinal ischemia in Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). Earlier diagnosis of DR could facilitate intervention at a stage that may prevent or lessen permanent damage from the ravages of the disease, in turn, improving patient quality of life and reducing lifetime treatment costs.  DR is one of the more debilitating potential outcomes of diabetes posing a major threat to the quality of life of diabetics. Experts believe that DR is the leading cause of blindness in the industrialized world in people between the ages of 25 and 74 years old. The American Academy of Ophthalmology states that DR is the leading cause of blindness among working Americans and currently affects nearly seven million people in the U.S. Early detection can help treat DR and salvage about 90 percent of vision loss, but about one-third of the diabetic population remains undiagnosed, translating into approximately 5.7 million people in the U.S. Delay in the primary diagnosis of diabetes allows diabetic complications to progress significantly before detection further increasing the risks associated with the disease by making the treatment much more complicated. Diabetes management guidelines advocate initiation of therapeutic intervention early in the prognosis of the disease. Estimates of diabetics in the U.S. with DR range from 15% to as high as 40%.  The goal of Neuro Kinetics diabetic screening methodology is to use a noninvasive, objective measure of diabetes-related damage to the peripheral retina that contributes to the development of central vision loss and the growth of abnormal blood vessels that can bleed and scar, leading to blindness. Unlike existing screening methods which employ photography of the back of the eye and reading centers, this device can provide an instantaneous answer to the patient and/or their doctor of the severity of the disease and indicate if immediate specialty eye care is warranted. By comparing the responses of an individual's pupil to varying brightness of lights directed either to the center of vision or to the peripheral vision, we can detect progressive retinal damage from DR while controlling for the effects of cataracts, medications, and autonomic dysfunction. Our preliminary data from a Phase I study has established testing conditions that appear to be capable of distinguishing individuals with moderate or severe DR from normal individuals with less than a 1:1000 false positive rate for normal people.  We have the following specific aims for Phase II: (1) to develop a clinical version of the testing device that is self-contained and can operate more easily and rapidly in a lighted area; (2) to develop control, recording and automatic analysis software for assessment of data quality and interpretation; (3) to perform clinical testing on a total of 200 normal and diabetic subjects to establish the discrimination capabilities of the instrument as a screening tool and (4) to develop an application for pre-commercial FDA approval and testing.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, Diabetic Retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among working Americans and currently affects nearly seven million people in the U.S. There is widespread agreement that the current U.S. eye care delivery system cannot meet the screening needs of these patients by relying on traditional, clinical eye examinations. Neuro Kinetics is developing a rapid, noninvasive screening technology based on images of the pupil's response to unique patterns of light to detect retinal damage from diabetes at a stage that would warrant intervention and therapy to protect sight.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Telemedicine can be defined as the delivery of healthcare services to distal locations by electronic connectivity. In recent years, telemedicine has expanded to include a wide range of remotely delivered services, including vital signs monitoring, medication management,  telepsychiatry  and others. The increasing utilization of telemedicine is driven by cost and, for distal ( underserved ) regions, a lack of professionals to deliver otherwise unavailable services. This proposal aims to develop a computerized assessment system capable of providing remote, audio-video-based administration of a wide range of commonly applied cognitive test instruments as well as behavioral-psychiatric measures (BPMs), in a similar manner as if the examiner were sitting face-to-face with the subject being evaluated. The proposed Computerized Assessment by Remote Examiner System (CARES) will enable qualified clinicians to remotely conduct thorough neuropsychological or psychiatric evaluations of research subjects or patients with a range of acquired brain disorders for which such assessments are routinely applied, including: traumatic brain injury, stroke, brain tumor, neurotoxicologicalinsult,HIV-relatedencephalopathy,schizophrenia,and Alzheimer's disease. Remote locations broadly include clinical evaluation units at hospitals, managed care facilities, group practice sites, nursing homes, correctional facilities, regional health clinics, and in patient's homes, in both rural and metropolitan areas. The CARES will implement a fundamentally new approach in which a remote examiner views a full-screen, application-specific GUI that provides on- screen controls that will enable an examiner to: control the pace of the test session, repeat and supplement computerized instructions, immediately score verbal report or overt behavior in real time, and pause or terminate a test. Thus, the CARES is well suited for application in impaired populations that commonly require ongoing monitoring and supplemental instruction. Significantly, the CARES is a technological extension of a previously validated, dual-display, computerized assessment system in which the subject is physically accompanied by a human examiner. The GUI for this antecedent system will be adapted to host a high-resolution televideo window that permits an examiner and patient to see and talk to each other, establishing high-quality  telepresence , which is especially important for the administration of tests or BPMs involving subjective impressions or judgement of overt behavior. Accordingly, the CARES approach contrasts sharply with available, web-based assessments that are not only unaccompanied by an examiner, but suffer from rigid administration procedures, as well as multiple technical shortcomings, that significantly limit the range of test instruments that can be reliably administered to impaired individuals. In Phase II, the main objectives are to: 1) develop an application- optimized, standardized, mobile CARES Hardware Platform (CHP) with integrated peripheral devices and software utilities; and 2)compare the concurrent validity, test-retest reliability, and user acceptability of accompanied computerized testing vs. remote computerized testing. The CARES will be the first system of its kind and will likely find immediate commercial application across a range of healthcare delivery networks, research settings, and controlled clinical trials.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Computerized Assessment by Remote Examiner System (CARES) is a unique and highly innovative technology intended to facilitate televideo-based neuropsychological and psychiatric evaluation services in areas that are currently  underserved  due to either geographic or economic obstacles that limit access to properly trained professionals who provide such services. Among these underserved populations are individuals living in rural areas or remote regions such as Indian reservations, individuals incarcerated in correctional facilities, and a variety of  homebound  individuals such as non-ambulatory patients or residents of nursing homes. The need to provide otherwise unavailable mental health services to these patients is a pressing disparity that the current project hopes to address.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue heterogeneity is a serious limiting factor for sound cell-specific molecular studies of the disease including genomic or proteomic analysis. Tissue microdissection and cell sorting technologies have advanced tremendously over the last decade from simple manual tissue dissection to sophisticated laser capture microdissecting (LCM) instruments and high speed fluorescence assisted cell sorting systems (FACS). In combination with genomics and proteomics technologies it is now possible to generate cell specific transcriptome/proteome data, advancing the identification of disease biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets. Currently, LCM and FACS are the two main technologies for the isolation of specific tissues and cell types. However, due to their high costs and often sophisticated interface, these technologies are not sufficient to fully support the growing need for cell specific molecular data. Therefore, there is a tremendous need for a low-cost and simple-to-use microdissection device that would offer capabilities similar to LCM and FACS. The overall goal of this SBIR project is to develop a new low-cost microdissection instrument with cellular resolution. In phase I of this project we proposed to build a prototype and test the feasibility of a novel capillary- based vacuum-assisted cell and tissue acquisition system (CTAS) that was envisioned as an attachment to inverted microscopes. The proposed CTAS would be able to dissect tissues at cellular resolution and collect material (RNA or protein) for downstream applications (e.g. expression microarrays). Phase I of this project was highly successful. We developed a fully functional prototype and demonstrated its use for collection of specific cell types from mouse central nervous system (spinal cord and brain). The architecture and major components of CTAS, including the capillary holder, collector, vacuum source, CTAS holder and light source, were developed, tested and optimized. Phase II specific aims include 1) further development of the critical components of CTAS; 2) development of control unit and adjustable parameters; 3) further testing of CTAS on tissue sections; and cell cultures. In addition, the prototype will be tested in different laboratory settings including tissue dissection and cell specific collection from heterogeneous cell culture sources. NeuroInDx will complete this work, which will be necessary to successfully evaluate proposed CTAS, and will commercialize the instrument in phase III of this project.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cell specific sorting/capture technology is a prerequisite for precise characterization of the specific cell types for understanding their function and regulation of the metabolism, as well as for preclinical translational research. Currently two major approaches for the acquisition of specific cells are available: fluorescence assisted cell sorting (FACS) and laser-capture microdissection (LCM). These technologies are sophisticated and the instruments are not only very expensive but have high maintenance costs. In phase I of this project, we developed a low-cost vacuum-assisted capillary-based cell and tissue acquisition system (CTAS) and demonstrated its feasibility and applicability for tissue microdissection and downstream applications. It is a simple, non-invasive (unlike LCM it does not require tissue fixing and drying) technology that can be easily automated and offers a wide range of cell- and tissue-specific separation parameters. We estimate that CTAS will be at least 5-10 times cheaper than LCM or FACS instruments. In phase II of this SBIR application, we propose further development of the instrument, its optimization and testing for the range of applications including tissue microdissection and cell specific collection from heterogeneous cell cultures. As part of Phase II, beta testing of CTAS will be carried out in several sites including academic laboratories and industry. This work will result in its full commercialization in the following phase III. This low-cost microdissection instrument will be affordable for virtually any research laboratory, and therefore, the demand will likely be very high given the growing need for cell specific analysis.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Widely publicized cases such as Terri Schiavo have raised awareness of the importance of advance care planning. However, while promoted through federal law and regulation, emphasis is placed on the completion of an advance directive (AD) document rather than on the informed decision making and communication essential to ensuring that end of life care preferences are honored. In fact, there is little evidence that having an AD alone results in improved or preferred care at the end of life. Consequently, the advance directive (or living will) as a public policy instrument has been called a failed social policy. More recently, attention has been redirected to the process of advance care planning. In response, we propose an innovative interactive decision aid to help individuals not only to make informed decisions about preferred treatment at end of life but also to communicate these preferences and decisions to their health care providers and families. The program will use video to provide visual depiction of several advance stage health states and options for end of life care treatment and to model effective communication with health care providers and family about preferences for care. Template documents for completing an AD and health care proxy will be provided for completion immediately or at a later date. The program is presented on a tablet-PC, with the capability to be web-based allowing the inclusion of these documents in an electronic medical record. No other available program offers all of these features on a portable platform to maximize and facilitate use across a range of settings The Specific Aims of Phase I were completed successfully. The Specific Aims of Phase II are to: 1) produce the final two dramatic videos regarding patient communication with family and a health care proxy; 2) produce digital videos for additional health states and potential treatment options; 3) finalize web design and complete programming of text screens and integration of video and audio narration; 4) evaluation of the program's effectiveness; and 5) finalization and implementation of the commercialization plan.

        "abstract": "Due to the threat of global warming, and the economic need for energy independence, the United States Department of Energy is developing alternative means of energy production. Solid Oxide Fuel Cells offer a route for more efficient use of fossil fuels, bio-fuels, and biomass, with less pollution compared to combustion approaches. However, widespread use of SOFCs is currently limited, partially by the high cost and corrosion associated with available interconnect technologies. Current corrosion issues degrade performance and limit the life of SOFC systems. These limitations compromise SOFC economic viability and hold back commercial adoption.In this Phase II SBIR Program, NexTech Materials will perform a build upon the success of its Phase I study. Phase I efforts concluded that manufacturing cost for Aerosol Spray Deposition (ASD) of ceramic oxide coatings present an economically viable approach to addressing interconnect corrosion. Comparisons of anticipated manufacturing costs showed that in terms of materials, capital, and operating costs required to manufacturing at scales up to 1.6M parts/year, ASD was a strong choice for SOFC interconnect protection.Critical cost-reducing materials and process refinements were identified in Phase I through modeling and experiment. In this Phase II effort, process demonstrations at the production scale will be performed using representative interconnect components. Components will be produced and tested singly and in SOFC stacks for several hundred hours. Parallel efforts to will customize the technology to suit a range of SOFC developers, thus maximizing the market for the technology and its reach. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The program will result in the commercial availability of low-cost metallic interconnects for SOFCs that can meet the lifetime requirements established by the Department of Energy.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of the project in Phase II is to develop and evaluate a stand-alone, Web-based serious game titled Vstreet-G, and to complete the interactive multimedia instruction on money management by adding a component on investment skills. Emancipation from dependence to living independently is one of the most challenging and feared life events for youth, especially those in care. Prior to emancipation, youth in supported living situations fail to grasp its impact and are not prepared to meet the enforced change. The Vstreet-G simulation game will help to prepare at-risk youth for emancipation by motivating them to learn and apply life skills in a Web-based environment specially adapted for this population that emphasizes applied learning experiences. In Phase I we produced two items: 1) a concept paper on the design and development of the Vstreet-G serious game and 2) the core interactive multimedia instructional component on money management, titled Money Medical: Healthy Money Management for the Web and as a CD. The proposed serious game will encapsulate and utilize the content of our previously developed and currently used Web site, Vstreet.com, which contains a rich variety of research-based curriculums and resources for teens on life skills. Vstreet-G will provide a simulated emancipation experience while encouraging youth to access the life skills materials on Vstreet.com to advance in the game. In the case of children in foster care, the federal Chafee Act requires that all whom the courts recognize as likely to emancipate directly from the care system be given life skills training beginning at age 14. Although legislators and educators recognize the critical need for this education, youth themselves do not, until they are on their own and their lives have started to unravel. The Vstreet-G game will 1) increase youth's awareness of the life skills they will need to prepare for taking this big step; 2) allow them to practice applying these skills in simulated living situations (without both the awareness and the opportunity to practice, emancipating youth are much more likely to fail in the real world); and 3) provide life skills educators with interactive materials that stimulate awareness about preparedness among youth who have a range of literacy levels and learning styles. The findings of the Phase I study showed that Money Medical was effective in improving youth's knowledge and confidence in managing their money. In the Phase II study, to be conducted with a minimum of 150 at-risk youth recruited from two sites, we will examine three basic research questions: 1) whether the Vstreet-G serious game increases aspects of users' motivation and readiness to change in ways that are relevant to their impending emancipation - including key components such as self-efficacy and empathy - compared to those who, using Vstreet.com, do not have the experience of the simulated environment; 2) whether the game environment of Vstreet-G is more effective at increasing users' money management skills than the existing Vstreet.com site; and 3) whether outcomes are differentially affected by the presence of self-identified disability.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By playing the proposed Web-based serious game, at-risk youth who are typically resistant to traditional educational approaches, and who are in line to transition to independent living, will have an opportunity to practice the transition in a virtual world. As a result, many of these youth will be better prepared to emancipate successfully, thereby reducing their impact on such public health problems as homelessness, physical and mental illness, drug abuse, and prostitution. This project, by providing life skills awareness and training, will help increase the chances for the at-risk youth population to live life as healthy, independent, and productive citizens.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many wounds, such as surgical and traumatic injuries, heal without difficulty. Chronic wounds, however, typically exhibit delayed healing in patients with underlying medical conditions that prevent normal tissue repair. For example, approximately 15% of all people with diabetes mellitus will develop a foot ulcer at some point in their lives. Diabetic foot ulcers have an increased risk of infection due to the slow healing times caused by poor blood circulation in the extremities and other associated co-morbidities. The treatment of diabetic foot ulcers is further complicated by the presence of multidrug resistant pathogens like MRSA methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. If left untreated, contaminated foot ulcers routinely become clinically infected and may ultimately lead to lower-limb amputations. This Phase II aims to develop a topical wound dressing that functions safely and effectively to prevent these and other chronic wound infections.    Novan, Inc. was founded to commercialize an innovative platform technology that harnesses the anti-infective power of nitric oxide (NO). During Phase I, Novan successfully created polyurethane films containing nitric oxide-loaded precipitated silica (Nitricil(tm)) that exhibit broad spectrum efficacy against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including P. aeruginosa. Following extensive discussions with clinicians and a thorough assessment of advanced wound care products utilized to manage infection, the goal of this three17 year project is to manufacture an absorbent nitric oxide-releasing wound dressing called Nitrisorb(tm). The specific aims for this project are to 1) optimize the dose of Nitricil(tm)-loaded in the wound contact layer, 2) produce commercially viable wound dressing prototypes, and 3) evaluate Nitrisorb(tm) product performance and safety in vivo. The Nitrisorb(tm) product could lead to a significant reduction in the costs of chronic wounds by improving the healing time, reducing the number of hospital days, and decreasing the number of procedures required to treat infections.    The only FDA approved use of NO is as a drug in the gaseous form to treat pulmonary hypertension in neonates (INOmax, 1999). The unprecedented use of NO in a wound dressing dictates the submission of a Request for Designation (RFD) to the FDA's Office of Combination Products. A formal response will designate the regulatory jurisdiction and path required to obtain product approval (i.e., drug, device, or biologic). Ultimately, Novan aspires to commercialize the first NO-based wound dressing. The Company has assembled a strong team of scientists, clinicians, contractors, and business leaders who believe in the technology and are positioned to ensure the greatest likelihood for success.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to discover and develop novel broad-spectrum antibiotics acting against critically important human pathogens. The unmet need is especially acute for Gram-negative pathogens, where we are rapidly running out of options for treating multidrug resistant species of Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Burkholderia, Klebsiella and Enterobacter.  This is a challenging goal, since the last novel class of broad-spectrum antibiotics was discovered 40 years ago. Currently, there are no broad-spectrum leads in the global pipeline of drug discovery, according to the review of this important subject at the last ICAAC meeting. The main barrier to progress in antimicrobial drug discovery is the lack of sources for novel compounds. NovoBiotic has a proprietary technology capable of meeting this challenge. We are obtaining new antimicrobials from a previously inaccessible source - uncultured fungi. In Phase I, we developed a trap for specific capture and growth of uncultured fungi. Many antimicrobials, including ?-lactams and cephalosporins derive from culturable representatives of this group of microorganisms. The trap consists of two layers of sterile agar sandwiched between semi-permeable membranes that is inserted into soil. Fungi produce hyphae which enable them to penetrate into the trap through the pores in the membrane, into the upper layer of agar and form pure colonies. Many uncultured species that initially grow in situ are then capable of growing under standard laboratory conditions in vitro.  The aims of Phase I were to assemble a collection of 200 fungi using the trap method, screen them for antimicrobial activity and dereplicate 25 of them. We achieved these milestones and discovered a novel broad- spectrum antimicrobial, Novo15, from an uncultured fungus only distantly related to known organisms. In Phase II we will validate the compounds discovered in Phase I in in vitro biological assays and animal models of S. aureus and K. pneumonia pulmonary infection. Also, we will isolate and screen an additional 250,000 fungal strains from the trap (Aim 1), validate potential leads using in vitro biological tests and determine the structure of promising compounds (Aim 2), and perform animal tests on 10 novel compounds (Aim 3). The end result of Phase II will be 2-3 validated, novel broad-spectrum antimicrobials. These will be developed into drugs in the next phase of the program.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is increasing public health concern about the ability of currently available antibiotics to keep pace with evolving microbial resistance; naturally acquired in the case of community and hospital based infections, and potentially engineered in the case of bioterror agents. One solution to this problem is the development of new antibiotics. The purpose of this project is to use our new technology to identify new classes of antibiotics with broad-spectrum activity against both conventional and biodefense pathogens.",

In Phase II, NP Photonics proposes to develop prototypes or products of the high SBS-threshold, Single-Mode (SM), polarization maintaining (PM), high power amplifiers operating with sub-microsecond pulses and transform-limited linewidth. This is based on the successful demonstrations in Phase I by using NP's proprietary patented large core SM PM highly Er/Yb co-doped phosphate glass fibers. Furthermore, in order to push the SBS threshold to the 100s kW level and to demonstrate even higher SBS threshold and improved conversion efficiency for 100-500 ns transform-limited fiber laser pulses, a new large core SM PM photonic crystal phosphate fiber 100/400 will be designed and fabricated in Phase II. It will be used to build the 3rd power amplifier stage in order to offer prototype/product services by achieving 10s kW peak power and 5-mJ pulse energy free of SBS effects.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop systems for measuring oxygen concentrations on and inside the eye. These systems will take advantage of phosphorescent probes that are sensitive to oxygen concentrations. They will have obvious applications in eye research and will lead to advancements in our understanding of ocular diseases, development of new drugs, contact lenses and surgical procedures. It should be emphasized that these instrument systems are aimed solely at the ophthalmic research market, and NOT at the clinical diagnostic market. We believe that there is both a significant demand for such products in this market, and that their use will have significant impact to our understanding of oxygen in the eye, its role in ocular disease, and the development of new drugs, contact lenses, other therapeutic devices, and surgical procedures. Our initial technique used a dual frequency photon counting system, which we developed specifically for this purpose. It combined maximum sensitivity with the ability to measure a wide range of oxygen concentrations. During Phase I, we demonstrated feasibility of our techniques both in vitro and in the rabbit eye. These studies indicated that we could use a more flexible programmable photon counting system that could span a wide range of frequencies allowing the use of a wide range of phosphorescent probes. Since the last revision of this application, we have implemented this new design and tested it with both in vitro solutions and with live rabbits. There are a wide range of phosphorescent dyes available, and we propose to characterize many of them for their ability to penetrate or not penetrate into different ocular tissue. Phosphorescence quenching is not limited to oxygen. The dye system used in Phase I has previously been shown to be relatively insensitive to other ocular variables, but any new dyes will also have to be characterized similarly. A number of animal systems including humans have been used in previous research on ocular oxygen. We intend to leverage three delivery platforms developed by OcuMetrics to access the full range of animal systems: humans, laboratory animals (primates, rabbits, etc.), and very small laboratory animals (mice). Our overall goal is to develop multiple measurement systems based on dyes that have been selected for specific environmental affinity, oxygen range, etc. A critical goal will be standardization and calibration control, so that results made on different machines will be comparable. In addition, we will design this instrument with enough flexibility so that we can add capabilities as new phosphorescent oxygen probes and techniques are developed.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Oxygen is fundamental to life, but its presence is not only life giving, its reactive nature can also lead to dysfunction. The proposed instrument will take advantage of phosphorescent probes that are sensitive to oxygen concentrations to monitor oxygen concentrations in various areas of the eye. This will have obvious applications in eye research, and drug and contact lens testing.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High Throughput Tau Oligomer Assay for Drug Screening for Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary: There is a large and rapidly growing unmet need for disease modifying drugs for Alzheimer's disease. Currently there are 18 million cases of AD worldwide; by 2025 this number is expected to increase to 34 million. Presently, only 5 mildly effective AD symptom-treating drugs exist, but none that treat the underlying neurodegenerative processes. Tau is becoming a more prominent target for the development of disease- modifying drugs (DMDs), as its role in neurodegeneration is becoming better understood. Mutations in the gene for tau protein MAPT are causative of dementia and tau pathology correlates well with AD progression. At the same time, late stage clinical failures for therapeutics based on the amyloid hypothesis have raised questions on solely targeting A2. Strong evidence has emerged implicating tau oligomers as playing a direct role in disease pathogenesis for AD and over 20 other neurodegenerative diseases (Brunden et al. 2008; Davidowitz et al. 2008). To discover drugs targeting tau oligomerization methods were developed to select compounds inhibiting tau self-interaction, and an assay using AlphaScreen detection technology was selected for further development for high throughput screening (Chatterjee et al. 2008). In addition, the phage display- atomic force microscopy method developed by Dr. Sierks (ASU) was used to isolate antibody fragments (scFvs) specifically binding to tau oligomers that will be adopted in the cell based screening assays. The specific aims of the proposed program are as follows:    Convert the tau oligomer assay to HTS format    Transfer Assay to the Michigan High Throughput Screening Center (MHTSC) for automation and  screening of a highly optimized compound library (100,000 compounds) and carry out medicinal  chemistry analysis to model the pharmacophore and select additional chemotypes for screening    Select compounds using tau oligomer specific antibody fragments in cell based assays The anticipated outcome of the proposed Phase II program is the selection of at least three or more lead candidate compounds targeting tau oligomers that will be developed during the Phase III program and evaluated in animal models of AD and tauopathies. To attain this result, the high throughput assay will be optimized and transferred to the Michigan High Throughput Screening Center where their Select Set library of approximately 100,000 compounds will be screened under the direction Dr. Robert Kilkuskie Hits will be validated and a structural pharmacaophore model will be developed. Toxic compounds will be eliminated using a neurocytotoxicity assay. Three or more scFvs will be selected with high sensitivity and specificity that will be used to identify compounds inhibiting tau self-association using in vitro cell based assays. Antibody fragments, in addition to enabling the primary goal, are supportive of the company's other programs including its tau biomarker development program and its tau immunotherapeutic program. However, the primary goal of the program is to advance the tau oligomer drug discovery platform to identify active inhibitors as lead candidates for IND enabling studies. Key Words Alzheimer's disease, tauopathy, neurodegenerative disease, drug discovery, tau oligomer, phage display, antibody fragment, scFv, high throughput screening        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed program focuses on developing a high throughput screening assay targeting tau oligomers for drug discovery for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This project was inspired by observations that accumulation of tau oligomers has been shown to correlate well with neuronal loss and memory impairment in AD and in tauopathy mouse models. OLIGOMERIX has developed in vitro assays for screening compounds that inhibit the formation of cytotoxic tau oligomers. This program aims to 1.) .Convert the tau oligomer assay to HTS format; 2.) Transfer Assay to the Michigan High Throughput Screening Center (MHTSC) for automation and screening of a highly optimized compound library (100,000 compounds) and carry out medicinal chemistry analysis to model the pharmacophore; 3.)

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A fast, cost-effective multispectral confocal imaging capability for high-resolution mapping in vivo will be created during this project. This new approach will be based on fiber Bragg gratings, a technology not utilized previously in biomedical imaging, and will ultimately enable the early in vivo detection and treatment of cancer at the cellular level. The central innovation in this effort involves coupling a fast optical fiber-based spectrum analyzer with confocal spatial scanning optics - both interfaced with endoscopes for in-vivo detection and potential treatments. This fiber optic imaging spectrometer can acquire spectra in microseconds - fast enough to collect one spectrum for each resolved spot in a confocal spatial scan. As a result, datacubes containing spatial images for many wavelengths can be acquired in real-time. Multispectral confocal imaging in milliseconds will eliminate the effects of motion in biological systems. One can envisage acquiring multiple spatially registered simultaneous movies, comparing one channel with another (by subtraction or normalization).         Further, biomedical researchers could use this new technology to catalog more extensive libraries of spectral images showing tumor growth, angiogenesis and subsequent metastasis. These enhanced libraries will lead to several applications in surgical pathology, oncology labs, and clinics. Clinicians will use the technology to take optical biopsies, perform treatments, and monitor long-term results. Patients will have access to real-time diagnosis and treatment. In addition to cancer interventions, other potential multispectral applications include: neural imaging, intra-cellular proteomics, micro-vascular testing, plaque detection, foodstuff testing, and the evaluation of pharmaceutical products.         Our planned phases for this program will successively (a) create a fast fiber grating based spectrometer, (b) integrate the spectrometer with confocal scanning optics, (c) evaluate the integrated system with representative ex-vivo and in-vivo tissue samples (normal and abnormal), and (d) deliver the final product optimized for intrasurgical imaging to the biomedical community.

        "abstract": "Development of accelerator structures that can sustain acceleration gradients in the range of 150 MeV/m are required in order to build a future multi-TeV collider with an energy reach beyond present or planned electron-positron colliders.  A two-channel dielectric wakefield accelerator is to be developed that could have the potential to satisfy that need.  A coaxial structure consisting of two dielectric pipes surrounded by a conductor is being analyzed so as to design (Phase I) and test (Phase II) a wake field accelerator driven along its outer channel by an annular charge bunch whose wake fields accelerate a test charge bunch moving along its inner channel.  This structure can have the advantages of a high transformer ratio, favorable stability, and accelerator gradients in a mm-scale version of several 100 MeV/m induced by a single few-nC drive bunch.   Computations were carried out to predict performance of coaxial dielectric wake field accelerator modules that can be tested using facilities at Argonne National Laboratory.  Stability of the high-current drive beam and the low-current test beam was analyzed and found to be adequate for the range of experiments that are planned for Phase II.  Experiments will be carried out using facilities at Argonne National Laboratory to measure test beam acceleration, structure transformer ratio, and beam stability.  Further computations will be made to refine designs for a future TeV-scale version of this two-beam accelerator.  Commercial applications and other benefits:  Development of structures that can sustain high accelerating gradient without an undue frequency of breakdown, and which can be the basis for a future multi-TeV electron-positron collider, can hasten the day when the multi-TeV collider will be built, and thus hasten the day when the many commercial companies will have an opportunity to obtain the multi-million dollar manufacturing contracts for the accelerator structures.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal is to develop monoclonal antibody (MoAb)-based compounds capable of blocking human MASP-2 function as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). MASP-2 is a plasma serine protease uniquely required for complement activation via the lectin pathway and may be an attractive target for the development of novel therapeutics for inflammatory disorders. The complement system is an important host defense mechanism, however excessive or uncontrolled complement activation can trigger an intense inflammatory response that is thought to significantly contribute to undesired tissue damage in many disease states. Recent results implicate a central role for complement activation in the pathogenesis of AMD, and especially of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), the most serious form of AMD. To treat AMD it would be desirable to develop pathway-specific inhibitors which would target only the complement pathway causing the particular pathology without completely shutting down the immune defense capabilities of complement. Immunohistological studies of human donor tissues indicate that the classical pathway does not play a major role in triggering complement activation in AMD. Results from the Phase I studies have shown inhibition of CNV by MASP-2 MoAbs and now have provided definitive proof for an important role of MASP-2 in mediating CNV caused by laser injury to the retina. In addition, we have confirmed that laser injury-induced increases in VEGF are prevented in the lectin pathway deficient MASP-2 (-/-) mice. These findings further provide very convincing evidence that MASP-2 is an attractive therapeutic target for this indication. The Specific Aims for year 1 include: 1) Establishment of the pharmacology and protective mechanisms of anti-MASP-2 MoAb in the mouse model of AMD by evaluating the therapeutic effects on CNV, lectin pathway biomarkers and the disease-relevant growth factor, VEGF, in choroid/ RPE tissue. The other specific aim for year 1 includes: 2) Evaluation of an anti-MASP-2 MoAb clinical candidate on local and systemic pharmacodynamics in the non-human primate. The specific aims for year 2 include: 3) Establishment of the efficacy of the anti-MASP-2 MoAb clinical candidate in a non-human primate AMD model and 4) Evaluation of the local ocular and global safety and toxicity of a single dose administration of the anti- MASP-2 MoAb.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness after age 55. It is estimated that 1.75 million individuals suffer from this disease in the United States, with another 7 million  at risk . In this SBIR grant, studies will evaluate a potential new target called MASP-2 for treatment of AMD. Studies will be conducted with anti-MASP- 2 monoclonal antibodies to determine their potential as novel therapeutic agents in models of AMD.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low oxygen conditions (hypoxia) commonly found in solid tumors are considered a major obstacle for the clinical management of cancer by radiation therapy (radiotherapy, RT). Moreover, cancer patients with significantly hypoxic tumors tend to have a poor prognosis for survival. Given the clinical relevance of hypoxia, a long-time objective of experimental RT research has been to effectively radiosensitize solid tumors by attenuating or exploiting this pathophysiological state. Molecular oxygen (oxygen) is a natural and potent radiosensitizer; thus, one strategy for effectively treating hypoxic tumors by RT is to artificially increase their oxygenation. This project aims to use a novel oxygen-delivery technology developed at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley)-heme-nitric oxide/oxygen-binding (H-NOX) proteins-to revolutionize RT for cancer patients. The H-NOX technology embodies 4 major improvements over prior efforts in the field of oxygen delivery therapeutics: (1) oxygen-binding H-NOXs are neutral towards nitric oxide (NO), comparing favorably with the high NO reactivity and hypertensive properties of cell-free hemoglobin; (2) over 50 H-NOX candidates have been engineered, each with a specific oxygen affinity; the entire panel of vehicles demonstrate oxygen affinities across a 10-million fold range; (3) H-NOX vehicles are structurally stable above 80 0C, and chemically stable for weeks at room temperature; (4) H-NOX vehicles are modular, and can be surface-modified to alter size, oncotic properties, or tissue targeting. In short, the H-NOX technology provides a toolbox of oxygen delivery candidates to test in hypoxic tissues and tumors for their capacity to raise oxygen levels and enhance RT and chemotherapy. Phase I studies successfully identified a lead candidate that penetrates deep into tumors and raises oxygen levels in hypoxic zones. Phase II studies will focus on determining the degree of RT enhancement by lead H-NOX candidates, and refining them for optimal biodistribution, tumor oxygenation, RT enhancement and safety. A lead H-NOX candidate that meets this profile will be eligible for IND-enabling studies in preparation for clinical trials. This Phase II proposal has been prepared in accordance with guidelines for developing radiation enhancement therapies as published by the NCI's Radiation Modifier Working Group. The Phase II milestones have also been discussed with potential corporate partners and venture investors. Successful completion of this study is expected to result in significant investor interest in supporting IND-enabling development for clinical trials.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Low oxygen conditions (hypoxia) commonly found in solid tumors are considered a major obstacle for the clinical management of cancer by radiation therapy (radiotherapy, RT). For the 500,000 cancer patients treated with RT each year, more than 50% present with hypoxic tumors and receive minimal benefit from RT. This project aims to use a breakthrough, oxygen-delivery technology that is tunable, stable, and modular, to revolutionize RT for cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the development, manufacturing and commercialization of a novel miniature self-aligned tunable diode laser. The tunable laser platform offers two major advantages compared to currently available products and technologies: (1) passive optical alignment and assembly; and (2) extremely broad spectral coverage from visible (375nm) to the infrared (4,000nm). The self-alignment feature translates to much simpler and efficient manufacturing, and the optical design enables the new platform to be two orders of magnitude more compact than commercially available tunable diode lasers. These features combine to considerably lower the labor costs associated with assembly and packaging.  The research objectives are to determine the parameters of the passive cavity that enable (1) stable single frequency operation, (2) a linewidth less than 30KHz, and (3) less than 1MHz wavelength drift.  It is also critical to develop methods to tune the output to a specific target wavelength. Prototypes of the tunable laser will be built for three wavelength groups: blue (400-415 nm) ? Red (635-660 nm) and near-infrared (760-790 nm). This novel laser platform will enable a broad range of technology areas.\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project has direct links to commercial applications that decrease energy use or promote renewable energy implementation.  Specifically, this laser technology can assist the reduction of carbon emissions by monitoring and optimizing efficiencies in combustion processes such as engines and coal plants (via gas sensing with infrared tunable lasers). The technology will help accelerate the deployment of environmental sensing stations by providing the key optical source for sensing systems at a fraction of today?s cost.  A second role would be to provide athermal operation of lasers, which could significantly reduce the energy consumption in telecommunication systems by eliminating the requirement for cooling the lasers.  A third application would be improving the efficiency of renewable wind power (via wind sensing with blue-violet lasers) by enabling ?smart? wind turbines. A laser-based wind sensor would provide each ?smart? turbine of a wind farm with the ability to preemptively assess and accurately predict the wind load far in advance, helping improve overall turbine efficiency and utilization. This information is critical to the planning of energy supply into the power grid. All of these applications have immediate commercial potential to help reduce the World?s dependence on fossil fuels.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a prototype analyzer that can detect, identify, and quantify the presence of Category A (B and C) bioagents at the required specificity and sensitivity (e.g. in air 104 spores/m3, 100 organisms/m3 and 2-300 mg toxin/m3) within 10 minutes.  The analyzers will incorporate a novel surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)-based assay into sample systems read by a portable Raman spectrometer. The assays will be functionalized to selectively capture specific bioagents and generate unique SER spectra when irradiated by the analyzer laser. During Phase I, feasibility was demonstrated by selectively binding and detecting 25 ppm B. cereus (a B. anthracis surrogate) in the presence of 250 ppm B. subtilis. During Phase II, the assays will be developed to detect several real agents, such as B. anthracis (anthrax), Yersinia pestis (Plague), Francisella tularensis (Tularemia), and Clostridium botulinum (Botulism). The assays will then be incorporated into a product prototype that autonomously detects aerosolized bioagents. The analytical capabilities of the prototype will be validated at the US Army's Edgewood Chemical Biological Center.\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will provide a bioagent detector with the necessary sensitivity and speed to save lives and reduce substantially the terror associated with biological attacks. The continued presence of US military personnel in the Middle East has produced a persistent fear that biological warfare agents may be used by terrorists against civilian and military personnel at home and abroad. The proposed analyzer will allow measurement of such bioagents within 10 minutes, a vast improvement over the 2-3 hours required by current technology. Initially, the proposed detector will be used to protect military bases. Once established, the application of this product will be expanded to civilian applications, such as transit systems, high profile buildings (federal, financial, Fortune 500), stadiums, airports, and malls. The US military and civilian market is currently estimated at $0.5 Billion.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Statistical databases for public use pose a critical problem: how to make the data available for analysis without disclosing information that would infringe on privacy, violate confidentiality, or endanger national security. Organizations in the public and private sectors have a major stake in this confidentiality protection problem, given the fact that access to data is essential for advancing research and formulating policy. Yet, the possibility of extracting certain sensitive elements of information from the data can jeopardize the welfare of these organizations and potentially, the welfare of the society in which they operate. The challenge is, therefore, to represent the data in a form that permits accurate analysis for supporting research, decision-making and policy initiatives, while preventing an unscrupulous or ill- intentioned party from exploiting the data for harmful consequences. The objective of this project is to develop a practical, computer-based framework for assessing, measuring, and mitigating disclosure risk in public use data. Our proposed framework, called OptShield, overcomes the disadvantages found in currently deployed disclosure limitation methods. We achieve this by combining perturbation and suppression methods with optimal switching of sensitive records at the micro-data level, to produce a method that protects confidentiality while preserving data integrity. In Phase II we are proposing to continue algorithmic and software development to achieve the objective of a working prototype of the software and service. This software will serve as the core technology to provide an application for a broad market in which customers have a major stake in confidentiality protection. The application we ultimately plan to offer in Phase III will consist of a three-phased approach to the disclosure limitation problem: (1) Assess a user's qualitative and quantitative disclosure risks inherent in the organization's data publishing and sharing plans; (2) Measure the disclosure risks in a user's proposed data products; and (3) Protect the user's data by applying the appropriate disclosure limitation techniques.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health organizations that collect and share sensitive data are apprehensive about the risk of inadvertently disclosing confidential information, given the fact that access to their data is essential for advancing research and formulating policy. Yet, the possibility of extracting certain vulnerable elements of information from the data, even after personal identifiers have been removed, can jeopardize the welfare of these organizations and potentially the welfare of the society in which they operate. Within the US Department of Health and Human Services, for example, preserving the confidentiality of records in order to continue to elicit information from the American people and from health care providers is  a matter of primary concern  (CDC/NCHS confidentiality guide). OptTek Systems, Inc. (OptTek) is developing a comprehensive framework designed to help public health and other organizations to avoid the disclosure of confidential information in public-use data. The application consists of a three-phased approach to the disclosure limitation problem: (1) Assess a user's qualitative and quantitative disclosure risks; (2) Measure the disclosure risks in a user's proposed data publishing and sharing plans; and (3) Protect the user's data by applying the appropriate disclosure limitation techniques.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol and drug (AOD) abuse by employees causes many costly problems for business and industry including absenteeism, injuries, health insurance claims, loss of productivity, employee morale, theft, and fatalities. The loss to companies in the United States totals  184.6 billion a year. There are 150 million Americans in the labor force, of whom 10.5 percent of the full-time employed adults and 11.9 percent of the part-time employed adults were classified with substance dependence or abuse. An estimated 7.06 percent of the workforce used alcohol at least once during the workday, and 8.10 percent of the workforce used alcohol at least once either before work or during the workday. Supervisors are key members of the work group that can influence a co-worker to seek assistance through their employee assistance program or health plan benefit. Research has identified perceived barriers for supervisors including dysfunctional tolerance, enabling, problem minimization, and neutralization of deviance. Supervisor confidence has also been identified as a major factor in program implementation, including referring employees for appropriate assistance. There is considerable evidence to suggest that conventional supervisor training has not resulted in long-term sustainable outcomes in the workplace. The long term objective of the proposed project is to develop an interactive web-based supervisor training program that will: (1) reduce supervisor's tolerance for alcohol misuse and other drug use in the workplace, (2) increase supervisors' ability to effectively respond to workplace performance and behavior problems associated with the abuse of alcohol and other drugs (AOD), and (3) increase the incidence of early intervention for troubled employees. The finished product will be an interactive Web-based training program designed to address the shortcomings of conventional AOD supervisor trainings. We will adapt a state-of-the-art empirically-validated supervisor training curriculum, and use a proven-effective conceptual framework that is solidly based in behavioral management theory. We will incorporate principles of adult learning, current research on transfer of training, and proven-effective instructional design principles specific to e-Learning. In Phase I, we developed and tested a prototype of our proposed Web-based IMM training program and found significant effects and a high feasibility of success. In Phase II, we will develop the full-scope training program, and evaluate it in a large randomized trial. To accomplish the goals of Phase II, we propose three specific aims: (1) To determine optimal program characteristics, features and content desired by key stakeholders by collecting formative data, (2) develop a Web-based supervisor training program using an iterative development process, and (3) determine efficacy by evaluating the supervisor training program in a randomized trial with 334 supervisors. 1        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Substance abuse remains one of the nation's most important public health problems. It results in many costly problems to our health care system and contributes to or causes more than 70 conditions that require hospitalization. Additionally, substance abuse complicates the treatment of most illnesses, prolongs hospital stays, increases morbidity, and sharply raises health care costs. Alcohol and other drug use creates a  184.6 billion loss for employers in productivity, absenteeism, injuries, employee morale, theft, increased health insurance claims, and fatalities.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression is one of the most prevalent mental disorders to afflict adults. It seriously impacts role functioning and often takes a recurrent or chronic course. Given the high prevalence and associated impairments, depression has become a major public health concern. Because most adults who suffer from depression never receive treatment, there is a critical need to develop interventions that can be easily implemented and widely disseminated.  This project will develop and test an interactive multimedia program to teach cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal skills to workers with subthreshold depression in order to reduce symptoms, improve functioning at the workplace, and potentially reduce the risk for escalation to full-syndrome depression. The intervention will consist of knowledge- and skills-based modules including: understanding depression, work stress management, mood monitoring, pleasant activity scheduling, increasing positive thinking, decreasing negative thinking, skill integration, and planning for the future. The competency-based instructional design will be structured for multiple sessions using video-based tutorials, testimonials, and behavior modeling vignettes. Additional browser modules will include depression self-screening, getting support, learning to relax, problem solving and communication, and additional resources. The online support system will include an electronic bulletin board, personal weekly conferences with an intervention coach, and an ask-an-expert forum. The intervention will include six target populations: men and women in early, mid and late life. The basic structure of the program will be the same for each target population, but specific content will be customized to each user group.  The Phase I prototype, targeted to 18-39 year-old women, provided training on understanding depression, mood monitoring, and scheduling pleasant activities. Results from a small randomized trial (n = 42) showed moderate to large effect sizes for pre to post change in depressive symptomatology, knowledge, use of the skills taught, and self-efficacy. Participants found the program easy to use and gave it high satisfaction and usability ratings.  The fully developed Phase II product will be evaluated in a large randomized trial (N = 300) with an eight- week intervention and 1-month follow-up period. The Phase II trial is expected to show reductions in depressive symptoms and increases in occupational functioning, and these changes in the outcome measures are expected to be mediated by changes in the specific skills acquired through the intervention.  The potential commercial applications of the Phase II product are to employee assistance programs, behavioral health organizations, health insurance companies, and mental health clinics/practices.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression has become a major public health concern given its high prevalence and associated impairments. Although there have been significant advances in the diagnosis and treatment of depression, the design and evaluation of interventions for subthreshold depression have received little attention to date.

Data from this age group indicate that multi-component interventions targeting peers, school staff, child, and family are optimal to effectively change the safety behaviors of older children. This project will develop an interactive multimedia program to enhance bicycle, pedestrian, and wheeled sports safety skills for children in grades 4-8, for use in both school and home settings. The Phase I prototype covered 2 of the critical safety skills required for safe navigation on foot and by bike in the community: (a) understanding complex traffic patterns, and (b) appropriate helmet use. In Phase II programs for additional targeted groups (parents, and school staff) will be developed, and the interactive safety program will be expanded to include: (a) a comprehensive set of safety skills (e.g., maintaining bike equipment, group riding, and crash avoidance) across urban, suburban, and rural environments; (b) school-wide implementation guidelines; (c) classroom activities; and (d) expansion materials for parents. The critical features of this project are the utilization of interactive media for tailoring the instructional presentation to the individual user, the incorporation of instructional design features that have been shown to achieve maximum learning, the application of safety skills in video-based examples of real-life traffic situations, and age-matched video modeling. The program will be grounded in behavior change theory and will incorporate computer-based assessment with remediation to ensure content mastery. Phase II of the project will evaluate the efficacy of this comprehensive school-wide program in a large-scale clinical trial with 40 middle schools.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With regard to prevalence and cost to society, low-back pain has few peers. With a patient population in excess of 15 million/year, the societal cost is estimated to be in the realm of  100 billion/year. Current treatment options for this disease have shown limited success, including physical therapy, medication and surgery. This proposal involves a novel, nonsurgical and cost-effective, tissue revitalization approach which shows promise for treatment of mechanically and nutritionally challenged tissues like the spinal disc. Previous in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the efficacy of Injectable collagen crosslink augmentation in stabilizing spinal joints, decreasing disc bulge under load, increasing the strength, tear resistance, and durability of the tissue, while also improving nutritional flow to these largely avascular tissues. Phase I testing was successful in characterizing the crosslinking effects of seven candidate agents in disc annulus fibrosis (AF) tissue using mechanical, thermal and protease digestion assays. At least one preferred agent was identified, and concentration, pH, conditioning, and buffering were optimized to maximize the efficiency of crosslinking and mechanical effect. Recently, in vitro assays have been undertaken to determine agent and buffer biocompatibility. The proposed Phase II testing will provide data necessary for regulatory filings and first-in-man clinical trials. Reagent delivery, penetration, reaction kinetics, permanency (effect duration), and storage requirements (shelf life) will be thoroughly investigated. Acute, functional biocompatibility and neurotoxicity studies will be conducted to quantify expected and worst-case treatment effects in an animal model. Further characterization of crosslinking effects will be determined using different subgroups of human AF tissues (variations in age, composition, degeneration). By bringing this path-breaking treatment to the doorstep of clinical trials, SBIR funding will play a vital role in enabling progress towards the ultimate goal of providing a novel, cost-effective treatment in the struggle against low back pain and disability.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Back pain and disability associated with spinal degeneration and instability remains among the most costly and prevalent health problems in the US today. With a patient population in excess of 15 million/year, the societal cost is estimated to be in the realm of  100 billion/year. Due to the limited success of current treatment options, it is reasonable to expect that an effective nonsurgical solution could revolutionize clinical care for this pandemic.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We describe an integrated approach for High Throughput Screening of AptamersTM (HTSATM, patent pending) to discover small, structurally defined nucleic acid aptamer sequences that bind with high affinity and selectivity to a target of interest. Such targets are proteins, bio-terror agents, pathogenic organisms and viruses. These aptamers will be engineered into the  probe  sequence of our patented AlloSwitchTM indicators that re- spond rapidly to the presence of the target, giving rise to a fluorescent or luminescent signal. In phase I we demonstrated that it is feasible to rapidly screen and isolate high-affinity HT-aptamers. We have used HTSA to isolate previously known aptamers with nanomolar affinity for human athrombin (from DNA hairpin loops) and for human coagulation factor IXa (from RNA with concatenated hairpin and internal loops), and an unprece- dented aptamer with apparent specificity for hexose sugars (from DNA hairpins) with affinity in the top third of known aptamers for small molecules. Thus, the feasibility of HTSA has been demonstrated. In phase II, the approach will be expanded to include a wider variety of structural motifs and new targets. The targets for discovery of probes and creation of AlloSwitches will include proteins involved in clotting and thrombosis, and growth factors involved in wound healing, angiogenesis, and proliferative diseases. AlloSwitch based assays will assist in the discovery of small molecules that can be used for therapies to regulate the interactions of these proteins in blood. This stands in contrast to therapies based directly on aptamers or antibodies, which are difficult to protect from hydrolysis by enzymes in plasma and to formulate as pharmaceuticals in pills. This project will also accelerate the commercialization of our biosensor technology in other fields.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We present an integrated approach for rapid discovery of small, structurally defined nucleic acid  HT- aptamer  sequences that bind with high affinity and selectivity to proteins and other targets. The approach will be used to create sensors to discover small molecules as candidates for drugs against selected protein targets involved in wound healing and thrombosis. Beyond this project, discovery of high affinity HT-aptamers will be used in detecting waterborne pathogens, biological warfare agents, and diagnostic applications with costs ex- pected to be reduced by a factor of ten or more compared to antibody-based reagents.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the need in the marketplace for fuel cells with improved durability.  Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells offer a potential environmentally friendly source of power, but performance improvements are required before costs justify more widespread adoption of this technology.  Catalyst deactivation limits the lifetime of commercial PEM fuel cells, as the catalyst support is subject to oxidation and the active metal component, typically containing platinum, sinters during use.   This Phase II project addresses both of these problems.  Through a combination of new technologies from the ceramics, electronics, and catalyst industries, the feasibility of producing  new support materials that are much more resistant to degradation has earlier been demonstrated.  Accelerated aging studies have shown dramatic increases in catalyst lifetime, as much as tenfold.  Building on these successes, the goals of this Phase II project are development of an optimized process for preparation of this new catalyst system and the production of prototype commercial fuel cell power packs with this new catalyst system.  These prototype devices will be tested to demonstrate if the improvements shown in accelerated aging studies translate into longer lifetimes in commercial products.\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project complements the work reported by others in developing fuel cell catalyst systems with higher activity.  Fuel cell systems that combine catalysts with high activity and long lifetime lead to the best overall economics.  Fuel cell powered systems also have environmental advantages.  The use of fuel cells to generate power leads to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions if they replace systems powered by internal combustion engines.  Reductions in emissions as high as 25% have been achieved when fuel cell power supplies replace internal combustion powered systems.  The technology to be developed can be used in other applications where attack of a carbon substrate under oxidizing conditions leads to degradation which occurs not only in a variety of catalyst applications but also in electrodes for battery applications.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic tissue-destructive disease in which cellular inflammation and inflammatory cytokines ultimately lead to damage of the colonic mucosa. There is no effective cure, and while standard therapies can ameliorate symptoms in some patients, they are not effective in a significant number of patients and can also cause severe side effects. Consequently, new therapeutic approaches are needed to inhibit the inappropriate and exaggerated inflammatory response in UC patients. The new therapeutic target that this application will develop is based on the recent elucidation of the  inflammatory reflux  in which the nervous system through the vagus nerve regulates immune responses by release of acetylcholine which binds to macrophage 17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) resulting in inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production. The results of Phase I studies demonstrated proof of principle that the17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist (GTS-21) ameliorates disease symptoms and tissue damage in two mouse models of UC. The goal of this Phase II proposal is to further advance preclinical development of GTS-21. The drug will be evaluated in vivo for its ability to ameliorate development of disease symptoms and colon pathological changes in two models of murine colitis, which resemble human UC. Drugs will be tested alone and combined with conventional UC therapies at either the initiation of colitis or after the development of symptoms. Drug efficacy will be monitored by disease symptoms, histopathology of the colon, and production of inflammatory mediators. We will also prepare and test a formulation of GTS-21 designed for selective delivery to the colon after oral administration. These studies will provide the groundwork for preparation of an IND and future Phase 2 clinical trials. Because GTS-21 will inhibit production of multiple inflammatory cytokines (as shown in Phase I studies) known to be responsible, at least in part, for damage to colonic mucosa, this therapeutic approach should be more effective than other biological therapies that target only one cytokine. Ultimately this work will develop a new therapeutic option for UC patients that is based on a novel anti-inflammatory pathway. GTS-21 may be superior to current treatments and offer a new option for patients unresponsive to conventional therapies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop a new drug that will suppress production of multiple inflammatory cytokines for the therapy of patients with ulcerative colitis. It has the potential to benefit patients unresponsive to conventional therapies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The accurate and rapid transfer of fluids is an integral part of nearly every biochemical reaction, assay or diagnostic test. While fluid transfer technology using disposable polymer pipette tips is well developed for volumes above one microliter, manipulating the smaller volumes required for high throughput screening using syringe-solenoid, inkjet or acoustic dispensers is very expensive and slow. Using silicon micromachining techniques, our Phase I effort has produced a new silicon tool set that provides previously inaccessible transfer volumes over many orders of magnitude (from ~50 pL to 5 5L), a price far below competing technologies, very high accuracy and a transfer rate many times greater than any other fluid transfer technology. This new Fluid Transfer Pin (FTP) technology derives from the extremely high accuracy inherent in the micromachining technology used to prepare the silicon transfer pins and collimators which can align the pins to an accuracy of a few microns within the printhead. The key to the accuracy and dynamic range of the fluid volume transferred is the concept of the silicon  TwinPin  which was invented during the Phase I effort. The uptake volume is held between two silicon pins that are held exactly parallel to one another by the micromachined silicon collimators within the printhead. Altering the distance between the two flat parallel pin shafts by changing the silicon collimators varies the volume of fluid transferred between 50 pL and several 5L. Furthermore, unlike any other type of small volume fluid dispensing device, the TwinPins can perform both wet transfers (the imbibed sample is submersed into a liquid- filled destination microtiter plate well and the FTP's fluid allowed to diffuse into the well fluid) or dry transfers (touching a dry well bottom, in a fashion similar to microarray printing, with the pin tip to transfer a small droplet of liquid into the well). By virtue of the 384-element printhead, samples may be dispensed at a rate 15 times faster than an acoustic dispenser at lt 1/10th the cost. Furthermore, the use of the TwinPins to print protein and DNA microarrays allows for the first time to print any spot size between 505 and gt10005 by using the same pin set and simply changing the collimator. Since most protein microarrays arrays with spots larger than ~6005 are printed with solid pins, which require washing and refilling after the deposition of each spot, use of the TwinPins for the deposition of large spots will allow hundreds of spots to be deposited without revisiting the source plate thereby decreasing the time and cost for any microarray production. In the Phase II effort the FTP technology will be evaluated in the laboratories of Prof. Joseph DeRisi at UCSF and with Dr. John Coller, Director of the Stanford Functional Genomics Facility at Stanford University and their feedback incorporated into the final designs.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Silicon fluid transfer pin (FTP) tools represent a technological advance that enables access to accurate and rapid extremely-low-volume transfer at a very low cost as compared to current technologies that achieve the same result. This will allow for high- throughput research to advance at all industry and academic levels without the limitations of high cost of overly technical equipment that is often difficult to setup and use. In addition to performing accurate and precise nanoliter volume transfer, the function of silicon FTPs can be expanded by applying special coatings to the pin surface from which more complex biological operations can be performed.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A clear need exists for the development of advanced power ources and recharging options for implanted electro-medical devices. The useful lifetime of most implants is constrained by the longevity of the power source. When an implanted primary (non-rechargeable) battery has discharged to a predetermined threshold, surgery must be scheduled to replace the battery or the entire device, at considerable cost, patient distress, and about a 2% chance of infection. Implantable devices that might use rechargeable batteries include a growing variety of neurostimulators to counteract Parkinson's symptoms, for chemotherapy, to electrically stimulate the stomach, throat, urinary tract and other muscles, to deliver pain medication, and for implanted pressure and temperature sensors whose use will proliferate quickly. All of these applications place demands on electrical power within the body. A novel new method for recharging secondary batteries can overcome some of the difficulties of the present method, which includes MRI incompatibility. The wireless power transmission technology being developed is based on well known principles of ultrasound, which is know for its safety in diagnostic applications. The potential advantages include smaller transmitters and receivers, elimination of electromagnetic interference and heating of metal parts, and transmission of power to deeper sites in the body. The latter will drive new applications. Our principal goals and specific aims are to demonstrate its ultimate capabilities in vivo, facilitate more rapid recharging thus fostering patient compliance, comply with FDA safety regulations, and move the technology forward to the prototype stage, ready to be made into a useful product. We will do this by increasing its power delivery, showing that any temperature rise is kept within FDA guidelines, developing alignment and cooling techniques, and constructing small and inexpensive components. This technology will support the NIH mission, advancing its goals to improve human health and reduce health care costs by: 1) alleviating the distress, pain, and complications by reducing battery replacement operations, 2) increasing functionality of the implant by providing more power for diagnostic output or burst mode operation, 3) improving patient compliance, and 4) reducing the number of expensive operations that replace batteries and other components.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This new wireless recharging technique will result in increased longevity and capability of implanted batteries and will advance several public health goals by: 1) alleviating distress, pain, complications and cost by reducing the number of battery replacement operations, 2) increasing functionality of the implant by providing more power for diagnostic output or burst mode operation, 3) improving patient compliance.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With improvements in neonatal and reproductive medicine, greater numbers of premature neonates are surviving that require hospital and home cardiorespiratory monitoring. Investigators have developed a method for acquiring an infant's heart rate at the abdomen and back without the use of electrodes. This new method has been combined with a previously developed FDA 510K cleared wireless respiratory rate sensor. Both sensors have been integrated into a single belt, worn at the abdomen, and transmit cardiorespiratory data wirelessly to a bedside monitor. NIH Phase II development was followed by clinical trials in a clinical setting at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Children's National Medical Center and Yale University Children's hospital for reliability, safety, and general acceptability. This low cost, electrodeless, and wireless design could 1) replace aging monitoring equipment at Level I/II care nurseries, in the home, and in neonatal transport equipment at dramatically reduced costs; 2) introduce cardiorespiratory monitoring into areas of neonatal care where it was previously cost prohibitive; 3) improve ease and comfort by which infants, parents, and caregivers interact; and 4) improve compliance in the in home setting as well as reduce incidence of false alarms due to elimination of shifting electrodes. Continuing objectives of this competing grant are to obtain FDA 510K clearance on the combined wireless monitor by multicenter clinical studies and to IP enable the wireless monitor so as to seamlessly monitor patients remotely on secure Web sites. The final form factor and user interface will also be designed and optimized. The wireless and disposable features of this technology define this as a value-added product that should appeal to innovative companies desirous of increased sales, market share and profitability while simultaneously lowering health care costs via offering inexpensive, easy to use non- invasive infant monitoring.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Providing a low-cost wireless cardio respiratory monitor that uses no electrodes such as the one proposed could have far reaching effects in the overall delivery of health care quality and cost when monitoring infants in the NICU as well as step down, lower level care units and in home monitoring settings. The ease of application and lack of wires will increase compliance with in home monitoring protocols as well as allow for better bonding of parents in and out of hospital settings.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Improvements in the safety and efficacy of warfarin therapy will result from intelligent application of knowledge derived from inherited characteristics (CYP2C9 and VKORC1) of individual patients, only when this knowledge is applied through a standardized interventional approach. The fundamental pharmacologic influences of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 have been unequivocally established and validated by numerous academic reports including those conducted by PGXL and its affiliated thought leaders. There is a clear cause and effect relationship between inherited variation in these enzymes and complications in warfarin management. Delayed metabolic clearance of S-warfarin (CYP2C9) and a lower concentration threshold for response (VKORC1) have a profound effect on the clinical pharmacology of warfarin and defeat the utility of standard dosing and monitoring practices. Current warfarin dosing practices, which rely on standardized initiation dosing and INR-based dose adjustments, are fundamentally flawed when applied to patients without regard to their unique metabolic and response characteristics. PGXL has developed a personalized medicine interface (PerMIT) which provides interpretive, genotype-based guidance to facilitate appropriate clinical practice modifications accommodating patient individuality. PerMIT:Warfarin is the first HIPAA-compliant and secure pharmacogenetics-based interventional methodology for warfarin anticoagulation management. PerMIT:Warfarin applies fundamental pharmacologic influences of inherited patient characteristics to individually tailor warfarin therapy. The mathematical operations that form the basis of PerMIT have been validated for accuracy, and PGXL is now prepared for prospective interventional trials. PGXL Laboratories has engaged all of the key external resources necessary to construct a comprehensive strategic framework to gather compelling clinical evidence of improved outcomes and to move PerMIT:Warfarin through the regulatory and commercialization processes. This SBIR Phase II Competitive Renewal application is designed to achieve the regulatory compliance and medical evidentiary standards set forth by federal regulatory bodies and the demands of the marketplace.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Individualised therapeutic management based on pharmacogenetic information requires a standardized interventional approach. PerMIT:Warfarin is the first pharmacogenetics-based interventional methodology for warfarin anticoagulation management.

The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has established a standard for warfarin pharmacogenetics reimbursement, calling for multi-site randomized controlled trials to assess the benefit of pharmacogenetics to warfarin therapeutic management. This SBIR Phase II Competitive Renewal application is designed to achieve the regulatory compliance and medical evidentiary standards set forth by these regulatory bodies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application pertains to the development of Medication for Hepatic Fibrosis. Established cirrhosis has a 10-year mortality of 34-66%, largely dependent on the cause of the cirrhosis; alcoholic cirrhosis has a worse prognosis than primary biliary cirrhosis and cirrhosis due to hepatitis. This application will be of interest to National institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Cirrhosis is long-term liver damage from the buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) caused by infections, alcohol, excess fat, bile obstruction, and iron or cupper overload. Approximately 400,000 Americans suffer from liver cirrhosis. Cirrhosis affects millions of patients worldwide and remains an unresolved challenge for clinicians. Given the morbidity/mortality associated with this disease, there is an urgent need for translation of emerging anti-fibrotic molecules into effective therapies. Expediting clinical trials for compounds that have successfully undergone preclinical studies has the potential to make much needed medications available and reduce the need for liver transplantations. The scarring process in liver cirrhosis is mediated by Transforming Growth Factor 2 (TGF2) which is the most powerful fibrotic agent. Many known blockers of TGF2 are mostly peptides and proteins which cannot be easily developed onto drugs due to rapid degradation and kidney elimination once it reaches the blood stream. In this application, we propose to formulate three known TGF2 blocker peptides using advanced affinity-based nanocarrier technology. This will prevent rapid degradation and elimination and will maintain relatively constant concentration of active anti-fibrotic peptides in the blood, thus facilitating the transition of these peptide drugs from pre-clinical to clinical setting. We will synthesize nanocarriers appropriate for each of the anti-fibrotic peptides and we will determine affinity (1/Kd, where Kd is the dissociation constant) of the peptide for these nanocarriers. We will then formulate these peptides with appropriate nanocarriers and evaluate the in vivo pharmacokinetics in rats. Finally we will test the efficacy of formulated peptides in animal models of liver fibrosis.

The key element of the assay is the MTP, a monolithic 500 W 500 lt m integrated circuit chip that can transmit its identification code at a radio frequency (RF). Each chip consists of photocells, read-only memory (ROM), transmit logic circuitry, and an integrated antenna which, when illuminated, transmit an ID through a varying magnetic field. In an assay, the chips are derivatized with a molecular probe capable of binding to an analyte of interest that can be fluorescently labeled. The chips are read in a high speed, fluidic -based analyzer. The analyzer decodes the MTP ID and measures the fluorescence intensity on the surface to index and report information about molecular interactions in the assay. Increased metal-enhanced fluorescence is a phenomenon based on light-induced plasmon formation in the metal, often silver, and transmission of this energy through fluorescence. During the course of the project, we will coat MTPs with different types of sliver nanostructures, quantitate and characterize fluorescence enhancement on the surface of the MTP. In addition, the analyzer will be improved to measure very low fluorescence levels. One of the goals of the project is to develop a protein-based, multiplex assay to detect urine biomarkers for prostate cancer (PCa). The selected biomarkers are AMACR (a racemase), endoglin, annexin A3 and cytokine IL-6. The biomarkers were chosen because of their unique expression profile in PCa patient samples versus those in healthy controls. The multiplex MTP assay involves the following steps: (a) conjugation of capture antibodies to silver nanostructure coated microtransponders, (b) deposition of the targeted antigen specimen source, (c) detection using the corresponding number of biotinylated antibodies and a reagent for visualization. We will design and develop the assay, as well as standardize the assay performance against the biomarker controls. Assay procedures will be optimized using individual ELISA antigen-antibody assays configured and optimized before an MTP biomarker assay is performed. In order to analyze the data from the analyzer, we will modify existing hardware and software.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed system for an ultra-sensitive assay provides a new tool for performing several tests at once. The system is applicable to cancer diagnostics and other medical ailments providing a more powerful, simpler to use and less costly approach. An assay will be developed to diagnose prostate cancer by testing urine in an non-invasive way at early phases of the disease. The assay has a potential to also improve PCa disease management. Acceptance of nanotechnology-based multiplex assays on microtransponders by researchers and clinicians could initiate new methods in disease diagnosis and treatment, drug discovery, and biological or environmental research.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the present project is to develop a new type of RFID tagging system for tracking mice. It is based on the PharmaSeq laser light-activated microtransponder, also known as  p-Chip . Its major advantages are its small size (500 5m x 500 5m x 100 5m), monolithic (one part) design, inertness (silicon-based), ease of use and very low cost. No anesthetization of the mice is required. The system consists of the tag itself, the tag reader, and an injector for p-Chips. The p-Chips are rapidly implanted in a mouse's tail just under the skin. To identify the animal, the operator simply brings a reader to within the immediate proximity of the implanted p-Chip and the ID is acquired automatically and transmitted to the a computer. The software further associates the ID of a particular mouse with data related to its role in experimental procedures and/or breeding history. The main goals of the project are to: (1) make several improvements to the injector regarding the ease of use, and fabricate a larger number of units; (2) conduct animal studies including biocompatibility in immunocompetent as well as immunosuppressed strains of mice; (3) modify the existing p-Chip/ID reader system, including the digital board and software; and (4) redesign of p-Chip/receiver system to work at higher frequencies (315 MHz). The system will be thoroughly tested in-house and in collaboration with outside laboratories. Tagging with p-Chips will improve the reliability of tracking of experimental subjects by preventing costly errors including rework due do unreadable markings and lost labels.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Laboratory mice play a powerful role in basic research and a key role in mammalian genetic and biomedical research. They are universally accepted as the primary model for analyzing and understanding inherited human disorders. The new PharmaSeq system has the potential to greatly increase the use of RFID tags in laboratory mice, or even to lead to the general adoption of this new technology as a universal tagging system that can track animals from breeding through their entire useful lifetime.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm births are responsible for 75% of neonatal mortality and one-half of long-term neurological impairments in children as well as a substantial portion of all birth-related short- and long-term morbidity. In the United States, about 12.8 percent of babies (more than 500,000 per year) are born prematurely. The rate of premature birth has increased by 36 percent since the early 1980s. Rates of low birth weight babies are higher in medically underserved and minority populations-even when issues such as access and insurance coverage are accounted for. Preterm births account for 30% of all health care spending on infants and 10% of spending for children. Societal costs in the US are estimated at  26 billion annually. Although most preterm births occur in women who do not have any of the few known risk factors for preterm birth some women are clearly at greater risk than others. Researchers have identified some modifiable lifestyle risk factors and medical conditions associated with preterm births that can be addressed during pregnancy. Timely screening and management of modifiable risks and evidence-based care can potentially reduce risks for preterm labor. Yet providing effective prenatal risk management systems in a clinical setting to meet the unique needs of medically underserved women is complex. Timely screening and management of modifiable conditions can reduce preterm births and improve maternal and child quality of life. However, providing effective prenatal risk management systems to meet the unique needs of medically underserved populations is complex. The goal of this proposal is to test the efficacy of a clinic-based, computer-assisted intervention system to reduce preterm births in high-risk, underserved populations. This system will: (1) assess a pregnant woman's unique risks in six modifiable areas associated with increased risks of preterm birth including smoking cessation, poor nutrition, domestic violence, maternal depression and stress, urinary and reproductive tract infections and substance use; (2) provide her with tailored advice on reducing her risks; (3) provide counseling suggestions and action planning tools for that woman's physician or certified nurse midwife specifically tailored for the patient's needs; and [(4) encourage referrals from the clinic as well as follow-up to ensure that she is successful in utilizing services from community-based organizations to help with complex problems such as domestic violence and substance use/abuse-when they exist.] In this proposed program, we will test the ability of the system to (1) reduce rates of births less than 37 weeks and birth weights less than 2500 grams; and (2) change behaviors that can reduce risks using a balanced prospective randomized controlled multi-site trial with 452 patients during prenatal care clinic visits beginning during the 1st trimester. This proposal would build on a successful Phase I study where we assessed the acceptability and feasibility of this system with patients and their physician and/or certified nurse midwife.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Preterm births account for 30% of all health care spending on infants and 10% of spending for children. The preterm birth rate has risen 36% since the early 1980s. Timely screening and management of modifiable conditions can reduce preterm births, yet providing effective prenatal risk management systems to meet the unique needs of medically underserved populations is complex. If the proposed system proves to be effective in reducing preterm births it can improve maternal and child quality of life as well as reduce the economic burden of preterm births in the U.S.",

In addition, this improvement will result in the utilization of significantly more high-purity germanium crystals for detector fabrication. The DOE operates user facilities for Nuclear Physics research that require such detectors for gamma-ray measurements.  New viable semiconductor-detector contacts were experimentally developed during Phase I.  These contacts will be further refined and adapted for use on full sized detectors for Nuclear Physics research during Phase II. To accomplish these goals, numerous germanium detectors will be fabricated and tested.  A new version of the NPX detector product line based on this technology will become available, in modest quantities, by the end of Phase II. Several new germanium-detector contacts were fabricated and tested. One particular contact experimentally demonstrated the essential physical properties needed to be an extremely useful segmented germanium-detector contact.  The contact technology will be fine-tuned and evolved to become amenable to full-sized NPX segmented germanium-detector fabrication.  This new contact will be the basis for a new product line to become available by the end of the Phase II.  The physical mechanisms of the contact will be studied to gain a better fundamental understanding.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Better germanium detector contacts will enable these detector systems to enter new realms of sensitivity and commercial viability.  These systems will have immediate applications in research taking place at DOE user facilities including work in Nuclear Physics, positron-annihilation spectroscopy, astrophysics, and rare-particle detection.  Moreover, these detector systems will enable germanium detectors to enter commercially active fields currently unoccupied by germanium detectors.  The most important of these fields is nuclear medicine.  Unlike many other position-sensitive gamma-ray detector technologies, germanium-detector technology is scalable to larger sizes and can be manufactured in mass. All technical steps of manufacture, including crystal growth detector fabrication, and system integration will remain viable in the United States for the foreseeable future.  The process will always require an environment including the presence of scientists, engineers, technicians, and close association with research scientists at DOE laboratories. All the work supported by this SBIR will be performed by PHDs Co. in Oak Ridge; TN. PHDs Co. is a 100% domestic corporation.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Previous work has identified a subgroup of chronic alcoholism subjects with severe, generalized cognitive impairment and a very poor outcome. What is critically lacking are brain molecular biomarkers that antedate both the cognitive impairment and the earliest, most minimal brain structural changes. Given the increased morbidity associated with cognitive impairment in chronic alcoholism subjects, further insights into the molecular basis for the cognitive changes are essential and could lead to future therapeutic and preventative measures as well as the ability to monitor neuromolecular responses to those therapeutic measures. The purpose of Phase I of the present SBIR Phase I/Phase II Fast Track application is to analyze existing NIH-funded multi-voxel 31P and 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging data sets to refine brain molecular biomarkers for neural membrane degeneration demonstrated in our STTR Phase I application. The STTR Phase I data strongly suggests it is the brain membrane phospholipid degeneration in the absence of adequate repair that results in cognitive impairment in chronic alcoholism. The neuromolecular biomarkers will reflect molecular changes that antecede brain structural changes observed by quantitative MRI-based neuromorphometrics and will predict which subjects with chronic alcoholism are at increased risk to develop cognitive impairment. Phase II of this proposal will focus on developing a software package in partnership with SterlingTech Software for analyses of MRSI data obtained from individual subjects to be compared to a normative basis set, analyze the data for abnormalities found in comparison with the normative basis set, and display changes in the individual subject. The proposed approach is unique because it directly and non-invasively measures critical aspects of brain molecular composition and metabolism in living subjects, specifically: 1) key aspects of membrane phospholipid metabolism; 2) utilization of high-energy phosphates; 3) dynamic aspects of protein phosphorylation - dephosphorylation; 4) the number of brain synaptic and transport vesicles; 5) key intermediates in the glycosylation of lipids and proteins; and 6) a marker of neuronal integrity. Since cognitive deficits are present in other neuropsychiatric disorders, for example chronic schizophrenia, a comparison of molecular measures associated with cognitive impairment in chronic schizophrenia with those of chronic alcoholism will help to establish the specificity of the biomarker for cognitive impairment in alcoholism. Brain molecular biomarkers which could distinguish molecular findings associated with cognitive impairment in chronic alcoholism from that observed in other neuropsychiatric disorders would be of great theoretical and practical clinical importance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Brain molecular biomarkers such as proposed in this application could be used to guide further understanding of the molecular underpinnings of cognitive impairment in chronic alcoholism This will enhance future therapeutic and preventative approaches designed to repair or prevent neural membrane damage observed in alcoholism. The molecular biomarkers will be used to develop a software package in partnership with SterlingTech Software that will analyze individual 31P and 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging data and produce a color-coded brain image showing how that subject compares to a control population. The software package will be commercialized and marketed to corporations (primarily MR manufacturers), institutions, and individuals worldwide.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop a for point-of-care (POC) nucleic acid assay for STD (sexually transmitted diseases) diagnostics using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS).  Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) infections are two of the most common sexually transmitted diseases worldwide. The company proposes to develop a multiplex assay and testing platform for the direct detection of CT and GC rRNA using EIS-based assays and a sensor array.  In a final product for clinical settings, collected sample (e.g., swab or urine) will be processed on-cartridge, with all cartridges provided in a sealed, RNase-free package. \nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will address the unmet market needs for a rapid and cost-effective nucleic acid based POC system to diagnose individuals with infectious disease-causing agents or toxins in nontraditional health care settings. Often persons who present to a clinic for STD testing never return to the clinic to receive their STD test result.  Thus, the availability of a POC test that can immediately provide results at the clinic is highly desirable.  Current POC tests lack sensitivity, which may lead to high false negative as well as false positive results. The company proposes to develop an inexpensive, highly sensitive, easy-to-use POC STD device to address this compelling market need.  In addition, the EIS-based biosensor system could be adapted for the POC detection of other infectious diseases.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The consequences of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and related dementia are devastating not only for dementia patients, but also for family caregivers (estimated at 8.9 million), who are considered the hidden patients, and are at high risk for depressive symptoms and syndromes related to the stress and difficulties of dementia caregiving. Efficient, low-cost and accessible interventions are needed to cope with dementia caregiving, particularly stress management. The goals of our Fast Track Phase I/Phase II project are: (1) to enhance the quality of life and reduce the caregiving stress of dementia family caregivers with a new psychotherapy intervention (iCare eTraining); and (2) to develop the iCare stress management eTraining in low-cost and accessible methods (DVD and Internet) for deployment to millions of families who need it. The novel iCare incorporates: (a) integration of content from our caregiving studies with different ethnic groups; (b) adaptation of our psychotherapy curriculum, based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), for video and Internet modalities; and (c) creative use of DVD, online video, and web technology. The result is an innovative psychotherapy intervention to treat dementia caregiver stress with more effective and powerful features: engaging methods (DVD and online video); tools to encourage supportive interactions with professionals and other caregivers; enhanced communication; methods to gather and distribute collective knowledge on coping with caregiving; and other supportive tools. Related clinical advantages are: encourage training participation, enable user interaction, and promote better assimilation of concepts; which should enhance caregivers' skills to deal with demanding tasks of caregiving (ultimately leading to alleviate stress and improve quality of life). The basis for the iCare curriculum was developed in many evidence-based procedures by Dr. Gallagher-Thompson, Dr. Thompson, and associates, resulting in a successful  Coping with Caregiving   class series (CWC), evaluated in several randomized clinical trials, e.g. a component of NIH-funded multi-site national research project  Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health  (REACH; Belle et al., 2006; Schulz et al., 2003), which demonstrated that CWC trainings reduced stress for caregivers from diverse communities. The psychotherapy aspect of iCare refers to  psychological techniques designed to encourage insight into problems for personal growth and behavior modification  (oriented by eTraining), rather than treatment by therapist (not feasible for broad deployment due to costs). The pedagogical format of iCare is a combination of DVD/online video training and use of supplemental materials that build skills and stimulate practice. In collaboration with the Alzheimer's Association, Family Caregiver Alliance, and other organizations, we will develop and evaluate iCare (targeting general caregiver population), with an expert Advisory Board (for scientific review) and family caregivers (for consumer input). We will assess the iCare effectiveness in improving the well-being and decreasing the stress of caregivers with a randomized clinical trial (Phase II). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A growing number of dementia family caregivers (estimated at 8.9 million; Family Caregiver Alliance, 2007) are at high risk for depressive symptoms and syndromes related to the stress and difficulties of caregiving for individuals with Alzheimer' Disease (AD) and related dementia (Pinquart and Sorensen, 2007; Schulz et al., 2000; Hooker et. al., 2000; Ory et al., 1999; Schulz and Beach, 1999; Schulz et. al, 1995; Gallagher et al., 1989). The annual national costs of caring for Alzheimer's are estimated at  148 billion in medical costs, living costs, and lost productivity; and family caregivers provide 8.5 billion hours of care annually, valued at almost  83 billion dollars (Alzheimer's Association, 2007), saving American taxpayers considerable money (e.g. even more than a decade ago, caring for Alzheimer's patients at home rather than in nursing home facilities was estimated to save American taxpayers  33.3 billion per year; Ernst and Hay, 1994). The expected outcomes of the iCare project are the following: (1) provide empirically validated effective training to manage the stress and cope better with dementia caregiving in a cost-effective and accessible manner; (2) promote the well-being of a growing number of dementia family caregivers who experience several negative symptoms; and (3) decrease the stress and burden of care for family caregivers of patients with dementia; in addition, we expect the following potential indirect outcomes (not measured by this study): (a) delay institutionalization of AD patients (as family members are expected to bear the duties of caring for a longer period of time as a result of decreased burden and reduced stress); (b) decrease caregiver medication use and associated side effects (as less depression problems and better mood of caregivers are expected by the regular application of the iCare concepts); and (c) lower the economic cost associated with AD, by decreasing, as noted above, caregiver burden, delaying institutionalization, reducing medication use, and promoting the general well-being of caregivers.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Three-dimensional (3D) imaging and visualization are indispensable in many sectors of the biomedical field. Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a unique high-resolution, full-color liquid crystal (LC) flat-panel 3D display that is superior to existing devices, and will enable doctors, biomedical researchers, clinicians, theorists, and surgeons to collaboratively view high-quality, full-color 3D images of biological materials with location-specific correct perspectives and without having to wear special glasses or head trackers. The low-cost display features high screen brightness and resolution, and is compact, with no bulky optics. It does not require any special preprocessing or formatting of image data, and can work with standard 3D graphic software and interactive computer systems or with real-time multivideo equipment. Furthermore, it has no intermediate components such as lenticular screens, slit arrays, goggles, or glasses to degrade natural 3D perception of the human vision system. The proposed approach integrates a special two-angle switching collimated backlight, a high resolution, LC flat-panel display with spatially multiplexed waveguide holograms in a multiperspective autostereo 3D display whose wide-area screen functions as multiple 2D display screens. In Phase I, POC designed and constructed a proof-of-concept four-view prototype system using a standard size (800x600 pixels) LCD and fabricated four-view multiplexed waveguide holograms. The prototype was successfully demonstrated by projecting full-color half-resolution (400x300 pixels) perspective images of several 3D objects. Phase II will produce a full-resolution (1280x1024 pixels or larger) eight-perspective view, large-area commercializable prototype system that will be tested with biomedical 3D image data. This real- time, full-color, low-cost multiperspective holographic autostereo LC 3D display system will find a wide range of commercial applications: medical imaging; educational training and simulation; virtual-reality environments; scientific simulation and modeling; industrial inspection; CAD for manufacturing; space exploration; telerobotics; photogrammetry; and 3D video and cinema.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed holographic automultiscopic, large-screen, high-resolution liquid-crystal 3D display with a natural look-around capability will significantly improve 3D visualization of biomedical images to biomedical researchers, doctors, and surgeons. This unique capability will aid in screening diagnostics and treatment planning without requiring special user eyewear, significantly reducing the time, cumbersomness, and cost of surgical procedures.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To improve the probability of earlier breast cancer detection while reducing the number of unnecessary needle biopsies, Physical Optics Corporation proposes to develop a new Fast Acousto-Optic Tomography System (FAOTS) as an auxiliary tool for the conventional ultrasound breast examination that often follows a screening mammography. The innovative FAOTS will provide images with better contrast than sonography, because the optical properties of normal tissue and tissue with neoplasia differ much more than their acoustic properties. FAOTS will use a tightly focused ultrasound beam to shift the frequency of photons at a certain location in a tissue and detect them using a heterodyne technique utilizing a parallel signal acquisition by multiple photodetectors on a fast CMOS chip. The utilization of a high-speed (gt4000 fps) CMOS camera with a large memory capacity enables signal detection in a short time interval, so speckle decorrelation in the live tissue will not affect system operation. In Phase I, POC experimentally demonstrated the capability of the laboratory prototype of obtaining high contrast signals with a speed exceeding the speckle decorrelation time. In Phase II, POC will design and fabricate an engineering FAOTS prototype and conduct a demonstration of its capability of mapping the optical properties of patient breast tissue at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, California. The fully developed FAOTS will provide a spatial resolution of ~0.4 mm, which is significantly better than Optical Diffuse Tomography (ODT). The FAOTS technology will enable positive predictive value (PPV) improvement in breast cancer diagnostics, with earlier detection of smaller tumors, thus enhancing patients' chances for long-time survival after cancer treatment. The successful demonstration of the FAOTS technology for mapping the optical properties of breast tissue will broaden the perspective for the extension of the FAOTS technology using multiple light wavelengths for improving image contrast. It will also facilitate development of special instrumentation for mapping the optical properties of other internal organs, and better diagnostics of tumors in these organs (e.g., prostate).",

        "abstract": "The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking development of seismic sensors, under its Geothermal Technologies Program, to support the subsurface monitoring of geothermal reservoirs during reservoir stimulation and operation.  It is anticipated that these sensors will respond within the frequency range from sub-Hz to multi-kHz, be compatible with packaging for downhole deployment, including the capability to operate within the temperature range from -20oC to +250oC, and having an expected operating lifetime of 5000 hr.  Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes an innovative Fiber Optic High Temperature Seismic Sensor (FOTSS) technology based on a microbending sensor design using multimode fibers, which is stable at elevated temperatures.  Using optical time domain reflectrometry with a diode laser for interrogation, and digital signal processing, the sensor provides sensitivity over a wide frequency range (sub-Hz to multi-kHz).  In Phase I POC successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the FOTSS approach through computer simulations, developing and demonstrating a working prototype based on a series of proof-of-concept experiments and tests.  POC demonstrated that the FOTTS Phase I prototype has sensitivity down to sub-mg levels with a bandwidth of 1400 Hz and high temperature resistance up to +250oC.  The results of the testing were in good agreement with the simulation and modeling results.  In Phase II POC plans to further develop the FOTSS system. POC will bring to maturity the FOTSS technology proven feasible in Phase I, and build a full-scale prototype FOTSS system for geothermal energy source monitoring directly applicable to DOE tasks.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The proposed sensor addresses the major DOE requirements for high-temperature endurance (250oC for 5000 hr), wide (several kHz) bandwidth, seismic sensor solution. High-temperature-resistant, permanent downhole sensor technologies support the expansion of geothermal energy by improving safety and enabling the development of new techniques to identify and monitor geothermal resources. In addition to geothermal well monitoring, commercial applications include deep oil and gas well seismic profiling for exploration and monitoring, environmental monitoring, and vibration measurements in high-temperature environments (e.g., engines, motors, rockets, and wind turbines).

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Distraction Osteogenesis is becoming the preferred method to obtain the skeletal expansion necessary to correct congenital and acquired craniomaxillofacial deformities. The procedure consists of an osteotomy at the expansion site and a mechanical device to separate the resulting segments at 1mm/day. Natural osteogenic processes produce new bone to fill the expanding gap. The mandible is often expanded more than 30mm. The mechanical devices used for distracting the mandible have an actuation screw whose end protrudes through the skin or into the mouth. Patients or their caretakers are charged with turning the screw 2-4 times daily. Automating the process will reduce complications associated with poor compliance with the treatment requirements, and continuous motion is known to produce new bone at twice the distraction rate as twice-daily discrete adjustments. These advantages will improve outcomes and reduce the time a device must be implanted. This proposal requests a FastTrack SBIR grant to complete development of a continuous, automated distractor for the mandible. The device uses hydraulic actuation and microprocessor-based closed-loop position control to perform the distraction and can accurately distract along both linear and curvilinear trajectories. No other automated distracters tested to date have these features. Key components include the implanted actuator, a controller that the patient wears externally, and a user interface used by the clinician to monitor and adjust the treatment. Preliminary animal trials showed feasibility of the concept in Yucatan minipigs (n=5). The work proposed here will complete technology development by engineering components that are sufficiently rugged for clinical use and end with a device ready for human trials and product development. Phase I entails developing and demonstrating a position sensor that will function reliably in vivo. Phase II will consist of detailed engineering of the clinician's user interface and engineering a rugged external control unit, and then testing the device in Yucatan minipigs (n=15). The tests will include demonstration of the new device at the rates used with discrete devices, as well as tests at a higher rate to quantify the advantages of continuous distraction. The proposing team is led by Physical Sciences Inc., and includes surgeons in the Department of Oral/Maxillofacial Surgery at the Massachusetts General Hospital and electronic engineers at Embedded Systems Design. The proposal also contains a financial analysis showing expected cost savings achieved through automation, projected revenues, and required investments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Distraction Osteogenesis is a technique for correcting bone deformities by tapping the body's natural bone- healing functions. It has many advantages over bone grafting to lengthen bone, but current distractors are still plagued by user problems that complicate treatment and sometimes hinder its success. The automated device proposed here will improve outcomes by eliminating patient responsibility, and it will use the biological benefits of continuous motion to reduce the time a device is implanted.",

Physical Sciences Inc., is leading the development of the product with support from our clinical partners in the Dept of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Massachusetts General Hospital and image-guided surgery experts in the Surgical Planning Laboratory at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The device can be used in both endoscopic and open procedures to transfer treatment plans from computer-based 3D surgical planning tools onto the bone. The system will provide for intraoperative registration of the image to the patient, with no requirement for fiducial markers in the pre-operative images and no fixation frame attached to the head. The surgeon will mark the bone for ostotomies, screw holes, and alignment, and then complete the procedure using instruments without any tracking, using the marks to guide the modification of bone. The proposed device will be less expensive and less complex than a system that tracks the motion of multiple surgical instruments as procedures are performed. OsteoMark is being developed to interact with the open-source medical imaging software Slicer/Osteoplan, though integration with an FDA-approved commercial program is planned for late in Phase II. In Phase I, we demonstrated the ability to transfer treatment plans to the mandible in endoscopic surgery on a pig cadaver. In Phase II, we will refine the system components and algorithms, carry out several operations on cadavers, and then perform tests on live minipigs.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Minimally-invasive surgery is becoming more widely used in reconstruction of bones in the face because it results in faster recovery times, less pain and discomfort, and less scarring than open procedures. Another recent advancement has been the use of computer graphics tools to plan complex reconstruction operations.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) has successfully completed a Phase I program to develop a multimodal adaptive optics (AO) retinal imager for diagnosis of retinal diseases, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The development represents the first ever high performance AO system constructed that combines AO- corrected scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) and swept source Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (SSOCT) imaging modes in a single compact clinical prototype platform. The SSOCT channel operates at a wavelength of 1 5m for increased penetration and visualization of the choriocapillaris and choroid, sites of major disease activity for DR and wet AMD. The system is designed to operate on a broad clinical population with a dual deformable mirror (DM) configuration that allows simultaneous low- and high- order aberration correction. The system also includes a wide field line scanning ophthalmoscope (LSO) for initial screening, target identification, and global orientation; an integrated retinal tracker (RT) to stabilize the SLO, OCT, and LSO imaging fields in the presence of rotational eye motion; and a high-resolution LCD-based fixation target for presentation to the subject of stimuli and other visual cues. The system was tested in a limited number of human subjects without retinal disease for performance optimization and validation. The system was able to resolve and quantify cone photoreceptors across the macula to within ~0.5 deg (~100-150 5m) of the fovea, image and delineate ten retinal layers, and penetrate to resolve targets deep into the choroid. In addition to instrument hardware development, analysis algorithms were developed for efficient information extraction from clinical imaging sessions, with functionality including automated image registration, photoreceptor counting, strip and montage stitching, and segmentation.  In collaboration with ophthalmologists and researchers at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) Eye Center, we propose to continue instrument development and full clinical testing in Phase II. The multimodal AO instrument will be refined and enhanced for clinical operation, including upgrades of the retinal tracker and synchronization hardware. In addition, we will outfit the instrument with a piezo-driven reference mirror for measurement of power Doppler signals from fine retinal capillaries. The system will be installed at UPMC for a two-stage clinical trial including initial validation in subjects without retinal disease and tests in subjects with glaucoma, DR, AMD, and RP. The study will demonstrate that the multimodal AO system provides structural and flow information not currently available from any other commercially- available imager. If successful, the Phase II program and subsequent Phase III commercial development will provide clinicians with high-resolution, high performance adaptive optics imaging to help guide therapies, develop new drugs, and improve patient outcomes.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By making high-resolution ocular access more widespread, the proposed high performance multimodal AO instrument will bring adaptive optics technology into use by a greater number of clinicians and scientists. These researchers will, in turn, use this tool to increase our understanding of vision and its disruption by disease and to measure tissue effects of new drugs and therapies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) has successfully completed a Phase I program demonstrating the feasibility of integrating adaptive optics (AO) into a line scanning laser ophthalmoscope (LSLO). The bench-top AO-LSLO instrument significantly reduces the size, complexity, and cost of research AOSLOs, for the purpose of moving adaptive optics imaging more quickly into routine clinical use. The AO-LSLO produces high resolution retinal images with only one moving part and a significantly reduced instrument footprint and number of optical components. The AO-LSLO has a moderate field of view (5.5 deg), which allows montages of the macula or other targets to be obtained more quickly and efficiently. In a preliminary human subjects investigation, photoreceptors could be resolved and counted to within ~0.5 mm of the fovea. Photoreceptor counts matched closely to previously reported histology. The capillaries surrounding the foveal avascular zone could be resolved, as well as cells flowing within them. Individual nerve fiber bundles could be resolved, especially near the optic nerve head, as well as other structures such as the lamina cribrosa. In addition to instrument design, fabrication, and testing, software algorithms were developed for automated image registration, cone counting, and montage stitching.  In collaboration with ophthalmologists at Duke University Eye Center, we propose to continue instrument development and full clinical testing in Phase II. The AO-LSLO instrument will be refined and enhanced for clinical operation, including re-design of the optical layout for a smaller footprint, opto- mechanical design of a clinical package, modification of scanning hardware for automatic montaging, and upgrade of some components for improved performance. In addition, we will explore further reduction of hardware complexity with the implementation of wave front sensorless algorithms. The pilot clinical study at Duke will be conducted in three stages. The first stage will accomplish preliminary testing in a clinical environment. The second stage will include a repeatability study, image several different retinal diseases (Stargardt's, retinitis pigmentosa, etc.), and compare the AO-LSLO to other imaging modalities currently in routine clinical use. The third stage will explore the instrument's capabilities to image photoreceptors in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) at the margin of sites of geographic atrophy (GA) and in diabetic macula edema at sites of previous laser treatment. In particular we will characterize and quantify photoreceptor loss across these sites of disease or laser treatment and other inner retinal components. This study will determine if the AO-LSLO provides complementary information not currently available from other imaging modes. If successful, the Phase II program and subsequent Phase III commercial development will provide clinicians with high-resolution, high performance adaptive optics imaging at a cost comparable to other retinal imagers to help guide therapies and improve patient outcomes.

The innovative architecture is based on nonlinear Kalman Filter data fusion with multiple dynamical models with compensation for ship platform errors, and a parallelized multiple hypothesis tracking/association methodology (MHT). The key result of the effort will be demonstration of the improved track quality (including probability of establishing track following cue, time to firm track, track error, and track purity in a cluttered/multitarget situation) for a BMD engagement in the ascent or midcourse of flight, including a raid scenario, using realistic models for ship motion and clock errors and in-service radar waveforms and signal processing tools. The effects of system constraints (finite communication bandwidth for resource management and co-registration of radar platforms) will be tested and compared using a software simulator of the multistatic architecture. The planned effort will integrate the algorithms and software developed during the Phase I with new developments (error compensation and MHT), and enable detailed (I/Q level) simulation of multistatic radar returns. To enable and implement the intensive processing needed for key functions and algorithms, a high performance computing solution using COTS equipment will be implemented.",

        "abstract": "Assessment of CO2 exchange between the atmosphere and the biosphere remains one of the largest uncertainties in predicting carbon sequestration by vegetative uptake on a global basis.  Distinguishing between photosynthetic uptake and respiratory emission of CO2 is difficult, due to the small differences between two large parameters, but crucial for determining net ecosystem exchange for CO2 between the atmosphere and the biosphere.  Carbonyl sulfide (COS) is a surrogate for CO2 uptake by plants during photosynthesis, but COS is not emitted from plants during respiration.  COS measurements may be used to provide unique constraints on carbon assimilation by the biosphere that are independent of the influence of respiration.  This proposal would develop a highly precise and portable instrument for absolute COS measurements based on newly available continuous wave mid-infrared quantum cascade lasers (QCL).  The instrument, with a precision for COS of 1 part-per-trillion (ppt) with 100 s averaging time, would provide continuous measurements of COS both at ground level monitoring sites and from aircraft platforms in order to address the global distribution of COS sources and sinks.  A newly acquired QCL was used in a pre-existing laboratory spectrometer to demonstrate detection sensitivity for COS of 5 ppt with 1 s averaging time and 1 ppt in 100 s.  The system operated continuously for a period of 5 months sampling roof top ambient air from December to May.  Gradual variations in COS due with wind trajectories in the winter contrasted to sharp daily variations due to uptake by soil vegetation with the onset of spring.  This data set uniquely demonstrates the power of continuous monitoring for assessing carbon uptake cycles in the biosphere. We will develop detailed optical, thermal, electronic and spectroscopic designs for a Phase II prototype instrument.  We will build two versions of the resulting instrument to demonstrate the capabilities both for long term unattended deployments at a local forest research site, and the potential for global COS measurements from aircraft platforms.  The instrument will be rigorously tested against existing measurement techniques.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The proposed instrument will provide the capability to measure atmospheric abundances of COS in real time in order to better asses CO2 uptake by vegetation.  Improved understanding of CO2 uptake will improve our understanding of global warming and help mitigate global climate change.  There is a worldwide market for such measurement systems in the environmental and ecological research communities.  Potentially larger markets exist in the medical research community where COS measurements in exhaled breath can be used to diagnose cystic fibrosis, liver disease, and lung transplant rejection.",

        "abstract": "The effectiveness of current airfoil cooling strategies in gas turbines is limited by the manufacturing processes used to fabricate cooling holes. Current manufacturing processes are either too costly or generate holes with widely varying air flow characteristics. These limitations lead to design compromises that decrease turbine efficiency while increasing fuel consumption, emissions and operating costs. A high speed water guided laser drilling process will be developed that will improve the predictability and repeatability of cooling hole performance and meet manufacturing cost objectives. The guided laser drilling process will also enable cost effective machining of shaped cooling holes to enable sophisticated turbine cooling strategies to be implemented. A water guided laser drilling process was successfully demonstrated for superalloys used in gas turbine systems. A demonstration apparatus was designed and built using commercially available components.The water guided laser drilling process will be further developed for transition to manufacturers of gas turbine systems. Cooling hole arrays drilled using the water guided laser drilling process will demonstrate superior performance to those drilled using current laser and electrochemical methods. A prototype drilling system will be constructed that demonstrates that the process meets the productivity and cost requirements of major gas turbine manufacturers.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  High speed drilling techniques for small holes will benefit the aerospace industry by enabling higher efficiency gas turbine propulsion systems for commercial aircraft. Similar efficiency gains will be possible in ground based turbine systems used for the generation of electricity. High speed guided laser drilling processes will enable small holes to be drilled in ceramics leading to improvements in automotive fuel injectors, wide market acceptance of ceramic circuit boards for higher performance electronics and advances in dentistry without anesthesia.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant: In this Phase II NIH SBIR, the Low Insertion Force Epidural (LIFE) device will be further optimized and efficacy measured on human cadavers and live porcine models. Piezo Resonance Innovations, Inc. successfully designed and demonstrated the Phase I LIFE device insertion tool in various tissue models, including trials by senior anesthesiologists. The Phase II developments will lead to a Phase III human study and commercialization in collaboration with a major medical company. With a global market of epidural kits near  219M, a device that will increase safety and comfort, enhance training, and raise penetration success rate by clinicians has commercial viability. The improvements derived from the LIFE device could allow less experienced providers, such as interventional radiologists or non-anesthesia trained pain physicians, to perform epidural procedures. Epidural anesthesia is a form of regional anesthesia involving injection of drugs directly into the epidural space. Epidural anesthesia is used in 2.4 million births annually in the United States, in addition to a wide range of other pain-management procedures as far up the spine as the neck. The procedure can be unpleasant to the patient and difficult to perform because of the high force levels required to penetrate the supraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament and ligamentum flavum. One of the most common complications is an accidental dural puncture. If the dura is punctured accidentally, the chance for a cerebrospinal fluid leak causing a post dural puncture headache is quite high. Headaches can be severe and last from weeks to years. Significant leakage can cause enough intracranial hypotension as to tear veins causing a subdural hematoma, and can cause traction injuries to the cranial nerves resulting in tinnitus, hearing loss, dizziness, facial droop, or double vision. Over-insertion is even more dangerous for epidurals inserted in the neck. The LIFE device will enable the clinician a more controlled entry into the epidural space, eliminating the excessive force that results in 'over-shooting' and dural punctures. This Phase II project will advance a commercially viable LIFE System to aid penetrating the ligamentum flavum, while also minimizing dural puncture  wet taps  during epidural insertion procedures.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Epidural anesthesia insertion is a difficult procedure, due in large part to the force required to insert a needle through tough ligament and muscle, and into the epidural space. When the needle 'pops-through' the tougher tissue into the epidural space, it is difficult to control the depth of penetration. An error in the procedure is referred to as a 'wet-tap' or dural puncture. The puncture may cause cerebrospinal fluid to leak into the epidural space, often resulting in a post dural-puncture headache and other painful complications. The development of a low force epidural insertion tool will provide clinicians with improved control to decrease pop-through and minimize dural puncture. This new technique will also enhance resident training, and with a reduction in risk, may allow less experienced providers, such as interventional radiologists or non-anesthesia trained pain physicians, to perform epidural insertion. For 2008, the global market for epidural kits is projected to be  219M.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Planet Biotechnology Inc. (PBI) is developing a therapeutic recombinant protein, PBI-220, that neutralizes anthrax toxin in vitro and protects against inhalational anthrax in vivo. PBI uses transgenic plants as an innovative, economical and flexible production technology. Our therapeutic protein, a fusion of the high- affinity human anthrax toxin receptor CMG2 and the Fc portion of IgG, offers broad-spectrum protection against anthrax because it can neutralize not only wild-type anthrax toxin, but toxin forms that have been modified to avoid neutralization by monoclonal antibodies. We believe that PBI-220 may be the 'best in class' therapeutic in development for anthrax.  We have demonstrated the in vitro toxin-neutralizing potency of PBI-220, using a standard assay, to be as high as the best anti-PA antibodies under development by Avanir, Elusys or Human Genome Sciences. A dose of PBI-220 as low as 2 mg/kg was sufficient to completely protect rabbits challenged with gt100 LD50 of B. anthracis spores. We have created transgenic tobacco plants that accumulate PBI-220 at commercially useful levels (gt75 mg/kg fresh weight of leaves) and are scaling up our purification procedure.  We propose to advance the development of PBI-220 beyond efficacy testing in rabbits to efficacy testing in a non-human primate (NHP) model of inhalational anthrax. These experiments will determine the dose, route of administration and timing of PBI-220 treatment that will provide protection at the maximum delay after spore inhalation, during periods when antibiotic alone becomes ineffective. We will evaluate the pharmacokinetics of PBI-220 in NHP, to help determine appropriate dosing in people. We will conduct pilot toxicology studies in rats and NHP to demonstrate PBI-220's safety. All of these studies are designed to support eventual filing of an Investigational New Drug Application with FDA for PBI-220, and its licensure under the FDA  Animal Rule .  An important aspect of the product development this grant will support is optimization of our manufacturing process and implementation of a Quality System so that we can produce PBI-220 under current Good Manufacturing Practices.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The American public is vulnerable to a bioterrorist attack using Anthrax (Bacillus anthracis). We believe than an immunoadhesin, comprised of the human anthrax toxin receptor CMG2 and a human IgG or IgA Fc, can provide complete protection against anthrax after the development of symptoms, without the need for vaccination, and would allow the development of the body's own protective antibodies against Bacillus anthracis.",

(PBI) has pioneered methods for the production of functional therapeutic antibodies and immunoadhesins in transgenic tobacco. For reasons that are unclear, the yield of antibodies in transgenic plants has generally been low, with most published literature citing maximum expression of IgG in transgenic tobacco well below 30 mg/kg. We have designed and investigated the expression in plants of human IgG1 variants using DNA sequences in which there are over- or under-represented codon pairs. By utilizing an IgG heavy chain constant region containing many over-represented codon pairs we were able to significantly enhance transient expression of a number of antibodies (up to 35-fold higher than with our codon usage optimized sequence). Furthermore, we have generated stable tobacco plants expressing up to 515 mg IgG/kg fresh weight.  Evidence suggests that the more over-represented a codon pair is, the more slowly it is translated. Local translational pausing might provide a time delay, enabling sequential folding of defined portions of nascent polypeptides, which may prevent protein misfolding and aggregation, and reduce degradation. We will test the hypothesis that translation is attenuated at over-represented codon pairs, and that translational pauses at particular positions are necessary for efficient co-translational folding and assembly of immunoglobulins in plants.  To determine whether the expression benefit of the presence of many over-represented codon pairs is particular to IgG heavy chain in plants, or whether it is more widely applicable, sequences will be designed and synthesized for a small protein (J chain) and a larger multi-domain protein (IgA2 heavy chain). Furthermore, the IgG1 heavy chain, IgA2 heavy chain and J Chain sequences will be designed for expression in tobacco, in which the positions of over-represented codon pairs in the expression host are harmonized with those in the native host.  The expression-competence of these sequences will be established using a tobacco transient expression system, after which stable transgenic tobacco plants will be generated. Specific transcript accumulation levels will be measured by real-time PCR and compared to protein accumulation levels. Endogenous BiP mRNA levels (a molecular marker of the unfolded protein response) will be quantified by real- time PCR in tobacco plants expressing the genes described above. 35S-pulse-chase labeling assays will determine the influence of over- or under-represented codon pairs on protein translation and turnover rates of the genes described within the grant.  If successful, the result will be a general platform technology for the quick, easy, scalable production of therapeutic human antibodies in large quantities from plants (and possibly other eukaryotic expression hosts).        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Planet is developing tobacco-produced recombinant proteins against several diseases including: intoxication by Botulinum Neurotoxin A (BoNT/A), the most potent toxin known and a bio-terror agent, the common cold, dental caries and intoxication by Anthrax toxin, also a bio-terror agent. All of these product-candidates could benefit from a technology that would increase expression in plants, which would result in decreases in production and purification costs, making therapeutic antibodies more affordable and widely available.",

A national survey of 29,230 college students in 2002 found that, at some point during the previous year, 45 percent had felt so depressed that they could not function; 65 percent had felt  things were hopeless.  Chemical dependency is widespread and has become normative on many campuses. Half of all students report that they  drink to get drunk.  Similar findings were reported following a survey of 80,000 college students in 2007-2008. Mental health and chemical dependency claim over 2,000 student lives each year. COMS will provide automated outcomes management for college health services. It will help college counseling centers (CCCs) and college health centers (CHCs) respond more effectively to the crisis. As the first outcomes management system (OMS) appropriate for use on college campuses, COMS will provide student health programs with the same evidence-based treatment screening, planning, and progress monitoring capabilities introduced successfully in behavioral health settings across the nation. It will provide: (1) Behavioral healthcare screening and clinical decision support: COMS will help to identify students suffering from serious behavioral health (mental health, substance abuse) disorders, or at risk for life threatening conditions such as eating disorders (ED), self-harm (e.g., cutting) and suicidality; (2) Effective screening for chemical dependency (CD), linked to appropriate interventions. COMS will enable CCCs to fully integrate screening with Motivational Enhancement Interviewing (MEI), promoting readiness to change among a population that considers heavy drinking and drug use to be normative; (3) Multivariate severity ( case mix ) adjustment, allowing for valid comparisons of treatment outcomes across programs and meaningful quality improvement initiatives; (4) Continual enhancement of its ability to evaluate  what works for whom,  as its database of patient characteristics, treatments and outcomes expands; (5) Population screening (anonymous): COMS will be made available on the CCC website to support its outreach function. Students who complete the COMS assessment will receive self-help materials, tailored lists of college, local (e.g., AA/NA groups) and national (hotlines, links to NIDA, NIAAA and NIMH web sites) resources, and the offer of a dynamic referral to the CCC, CHC or local providers; (6) Assessment of risk for dropout; and (7) Utility for research. Phase II specific aims include: (1) Develop data quality indicators; (2) Automate the monitoring assessment and report; (3) Provide remote and anonymous web access; (4) Develop and field test COMS for CHCs; (5) Derive predictive algorithms for treatment response and college dropout; (6) Integrate COMS into an electronic practice management system; and (7) Provide dynamic referral, self-help and lists of tailored resources.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, significant disparity exists in the vital healthcare documents being provided to limited English-proficient (LEP) patients. In 2007, a nationwide survey of hospitals by The Joint Commission found that only 50 percent of hospitals had translated informed consent documents. Even then, the translations were often only available in Spanish. Other types of documents were translated even less frequently. Hospitals, with limited budgets for language services, are struggling to allocate resources to create quality, translated documents for their patients. During the 2005 Roundtable on Health Disparity and Information Technology, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Office of Minority Health (OMH) identified a national repository of translated documents as a high priority need to reduce medical errors due to language miscommunication. During Phase I of this grant, we developed and evaluated a new web-accessible platform for documents that demonstrated feasibility in creating, managing, sharing, printing, and speaking documents to patients in foreign languages. This platform, called TDARS (Translated Document Assembly and Retrieval System), allows healthcare organizations to quickly assemble coherent vital healthcare documents, instantly create quality, translated versions that can be printed, and then instruct a computer to read the translated documents to the patients. TDARS offers a high degree of flexibility in customizing documents for each organization, enables documents to be shared among institutions, provides a method to comply with The Joint Commission's document access standards, and can do all this for less than the average cost of translating one document in one language - making a library of documents economically accessible to even the smallest hospitals. During Phase II, our objective is to develop a commercial Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product for hospitals and other healthcare organizations offered through a subscription-pricing model. We will expand TDARS to include a core set of documents identified as being of greatest need during our Phase I evaluation, making them available in the languages identified as being most common and challenging nationwide (Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Russian, Arabic, Korean, and Somali). Thirty participating sites will be recruited that represent our target market population of small and medium-sized hospitals.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A national repository of quality, pre-translated documents that can speak the documents to patients could dramatically reduce the disparity of information provided to our limited English proficient patients. Current methods of translating documents are expensive, the quality of translations is inconsistent, and efforts are being duplicated by multiple hospitals. Both the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Office of Minority Health (OMH) have indicated that creating such a repository is a national priority.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oral infections of Candida albicans represent an increasing problem in human health. In immunocompromised individuals, especially those suffering from AIDS, candiasis can result in both localized, yet painful lesions in the oral cavity as well as life-threatening systemic infections. Furthermore, due to the use of standard antifungal treatments, an increasing number of infections are due to non-albicans candidal (NAC) species. It is thus critical to develop new therapies that can treat both C. albicans infections as well as those due to NAC. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are naturally occurring, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents that have been examined recently for their utility as therapeutic antibiotics and antifungals. Chief among their strengths is that microbes do not generally develop resistance to these agents. Unfortunately, they are expensive to produce and are often sensitive to protease digestion. Polymedix, Inc. has developed a series of inexpensive nonpeptidic oligomers and polymers that mimic AMPs in both structure and activity. In the first phase of this grant, we examined a series of small molecule non-peptide mimics of AMPs and evaluated their potential as leads for a topical treatment for oral candidiasis. Our results demonstrated the potent activity of several classes of these mimetics against C. albicans as well as non-albicans species in both planktonic and biofilm cultures. The activity was rapid, and fungicidal against both blastoconidia and hyphal forms. We have also failed to generate resistant strains of Candida, substantiating their value as attractive candidates for anti-candidal drugs. To continue the development of candida-active mimetics, we propose the following aims for this Phase 2 application: 1). Establish a mouse model of oral candidal infection. 2) Define the activity of peptide mimetic compounds identified in phase I on oral candidal infection in vivo. 3) Optimize the mimetic chemistry to achieve the most active compound. Our overall goal in this phase is to determine the optimal compound(s) and conditions under which an antimicrobial peptide mimetic can be applied to oral mucosa in order to efficiently clear an experimental Candida infection. Successful completion of this phase will provide a development lead candidate(s) for further development as a topical treatment for oral candidiasis.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Oral candidal infections are serious complications found in immunocompromised individuals, such as those suffering from AIDS. Development of safe and effective agents to treat these painful and sometimes life-threatening infections, without the risk of developing resistant strains of Candida, is essential. We propose to examine several compounds determined in the first phase to be active against Candida, in an animal model of oral candidiasis to provide the basis for development of a treatment for this disease.",

        "abstract": "Most heat exchangers utilized in process industries are made from metals. These heat exchangers are bulky, heavy, subject to corrosion and microbiological fouling which leads to reduction in performance and increase in cost. The plastic heat exchangers can alleviate some of these problems. However, commercial plastic heat exchangers are less efficient and have a limited operating temperature range. The availability of light weight, compact, corrosion resistant, efficient heat exchanger is particularly important for process industries and the transportation sector. In phase 1 of the project, PoroGen Corporation has demonstrated the technical and economical feasibility of developing compact polymeric heat exchanger from an advanced engineering polymer poly (ether ether ketone), PEEK. The PEEK heat exchanger exhibits high temperature operating capability, superior heat transfer efficiency, light weight, durability, and contaminant and corrosion resistance. In Phase 2 of the program the heat transfer efficiency will be further optimized, commercial size heat exchanger will be designed, constructed and tested for transportation sector applications.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Compact lightweight PEEK heat exchanger will be deployed in transportation sector, aviation and automobile industries, as cabin air coolers, filter coolers and radiators. In aviation PEEK heat exchangers will be used in a) cabin heating (all occupied regions and windshield heating); b) wing and empennage anti-icing; c) engine and accessory heating (when heater is installed as part of the aircraft); d) aircraft de-icing; e) cabin air conditioning; f) cooling electronic equipment and cooling compressed air directed into On Board Inert Gas Generation Systems (OBIGGS). The wide adaptation of PEEK heat exchangers will provide significant energy savings for the transportation sector where weight reduction translates directly into fuel saving. Additional market opportunities for polymeric heat exchanger include applications in the chemical, pharmaceutical, food and beverage industries, with eventual integration into generic process equipment such as condensing boilers and refrigeration plants.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (excessive bilirubin) is one of the most common problems encountered in newborns. If caught in time, hyperbilirubinemia can be treated. In a newborn infant, severe hyperbilirubinemia can cause brain damage (kernicterus), hearing loss, physical abnormalities, and even death. Recently, there has been a re-emergence of kernicterus, a preventable brain injury resulting from severe neonatal hyprbilirubinemia. This is due to early discharge after delivery, inaccurate bilirubin measurements, and improper management of the patients.  The average hospital stay for a newborn delivered vaginally in 1970 was 3.9 days; today the average hospital stay is 1.7 days. Newborn bilirubin levels, however, do not peak until sometime between the third and fifth day after birth. With early discharge, the opportunity and responsibility for observing the newborn during the period of greatest extreme hyperbilirubinemia risk has shifted from the hospital to the primary caregiver.  The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) revised their clinical practice guidelines for managing hyperbilirubinemia in 2004. The new guidelines recommend that all bilirubin levels be interpreted according to the infant's age in hours. Therefore, bilirubin test in newborns must be processed and reported urgently. Laboratories conducting testing may not be able to provide results in the relatively short time frame required for appropriate treatment decisions.  This application proposes the development of a minimally invasive, inexpensive, point-of-care test that will provide the caregiver, both in the hospital and the office, direct and immediate access to whole blood total bilirubin levels. The test consists of a solid-phase test strip and reflectance based meter, similar to glucose models. Specific aims of the Phase I research have all been met.  The goal of the Phase II proposal is to develop a final prototype solid phase test strip and hand-held digital reader. Phase II has three major aims: (1) finish development of the cassette and evaluate its performance; (2) develop reader with connectivity features; and (3) scale-up the manufacturing process and evaluate the casettes for performance using new reader.  In Phase III commercialization phase, the main focus will be to sign up marketing partners, secure additional funding to prepare the product for launch, and by performing clinical studies to collect data for regulatory market approvals.  The availability of the proposed PortaTBili product will prevent delays in finding those infants destined to develop severe hyperbilirubinemia, making significant impact in the nation's health management for infants. The low cost instrument will also allow improvement in infant healthcare practice globally.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed test strip will allow a physician to determine an infant's total bilirubin concentration from a whole blood sample without having to send out to a lab. With this information, the physician can identify and treat infants who are at high risk for bilirubin related conditions that are life threatening or that will adversely affect the quality of life.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultimate goal of this SBIR project is to develop a novel proteomic system that will enable the real- time expression profiling of proteins in live murine embryonic stem (mES) cells and in differentiated cells derived there from. The first step involves the establishment of a library of fluorescent trap mES cell lines, each of which will harbor a single fluorescently-tagged protein. The fluorescence in each cell of a particular clonal line will serve as a reporter for the expression and subcellular localization of the tagged protein in that cell line. Such a library of clonal fluorescently-tagged lines can be subjected to quantitative fluorescence microscopy in multiwell live-cell arrays, to enable the simultaneous real-time expression profiling of multiple proteins in live cells under various culture conditions. In Phase I we demonstrated the feasibility of establishing a large and diverse protein-trap library using our approach. This proposed Phase II effort will be focused generating a library of at 1500 unique fluorescent protein-trap mES cell lines. Individual cell lines from such a library of fluorescently protein-trap mES lines can also be used as versatile protein-specific research tools as they can be manipulated in culture into different tissue-types or used for the generation of transgenic mice when desired. Many also these cell lines can also be used to design novel powerful cell-based assays. Therefore this proposed Phase II project will result in the generation of a versatile and diverse proteomic research resource in mES cells.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ultimate aim of this SBIR project is to develop a system that will enable researchers to monitor the location and levels of hundreds of proteins simultaneously in living cells. Such a system will be useful in researching a wide variety of biological processes, including understanding the molecular basis of a number of human diseases. Further, such a system can be applied to the identification therapeutic targets and the creation of powerful drug-screening platforms to identify potential therapeutic agents that may cure these diseases.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ultimate goal of this effort is to develop, validate, and commercialize an ultra-broad tuning range, ultrahigh scan rate, swept laser source imaging engine that will enable the next generation of Optical Coherence Tomography / Optical Coherence Microscopy (OCT/OCM) systems. OCT and OCM enable 3D in vivo volumetric imaging of tissue pathology by detecting the echo time delay of back-reflected and backscattered light. OCT and OCM have powerful advantages as a cancer imaging modality because they provide information on tissue pathology in real time, without the need to excise and process specimens as in conventional excisional biopsy and histopathology. OCT has an axial image resolution of ~5-10 um and can image tissue over a much wider area than possible using conventional pinch biopsy. In endoscopic OCT, imaging can be performed over several square centimeters of the lumen. OCM has transverse resolutions of 1-2 um and can provide 3D image information at the cellular level.  Swept source / Fourier domain OCT/OCM using compact VCSEL (vertical cavity surface emitting lasers) promises to enable imaging with significantly higher imaging speeds than existing commercial OCT technology. We propose to develop a swept source imaging engine which achieves an axial scan rate of 1 MHz, ~40x faster than commercial ophthalmic OCT instruments (25 kHz axial scan rate). Furthermore, swept source OCT/OCM using VCSEL technologies can be engineered into a compact imaging engine which is smaller than a laptop computer. The development of a high performance OCT/OCM imaging engine for the OEM market will enable access to the technology by a wide range of both established and start-up medical companies. This development strategy, which contrasts with focusing on commercialization for a single clinical application, reduces risks and will accelerate the development and impact of the technology across a broad range of clinical applications for cancer imaging.  This proposed effort builds upon advances in semiconductor materials technology and tunable lasers developed by Praevium Research, Inc. in NCI grant 4R44CA101067 and follow-on commercial investment by commercial partner, Thorlabs, Inc., the world's largest manufacturer of research OCT technology. This work involves a collaboration between the primary organization Praevium Reseach, Inc. commercial partner Thorlabs, and the OCT group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was responsible for the invention and development of OCT.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This effort is expected impact public health by advancing a new clinical tool capable of three dimensional in-vivo volumetric imaging of tissue pathology without the need for tissue excision and processing as in conventional excisional biopsy and histopathology. This tool employs advanced high resolution, high data rate optical coherence tomography (OCT), which measures backscattered echoes of reflected light, in the same way that ultrasound imaging measures sound echoes, but with an imaging resolution 10-100 higher than ultrasound. The proposed instrument operates at 40X the imaging speed of existing commercial OCT instruments, and is enabled by a new compact rapidly swept laser source.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A primary goal in neuroscience is to understand at a mechanistic level the functioning of neuronal networks with specific behaviors. This involves in general, the anatomical connectivity among the various types of neurons within the local network, the physiological properties of these cells, and the spatiotemporal firing signals of the neurons within the circuit. The challenge is not only to discover the connectivity among neurons but also to effectively record the signal activity within the neuronal network during a behavior in such a way as to provide functional information. Since 2001 Prairie Technologies, Inc. has been designing, building, refining and selling a new type of confocal scanning system, the Swept Field Confocal microscope (SFC). SBIR Phase I and II awards have provided the funding necessary for Prairie to develop an entry level product for the biological marketplace. Due to successful completion of all of our Phase I and Phase II goals, we have been able to sell over 60 units totaling to sales of  6,000,000.00 for the company. Recently we have been able to develop a worldwide sales channel for the SFC with Nikon Instruments, Inc. Because of high speed and low toxicity, the SFC is now gaining in sales popularity in the neuro and cell biology fields. In order to provide more functional information, we propose to further improve the speed of the SFC and simplify its ease of use for the scientists and to increase the amount of applications that can be performed with the instrument such as Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). In particular, we would like to add quantitative techniques such as Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM) for the study of dynamic processes and FRET analysis. By completing the specific aims outlined in this proposal, the SFC can not only perform as a confocal microscope, but have capability to provide dynamic information about the local neuron network with high resolution. In addition, with completion of this project Prairie can achieve increased product sales of the SFC into the  200 million annual world-wide laser scanning microscopy market.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A primary goal in neuroscience is to understand at a mechanistic level the functioning of neuronal networks with specific behaviors, which can be used to characterize neurological disorders. Such studies require the ability to identify the signaling networks and noninvasively study the dynamics within living cells. The improved Swept Field Confocal microscope system will provide such capabilities to record the spatiotemporal information in real time of normal and diseased processes and to study the cellular dynamics with additional information about the microenvironment and signaling pathways detected with Fluorescent Lifetime Imaging.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Fast-track application addresses the problem of teaching children with autism and related intellectual disabilities to discriminate among items of relatively greater or lesser symbolic value. The context for instruction is an evolving suite of computer-based and computer-managed matching-to-sample programs for teaching functional money skills. Foundational work accomplished thus far has demonstrated effective methodology for teaching critical prerequisite skills, among them (a) to discriminate individual coins and coin combinations on the basis of identity, (b) to relate different coin combinations of equivalent value (e.g., 25 cents with 5 nickels), and (c) to select series of different coin combinations of equivalent value from a large unsorted pool that provides a number of potentially valid choices (e.g., given a 25 cent sample to select combinations of two dimes and a nickel, a dime and three nickels, and/or five nickels). The current money skills program has implemented a number of state-of-the-art curricular approaches including potentially errorless assessment and instruction, stimulus equivalence development, automated decision-making algorithms for assessing student progress and determining advancement within the program, and methods for encouraging facile generalization from computer-based training to tabletop environments and vice versa. The proposed addition to the money skills teaching suite has the working title ValueTeacher (VT). As the name implies, the VT program takes the next logical step in money skills training, explicitly teaching children to discriminate coins and coin combinations of greater vs. lesser value and to make inferences based on such relationships. The computer-managed VT program will take advantage of a number of advanced behavioral programming procedures, among them multiple and concurrent schedules of reinforcement, percentile-based automated shaping of progressively finer value judgments, and outcome-specific reinforcement. In Phase 1, prototype software will be developed to assess and teach discrimination of coin values up to 50 cents as proof of concept. In Phase 2, the procedures will be extended to values up to  5.00 and incorporated within a state-of-the-art user interface that will promote effective use of the program by behavior therapists, special education teachers, and other educators of children with intellectual disabilities. In both Phases, additional curricula will be provided to assist in generalization of skills acquired in the classroom to real-world purchasing situations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Our objective is to complete development of the MERIT suite, a computer-based curriculum that can potentially prepare children who have the requisite cognitive capacity to use money independently. We believe that the MERIT product suite has the potential to significantly improve the effectiveness of money skills instruction for children with intellectual disabilities, many of whom make at best slow and uneven progress in learning this critical skill.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cholera toxin (CT) and the related heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) are AB toxins with cell targeting B domains and enzymatically active A domains. The enzymatically active A1 domains of both CT (CTA1) and LT (LTA1) have demonstrated particular promise as genetic adjuvants that can enhance the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines in small and large animals and may provide necessary boosting and dose sparing effects in humans. In our Phase I efforts, we identified mutants of CTA1 and LTA1 with enhanced enzymatic activity in vitro and enhanced adjuvanticity in vivo. We identified a mutant of LTA1 that induced anti-HIV and anti-SIV cellular responses in mice nearly 2-fold higher than those induced by the  gold-standard  adjuvant IL-12 plasmid DNA (pDNA) or in vivo electroporation. In this Phase II application, we propose screen additional mutants and select a lead A1 subunit adjuvant to compare its adjuvanticity to that of IL-12 pDNA and electroporation. Using a prototype SIV DNA vaccine, we will compare the magnitude and polyfunctionality of the T cell response in both mice and macaques. We will follow the macaque studies with a homologous SIV challenge to determine whether any of the quantitative and qualitative differences observed in the immune response are relevant to protection. We propose to achieve these goals through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Identify a lead A1 subunit adjuvant that induces comparable or superior immune responses to SIV vaccine antigens as compared to electroporation and IL-12 pDNA; Aim 2: Characterize the anti-SIV immune responses adjuvanted by the lead A1 subunit adjuvant vs. IL-12 pDNA and electroporation in a macaque model Aim 3: Determine if administration of a SIV pDNA vaccine adjuvanted by the lead A1 subunit provide protection from homologous SIVmac251 challenge that is superior to that provided by IL-12 pDNA and electroporation. If the lead A1 subunit genetic adjuvant proves to be superior to IL-12 pDNA in the homologous challenge model, this adjuvant will be further evaluated in a heterologous challenge model. 2        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this project is to develop an advanced DNA vaccine adjuvant based on a modified A1 subunit of cholera toxin or heat-labile enterotoxin with enhanced enzymatic activity and adjuvanticity.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the commercialization of multichannel holographic spectrometers featured large operating bandwidth and fine spectral resolution. The proposed research is to develop a new platform for spectrometers using multiplexed cylindrical beam volume holograms (MCBVHs) as dispersive elements. Due to its unique characteristic, the MCBVH enables the design of two-dimensional (2D) spatial-spectral output patterns to significantly enhance the functionality of holographic spectrometers. A significant improvement of the operating bandwidth can be achieved without sacrificing spectral resolution while keeping all merits of a compact, lightweight, low-cost, reliable, and alignment robust holographic spectrometer. With the proposed multichannel spectrometer, several species of interest can be detected at one shot even though their spectrums are distributed in a very large spectral bandwidth. Due to the design flexibility of volume holograms, this technology enables the design of spectrometers with custom functionalities. Breaking the resolution-bandwidth trade-off of the conventional spectrometers with a holographic system that does not increase the complexity of the final product is the major breakthrough expected from this project. The expected outcome of this project will be a simplest yet highly functional spectrometer that can be designed to perform for technically any given application criteria. \nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide an enabling technology for spectral sensor systems which offer great utility to the life science and medical markets. For high throughput screening, it is desired to have multiple channels read simultaneously on a test containing multiple sample sites. For fluorescence based tests, multiple fluorophores need to be quantified requiring more spectral information. Maintaining good sensitivity is still required in these applications for low concentration detection at a low cost and size demanded by these markets. The proposed multichannel spectrometer based on MCBVHs will have a broad range of applications in the fields of biochemistry, medicine, pharmaceuticals, industrial quality assurance, homeland security, mineralogy, and environmental monitoring. Moreover, the compact and lightweight nature of the proposed spectrometer makes it a perfect choice for handheld sensing devices that are of high current demand in several fields as mentioned above. The entire US market volume that can be covered by this technology has been $2.6B in 2005, with a prospected 7% growth rate through 2010. The use of sophisticated volume holograms with 2D spatial-spectral output patterns is an important enabling technology that can impact the design of custom multi-purpose spectrometers/sensors beyond the proposed functionalities.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plasmodium vivax recombinant CS protein vaccine Plasmodium vivax (Pv) is responsible for hundreds of millions of malaria cases annually, as many cases of malaria in travelers as P. falciparum (Pf), and a substantial economic burden. Severe malaria with mortality due to Pv has recently been reported from Oceania, south Asia, and South America. During the last decade, drug resistant Pv has emerged. There is a huge potential market for a Pv vaccine in travelers and military from the developed world, and among populations in countries with endemic Pv. Pv vaccine research has been neglected. The fact that Pf and Pv co-exist in most malaria endemic areas worldwide presents technical and ethical constraints for deployment of a vaccine effective only against Pf. Malaria cannot be eradicated without eliminating Pv. The only subunit malaria vaccines that have been reproducibly shown to prevent Pf malaria in humans are based on the Pf circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP). These protective vaccines elicit antibodies against the central repeat region of the molecule, which is conserved in all isolates of Pf, and against T cell epitopes in the C-terminal flanking region. It has not been possible to produce successfully a PfCSP recombinant (rec) protein vaccine that includes the N-terminal flanking region. Development of a PvCSP rec protein vaccine has been complicated by the fact that there are 2 major alleles of the PvCSP (210 and 247) based on variation in sequence of the central repeats. In Phase I we constructed PvCSP rec proteins that combined 3 copies of PvCSP 210 repeats and 3 copies of PvCSP 247 repeats with N-terminus (Protein 1), C- terminus (Protein 2) or N- and C-termini (Protein 3) of the PvCSP. All were expressed at levels adequate for GMP production. Protein 2 aggregated making purification and characterization difficult. All induced in mice antibodies that recognized PvCSP and Pv sporozoites expressing PvCSP 210 or 247, and inhibited Pv sporozoite invasion and development in human hepatocytes. Protein 2 did not induce antibodies against the Pv247 repeats, and could not be evaluated in T cell studies. Protein 3 induced better immune responses than Protein 1, and since Protein 3 includes essentially the full-length protein with all B and T cell epitopes, we have selected Protein 3 for Phase II. In Phase II we will: 1) Optimize protein 3 expression and generate a master clone and master cell bank, 2) Define specifications for fermentation procedure at scale under cGMPs, 3) Formulate candidate protein with 4 different adjuvants, 4) Down select optimal protein/adjuvant/formulation by comparative immunogenicity in mice and monkeys, 5) Define specifications for process, generate technical transfer records and documentation for cGMP manufacture, 6) Manufacture vaccine, conduct release assays, release bulk drug substance and conduct stability studies. By end of Phase II PvCSP Protein 3 vaccine/adjuvant will be available for pre-clinical toxicology studies and Phase 1/2a clinical trials.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Density functional theory (DFT) is perhaps the most widely applied quantum chemistry method in molecular simulations due to its ability to accurately and efficiently model a wide range of molecular systems. Still, it has a major deficiency, namely the lack of nondynamic correlation. As a result, it can yield unreliable results for chemical reactions, radicals, excited states, and charge-transfers. These properties are very often the focus of biological-based research and development and can only be studied computationally with quantum mechanical based methods. In Phase I of this project, we developed an efficient self-consistent solution for a new DFT method called real-space correlation (RSC) that addresses this deficiency. In addition, our RSC-DFT implementation was shown to be very efficient, some 100 times faster than a prior implementation. Our Phase I results demonstrate that RSC not only excels in standard DFT test cases, but also overcomes some of DFT's known failures. The overall goal of this Phase II project is to make RSC available for the majority of DFT computations, including calculation of the energy and gradient for ground and excited electronic states. We will also reduce the computational cost of RSC even further such that it will be as efficient as conventional DFT. Our development will be validated through two applications of biological interest, where DFT is known to give poor results. Finally, RSC will be combined with our dispersion DFT implementation, , and the unified method will represent a substantial leap forward in DFT, allowing researchers to routinely and reliably study molecular systems that were heretofore not possible with current quantum chemistry based techniques. This will also allow Q-Chem to expand its market to new areas.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to implement a new DFT method in a computationally efficient manner.

Among the quantum chemistry methods, density functional theory (DFT) is perhaps the most widely used, especially in molecular biology, due to its ability to accurately model a wide range of molecular systems with reasonable computational cost. Despite its wide use, DFT does not include the dispersion correlation effect, or van der Waals interaction, which plays a critical role in the determination of the overall conformations of molecular systems and accordingly, is indispensable in the study of DNA and proteins, molecular recognition, the packing of crystals, etc. In Phase I of this project, we developed an efficient SCF and nuclear gradient solution for a density functional dispersion model called XDM, and demonstrated that it corrected some of the failures of current DFT methods in structural and energetic studies. In this Phase II proposal, we plan to incorporate dispersion of the XDM model into all the major aspects of DFT applications, including energetic and structural calculations of both ground and excited electronic states, with further improved accuracy. To demonstrate the utility of the DFT-XDM approach for modeling systems of biological interest, we will investigate two challenging molecular processes, namely the binding process of cisplatin to DNA, and electronic transitions in photoactive yellow protein (PYP). Cisplatin is widely used in chemotherapy, and photoactive yellow protein is a widely studied photoreceptor that is key to understanding signal transduction. As we will show, the successful development and implementation of the DFT-XDM model proposed here will lead to much more accurate DFT solutions.

        "abstract": "Most medium and large commercial and industrial facilities use packaged water chillers ranging from 50 ton capacity and up for air conditioning and refrigeration.  Their current refrigerants are chemicals which will soon be phased out and replaced by environmentally benign alternative refrigerants of zero ozone-depletion and negligible global warming.  Among all candidate refrigerants, Carbon dioxide has been found to be the best considering all requisite conditions including non-flammability and non-toxicity.  Because of its inherent inefficiency arising from a transcritical cycle with low critical temperature, a direct application to the conventional chiller cycle requires power consumption of 1.2 kW/ton at the rating condition.  As an innovative breakthrough, a high efficiency carbon dioxide chiller will be developed.  By reducing overall pressure ratio, the cycle efficiency is dramatically increased to provide the power consumption as low as 0.5 kW/ton at 150 tons of cooling capacity. The proposed innovative carbon dioxide cycle is easily scalable to chiller sizes other than 150 tons.  In Phase I, the feasibility of the innovative carbon dioxide chiller concept was successfully confirmed through a thermodynamic analysis of the cycle.  A preliminary analysis of all the components also showed the feasibility of anticipated performance.  Mechanical integrity of all key components was verified through a preliminary mechanical design. An overall system size and volume was estimated, and any conflicts with commercial needs were checked.  In Phase II, the novel design technology will be established through component tests.  The demonstration of efficiency gain using the new technology installed in an existing commercial chiller will be made, which will create a near-term retrofit business of improving current chiller efficiency by simply adding the new technology, and which will minimize any potential trial-and-errors in the carbon dioxide chiller development. A complete design of the key components of the proposed carbon dioxide water chiller will be accomplished.  A working relationship with a manufacturing company, specialized in packaged water chiller business, will be established.  In Phase III, a prototype chiller of 150 ton capacity will be built and field tested.

The radiation is collected on a linear array detector and post-processed to yield transverse profile information with a resolution on the order of 10 microns.

These steps position us to fabricate and test a high rep. rate prototype gun in Phase II, and eventually offer a high-power high-brightness photoinjector as a product in Phase III.  In Phase II of the project, we will complete the engineering of the SFF high rep. rate gun, and build and test the prototype at LLNL.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The applications of very high duty cycle, high gradient photoinjectors include x-ray free-electron lasers (FELs), energy recovery linear accelerators (ERLs), and inverse Compton scattering (ICS) sources for medicine, as well associated imaging/analysis applications of interest to homeland security. The technical approach developed in this project may also be applied to a wide variety of rf structures, such as linacs and klystrons.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project makes significant advances in the field of photonics by developing a cutting-edge performance, cost effective and compact ultrafast laser light amplifier.  The amplifier is a key element in generating this compelling form of light for revolutionary materials processing capabilities.  Ultrafast lasers enable athermal ablation of nearly any material with micron-scale precision.  Historically, ultrafast lasers have been confined to bulky, optical breadboard systems?ideal for academic environments but unsuitable for practical commercial applications owing to their ambient temperature sensitivity and tendency to drift out of alignment.  The technology developed under this SBIR leverages novel laser amplifier glass material development to support a planar waveguide amplifier architecture.  When combined with recent advances in fiber-optic ultrafast laser technology, the herein developed amplifier module will produce a high power, compact, and cost efficient ultrafast laser integrated system.  In addition, the advances made in planar waveguides under this program have utility in compact, high performance long pulse and continuous wave lasers.  The technology will advance the state of the art in photonics to yield cheap, efficient and rugged amplifier architectures which can be used in a variety of applications.  \nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a pragmatic architecture for ultrafast lasers which enables discovery and the application of this light in the commercial marketplace.  The inherent capability for the short bursts of light from ultrafast lasers to ablate any material?including novel glasses, noble metals, modern alloys, polymers, and other hard-to-machine materials?will create substantial value by enabling a new generation of manufacturing techniques, products and services, and the businesses to drive these innovations.  As a salient example, ultrafast lasers are capable of cutting and shaping bio-absorbable polymers, such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), now in development for the next generation of cardiovascular stents.  These slowly dissolve in the human body in order to avoid complications from restenosis.  PLGA is extraordinarily difficult to machine with conventional lasers?due to melting?or mechanical techniques?due to loss of structural integrity.  Other examples include precise, efficient cutting of organic light emitting diode (OLED) substrates and precision thin film removal for high efficiency, large area solar panels.  This technology will broadly impact business processes in multiple industries by advancing manufacturing fidelity-to-design and by making obsolete the incumbent defect removal methods such as hot acid etching.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): When responding to a chemical spill or other hazardous cleanup operation, first responders must frequently wear a level A hazardous materials suit. These suits protect the first responder from chemical exposure by completely sealing the wearer against external vapors and liquids. Because the suits are sealed, a fresh air supply is required which is typically provided by a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). In total, the SCBA/impermeable suit provides contaminant free air and a barrier to the chemical hazard. Unfortunately, because the suits are sealed, they quickly get very hot and humid. Given the fact that a first responder can be in the suit from 30-60 min, overheating is not just a source of discomfort, but is a real hazard to the health of the first responder. In addition, perspiration condenses on the inside of the faceplate obscuring vision, and the heat/humidity buildup in the suit severely limits the time that can be spent in the suit without risking heat exhaustion. TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes to develop a lightweight, portable system that will both cool and dehumidify the air circulated through a hazmat suit. TDA will use a heat exchanger to transfer heat from the inside of the suit to the dirty environment, but keeps the clean and contaminated air streams separate. The dry (about 15% RH) clean air is cooled to about 770F and returned to the first responder. The cool, dry air is distributed to the hands, head, and feet within the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with a lightweight fabric, internal duct system. In the Phase I project, we will design and build a test heat exchanger to demonstrate our concept. In addition, we will perform a system analysis using a 2D software and a finite element analysis. The design analysis will form the basis of the prototype fabrication in the Phase II project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will allow first responders to work in hot and humid environments for long periods of time without being subject to the deleterious effects of over heating. The successful development of a cooling suit will find applications in other agencies of the U.S. Government.",

        "abstract": "Hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) is an effective and well studied decontaminant for vehicles and buildings contaminated by hazardous chemical or biological materials. Unfortunately, the current technology for generating HPV requires 35 weight percent hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a precursor, which is dangerous and cumbersome to transport and is classified by the Department of Transportation (DOT) as both a Class 5.1 Hazard (oxidizer) and a Class 8 Hazard (corrosive). While the 35 weight percent H2O2 normally is stable, if the temperature becomes elevated or the container becomes contaminated it can quickly decompose, releasing large amounts of oxygen.\nTDA Research, Inc. (TDA) is developing a compact portable system that will generate liquid H2O2 onsite, eliminating all problems related to its transport and storage. The portable system will require only water, air, and electricity (resources that are readily available at any application site) and will not generate any hazardous by-products for which disposal is difficult.\nIn the Phase I project, TDA demonstrated the technical feasibility of using nanocatalysts in a microreactor for direct synthesis of H2O2. The catalysts developed in Phase I showed a very high activity and selectivity for H2O2 synthesis. In Phase II, TDA will build and test a prototype microreactor unit for H2O2 synthesis.\nThis system will enable onsite H2O2 generation of a 35 weight percent solution that can be used to decontaminate the interiors of vehicles and buildings. H2O2 is a strong, nonpolluting oxidizing agent, with broad applications in pulp/paper bleaching, water/waste and effluent treatment, chemical synthesis, textile bleaching, mining/metallurgy, electronics (semiconductors), and propulsion. It also is finding increased use in maintaining safe hospital interiors.

        "abstract": "Ethanol is a versatile chemical that is used as a chemical solvent, sterilizer, antifreeze, chemical intermediate, but mostly an oxygenate in fuels.  Ethanol is produced primarily by fermentation of grains; however, there are a few industrial processes that manufacture high purity ethanol, mostly from the hydration of ethylene. Due to its projected use as an oxygenate in gasoline, ethanol demand is projected to grow by as much as 10% per year.  Currently, 83% of the ethanol in the U.S. is produced by fermentation processes from corn. As a result, food prices spiked in 2008, in part driven by the fact that farmers were growing corn for ethanol production instead of for food crops.  If synthetic ethanol could instead be made directly by oxidizing the cheaper light alkanes that are found in abundance in the petroleum industry, these low value fuel gases could be converted into a high value alcohol. Conversion of low value ethane to high value ethanol would be an advantage for both the fuels and chemical industries.  TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) has identified a novel catalyst to convert light alkanes to valuable oxygenates such as alcohols. Since the process directly oxidizes light alkanes instead of olefins, it could operate far more cheaply than current industrial synthetic alcohol manufacturing processes.  In the Phase I project, TDA successfully demonstrated that it can convert light alkanes such as ethane directly to ethanol in higher yields than reported to date.  In addition, we carried out an economic analysis for a 50 million liters/year ethanol plant based on our technology.   In the Phase II project, with our partners, we will continue to refine our catalytic process with a combination of modeling, catalyst testing, and process and economic analysis.  We are working with a major ethanol manufacturer who will consider adopting our technology should the results our process and economic analysis meet industry benchmarks.

        "abstract": "Rapid and encouraging progress in bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics (BHJ OPV) has made them one of the most promising new technologies for inexpensively generating electricity from sunshine. However, power conversion efficiencies remain about ~60% of what is thought to be required in order for them to be commercially viable. Moreover, the champion devices incorporate both vacuum-deposited materials, which mitigate their advantage of inexpensive production, and highly reactive materials, which lead to poor stability.  Our approach is a new architecture for BHJ OPV, which simultaneously extends the range of operation further into the red (from ~630 nm to ~850 nm and beyond) while retaining the excellent properties of the poly(3-hexyl)thiophene:fullerene blend for energy conversion at lower wavelengths.  Issues related to device stability will be addressed by eliminating chemically unstable materials, which will prove to be unnecessary in the new architecture.  True low-cost fabrication will also be achieved by limiting the cost of the organic materials and depositing both transparent conducting oxides and metal back electrodes from nanoparticle solutions.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The new architecture proposed will lead to increased efficiency and stability while minimizing materials and production costs.  That combination will lead to BHJ OPV devices that are less expensive than existing devices on a $/kW*h basis, enabling commercial utilization of BHJ OPV for electrical power production. Initial markets for BJ OPV are believed to lie in flexible and portable electronics for remote power generation, trending towards on-site business and residential power generation as manufacturing techniques are up-scaled and refined.",

        "abstract": "Thermoelectric power plants and refineries use large quantities of water for cooling, placing large demands on conventional water resources. This is especially true in arid locations, where groundwater may be the only source. To ease the burden and free up conventional water resources for agricultural and potable water use, there is increasing interest in developing technologies that could allow thermoelectric power generating stations to use unconventional, brackish water that is unfit for agriculture or potable water use, for process cooling. Unfortunately, depending on the source, these brackish waters contains dissolved salts and other contaminants in the range of several thousand parts-per-million, which must be removed to make these waters suitable for cooling tower makeup water. TDA Research Inc., is developing a capacitive deionization (CDI) process that makes use of our inexpensive, high surface area, high capacity, and adjustable pore size electrodes. With our electrode technology, we can tune the properties of the electrodes to maximize their performance to process many types of brackish water, or a particular feed. Our technology is considerably less expensive than competing technologies such as ion exchange and reverse osmosis.In Phase I, TDA designed and built a CDI electrochemical cell and demonstrated that our proprietary electrodes have high capacities for removing dissolved salts in simulated brackish water. In addition, no degradation was observed after an eightycycle test, indicating that the electrodes are durable.  In Phase II, TDA will optimize the electrodes and the process conditions for CDI, and then design, build and test of a prototype unit with several real brackish water samples. The prototype will be tested at TDA and by our industrial partner at their facilities. The successful demonstration of the prototype will give use valuable data for designing and demonstrating a pilot scale test unit in Phase III.

The DOE also has an interest in promoting new technologies that take advantage of the excess reactive distillation capacity that has resulted from regulations on oxygenated fuel additives in the chemical industry. A new solid catalyzed reactive distillation process would address these interests while promoting the expansion of the domestic biodiesel industry by using waste oils and fats as a low cost feedstock. Without this technology advance, the growth of the biodiesel industry is limited because the current production processes rely, at least in part, on highly refined (expensive) vegetable oil, and there is a limited supply of vegetable oil in excess of what is needed for food and animal feed. The project will develop a new reactive distillation process using a proprietary solid catalyst that will allow the economical production of biodiesel from any vegetable or animal derived oil feedstock, including waste oils and fats. The Phase I project developed new solid acid catalyst for biodiesel production using high free fatty acid feedstocks. The catalysts were tested in packed bed reactors as well as a bench scale Oldershaw column operated at elevated temperature and pressure. A preliminary engineering and economic analysis was performed. The production methods for the solid catalyst will be scaled-up, and the catalyst and reactive distillation process will be thoroughly tested in long term tests using actual recycled oils, greases and animal fats. The project will include a detailed engineering and economic analysis for using the process to produce ASTM biodiesel from waste feedstocks.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop an inexpensive, yet very high quality detector system for protein crystallography, using Active Pixel Matrix CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) technology. We have based this effort on an existing CMOS imaging system for X rays, manufactured by Rad-icon Imaging Corporation. During Phase I of this proposed project, we increased the active area of the existing detector module 4-fold, by doubling its pixel size from 485m to 965m. Full-scale (50mm x 100mm) prototypes were fabricated and tested. We decreased its total noise by half, and we increased its readout precision from 12-bit (1 part in 4,096) to 14- bit (1 part in 16,384). Finally, we fabricated small (16pixel x16pixel) prototype devices whose readout was redesigned with 16-bit, correlated double sampling (CDS). We test these devices and verified that CDS reduces the readout noise by up to a factor of 6. In Phase II, we will fabricate full-sized sensors with correlated double sampling. We will also incorporate additional noise suppression technology, particularly multiple non-destructive readout. By fabricating the new sensors with multiple readout ports, we enable parallel readout, so we can read each pixel many (16) times in less than one second, thus improving the reliability of each measurement. These technical improvements will reduce noise sufficiently that we can implement 16-bit precision readout such that the noise is less than one part in 65,536 of the total range of the detector. We will then develop a complete detector system, incorporating 12 of these modules in a 2x6 array, covering an area of 20cm x 30cm. This system will be cooled to -600C, to reduce the noise even more. The X-ray detection systems we plan to bring to market will be technically very advanced relative to existing commercial units, yet they will cost about half as much. Our system will greatly improve the scientific effectiveness of structural molecular biology, and the cost effectiveness of their labor.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: 1). Protein crystallography is a mature and important enabling technology for the biological sciences and in pharmaceutical development, for determining the structures of large biological molecules: proteins and nucleic acids. The present proposal would enhance the efficacy of protein crystallography, by improving the X-ray detector these scientists use in their home laboratory, to record the diffraction data from protein crystals they have grown. The detector we wish to develop is faster, higher-resolution, higher precision, and more efficient than the detectors now used by protein crystallographers, and it will be half the price.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specific Aims: 1 - to refine a novel set of low cost patent pending interactive home AMD education and monitoring tools that combine tests evaluated favorably in Phase I together with additional novel tools currently in prototype. 2 - To clinically evaluate the effectiveness of these tools in reducing the delay between onset of symptoms and presentation, thus potentially minimizing vision loss. Significance: Macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in those over 60. New anti-VEGF treatments introduced in 2005 are effective if given early but patients typically wait for up to 5 months after the onset of symptoms to see a healthcare professional, leading to unnecessary vision loss. This results in incremental costs of care (which most often accrue to Medicare), a higher societal burden and lower patient quality of life. In earlier studies, we have identified critical reasons for patient delay and significant gaps in the current standard of care. Our solutions address the most significant reasons for patient delay in a cost-effective format capable of distribution to millions of patients, that, if successful, will accelerate presentation and minimize vision loss for a significant population of patients. Background: There are almost 10 million people with early AMD in the US, with the number expected to rise to 17.8 million by 2050. 2,3 of this population, 10 to 15% of dry patients will eventually convert to wet AMD.4 The conversion from dry to wet AMD can occur suddenly and has been historically difficult to recognize and respond to by patients. Delays in presentation of up to 5 months are common.8 In a recent study of patients with newly diagnosed wet AMD, the most common patient-cited reasons for delay were lack of confidence in symptoms, and a lack of appreciation of the urgency of the problem. The current gold standard of home monitoring, the Amsler Grid, developed in the 1940's, does not address the top reasons for delay, nor does it address the variety of symptoms that patients experience with advancing disease. New electronic technologies for improving home monitoring AMD have demonstrated sensitivity and specificity, but their cost and learning curve can limit broad-scale distribution. A solution is required that 1) addresses the multiple reasons for delay, 2) is low-cost and amenable to distribution across large populations, 3) includes multiple interactive elements that address patient compliance and individual needs, and 4) fosters appropriate and timely action. Research design and methods: 1) conduct focus group evaluation of current prototype tools. 2) Refine the prototypes based upon patient feedback. 3) Conduct a clinical evaluation of the performance of the novel tools, measuring drop in visual acuity prior to presentation after onset of wet AMD. If successful, tools will enable broad-scale outreach, reduce educational disparities, foster routine eye exams, help accelerate patient presentation, help reduce vision loss, and help lower the socioeconomic burden of AMD.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in adults over the age of 60.1 New injectable treatments introduced in 2005 are effective if given early but patients typically wait for up to 5 months after the onset of symptoms to see a healthcare professional, leading to unnecessary vision loss. This results in incremental costs of care (which most often accrue to Medicare), a higher societal burden and lower patient quality of life. The current study refines a patent pending novel group of low cost tools and assesses their ability to reduce presentation delay.",

        "abstract": "Multiple classes of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) are required to complete many modern, complex missions.  Just as with humans, UGVs typically specialize in a small subset of critical tasks.  Most work with UGV systems is based around the principle of making a platform optimally perform its tasks.  However, this approach will never yield a \"sum is greater than the parts\" solution because it lacks focus on cooperation between heterogeneous UGVs.  There is no methodology to elegantly and automatically fuse each UGV's capabilities into a greater, common framework.  For example, how can the IED-disposal capabilities of a TALON be fused with the long range capability of an autonomous Stryker?  During Phase I of Cooperative Control of Small Unmanned assets (CCSU), Robotic Research, LLC began combining state-of-the-art unmanned systems technologies together with algorithms that provide superior, cooperative control of heterogeneous unmanned systems.  Under the proposed Phase II effort, Robotic Research will expand on this work to create the prototype CCSU system.  Phase II will result in a system tested and demonstrated under a wide variety of relevant scenarios while utilizing numerous heterogeneous UGVs.",

        "abstract": "The proposed project is for the development of a low cost, high efficiency solar cooling system. The system makes use of novel low cost mid temperature solar collectors in conjunction with a unique solar driven continuously variable speed absorption chiller to provide cost effective air conditioning. The approach used in this effort is to prove the potential viability of critical components and control strategies for the operation of the solar driven chiller via design, fabrication and testing under Phase I of the project. Under Phase II, a full scale integrated system will be developed and tested. This development will address issues of design, component manufacturing, controls integration and performance optimization as well as economic viability. Under Phase I, the design, fabrication and testing of two different viable solar generator components for the chiller with co-firing capabilities was successfully completed. A novel low cost parabolic solar collector for medium temperature operation with tracking capability was developed and tested. Preliminary control strategies for the system were identified. An economic evaluation of the system was performed that showed attractive return on investment potential for the system in two locations studied. Under Phase II, the solar generator will be integrated into an air cooled continuously variable speed chiller with controls modified to include solar cooling and co-firing options. This chiller will undergo detailed performance testing. A full scale solar collector bank will be assembled and the chiller will be tested in conjunction with the solar collectors and an integrated control system. System costs will be detailed and system tests will be conducted over a period sufficient to determine economic viability. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The proposed system will be suitable for commercial, light commercial and residential air conditioning applications providing reduced energy costs and excellent return on investment. Peak power demand reduction will benefit commercial users and utilities. Reductions in the combustion of fossil fuels, saving of fuel resources and decreased CO2 generation will accrue. Good, high paying jobs for assembly, installation, marketing and sales of the product will be generated.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed project creates and proves an innovative wheelchair accessory, SAFESLIDEBOARD. SAFESLIDEBOARD is superior to currently available transfer boards that require use of both hands for the following reasons: (1) SAFESLIDEBOARD is an attached component of the armrest reducing the risk for falls that occur when the standard transfer board slides off the wheelchair or transfer surface; (2) Transfers can be performed by individuals with limited hand use, weight shift, and cognitive awareness to set up and transfer independently; and (3) SAFESLIDEBOARD is vertically secured directly under a flip back armrest (developed in Phase I) instead of being stowed behind or on the lap of the wheelchair user and thus cannot be dropped or misplaced. The proposed project supports the mission of the National Institutes on Aging by developing/refining technology to address  Special problems and needs of the aged,  particularly aged individuals with impaired mobility and hand use. The proposed Phase II project has a developmental phase, year 1, and an experimental phase, year 2. The Specific Aims are to: (1) Develop new prototypes of retrofitting armrest transfer board for wheelchairs; (2) Determine the effectiveness of SAFESLIDEBOARD; (3) Determine health care provider satisfaction with SAFESLIDEBOARD using qualitative, structured interview research techniques; and (4) Determine marketing options for SAFESLIDEBOARD. During the year 1, developmental phase, the Phase I prototype will be redesigned and fabricated to be lighter, stronger, and suitable for multiple wheelchairs - based on Phase I results. Aim 1 will complete seven tasks that include redesign of the: (1) transfer board model, (2) armrest adapter(arm assembly) to fit the new transfer board, (3) rear landing apparatus for flip-back armrest; (4) armrest tubing; (5) front attachment/seat cradle (6) connecting rod and swiveling hinge assembly; and (7) beta prototype production and ISO testing. During the year 2, experimental phase, clinical trials (N=72, 36 wheelchair users and 36 healthcare providers) will compare SAFESLIDEBOARD to the standard transfer board for bed, tub and toilet transfers. The target population is individuals post stroke but will not exclude other individuals who have difficulty using a standard transfer board. A mixed design approach will be used: (1) Prospective, repeated measures crossover (ABB, BAA, AAB, and BBA) for Aim 2; (2) Qualitative for Aim 3; and (3) Survey for Aim 4. Wheelchair user outcomes include: assistance required, safety, and features. Caregiver outcomes include: ease of installation, preference, pre-installed versus accessory, site of installation (right/left or both). Data will be analyzed using within subject repeated analyses, controlling for covariates, for Aim 2, and qualitative analyses based on grounded theory for Aim 3, and descriptive statistics for Aim 4, The projected Phase II end result is a market ready transfer device that passes ISO standards for a wheelchair armrest.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: One of the single most important factors allowing older adult wheelchair users to stay at home, living independent of caregivers, and free of debilitating injury, is their ability to transfer to and from their wheelchairs safely. Transfer boards, which are boards upon which the user slides into and out of their wheelchair, are often misplaced, difficult to set up and free to slide off of the wheelchair to cause falls. The purpose of this project is to develop easily installed flip back armrests that can be lowered with one hand to be used as attached transfer boards that never fall or get misplaced.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is responsible for hundreds of millions of cases and a million deaths annually. An ideal tool for eliminating Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), the causative agent of 99% of all malaria deaths, would be a highly effective vaccine that prevents blood stage infection and thereby prevents all disease and transmission. When radiation attenuated Pf sporozoites (Pf SPZ) are administered by bite of infected mosquitoes, gt 90% of human volunteers are protected for at least 10 months against experimental Pf challenge. Sanaria's goal is to develop and commercialize an attenuated Pf SPZ vaccine that prevents Pf blood stage infection in gt 90% of recipients. Such a vaccine has the potential for gt  1 billion annual revenues in markets in the developed and developing world. Sanaria has succeeded in establishing robust, reproducible, and consistent manufacture and release of clinical lots of its radiation attenuated PfSPZ Vaccine, received FDA approval for its IND, and in the 2nd quarter of 2009 will initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial to assess safety and protective efficacy of the PfSPZ Vaccine. After demonstrating safety, the goal is to move rapidly to safety and proof of concept efficacy studies, expanded Phase 2 studies and Phase 3 studies in Africa to support licensure. There is a clear path to taking this PfSPZ Vaccine to registration and commercialization. However, a number of experts believe that it would be preferable if the SPZ were attenuated by permanent genetic alteration (i.e. gene deletions) rather than by irradiation. This elegant, defined approach has the potential to be safer and might give rise to more potent attenuated SPZ. For our Phase I project, the goal was to produce at least one genetically modified Pf knock out (KO) clone that produced Pf SPZ that could 1) invade human hepatocytes, 2) develop in hepatocytes and produce proteins not expressed in SPZ, and 3) not be able to fully mature in hepatocytes (i.e. be fully attenuated). Our collaborative work has led to production of two single KO clones (p52 and fabI) that fulfill the 1st two goals, one of which (p52) has already been shown to fulfill all three, and a double KO clone (lacking p52 and p36) that has yet to be characterized. The single KO clones were created by single site crossover disruption and all three retain a selectable marker. Herein, we propose a systematic approach that will lead to the production of at least one Pf parasite clone optimized for attenuation, safety, potency, and suitability for manufacture. This involves deleting selected pairs of genes, each resulting in liver stage attenuation, using a double crossover strategy. This approach will maximize the likelihood of sustained attenuation and safety. Removal of selectable markers will eliminate the chance of inducing antibiotic resistance in the host or the environment. Testing of multiple doubly attenuated KO clones will maximize the prospects of identifying one that is optimal for gametocyte and SPZ production, attenuation, and potency. Process development and an engineering production campaign will produce genetically attenuated SPZ that fulfill regulatory requirements and can be manufactured and then tested in humans as a candidate vaccine.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A highly effective malaria vaccine would have an enormous public health benefit. Sanaria's attenuated malaria sporozoite vaccine (PfSPZ Vaccine) is expected to be highly effective and will be studied in clinical trials in 2009. The PfSPZ Vaccine is attenuated (weakened) by irradiation of each vaccine lot. This research aims to eliminate the need for irradiation in manufacturing a PfSPZ vaccine, by creating parasites that are attenuated by gene removal.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the obesity epidemic permeating all segments of society, novel weight loss tools with broad appeal and reach are essential. The pervasive use of personal mobile phones in the U.S. provides a unique opportunity to promote positive behavior change through timely and tailored health messages. We propose to develop a mobile phone based application, Text4Diet , designed to produce and maintain weight loss through improved diet and physical activity (PA) behaviors. Text4Diet  will build upon a novel text-message-based intervention, mDIET (mobile Dietary Intervention through Electronic Technology), recently found efficacious for weight loss among overweight/obese adults in an NCI-funded randomized controlled trial (R21 CA115615- 01A1; K Patrick, PI). To our knowledge the mDIET study is the first to produce evidence of the efficacy of text messages to promote weight loss among overweight/obese adults. The Text4Diet  system will embed the core mDIET technology into a larger web platform that supports commercialization. This includes initial web-based dietary and physical activity assessment to identify behaviors to target with tailored text and MMS (graphical and picture) messages. Text4Diet  then allows users to self-monitor weight; improve nutrition behaviors, such as increasing consumption of fiber, fruits and vegetables, decreasing consumption of dietary fat, and consuming appropriate portion sizes; improve PA behaviors; record and track step counts; and receive timely text message prompts and suggestions to serve as positive reminders and motivators for achieving their behavior change goals. Users also have access to an extensive online library containing nutrition and PA information and strategies to supplement the Text4Diet  mobile application. Text4Diet will be evaluated in a 9 month randomized controlled trial among overweight and obese (BMI of 25.0 to 39.9) men and women, aged 21- 65. The primary outcome will be change in weight (kg) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include: change in weight at 9 months, change in pedometer step counts, satisfaction with the Text4Diet  application, adherence to the intervention, eating behaviors and physical activity behaviors. Phase I activities will include: a) development of the Text4Diet  website supporting user enrollment and diet and physical activity assessment; b) automation of the administration and scoring of the diet and PA assessments; c) at least 500 new text and MMS messages addressing additional behaviors; d) expansion of the expert logic system to respond dynamically to a user's progress; e) inclusion of pedometer data into the text message logic, f) new software to produce step count graphs, g) completion of alpha system testing, and h) completion of usability testing of enrollment system. In Phase II, a 2 month beta test will be completed to evaluate the expanded Text4Diet  application developed during Phase I. The beta test results will be incorporated into the final system tested in the 9 month randomized controlled trial. Measurement will take place at 0, 6 and 9 months. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Given the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in the U.S., it is apparent that innovative and sophisticated weight loss tools are needed. Three-quarters of the U.S. population now carries a mobile phone. Text4Diet  will capitalize on this unique opportunity to facilitate weight loss and weight loss maintenance through the delivery of personalized and timely behavioral text messages.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dysfunction of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) results in diseases as diverse as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, dwarfism, color blindness, retina pigmentosa and asthma. GPCRs are also involved in depression, schizophrenia, sleeplessness, hypertension, impotence, anxiety, stress, renal failure, several cardiovascular disorders and inflammations. Unfortunately, only a handful of GPCR crystal structures are available in the public domain. Therefore, in order to employ structure-based approaches to the design of drugs that target GPCRs, there is a critical need to develop technology that can lead to the production of accurate models of GPCRs. An essential part of constructing accurate GPCR models is the proper treatment of the lipid bilayer membrane. We propose to develop a novel commercial software package capable of performing long length-scale and time-scale molecular dynamics simulations of all-atom GPCR models in coarse grain lipid bilayer/water environments. A recently introduced multi-scale methodology using simplified and computationally efficient coarse-grain representations of lipid bilayers and water in combination with atomistic models for proteins has been validated in exploratory studies. This mixed AA-CG methodology will be incorporated into a powerful, user-friendly commercial software package directed at pharmaceutical and biotechnology researchers focusing on development of drugs that target class A GPCRs.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are one of the most important families of target proteins for the development of new medicines; approximately 50-60% of all approved drugs on the market today target GPCRs and nearly all pharmaceutical companies are actively investigating GPCRs. GPCRs are involved in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, dwarfism, color blindness, retina pigmentosa, asthma, depression, schizophrenia, sleeplessness, hypertension, impotence, anxiety, stress, renal failure, cardiovascular disorders, and inflammations. We propose to develop easy-to-use commercial software aimed at producing accurate models for GPCRs that can be used in the design of new medicines that target this important superfamily of proteins.",

An interactive DVD platform will be utilized to provide a menu of engaging activities for students as well as readily-employed resources for teachers. The student-centered components will include: 1) an age- appropriate short film that is designed to introduce the reality and tragedy of FASD and to stimulate discussion of prevention approaches; 2) an exploration featuring micrographic images and computer animations that highlight the remarkable similarities between normal human development and that of an FASD animal model (the Medaka fish); 3) a virtual experiment illustrating the effects of alcohol on brain development in the fish model system; 4) a post- laboratory multimedia summary relating these experimental findings to the insult on human brain structure and function that prenatal alcohol exposure causes; and 5) a selection of proposed student-driven prevention activities. The resources for teachers will include: 1) instructive FASD background materials; 2) sample lesson plans; 3) student assessment instruments; and 4) alignment with National Education Standards. Each of the components of the curriculum, as well as the DVD itself, will be formally evaluated and the results will be used to guide final production. National distribution of this product will be facilitated via collaborative arrangements with well-respected science and health education companies (Realityworks, Inc. www.realityworks.com and Carolina Biological Supply Company www.carolina.com). This curriculum will fill a critical educational void and promises to aid in reducing common, yet preventable, birth defects.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy can result in a spectrum of birth defects estimated to affect 40,000 babies each year in our country. Each of these birth defects is entirely preventable if a woman avoids drinking during pregnancy. Educational resources focused on prevention of alcohol-induced birth defects are limited. The proposed science-based health curriculum for high school students will provide resources for teachers and students to heighten awareness about effects of alcohol on development of the brain and behavior, and thereby promote prevention of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.",

The one limiting factor for all of the above extremely important and compelling technologies is waste heat management that can remove several kilowatts of waste heat while simultaneously providing a low thermal resistance to that keeps the semiconductor junction temperature as low as possible. The reason for maintaining a low junction temperature is that all semiconductors perform better at lower temperature. SRL has recently demonstrated the dramatic potential of our advanced thermal management technology by extracting more than a kilowatt of optical power from a centimeter-wide laser-diode (LD) bar, which represents a 10X increase over the state-of-the-art. This successful demonstration was completed by attaching the LD chip to a pre-prototype, low thermal-resistance, high thermal-capacity, enhanced-performance impingement-cooler (EPIC).

The development of this 4-micron source, which will represent a factor-of-10 increase in high-repetition-rate, pulsed mid-IR power over the current state of the art, is applicable to improved jamming of missile seekers that sense radiation of this wavelength. Such IR-seeking missiles, also known as \"heat-seeking\" missiles, have for many years posed a grave threat to both military and commercial aircraft.

For ease of use, most applications require coupling the LD photons to an optical fiber.   Attaching the LD-die to a heat-sink is a key packaging procedure.  The heat-sink material is generally copper since it is the lowest thermal-resistance metal but its CTE (coefficient of thermal expansion) is significantly larger than the LD-die.  Unless compensated, this CTE mismatch leads to mechanical stress which in turn degrades LD performance, lifetime and fiber-coupling efficiency.   The use of a malleable-metal solder, consisting of either an indium-based or a lead-based alloy, is the present solution to the CTE mismatch problem between the LD and a copper heat-sink. Unfortunately, indium-alloy solders are subject to thermo-migration and electro-migration whereas lead-alloy solders do not comply with RoHS (Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances) regulations.

        "abstract": "In the United States, several high profile outbreaks of waterborne illness during the past 15 years have highlighted the need for a solution to drinking water contamination. Several recent studies suggest that approximately 20 percent of surface and ground source waters in the United States are contaminated with viruses. There are very few data on virus occurrence in drinking water, however, which is mainly attributed to the absence of efficient methodologies that enable concentration and detection of viruses from water samples. Most current methods are labor or time intensive, expensive, or impractical. Therefore, there is an acute need for the development of concentration and detection technologies that enable efficient assay of viruses in water samples, and these methods should be designed to be conducted directly in the field. Scientific Methods, Inc. (SMI) has designed a concentration device that can capture viruses from large amounts of water. The device completely eliminates the need for a secondary concentration step and also increases the speed of concentration.\nThe objective of this Phase II SBIR project is the development of an integrated detection method that includes capture of human enteric viruses as well as coliphages from large volumes of water followed by detection of the viruses by multiple real-time, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). During the Phase II period SMI plans to develop a multiple isothermal RT-PCR assay so that both the viral capture and detection steps can be completed directly in the field. Also, in-field sampling of ground and surface water sources will be conducted, and the ability of the integrated capture and detection method to assay for the presence of viruses in these waters will be demonstrated. It is expected that water testing companies, research laboratories, municipalities, and government agencies will make use of the capture and concentration device, either in combination with their own downstream detection assays or with the isothermal-based RT-PCR assay that will be created during Phase II.",

The ultra low sulfur diesel fuel typically found in the field has very low interfacial tension allowing water to be present in the form of very fine droplets which pass through conventional water separators and end up in the fuel injection system.  This project will quantify and develop a functionalized multiwall carbon nanotube-based water separator to be used with all ultra low sulfur diesel fuels on the market with nearly 100% water removal efficiency.  The objective is to enhance the separator performance to cost ratio by working to further increase the separation efficiency and lower the media cost through process scaling and materials development.\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of the project are focused on benefits related to enhanced ultra low sulfur diesel fuel separation, including more consistent fuel delivery to the engine, longer injector/engine life, better combustion of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel, lower maintenance costs, new jobs enabled by the use of high-sulfur fuel reserves, and more efficient combustion of bio-fuels.  Reduced water content in the fuel will help to improve performance of the high pressure fuel injection systems, maintain tolerances of the fuel injection system components, and reduce maintenance costs.",

DUV LEDs operating in the spectral region from 240 nm to 365 nm are of great importance for medical, bio-analytical, sensing, and homeland security technologies.  This project aims to improve the LED efficiency and lifetime by improvements in the material quality, doping, and device design.  These enhancements will lay the groundwork for large-scale penetration of high volume markets, such as global sanitation and disinfection.  This Phase II project will achieve efficient multiple pass extraction in transparent epitaxial structures through use of high-quality MEMOCVD doped p-AlInGaN top contact layers.  Achieving an improved quality of highly doped p-AlInGaN layers will allow creation of a low-cost, high power semiconductor DUV radiation source with wall plug efficiency exceeding 5% and operation lifetimes longer than 5,000 hours. \nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will originate from the market penetration of DUV LEDs into existing markets that require compact and environmentally friendly UV radiation sources.  This project will also allow penetration into new applications that were previously unattainable due to the inherent limitations of existing UV lamps or lasers.  The primary markets for these devices include bio-medical and analytical instrumentation, fluorescence sensing, ink curing, phototherapy and water/air disinfection.  This new technology for manufacturing high-efficiency and long-lifetime DUV devices will allow these semiconductor light sources to have a price point which is competitive with the mature UV lamp technology.  This will allow the increased use of an environmentally friendly, mercury-free UV technology for a variety of applications, which will result in a reduction of toxic waste and in the costs associated with mercury lamp disposal.  The purification, sterilization, and early warning applications enabled by these new DUV LED sources will also result in an improved quality of life, particularly in the developing world.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall Phase II objective is to continue the development/validation of new system biology computational tools for inferencing gene regulatory relationships from gene expression data obtained from multi-perturbation gene knockout experiments. NIH's Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) is an initiative to generate a public resource of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells containing a null mutation in every gene in the mouse genome - important for deciphering the complexity of biological systems of mice and ultimately man. It is anticipated that a new generation of multi-perturbation/KO studies with a biological system perspective will emerge in all areas of biomedical research. New computational tools for deciphering genetically regulated responses (genotype-to- phenotype signaling cascades) will significantly aid in advancing our understanding of the molecular targets and mechanisms of many diseases. Today, researchers need new tools to deal with and decipher the tremendous volumes of gene/protein expression data generated from multi-perturbation investigations. Seralogix's Phase II efforts focus on improving and creating new functionality for learning larger scale (biological system level) gene regulatory networks and integrating this network learning functionality into our existing Biosystem Analysis Framework (BAF). Our BAF is comprised of a suite of integrated mathematical analysis and modeling tools and databases. The BAF core tools are based on Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs). DBNs allow us to systematically integrate prior knowledge with empirical time-course expression data for modeling, pattern recognition and eventually biological system genetic network learning as proposed herein. Our algorithmic innovation, proven feasible in Phase I, is the incorporation of biological prior knowledge and multi-perturbation data with our DBNs for enabling a genetic network learning approach. This approach is based on well established Bayesian statistical methods that we adopt in a sampling scheme enhanced with biological prior knowledge to overcome the intrinsic difficulty of structure learning from sparse and noisy gene expression data. We show in Phase I that prior-knowledge, coupled with Bayesian network learning methods and multi-perturbation/KO experimental data, resulted in reliable gene regulatory relationship identification. We believe this approach can be scaled up, leading to a more robust mathematical/functional system level model. Further, we believe that integrating genetic network learning into Seralogix's BAF will provide an important new tool for identifying novel gene regulatory relations and insights into disease processes and have significant commercial potential for Seralogix. We will be collaborating with the Texas Institute of Genomic Medicine as a provider of mouse gene expression KO data who are studying the genomic causes of birth defects. Our Phase II aims include: 1) scaling our approach to support biological system level network learning; 2) statistical assessment and biological validation of our learned networks; 3) developing new tools/techniques to interrogate the resulting system network models so biologist can extract important knowledge.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is one of the ultimate goals for modern biological research to fully elucidate the intricate interplays and the regulations of the molecular determinants that control health and disease, to name a few, cell cycling, developmental biology, aging, and the progressive and recurrent pathogenesis of complex diseases. Having new computational methods (software tools) for identifying and deciphering genetically regulated response (e.g. signaling cascades) will significantly aid in advancing our understanding of the molecular targets and mechanisms of many diseases of high public health concern. The discovery of underlying genetic function and relationships will be extremely important for making medical breakthroughs, especially for the safe and effective development of drugs and diagnostics. Today, researchers are hindered by the tremendous volumes of gene/protein expression data generated from knockout investigations. Computational tools that transform these volumes of raw genomic/proteomic data to actionable knowledge via mathematical modeling will help guide and accelerate researchers' investigations of genetic disorder and identifying targets of intervention and treatment.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 1.1 million conceptuses and fetuses die spontaneously each year, nearly 28,000 after 20 weeks' gestation. 12.5% of all infants are delivered prematurely, and the cost of care for the prematurely born is nearly 27 billion dollars annually. Prenatal assessment is currently dominated by ultrasound-based techniques; however, these are limited in their ability to evaluate cardiac arrhythmia, conduction, ischemia, and heart rate variability. Recently, we and other researchers have shown that a relatively new technique, fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG), holds great promise to provide specific diagnostic and electrophysiologic data to better manage pregnancies in which the fetus suffers from cardiac disease, arrhythmia, is undergoing interventional procedures, or is at high risk for intrauterine demise. It can provide further antenatal reassurance, lowering unnecessary pre-term delivery of high risk pregnancies. Currently in the Midwest, women are traveling over 100 miles for this procedure when their doctor has identified an arrhythmia or high- risk condition. Nearly 200 fetal arrhythmia pregnancies have been studied to date at the University of Wisconsin, the only dedicated fMCG center in the United States. This represents a small fraction of those pregnancies for which ready access to fMCG could have positively impacted patient care. The goal of this research program is to construct and operate a prototype mobile imaging system to promote the development and adoption of fMCG. The project is unusually challenging and extensive in scope; however, we believe that our consortium of commercial and university partners has the necessary experience and expertise to implement this ambitious concept. In the Phase I study, we will conduct a magnetic site survey, fabricate and test prototype shields, and analyze various sensor configurations in order to optimize the performance of the equipment and to establish the technical feasibility of obtaining high-quality fMCG recordings in a mobile system. The goal of the Phase II project is to construct a prototype mobile fMCG system that will travel between hospitals in a 4-state region, making this technology available to a much greater patient population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed research will advance prenatal health care by promoting the development and adoption of fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG), a promising new technology for fetal evaluation. This will be accomplished by constructing a mobile fMCG system that will travel between hospitals in a 4-state region. This technology has proven to be extremely valuable in the management of fetuses with cardiac complications and has the potential to shed light the causes of unexplained sudden fetal death.",

A high cholesterol level is well-known risk factors for heart disease. Although blood cholesterol can be lowered using a number of marketed drugs, of which statins are the leading drugs, only 38% of patients taking these drugs are achieving the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals set by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP). Furthermore, patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia who have markedly elevated cholesterol levels respond poorly to current drug therapy, and are at very high risk of premature cardiovascular disease. These and other patients will dramatically benefit from an aggressive treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The long-term goal of this work is to develop novel drugs for cholesterol lowering. Our therapeutic target is the protease proprotein convertase subtilisin-like kexin type 9 (PCSK9). PCSK9 controls the degradation of the LDL receptor (LDLR) in the liver and thereby contributes to cholesterol homeostasis. PCSK9 is synthesized as a precursor protein that undergoes processing between the prodomain and catalytic domain. This processing is required for PCSK9 to be secreted and to undertake its biological activity. Our goal is to identify compounds that prevent the processing of PCSK9, thus prevent its secretion and its ability to participate in the degradation of the LDL receptor. To achieve our Phase I goal, we have integrated virtual (computer) screening methods with cell-based assays and consequently identified five screening hits. As part of this Phase II proposal, we plan to expand and optimize our hits, and confirm the ability of selected compounds to stabilize the LDLR and decrease the LDL-C level using in situ and in vivo studies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the US. A high cholesterol level is a well-known risk factor for heart disease. Although blood cholesterol can be lowered using a number of marketed drugs, these drugs do not treat a segment of the population with very high cholesterol. Our goal is to develop new cholesterol lowering drugs that have an effect on all individuals with high cholesterol levels, including that segment of the population having very high cholesterol levels.",

Today, only 2 percent of Americans wear a hearing aid, while it is believe that at least 10 percent of Americans could benefit from a hearing assistive device.   Innovations at the microphone level have a direct positive impact on hearing aid performance.   This work is focused on commercializing a new type of MEMS microphone that will set a new benchmark with respect to the combination of high fidelity and small size.   A revolutionary approach is taken in which interference of light is used to detect sound.  The system combines optical and mechanical elements fabricated on silicon with semiconductor lasers and optoelectronics to form a robust capsule consistent in size with the smallest microphones demonstrated to date, but with fidelity rivaled only by microphones 100x larger in size.  With ultra-low noise microphones,  hearing aid system developers will be able to  integrate more advanced algorithms aimed at solving a long-standing problem for hearing aid  users known as the  cocktail party  problem.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will investigate a novel Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) microphone based on new design principles.   By abandoning the design principles of traditional microphones (both MEMS and full-scale), a vastly superior acoustical design is being explored that has resulted in substantial improvements in fidelity and size reduction (15 dB signal to noise ration[SNR] improvement over existing commercial directional microphones, and roughly 100x smaller in volume).   Furthermore, as demonstrated in Phase I, the microphones have an inherently directional response with the benefit of focusing on a speaker or event of interest while rejecting ambient background noise.  These attributes make this innovation ideal for addressing an emerging need of high volume consumer communication device manufactures who are looking for acoustic sensing innovations with the unique combination of high performance + low manufacturing cost.  The objective of this Phase II innovation is to continue prototyping efforts from Phase I to the point of pilot scale manufacture.    This effort will entail finite element modeling and design optimization of the new device structure, fabrication of 2nd generation prototypes, and experimentation in collaboration with customers from several different microphone sectors including hearing aids and cellular phones.  \nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is based on an enabling capability:  the introduction of advanced audio features (e.g. directionality and high fidelity) into a suite of consumer communication devices.  The primary customer focus for this innovation is high volume consumer communication device manufacturers.   New applications on their horizon demand improvements in microphone component performance.   There are presently several commercial suppliers of MEMS microphones.   All use variations of a traditional microphone architecture which has proven incapable of addressing high SNR applications.  Additional markets and applications for this innovation include acoustic instrumentation, performance audio, military and defense, intelligence gathering, speech recognition (e.g. in laptop computers), and hearing aids.  Addressing hearing aid markets will have a societal impact as well, as patient satisfaction with hearing aid devices is presently very low.  Innovations at the microphone and signal processing level have the potential to improve this greatly.  The innovation is also expected to have other audiological applications including use in hearing health monitoring systems based on otoacoustic principles.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prescription drug abuse is a growing concern for several reasons. The practice of obtaining multiple prescriptions and early refills poses a number of health risks for patients who use prescription drugs; because multiple prescriptions or early refills are not closely monitored, it is sometimes up to the primary care physician to properly screen for signs of potential prescription drug abuse and addiction. Clinicians in primary care settings should be equipped with the knowledge to recognize the signs of potential abuse, as well as the steps necessary to address patients who are deemed to be addicted to, or abusing, prescription drugs. The interaction can be difficult, because many patients are either unaware of or evasive about their addiction or abuse. Providing simulation training to help prepare clinicians to better screen patients for potential prescription drug abuse and to identify treatment methods to help these high-risk patients deal with their chronic pain would be very effective. For the Phase II application, SIMmersion LLC, in cooperation with Dr. Michael Fleming of the University of Wisconsin, proposes to develop and evaluate a full-featured interactive simulation to train clinicians in primary care settings how to screen for prescription drug misuse and apply pain management plans. The proposed training simulation will allow physicians and other primary healthcare practitioners to practice the detection and management of prescription opioid misuse in patients suffering from chronic pain. The ideal outcome would be that clinicians become more proficient and comfortable with these skills, and therefore more likely to use them as a routine part of their practice with all patients, thereby reducing the number of people being harmed by the misuse of prescription drugs. To evaluate the efficacy of the simulation training system, Dr. Fleming and his research team will conduct an educational trial. One hundred students and practitioners will be randomly assigned to usual education on prescription drug abuse and misuse (n=50) or to the SIMmersion training program (n=50). Subjects will complete baseline and 6-month post-measures of knowledge and clinical behavior. The measures will include a knowledge pencil-and-paper test and standardized patients. The research will be conducted at the UW Health Sciences Clinical Teaching and Assessment Center. The simulated patient program, using the SIMmersion technology, is expected to significantly advance our ability to train medical professionals in human processing and interaction skills. We expect the end result of the SBIR grant will include improved skills among healthcare professionals in prescription drug screening and application of pain management plans, as well as improved patient outcomes for those who use prescription drugs to manage chronic pain.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Innovative and economical technologies that assist primary care clinicians in acquiring competence in screening patients for prescription drug abuse and chronic pain management could help increase the frequency and efficacy of screening for potential abuse. Screening patients for prescription drug abuse in primary care settings and implementing treatment management plans may help identify abuse sooner and lead to life-changing interventions, which could reduce the negative impact of prescription and other drug abuse and addiction.",

In addition to its value in the elementary classroom, the Digital Den offers parents, caregivers and after school staff a tool for optimal literacy learning without the necessity of prior training in literacy instructional practices. In Phase I, Sirius Thinking will test the feasibility of the Digital Reading Den through a mixed-design study of focus group interviews and assessments to gauge the Digital Den's usability and appeal for children, its promise for literacy and vocabulary learning, and its potential as a classroom-based supplement or addition to an after school program. Once feasibility is established, Sirius Thinking will further refine the components of the Den in a Phase II production stage, produce multiple modules of the Digital Den, and embark on a large- scale experimental research study in after school programs at three underperforming elementary schools. Phase II research will aim to establish the effectiveness of the Digital Den as an educational tool by comparing growth in vocabulary and early literacy skills between children who engage with the complete Digital Den, children who engage only with the interactive storybook and animated dictionary, and children who engage only with print versions of the storybook. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sirius Thinking, Ltd.'s proposed Digital Reading Den is aimed at increasing the early literacy skills and vocabulary of low-income native English speaking and Spanish speaking kindergartners and first graders. Using a computer-based platform, the Digital Den features a plethora of multimedia material - video clips, interactive storybooks, an animated dictionary, Spanish translations of words and content, music, etc. - that systematically and synergistically reinforce early literacy curricula. The Digital Den is designed for use in after school programs, as well as in classrooms, as a motivating and entertaining supplement to traditional literacy instruction.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a Recommendation System that offers users links to relevant pages as they browse the Web. As users interact with a Web page annotation platform, they use tools, such as highlighters and sticky notes, to annotate pages. The System is able to leverage these annotations to accurately model the user's information need, and to deliver high-quality recommendations. This Phase II project builds upon a prototype developed in Phase I, applying techniques from the information retrieval and natural language processing research communities to improve recommendation quality. This project encompasses primary research in document modeling, index representations and retrieval models. Further, the project proposes interesting synergies by drawing in methods from the text categorization, topic detection and tracking and collaborative filtering communities. \nThe Broader Impact of this work lies in its potential to positively impact the task of doing research on the web. The company's nascent Web annotation Platform promises to save users time, reducing cost and frustration by providing content management and organizational structures that allow them to preserve state between web research sessions. The next step is to deploy the Recommendation System to bring users the next page they need before they even realize they need it. Individual users and businesses alike will derive value from the time savings provided by the company's Platform and its Recommendation System.",

Recent results with nanocomposite films have shown that Figures of Merit (ZT) much greater than 1.0 are possible at laboratory-scale; however a technology road map with the view towards large-volume and low-cost manufacturing processes of such TE devices has not previously been envisioned. These demonstrated results must now be transitioned into commercial applications. SMI has teamed with a leading thermoelectric (TE) research group in order to optimize and convert high-performance solid state TE materials developed at laboratory-scale into economically producible products for DOE desired products, military needs, and commercial applications in general. We propose to develop a scalable manufacturing process of large-volume and cost-effective nanocomposite TE device films with ZT values exceeding 2.0.Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Conversion of heat directly to electrical energy is needed for many DOE programs and, following solar energy, will be an important part of many energy generation needs. The realization of high volume production of rugged, high-efficiency, and low-cost thermoelectric devices will have substantial positive impacts on reducing instrument size, weight and cost ",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To more efficiently meet the need and demand for hepatitis C virus (HCV) information and health communication skills among thousands of addiction counselors throughout the US, this project aims to adapt an effective, accredited, trainer-delivered HCV training ( STOP HEP C training ) for addiction counselors into an interactive, tailored, self-paced, easily accessible, accredited, web-based computer-assisted instruction (CAI) program. Addiction counselors sorely need this information and these skills in view of the fact that of the 4 million HCV-infected people in the US (4 times as many as HIV ), the majority are former or current drug users who often lack critically needed medical support in their communities. As a consequence, when they enter drug treatment programs, most drug users are uneducated about HCV transmission and the potential dire consequences if HCV-infected. However, addiction counselors are optimally situated to support their clients' HCV related needs. While the NIDA-funded STOP HEP C training was developed and found to be effective in increasing counselors' HCV knowledge and health communication with clients, the demand for the STOP HEP C training far exceeds the capacity to deliver it in a trainer-facilitated format. The CAI offers an optimal way to disseminate this critically needed, evidence-based, and theoretically grounded training that retains its advantages and addresses its limitations in the current format while doing so at a reduced per-person cost of delivery. During Phase I, this project: 1) revised and updated the entire curriculum; 2) adapted two of the STOP HEP C training modules into a CAI script; 2) convened an Expert Advisory Panel that evaluated the CAI script; 3) developed a self-directed prototype of the 2 modules: an introductory module with limited interactivity and an advanced highly interactive module individually tailored for either Drug Free Treatment Providers (DFTP) or Methadone-Maintenance Treatment Providers (MMTP); and 4) through qualitative and quantitative data analyses, assessed the learning effectiveness of the prototypes with a sample of potential consumers. This CAI will be superior to other currently available HCV trainings as it will provide information on health communication strategies; enable counselors to obtain counseling certification credits; be easily accessible, cost-effective, and self-paced; provide tailored information reflecting the treatment modality in which individual counselors work; and increase comprehension and retention of the material due to the interactive presentation of the information. The commercialization of the completed CAI will benefit from the secured support of regional and national associations serving addiction counselors, and businesses that have expertise in marketing health provider trainings and CAI products. In addition to sending product brochures to the extensive mailing lists of these businesses and associations, and placing advertisements on their websites with high exposure, we will market the CAI by demonstrating it at the national addiction provider conferences.

Recent advances in HIV prevention technology transfer, a process by which effective interventions are identified by researchers, translated for practitioner audiences, disseminated, and re-implemented (Card et al., 2001; Neumann and Sogolow, 2000), are beginning to bridge the gap between research and practice in the United States (US) (Institute of Medicine, 2001). No similar resources exist for health practitioners, educators, and researchers in developing countries. The proposed project will provide health practitioners and researchers from developing countries with key resources that facilitate access to, replication of, and re-evaluation of efficacious behavioral HIV prevention interventions. Specifically, the project will (1) Develop the HIV/AIDS Prevention Program Archive for Developing Countries (HAPPA-DEV), a collection of HIV prevention program kits containing all the materials needed to replicate and re-evaluate behavioral intervention programs that have been shown to be efficacious (by rigorous evaluation research) in preventing HIV infection or its risk-related behavioral antecedents among youth and adults in developing country settings; (2) Develop an innovative, research-based Program Adaptation Toolkitgtin a customized version to augment HAPPA-DEV program boxes as well as in a stand- alone version to use with empirically-validated programs acquired from other sourcesgtthat will build practitioners' capacity to tailor effective behavioral programs to new target populations and contexts, while retaining fidelity to the programs' core components; and (3) Develop a program LOCator and USage (LOCUS) tool to assist users in identifying prevention interventions in the archive best suited to their needs and settings, and to give users usage and implementation tips for each HAPPA-DEV program. In Phase I, efficacious interventions were identified and selected by a Scientist Expert Panel and prototypes of all products were developed and subjected to usability testing with HIV prevention professionals. In Phase II, the Scientist Expert Panel will identify and select a second set of programs for inclusion in the HAPPA-DEV collection; the product prototypes developed in Phase I will be modified per the results of the Phase I usability tests; usability tests will be conducted on the revised products; all products will be finalized and developed in their entirety; and a dissemination/implementation study will be conducted to assess the program adaptation process and experiences of agencies implementing the HAPPA-DEV programs.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV prevention practitioners in the developing world have had little help in identifying behavioral interventions that have been shown to be effective in their or other regions, in acquiring materials from effective intervention programs, and in adapting the interventions to their target populations and contexts. The resources developed under the auspices of this project will provide health practitioners and researchers from developing countries (and their US collaborators) with key resources that facilitate access to, replication of, and re-evaluation of efficacious behavioral HIV prevention interventions.",

        "abstract": "Thermal barrier coatings are increasingly being used in advanced power plant and industrial gas turbines to protect metal components from the hot gas stream.  Their use improves the durability of turbine parts and increases efficiency of operation.  However, premature failure remains a critical concern.  It is very important to have a non-destructive evaluation technique for quality control and to detect early damage of thermal barrier coatings during use. Current inspection methods are either destructive or do not provide sufficient evaluation of the coating.  An optical, nondestructive inspection method for thermal barrier coatings based on a technology known as optical coherence tomography is being developed.  This technology will provide unprecedented imaging of the thermal barrier coating layers and structure and will be capable of detecting damaged coatings and conditions indicative of degradation of the coating.  In Phase I, a high-speed instrument capable of nondestructively imaging subsurface structures in thermal barrier coatings was constructed and tested.  The dependence of imaging performance on various instrument components and parameters were investigated.  The feasibility of this approach was confirmed and a design for a Phase II prototype was developed.  In Phase II, an optimized instrument will be constructed and tested.  Nondestructive inspection of thermal barrier coating samples subjected to different degrees of thermal aging will be performed.  An algorithm for predicting the remaining service life of thermal barrier coatings based on optical coherence tomography data and other nondestructive testing will be developed and validated. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Development of this technology will allow better quality control inspection of thermal barrier coating coated turbine parts at manufacturing and maintenance facilities, will allow identification of coatings that are close to failure.  These capabilities will lead to cost savings for turbine parts manufacturers since destructive testing for quality control will be eliminated.  Substantial operations savings can also be expected if this technology can help maximize the useful life of components or indicate when failure is about to occur.  Unplanned shutdowns are extremely costly to the power industry and its customers.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Envenomations by the brown recluse spider, Loxosceles reclusa, are a significant source of morbidity in endemic regions of the United States, and misdiagnoses are common. A survey of physicians in the endemic area has shown the economic viability of an accurate diagnostic test for these spider bites. Development and testing of an optimized Loxosceles venom assay will present significant challenges. Unlike the routine construction of ELISAs dedicated to the detection of a single protein, this ELISA will detect venom containing multiple proteins, including a unique physiologically active protein- sphingomyelinase D (SMD) abundantly present in the venom. In preliminary research, our polyclonal assay has shown good sensitivity and good in-vitro specificity. Our research shows that identifiable amounts of venom in clinical envenomations are present for at least seven days. In rabbits, our polyclonal assay allows identification of venom on the surface for as long as two weeks. The limits of sensitivity, in-vivo specificity, and the duration of detection are unknown. Phase I should allow determination of the smallest amount of venom detectable as well as the clinical time limits for in-vivo duration of sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Monoclonal antibodies will be isotyped and quantities raised in a bioreactor to perform checkerboard analysis. This analysis will allow determination of an optimal combination of L. reclusa monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. A kit assay will result from Phase I, allowing multi-site testing in Phase II. These clinical studies will allow development of a lateral flow assay or microtiter plate assay, with the goal of FDA device approval and marketing. Clinical application of an optimized assay would save the morbidity and expense due to inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of various skin conditions with presentations similar to Loxosceles envenomations. Techniques used in the successful detection of this spider venom are directly applicable to bites from S. American Loxosceles species, responsible for additional deaths each year. The swab venom assay technique could be applicable to envenomations from numerous species    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Bites of the brown recluse spider, Loxosceles reclusa, cause considerable morbidity and occasional mortality in the Midwest.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain remains a major burden on society, significantly affecting millions of people and costing the populace billions annually. Despite major advances made to our understanding of pain, very few new therapies have successfully translated to clinical care. A particular shortfall in this translation is the lack of a high-throughput, commercially available in vivo assay. To address this deficit, we are refining our novel operant behavioral system for assessing pain in rodents. The central hypothesis is that operant assays can provide a sensitive, reliable, and clinically relevant way to evaluate sensory and nociceptive processing. Three specific aims will be investigated: (1) to evaluate a peltier thermal-stimulus system for operant pain testing; (2) to develop and optimize the software control of the operant pain-testing system; and (3) to evaluate multiple-linked operant behavior box units. We will achieve these aims using the innovative operant system that we developed in the Phase I grant, which assesses thermal pain in a reward-conflict paradigm. The rationale for the proposed research is that a software-driven, in vivo system will allow for a high- throughput approach for completing behavioral pain and analgesic studies. We are developing and commercializing an innovative product that will meet these needs. We are particularly well suited to complete this work, given the pairing of Stoelting Company's expertise in developing the product and Drs. Neubert and Caudle's pain-research experience. We completed all of the Phase I proposal's milestones, and this Phase II grant will build on our success. This product line could significantly reduce the time for new pain-relieving therapies to be screened and evaluated, greatly enhancing the opportunity for discovery of a superior analgesic.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful development of this reliable, high-throughput operant pain-assessment device would lead to commercial success through both academic and pharmaceutical institutions. This commercialization would create a method to more quickly convey new viable pain treatments from bench to bedside; if this helped accelerate even one new effective analgesic therapy, there would be tremendous societal benefit. This project will provide a key step in reaching this goal of advancing translational pain research.",

Although surgical excision of the primary tumor is curative for the majority of squamous and basal cell skin cancers, approximately 10% of primary or recurrent non-melanoma skin cancers present as complex, perineural, or locally invasive tumors that are more difficult to manage by surgery alone. Tumor recurrence near the site of the primary tumor remains a predominant cause of treatment failure. The ultimate goal of this Fast-Track SBIR proposal is to develop a novel bio-engineered tissue therapeutic that will prevent the spread or recurrence of locally-invasive or complex skin cancers through the sustained, expression of a potent immunostimulatory cytokine at the site of a recently resected tumor. Phase I proposes to generate keratinocyte-specific expression vectors and demonstrate production of bioactive cytokine from transformed keratinocytes. The isolation and characterization of a panel of stably-transfected keratinocytes will identify three candidate clones producing high, medium, and low levels of cytokine expression for further evaluation in Phase II. During Phase II, the most promising clones will be evaluated for karyotype, tumorigenicity, and transgene configuration. Using a murine xenograft model, the ability of these candidate clones to suppress the growth of human tumors in vivo will be assessed. The clone that exhibits the greatest tumor growth suppression will be identified as the leading candidate for further preclinical development. A master cell bank will be prepared from this clone according to current Good Manufacturing Practices. This cell bank will be qualified using a panel of tests recommended by the FDA for characterization of cell lines used to produce biological products. Successful completion of the research outlined in this Fast-Track proposal will generate critical pre-clinical safety and efficacy data that will support the filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the FDA for evaluation of this technology in human clinical trials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The National Cancer Institute projects that more than 1,000,000 cases of skin cancer are expected to be diagnosed in the United States in 2008, including more than 62,000 new cases of melanoma. Although most cases of skin cancer can be treated surgically, tumor recurrence near the original tumor site is the leading cause of treatment failure. The goal of this project is to develop a living skin substitute that will express a factor known to inhibit the growth of human tumors, in addition to providing factors that promote the healing of skin wounds. This product has the potential to prevent the spread or recurrence of residual tumor cells following surgical removal of primary skin cancers.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Burns and trauma to the skin affect an estimated 1.25 million Americans each year. Extensive damage to the skin has serious repercussions, leading to dehydration, increased metabolic load, entry of toxic substances, immunosuppression, and wound infection. Currently, there are no full-thickness skin substitutes approved for use in treating these debilitating and life-threatening injuries. In addition to these forms of acute skin damage, chronic non-healing wounds are a significant medical problem and are expected to increase in frequency as the US population ages. The care of patients with severe skin wounds represents an enormous cost that can be reduced significantly by altering the current wound care paradigm through the cost-effective manufacture of innovative and efficacious wound care products.  The proposed work will improve upon Stratatech's established production processes for StrataGraft(R) tissue, an innovative, clinically-tested skin substitute for the treatment of traumatic and chronic skin wounds. StrataGraft(R) skin tissue is produced using human dermal fibroblasts and the proprietary NIKS(R) human keratinocyte cell line, a consistent source of genetically-uniform, non-tumorigenic, pathogen-free human keratinocytes. Stratatech recently completed a Phase I/II clinical trial of StrataGraft(R) skin tissue for the temporary management of traumatic skin wounds, the results of which indicated that StrataGraft(R) tissue is well-tolerated and comparable to the standard of care for these wounds.  The goal of this SBIR Phase II Competing Renewal application is to develop improved manufacturing processes for Stratatech's line of innovative, cell-based tissues. We propose to develop and optimize completely cell-derived, closed-system manufacturing conditions for production of the clinically-tested StrataGraft(R) living human skin substitute tissue. The objective of this SBIR Phase II Competing Renewal proposal represents an important step in the refinement of our manufacturing process, increasing the safety and consistency of the product, while also reducing costs and facilitating the transition to the closed and automated manufacturing systems that will be necessary to meet the growing demand for these novel wound care products. The improvements proposed in this application would be applicable to Stratatech's entire product line, including not only StrataGraft(R) tissue, but also our line of next generation, genetically-enhanced ExpressGraft  tissues, and our in vitro skin model system.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than 40,000 people are hospitalized each year in the United States for burns and millions more are affected by nonhealing chronic wounds that, if left untreated, can lead to infection or even amputation. Standard treatments are unable to adequately address these problems. The goal of this SBIR Phase II Competing Renewal proposal is to develop closed-system manufacturing processes for production of Stratatech's clinically-tested StrataGraft(R) skin substitute for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds. The proposed research will refine the current manufacturing process for StrataGraft(R) skin tissue, improving product safety and consistency, reducing costs, and facilitating process scale-up. The proposed process improvements will benefit Stratatech's entire line of therapeutic products and will facilitate the commercialization of these therapies for the treatment of traumatic and chronic wounds.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 1000 American die every single day due to sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), which claims more lives than breast cancer, AIDS, and lung cancer combined. The survival from SCA strongly depends on the early defibrillation and the probability of survival decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in defibrillation. In fact, less than 5% of patients with out-of-hospital SCA can survive to hospitalization. It has been found that automated external defibrillators (AED) can at least double the overall survival rate for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients. In this fast-track SBIR program, Strategic Polymer Sciences, Inc. (SPS) proposes to develop low-cost compact film capacitors with ultra-high electrical energy density for portable AED. The advanced capacitors will utilize the recent breakthrough dielectric materials discovered at Penn State University (Zhang et al. Science 280:2101; 313:334; 321:821; and Nature 419:284) and the commercial-scale resin production and thin film processing technologies developed by SPS. For the same amount of delivered energy, the SPS capacitors will be 80% smaller and 50% cheaper than the current polypropylene (PP) AED capacitors. The advanced SPS film capacitors will shrink the size and reduce the cost of AED, facilitate the deployment of AED in millions of American homes and public buildings, and save thousands of patients with heart arrhythmia problem. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of ultra-high energy density capacitors based on advanced SPS dielectric materials can significantly reduce the size and cost of Automated External Defibrillators (AED). This will enable the deployment of AED in millions of homes of patients with heart arrhythmia problem who are facing the threat of delayed defibrillation if AED not available.",

SPS will investigate this polymer process and fabrication of the devices and explore and optimize the system design.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Being electric insulator ECE material consumes very little electricity and has much higher efficiency compared to the traditional cooling technologies. ECE material is also environmentally friendly. This technology can be potentially used in building air conditioning, refrigeration, and cooling devices.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of this project is to develop a biomarker - the Needle Torque Test (NTT) - capable of detecting connective tissue abnormalities associated with musculoskeletal disorders. The NTT is administered by inserting an acupuncture needle into connective tissue and using the Automated Needle Torque Sensor to deliver a precise biomechanical stimulus to the needle probe via rotation. The tissue response to this stimulus is quantified as torque. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Document Automated Needle Torque Sensor device and Needle Torque Test procedural reliability in vitro. This will be achieved by making structural and methodological refinements designed to insure measurement consistency, and documenting device performance under simulated clinical conditions against known torques. 2) Document the Needle Torque test/retest reliability in vivo. To fulfill this aim, we will perform a longitudinal study in 100 healthy human subjects without musculoskeletal pain or pathology, repeating testing of 6 points on the biceps femoris, rectus femoris, and biceps brachii at three time points (time 0, 30 minutes and 1 week). 3) Validate the NTT as a biomarker capable of identifying connective tissue abnormalities by: a) establishing an NTT/connective tissue disorder link. We will collect and compare NTT scores in 15 subjects with scleroderma, and 15 subjects with inherited connective tissue disorders manifesting as connective tissue hyperlaxity, compared with 30 control subjects from Aim 2 that are frequency-matched for age and sex and b) establishing an NTT/musculoskeletal disorder link. We will collect and compare NTT scores in 15 subjects with restricted hamstring flexibility, compared with 15 control subjects from Aim 2 with normal hamstring flexibility who have been frequency-matched for age and sex.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic musculoskeletal pain is the source of considerable disability, work absenteeism and health care costs. A major obstacle to the incorporation of manual therapies such as massage and spinal manipulation into our health care system is the lack of methods to objectively measure the effect of treatments. Automated Needle Torque Sensor technology under development in this project will potentially enable objective measurement of connective tissue abnormalities associated with musculoskeletal pain. This will 1) help establish the efficacy of manual treatments through improved research, 2) enhance the objective monitoring of patient progress in clinical practice and 3) bolster the evidence needed to justify insurance reimbursement.",

        "abstract": "Summerdale, Inc. and Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) will focus on above-ground applications of waterborne preservatives for indoor and outdoor residential lumber. Specifically, fatty acid-based formulations +/- adjuvants will be targeted for use on a) indoor lumber and wood composites and b) exterior residential (above ground) such as decking. However, further Phase II development of outdoor residential markets will depend on Phase II results from replicated leach trials. Fatty acid/adjuvant control of mold/decay fungi and termites must be sufficient; i.e., where preservative is retained and pesticide performance is acceptable after standard leach trials. Also, multi-year field trials, testing both stake and above-ground durability of treated specimens, are planned. The trials provide a very rigorous examination of preservative long-term efficacy. In-ground stake testing of several formulations has already been initiated. It is conceivable that formulations may not show long-term protection during prolonged, in-ground contact. Nevertheless, durability of treated-wood for exterior residential (above-ground) can be determined from the accelerated stake and above-ground test results. Over 82% of all waterborne preservatives were used on lumber and timber. An estimated 183.2 million pounds of waterborne preservatives were applied in 2004 and that the largest market for treated wood was residential. The largest growth was for copper-rich ACQ (and CA) and inorganic boron preservatives. ACQ, alone, had 46.7% of the waterborne preservatives market in 2004. Over the last several years, MCQ (micronized copper quats) has penetrated this market. Currently, copper-based preservatives are used to pressure treat lumber for numerous residential applications such as decking, outdoor furniture, fences, play structures, etc. Novel fatty acid-based preservatives, as exterior treatments, can be: a) potential \"stand-alone\" replacements for selected copper-based products (i.e., ACQ) used above-ground and b) as combination treatments with selected, existing products. An effective stand-alone product and/or a combination treatment should be of interest to a licensee. An acceptable, stand-alone formulation, relative to an existing wood preservative, should have improved or superior deterioration control and comparable or improved cost and other features (better human and environmental safety, less metal corrosivity, acceptable appearance of treated wood, etc.). Since dip and pressure treatments are used by wood preservers (typically at factories or lumber mills), both application methods for exterior applications will be examined. However, formulation development will be targeted toward both interior and exterior treatments and include control of mold and decay fungi and termites. Potential exterior treatments will also include a determination of formulation capabilities as an anti-sapstain.",

An improved method of fabricating such superconductors is being investigated using the Internal Tin Tube (ITT) Process that will improve the critical current density achievable.  In Phase I, Sn-Ta alloys were fabricated by melt diffusion of mixed powders.  The alloys were rolled to foil and placed at the interface between the niobium and the high tin copper-clad tin cores of ITT monofilaments.  Thick Nb3Sn layers were formed after heat treatment.  Fine grained Nb3Sn was observed in composites containing the alloys, but not in a control composite that did not contain Sn-Ta alloy.  In Phase II, the Sn-Ta alloy homogeneity will be improved.  The alloy compostion and thickness will be optimized.  The process will be scaled-up to a commercial level, with conductor lengths and filament sizes suitable for high energy physics applications.

High efficiency photo-injectors are the electron source of choice for future linear accelerators (linacs) and colliders, energy recovery linear accelerators (ERLs), fourth generation light sources, injectors for laser-driven plasma wake field accelerators, low-energy electron linacs for applied research, and high-power free electron lasers (FELs). Negative electron affinity semiconductor photocathodes, such as cesium-activated GaAs, can show relatively high quantum efficiency.  However, these cathodes require very high vacuum environment for operation with reasonable lifetime which is generally incompatible with high intensity electron gun environment. Hence, there is an immediate need for the development of high QE photocathodes capable of robust operation at high emission currents.  This program is directed toward the development of robust GaN-based photocathodes for operation in high-current electron injectors.  The main goal is to optimize the electron source characteristics and lifetime for practical application in current and future DOE projects.  In the phase I program, GaN-based photocathodes with novel structures were fabricated to demonstrate the remarkable efficiency and stability of these cathodes for electron emitter and UV imaging applications.  Device modeling was also done to determine new cathode structures for the Phase II effort. Novel GaN-based photocathodes studied in Phase I will be further optimized by investigating parameters that can affect the reliability and lifetime of these cathodes for operation in high voltage electron guns.  To speed up the development phase a new cathode activation and testing chamber will be added to the thin-film deposition system.  However, the performance of the optimized cathodes will be evaluated in realistic gun environment by collaborators at Argonne National Lab and Cornell University facilities.  Commercial Application and other Benefits:  The high-performance UV photocathodes proposed in this work can provide a springboard to commercialization of two main products - an efficient electron emitter and a sensitive photodetector.  These products have a great commercialization potential for many applications, including UV imaging, spectroscopy, maskless electron lithography and thin-film metrology.",

To develop high field magnets will require higher performance low-cost Nb3Sn Superconductors.  The cost-performance of state-of-the-art commercial Nb3Sn strand is $3/kA-m to $5/kA-m.  By development of lower cost processing and materials, powder-in-tube (PIT) Nb3Sn wire will improve the cost-performance to less than $1.00/kA-m for use in high field magnets for future High Energy Physics (HEP) accelerator research.  The overall technical approach for the Phase I/Phase II project will be to develop and demonstrate a substantially lower strand costs for the PIT process.  A new low-cost intermetallic tin powder will be introduced within a low-cost novel PIT conductor design.  In the Phase I work, we have successfully fabricated a multifilament PIT (Nb,Ti,Zr)3Sn quaternary conductor for high field 15-20 Tesla magnet applications.  This was achieved via a low-cost titanium doped tin powder core in Nb-1%Zr tubes. In the proposed development program, the main goal in the Phase II work will be to continue development and optimization of the (Nb,Ti,Zr)3Sn A-15 layer and properties in PIT conductors demonstrated in the Phase I work.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The impact of protein-based pharmaceuticals in the treatment of disease continues to surge, driven by discoveries in genomics and successful implementation by the biotechnology industry. The production of proteins remains a challenge because of the increasing demand and need for large doses. Many proteins require post-translational modifications that are only efficiently synthesized by vertebrate cells. Vertebrate cells, such as the industry standard Chinese Hamster Cells (CHO), can be difficult to grow under GMP conditions and require immense resources to propagate at the scale needed to meet market demands. Animal and plant based bioreactors systems are an attractive alternative to CHO due to low maintenance costs and ease of scalability. However, the post-translational modification of biopharmaceuticals, in particular glycosylation, is executed differently in animals and plants as compared to CHO cells. The hen, because of its prolific egg laying and protein production abilities, has been pursued as a biopharmaceutical bioreactor. The sugar molecules attached to certain proteins produced in eggs of transgenic hens have been found to share the same basic structure with CHO and human proteins. However there are some structural elements that are lacking in the egg white-derived sugars that could be important for bioactivity and bioavailability in human patients. The goal of this project is to genetically engineer hens to impart wholly-human like sugar structures upon egg white-derived biopharmaceuticals.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project, creation of transgenic hens that produce human biopharmaceuticals with human-like characteristics, will be a major step in the maturation of a production technology that will have dramatic effects on the biopharmaceutical industry. In the near future, consumers will have access to the first generation of hen-produced drugs and will benefit from the greatly reduced cost as well as increased safety and efficacy of such drugs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This multi-phase SBIR project targets a significant problem within the mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences: rapid size-based purification and separation of macromolecules, including proteins, nucleic acids and polysaccharides. The main objective is to develop novel ultrafiltration membranes with unprecedented sharp and controllable molecular-weight cut-off (MWCO) and reduced fouling. Such membranes are needed to fully realize the potential benefits of ultrafiltration (UF) and thereby address various pressing needs in biochemical and medical research, medical care, bioanalysis and biomanufacturing. Synkera aims to addresses this challenge by developing and commercializing membranes made from self-organized nanoporous ceramic with practically monodisperse nanometer-scale pores. At the core of this approach, which was proven feasible in Phase I, is Synkera's unprecedented ability to precisely tune the membrane pore diameter to any value in the 0.5-150 nm range. All the key Phase I objectives have been met or exceeded. For the first time, Synkera fabricated prototypes of such membranes and demonstrated their superior performance in comparison with commercial membranes. A clear breakthrough opportunity is now open to develop a whole new family of UF membranes for a variety of applications with enormous market potential and technical, economical, and health benefits to the end users, consumers and patients. Not only do the new membranes offer a performance improvement for established UF uses, but the advanced architecture and unrivaled control of the structure of Synkera's membranes also potentially enable new breakthrough applications such as fractionation of complex macromolecule mixtures. To fully explore the potential of this technology, Synkera established collaborative RandD with several academic and industrial partners. The near-term products based on the proposed technology include planar UF filters that outperform currently available membranes, as well as application-specific membranes (e.g., for protein separation) and bioanalysis substrates (e.g., for glucose sensing). In partnership with OEM manufacturers of biomedical consumables, we will also develop and commercialize centrifuge, syringe and in-line filters, filter cartridges, multiwell-plate inserts, and UF modules. The main objective of Phase II is now to perform a systematic development of the membrane technology to meet the requirements of different applications, and advance it to a readiness level that enables inexpensive yet high-performance membranes and derivative products.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project addresses a significant problem in biomedical research and medical care: rapid size-based purification and separation of macromolecules, including proteins, nucleic acids and polysaccharides. The development of novel advanced ultrafiltration membranes with unprecedented sharp and controllable molecular-weight cut-off and reduced fouling is proposed. The proposed technology will enable a novel family of high-performance membranes for use in biochemical analysis, laboratory studies, and, potentially, in hemodialysis for treatment of end-stage renal failure and in open heart surgery for blood oxygenation.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The potential for the use of stem cells for regenerative medicine has produced considerable excitement. Laboratory studies have shown that it may be possible to produce functional replacements for diseased or injured tissues. However, there are still a number of scientific hurdles that must be overcome if such therapies are going to be realized. The first and most intensively studied aspect of stem cell biology are the mechanisms by which stem cells are transformed into cells with distinct physiological functions. This area of stem cell research will not be addressed in this proposal. Instead, the second area of investigation, namely how to produce enough cells from a given number of stems cells to be of practical use in creating tissues for regenerative medicine. It is assumed by many investigators, that a virtually unlimited number of stem cells can be produced in simple culture systems to meet all therapeutic requirements. This belief is based on observations of the ability of stem cells to self-renew in culture. The conventional cell culture environment does not resemble the in vivo environment in which the stem cells normally exist and therein lies the problem for large scale growth of stem cells. In vivo, stem cells are maintained in largely quiescent state. Most cell divisions lead to the production of a stem cell and a daughter cell which will continue to divide to eventually produce a tissue. The numbers of stem cells actually change very little. This situation is thought to have evolved to minimize the possibility of mutations which could lead to uncontrolled growth, ie. cancer. In this proposal, we intend to utilize the NASA-designed Rotary Cell Culture System to mimic the normal in vivo environment of stem cells in the bone marrow called the niche. Modeling the niche will allow stem cells to be grown and maintained in a nearly natural environment. The stem cells which produce the elements of the blood can then be easily harvested and transplanted into patients. The RCCS is ideally suited to reproduce the 3-dimensional microenvironment the exists in the human body. By co-culturing supporting cells with stem cells on a polymer scaffolding material, we will create a culture system which will allow the long term maintenance of stem cells and enable continuous harvesting of cells in a controlled manner. Since stem cell niches exist in most tissues in the body, it is anticipated that artificial stem cell niche system developed in this project can be adapted to other types of cellular therapies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is aimed at producing a stem cell culture system which can maintain adult stem cells in a specialized environment to maintain them for long periods of time and stimulate the production of large numbers of progenitor cells for regenerative medicine. By allowing scale-up of therapeutic cell production, this project will help enable the use of stem cells for therapeutics which heretofore has been confined to very small scale research applications.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cadaver dissection is a critical exercise in medical education. In addition to the 60,000 plus medical students who participate in cadaver dissection, there are hundreds of thousands of other health care professionals and millions of high school students who would benefit from the exploratory learning experience that cadaver dissection provides. However, only 17,500 cadavers are available annually, and ethical and safety issues prevent such widespread use of what would otherwise be an invaluable educational experience in Anatomy. Over the past decade, personal computers have achieved remarkable performance milestones, driven by the gaming industry. An opportunity exists to develop a Virtual Reality anatomical exploration simulator that combines the best of virtual surgery and multimedia at an affordable cost and brings this invaluable experience to the masses. This proposal describes the Virtual Cadaver Lab, a 3D, real time, interactive exploratory application that allows students to explore the human anatomy the same way that medical students explore physical cadavers. VR offers distinct advantages over physical cadavers, such as the ability to erase mistakes, the ability to explore multiple specimens, the ability to record and playback dissections for assessment, and the ability to augment the experience with tissue and organ specific information. In the Virtual Cadaver Lab simulation, a student will be able to view a human body from any angle, touch it with a virtual probe, and cut open the skin for exploration. Tissues and organs can even be activated to move during their dissection activities. A low cost touch based input device and interface for multi-touch surfaces, such as Microsoft Surface, is proposed. The proposed research has tremendous implications, not only for medical students, but for biology students at the K-12 and undergraduate levels. Medical students can practice on multiple cadavers as a supplement to their lab experience without the need to be present in a cadaver lab, and without regulatory or ethical issues. Other science students can gain valuable insight into the human anatomy by running the software in a schools computer lab or on their home computer. In Phase 1, we showed the feasibility of such a software which was well received by students as well as anatomy professors. In Phase 2, we will convert this prototype into a high-quality, fully functional commercial software package. The software will be evaluated and beta tested in 5 of the nation's leading medical schools.

Many of these highly qualified professionals speak U.S. English as a second language and struggle to communicate effectively with clients and colleagues. The Intercultural Communication Workshop (hereafter, ICW), is a multimedia, internet-based educational tool designed to improve the overall communicative competence of foreign- born nurses. ICW Phase I integrates instruction in speech intelligibility with contextual information about communication, culture, and healthcare in the U.S. In Phase II, the user interface and navigation will be refined based on the findings of the Phase I field trial and the content will be expanded to address the language needs of diverse native speakers. Interactive role-play simulations will provide opportunities to practice new communication strategies. A multi-method, multi-measure two-group randomized controlled trial will be used to evaluate the educational effectiveness of the ICW, using an  intent-to- teach  approach analogous to the  intent-to-treat  approach for evaluations of effectiveness of biomedical interventions. Successful completion of ICW and a satisfactory demonstration of educational effectiveness will result in a new, low-cost, efficient resource for foreign-born nurses and their employers, lead to gains in speech intelligibility and communication skills in U.S. English for foreign-born nurses, enhance the intrinsic rewards of their profession for foreign-born nurses, and ultimately improve retention of foreign-born nurses in challenging and rewarding positions in the healthcare workforce. ICW will also yield two online assessment tools that facilitate the work of second-language acquisition and speech and language professionals. The use of computer-based training to improve the speech intelligibility and communication skills of foreign-born nurses addresses NINR's strategic plan for  Adopting, adapting and generating new technologies for better health care.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quality of delivery is known to moderate the effectiveness of drug abuse prevention programs. As research-based programs become widely disseminated, having tools for assessing quality of delivery becomes important for documenting and understanding the conditions under which programs succeed and fail. There are currently no standard methods for measuring the quality with which prevention programs are delivered. The goal of this project is to create a standardized tool for assessing quality of delivery for research-based drug abuse prevention programs.. Commercially, the addition of this product to an existing product (Evaluation Lizard) that provides pretest and posttest surveys tailored to the evaluation of evidence-based programs, will significantly strengthen our niche in the prevention evaluation marketplace. The broad aim of this SBIR project is to develop a tool that will allow the collection of standardized measures of quality of delivery across a wide range of programs being disseminated as a result of their inclusion on the NREPP model programs list and newly developed programs that wish to qualify for future inclusion. During Phase I, we interviewed prevention researchers, program administrators, program developers, and policy makers to define and elaborate on the essential criteria for defining dimensions of quality of implementation. Based on their input, we designed a prototype system that allowed us to accomplish the following tasks: (1) create session and program rating form templates for selected NREPP facilitator-delivered prevention programs, (2) link templates to a database to track form information (program, session, observer, teacher, and date of creation), and (3) create PDF forms printed remotely that can be linked by bar code back to the database. The prototype system measures dosage, adherence, engagement, and adaptation. We also developed a manual for using the system. While functional for the pilot test, this system is not yet fully automated and does not include numerous elements. During Phase II, our first task will be to complete the quality of delivery data gathering system for collecting quality of delivery data that will include tools for assessing adherence, adaptation, dosage, engagement, and measures of overall quality. We will develop online applications that will allow data collected about quality of program delivery to be linked and jointly analyzed in various ways with pretest-posttest outcome data from students. To ensure that the application works as intended, we will conduct alpha and beta tests of all component applications. We will develop an online system for conducting basic analysis and preparing reports that meets the needs of five separate professional groups: program implementers, program administrators, program developers, prevention researchers, and policy makers. We will conduct a field trial with 10 prevention agencies and school districts to demonstrate that the quality of delivery data collection and reporting system provide program implementers, prevention agency administrators and supervisors, and government agency prevention administrators with information useful to documenting and understanding the process of prevention program delivery. Established prevention agencies will adopt the use of the Evaluation Lizard system, including both pretest-posttest surveys and quality of delivery report forms. We hypothesize that participating groups will report satisfaction with the functioning of the system and will report increased awareness of how prevention is being implemented in their area of purview. Further, we will conduct a reliability and validity sub-study in which participating agencies will be asked to select one teacher to video record the lessons they teach so that observation data can be included in the analysis in order to demonstrate reliability and validity of the measures.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The field of drug abuse prevention research has identified numerous interventions that can be effective; however, unless programs are implemented well in practice, they are unlikely to achieve their desired effect, and the effort and expense of these programs may be wasted. The need to assess quality of implementation is widely recognized, but, to date, there is no unified strategy for gathering or reporting about data. The value of the product we are proposing is that it would provide an easy-to-use system for documenting quality of program implementation that could be linked to outcome data.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is poised to introduce superior electrolytes to the lithium-ion batteries by using a new class of low-cost, high-performance lithium salts.  Currently, the cost of batteries is impacted not only by the high cost of the lithium salts, but also their relatively lower stability that limits battery lifetime.  If successful, these electrolytes, to be developed under this Phase II project, will possess higher ionic conductivity and superior thermal and electrochemical properties that will be very attractive particularly for full size lithium-ion batteries applicable to electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles (EV/HEV).  Building on the company's earlier success in developing a novel two-step synthetic strategy to prepare these salts which contain two lithium ions versus one in currently used salts, this project will optimize and scale up the synthetic process leading to the production of these salts at much lower cost, while meeting all principal specifications, including high transference number, an attractive property of a battery to function properly at subzero temperatures.  This project will also further explore synthetic approaches to deliver even lower cost to capture the small size lithium battery market, where the applications are in computers, cell phones, cameras, and medical devices.  \nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be in the area of the rechargeable battery industry, especially in the arena of EV/HEV.  Cost, performance and battery life are major drivers of this industry.  The availability of electrolytes of lower cost, high performance and enhanced stability will contribute to cost reduction needed to make battery driven applications more affordable to users.  The successful outcomes of this project are expected to contribute to the US Government's emphasis on renewable energy and particularly, the Department of Energy's roadmap on advanced batteries with more robust and stable chemistries and cost effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "The objective of the project is the development of an on-board envelope estimation, protection and upset recovery tool to address loss of control incidents in commercial aircraft. Loss of control incidents can be attributed to variety of factors including environmental (icing, clear air turbulence, wakes, etc.), failure of aircraft components (stuck control surfaces, failure of hydraulic systems, broken cables, etc.), human factors (pilot error, insufficient training, crew distraction, etc.) or a combination of any of them. Usually the final catastrophic event is linked to nonlinear phenomenon (like stall) and there is a small time window of opportunity for the pilot (or the flight computer) to recover but the action they take are critical to any such recovery. In Phase I, we have demonstrated how nonlinear equilibrium analysis can be brought to bear upon this problem to understand the dynamic behavior of the aircraft outside of the nominal operating regime. We have also shown using NASA Generic Transport Model (GTM) how such tools may be used to dynamically estimate the operational envelope of the aircraft. In Phase II, we will extend the methodology to design an on-board envelope protection system and study upset recovery schemes. The analytical tools will be supported by the development of commercial grade software for on-board envelope estimation and upset recovery for unimpaired and impaired aircraft. We have already implemented symbolic tools for modeling and analysis, database management, numerical validation and visualization. These tools will be extended, improved and evaluated experimentally.

        "abstract": "Thermal energy storage systems balance out the discrepancies caused by the mismatch in the timing of energy supply and demand in alternative energy systems. In the case of solar space heating, for example, the intermittent supply of solar radiation requires storage of the excess daytime supply to meet the nighttime demand. Thermal energy storage benefits the energy-efficiency of buildings by controlling indoor temperature fluctuations, and by shifting the energy demand away from peak hours. The focus of the project is on development of a new thermal energy storage material which complements large latent heat capacity with desired shape-stability, thermal conductivity, heat and fire resistance, scalability, economy, sustainability, and versatility for use in diverse energy systems. The new hybrid nano-phase change materials (nano-PCMs) rely upon the molecular interactions of PCM with the enormous (functionalized) surface area of low-cost expanded graphite nanosheets as well as the support of PCM by a networked, thermally stable polymer to realize a highly desired balance of qualities favoring their broad transition to energy-efficient buildings and solar energy markets. Hybrid nano-PCMs are produced by simple intercalation of expanded graphite nanosheets, preserving the interconnected nature of nanosheets to render high levels of thermal conductivity. High thermal conductivity is key to timely mobilization of the whole volume of nano-PCMs towards latent heat storage in scaled-up building applications. The Phase I project developed simple processing techniques for production of hybrid nano-PCMs, and validated their ability to provide a distinct balance of latent heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and high-temperature stability of shape and mechanical performance. Building walls incorporating nano-PCMs were also developed, and their value towards control of indoor temperature fluctuations and shifting of thermal load in building applicaitons was demonstrated. Numerical analyses confirmed that nano-PCM building products can bring about major energy savings and thermal load shifts.   The proposed Phase II project will build upon the Phase I accomplishments towards: (i) full development and thorough characterization of hybrid nano-PCMs and building products incorporating them; (ii) theoretical and experimental validation of the benefits of hybrid nano-PCMs in terms of energy-efficiency, thermal comfort and shifting of thermal load in different building systems and climatic conditions; and (iii) competitive market evaluation of the technology for identifying priority applications and viable routes to market transition. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Nano-PCMs offer a desired balance of performance and cost for convenient incorporation into building construction products. These products can bring about major gains in the energy-efficiency and life-cycle economy of buildings at viable initial cost. The significant energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission of buildings magnify the benefits of the technology. The near-term markets in energy-efficient building construction offer the potential to consume close to 10 million tons/yr of thermal storage materials. A 5% share of this market represents ~$200 million annual sales of nano-PCM. The diminishing resources of fossil fuels, and their environmental burdens and rising costs are key factors benefiting market acceptance of the technology.",

        "abstract": "The Oak Ridge National Laboratory ion source group will construct and operate a two-solenoid low-energy beam transport (LEBT) system for 60 mA H- beams, including rf chopping.  This could increase the beam current in the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), while eliminating the sparking problems of the existing electrostatic LEBT. Previous solenoid-based LEBT designs with beam chopping showed problems, due to background ion plasma around the chopper. The parallel simulation framework VORPAL will be used to simulate H- ion beam transport experiments being planned as part of the long-term SNS power upgrade project at Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL).  Tech-X personnel have established a collaboration with the ion source group at ORNL during the Phase I effort and this collaboration will be continued and strengthened during Phase II, enabling us to provide key computational support during design and commissioning of the LEBT and to benefit from the insight and guidance of ORNL physicists.  It was demonstrated that the parallel VORPAL framework can model all key aspects of chopping in the ORNL LEBT design:  3D electrostatic particle-in-cell (PIC), complex 4-quadrant chopper geometry and radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) entrance, gradual build-up of background ion plasma, converging ion beam with initial phase space taken from ORNL specifications, and external solenoidal magnetic field.  The design potentials were applied to the chopper quadrants with specified rise and fall times and the beam steering angle was verified, while strong plasma dynamics was observed.  All possible avenues for beam-plasma instabilities will be explored over multiple time scales:  electron plasma frequency (very fast), ion plasma frequency (fast) and rf chopper frequency (slow).  Previous experiments and present intuition suggest that problems are occurring on the slow time scale, for which a fast Boltzmann electron model will be used.  Code validation and experimental support during LEBT design and commissioning are planned.  VORPAL training will be offered to the ion source community and ease of use will be improved, especially through improvements to the graphical user interface (GUI), known as VORPAL Composer.  Commercial applications and other benefits:  The commercial VORPAL application will be further developed, making it more directly relevant to important commercial applications like compact deuterium on tritium neutron sources for homeland security and oil exploration, as well as ion implantation for the semiconductor industry.  The work will also help to reduce risk and potentially lower costs for the planned SNS power upgrade",

        "abstract": "Data processing is becoming an integral part of modern experiments and should operate with the timeliness and reliability appropriate to each project.  There is a need for a customizable, resource-aware and dynamic mechanism allowing for automatic dissemination of the quality assurance data to the right parties at the right time.  The Data Distribution Service (DDS) is a promising new technology that is expected to deliver these features but needs to be tested within and adapted for DOE applications. Tech-X therefore proposes to develop QuAI, a Quality Assurance Infrastructure for timely and reliable distribution of quality assurance data between concurrent data processing applications.  The infrastructure will consist of reusable C++ library and Python objects facilitating use of DDS for the upcoming Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) cosponsored by HEP/DOE and NASA. QuAI will allow data exchange over the wide area network with the security and Quality of Service adequate for the JDEM data processing needs.  The project will be carried out in collaboration with the Ground Data System JDEM team at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.  Software developed in Phase I consists of prototypes for the simplifying C++ library and Python wrappers for DDS entities and examples demonstrating the use of the developed software for distribution of the JDEM-relevant data (images and tables from FITS files and simple status data) and providing elements of the Quality of Service satisfying some JDEM requirements (getting data reliably and getting pre-published data).  Commercial applications and other benefits:  Software developed in this project will allow for quality-assured distributed data processing for DOE experiments and NASA missions.  This project will bring Tech-X consulting business for developing custom extensions of QuAI, including custom security, for new HEP, NP and NASA teams, industrial control systems, and mission critical military applications. Adding Python support to DDSimplementations will result in strategic partnerships with DDS vendors.",

        "abstract": "Numerical simulations play a critical role in exploration of new experimental regimes needed for design and operation of new fusion devices such as ITER. Hence, simulations must be carefully validated against experiments.  Validation of fusion codes is overly difficult due to incompatibilities of data representation used in simulations and experiments, and the workflow issues that arise when the codes run remotely at leadership class computing facilities.  There is a need for tools that would standardize and streamline the routine portion of the overall validation efforts by taking advantage of modern data formats, available network tools, and by better exploiting available and upcoming supercomputing resources.  Tech-X therefore proposes to develop a data standard to describe data from a subset of fusion codes and diagnostics allowing their validation, implement common data and format transformations needed for merging these simulation and diagnostics data, and enable composing workflows for running the related synthetic diagnostics in local and remote high-performance environment.  Prototype standards for describing GYRO and NIMROD data and BES and Soft X-Ray diagnostics data were developed using a self described data format (HDF5). Methods for simplifying the workflow for synthetic diagnostic calculation for GYRO/BES and NIMROD/Soft X-Ray were explored.  Methods for integrating these methods into an established visualization tool (VisIt) were examined.  Commercial applications and other benefits:  The software infrastructure built in this project will streamline validation of fusion codes against experiment.  It could bring Tech-X consulting business opportunities with companies such as General Atomics and international customers involved in fusion projects (ITER, KSTAR, and JT-60).

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Only 28% of all Americans are considered scientifically literate [1], a distressing figure that leaves 72% of U.S. citizens ill-prepared to comprehend the substance of important issues such as stem cell research, global warming, or their own health-related conditions. Enhanced educational efforts are needed to improve the nation's scientific literacy and help more Americans keep pace with the rapidly evolving technological world. Terra Nova proposes to extend the successful research and development of the Phase I prototype, to produce an engaging software program that will strengthen the health science literacy of middle school students. Utilizing highly interactive technologies and evidence-based content, the web-based Virtual M.D.: Medical Sleuths end-product program (developed for the Virtual M.D.: e-Learning Tool for Improving Health Science Literacy grant project) will be designed to stimulate the interest of today's middle school students through interactive instruction and a  detective-type  process for finding solutions to contemporary real-world problems. Taking on the persona of a  virtual M.D.  to study  virtual patients  represented by animated characters, students will apply the scientific method to analyze signs and symptoms to diagnose key human diseases relevant to adolescents. This engaging method of learning will promote an accurate understanding of several important diseases, improve scientific analytical and research skills, offer guidelines for healthy living, and inspire a greater interest in pursuing a healthcare or research career. The broad, long-term objective for Phase II is to completely develop and rigorously test the complete Virtual M.D.: Medical Sleuths interactive program for eventual dissemination to middle schools across the country. The Specific Aims to be met during Phase II are: AIM 1 - Expand the research and instructional design plan developed and validated in Phase I, for an interactive middle school software tool that will communicate health and scientific information about adolescent obesity, Type 1 diabetes, asthma, and HIV/AIDS; AIM 2 - Produce all program materials including the web-based virtual simulation, an online learning community, Career Highlight videos, assessment components, and companion materials; and AIM 3 - Thoroughly evaluate all Phase II deliverables through quantitative, qualitative, and descriptive assessment measures including Expert Consultant Group reviews and a comprehensive Field Test Evaluation. Through the Virtual M.D. unit, Terra Nova seeks to support the National Center for Research Resources' public health mission of promoting scientific literacy among K-12 students through discovery-oriented tools, provide education to help people  understand, detect, treat, and prevent  a wide range of diseases, and encourage lifelong interest in the field of science. The Phase II end-product program will both fill an unmet need in the middle school market, as well as contribute to NCRR's mission of providing an educational tool to improve the public's health science literacy.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With only 28% of U.S. citizens qualifying as scientifically literate [1], national attention is sharply focused on identifying methods to improve Americans' understanding of and appreciation for key scientific concepts - so they may make better-informed decisions about the world around them. The proposed web-based Virtual M.D.: Medical Sleuths educational unit responds to this initiative by providing students at the middle school level with a creative, interactive, detective-type process for finding scientific solutions to real-life health problems. By giving students the opportunity to serve in the role of a  virtual M.D.  to study, diagnose, and treat virtual patients, the unit will promote public health initiatives by: a) improving students' health science literacy, b) providing them with practical guidelines for preventing the onset of disease, c) familiarizing them with a variety of health-related career options, and d) further inspiring a lifelong curiosity about science and its applications.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes mellitus (DM) in dogs is characterized by a rapid onset of bilateral cataracts that result in vision loss. Over 400,000 dogs annually develop cataracts that results in vision loss and currently the only medical treatment for these dogs is cataract surgery between  3,500-6,000. We have developed an alternative, nonsurgical medical treatment that is composed of an aldose reductase inhibitor in a topical vehicle that has been trademarked as KinostatTM. In our SBIR Phase I study, we established in a masked, multicenter study composed of 40 dogs with naturally occurring DM that topical KinostatTM significantly reduces both cataract formation and the progression of cataracts in diabetic dogs. This Phase II proposal seeks to conduct studies under IAND 11-785 that are required to obtain FDA approval for KinostatTM to become commercially available. Under FDA guidance, the Phase II studies will include a 12-month masked clinical trial conducted at 5 regional clinics with dogs of various breeds with newly diagnosed DM and no cataracts present. Lens changes will be evaluated at the onset, and at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months. The efficacy of topical KinostatTM will be established by comparing the onset and severity of cataract formation in 125 dogs receiving topical KinostatTM compared to 35 dogs receiving placebo. In addition, a 6-month GLP toxicity test in 48 normal dogs of equal gender will be conducted. Both studies will utilize KinostatTM that has been synthesized, formulated and packaged under cGMP and GLP conditions by the future contract manufacturers. Bioequivalence of the manufactured product to the KinostatTM formulation in Phase I will be conducted prior to the start of the clinical trial. In addition, the manufactured formulation will be characterized for consistency of particle size and delivery amounts as mandated by the FDA. The commercial availability of KinostatTM will provide owners of an estimated 1.2 million companion dogs with DM a less costly, nonsurgical alternative medical treatment for cataracts and reduce the incidence of secondary ophthalmic complications.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal seeks funding to obtain data required by the FDA for approval for marketing KinostatTM, a topical aldose reductase inhibitor formulation, for the prevention of cataracts in the 400,000 diabetic companion and working dogs that annually develop cataracts where vision can only be restored with costly cataract surgery. Once KinostatTM has been successfully established for the prevention of cataracts in diabetic dogs, we will repurpose this drug for humans use as an Orphan Drug for preventing aldose reductase linked cataracts in young children with diabetes. This will alleviate the need for cataract surgery in young children where proper intraocular lens placement and secondary cataracts due to posterior capsule opacification are problematic because their eyes are expected to undergo significant ocular growth after surgery.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this SBIR Phase II proposal is to further develop a novel treatment that will be used to save the lives of patients with intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Although various modalities and substances have been studied to reduce intestinal I/R-induced mortality, none have been entirely successful. As such, the development of novel treatments to prevent or at least minimize intestinal I/R injury is of tremendous benefit to the patient. The market potential for intestinal I/R treatment as a whole is estimated at  2-5 billion per year in the US alone. We have recently demonstrated that administration of rat adrenomedullin (AM), a recently-discovered potent vasoactive peptide, in combination with human adrenomedullin binding protein-1 (AMBP-1), a novel specific binding protein of AM, immediately at the beginning of reperfusion attenuated tissue injury and inflammatory responses in a rat model of intestinal I/R induced by superior mesenteric artery occlusion (SMAO). To avoid the potential immunogenicity of rat proteins in humans, human AM was proposed in the Phase I project. The above protective effects have been confirmed using commercial human AMBP-1 in combination with human AM in the same animal model of SMAO. The dose-response study showed that the highest dosage of human AM/AMBP-1 proposed in the Phase I project achieved a better protection after intestinal I/R. However, the extremely high cost of commercial human AMBP-1 limits the further development of AM/AMBP-1. To overcome this obstacle, we have successfully isolated and purified AMBP-1 from human serum at a much lower cost. We therefore continue to hypothesize that administration of human AM/AMBP-1 attenuates organ injury and inflammation, and reduces mortality following after intestinal I/R injury. In this Phase II proposal, we will first scale up the production of human AMBP-1 and, then, perform additional efficacy studies in order to determine the optimal protective dosage of human AM/AMBP-1 in intestinal I/R in the rat. Moreover, the pharmacokinetic characterization of human AM/AMBP-1 after intestinal I/R will be assessed. To advance our technology to the clinical trials, the efficacy of human AM/AMBP-1 will be investigated in a swine model of intestinal I/R. Our ultimate goal is to develop the commercial utilization of human AM/AMBP-1 as a safe and effective treatment for patients with intestinal I/R injury.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) is a common clinical problem in the settings of sepsis, hemorrhagic shock, vascular surgery and small bowel transplantation. Although various modalities and substances have been studied to reduce intestinal I/R-induced mortality, none have been entirely successful. As such, the development of novel treatments to prevent or at least minimize intestinal I/R injury is of tremendous benefit to the patient. The market potential for intestinal I/R treatment is estimated at  2-5 billion per year in the US alone. It is obvious that there is an urgent medical need for the development of an effective and novel resuscitation approach for the treatment of patients with intestinal I/R injury.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid, Portable HIV Detection and Monitoring System The long term objectives of this project are: 1. Develop a prototype of a rapid portable instrument for detecting and measuring the amount of Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV's) in samples of patient blood, particularly in low resource settings. 2. Carry out a pilot study to establish the effectiveness and comparative performance of the instrument against an established reference system. The aim is to provide clinicians tools to diagnose and monitor HIV that exist in resource abundant settings but are not readily available in low resource settings. In particular, the instrument system will provide clinicians with detection methods that could be helpful in identifying acute HIV-1, early diagnosis of infection in pregnant women and infants, monitoring viral load following treatment and monitoring for the emergence of antiretroviral resistance. Viral load monitoring of patients on antiretrovirals is a good example of the difference in treatment between resource abundant and low resource settings. Routinely done in the former because of the threat to patients and community should they develop a drug resistant strain of HIV, millions of recipients of antiretroviral therapy currently are not being monitored due to its cost and complexity. These aims are congruent with those parts of the mission of DAIDS to bring an end to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by supporting the advancement of therapies for HIV infection and its complications.... This project will achieve its stated goals by carrying out a system design of a compact, fast portable system, identifying all the subsystem requirements and required technology advances and then proceeding to tackle them. The researchers at UMass Medical School will develop an effective HIV PCR assay. Thermal Gradient will carry out research on critical aspects of the key PCR amplification device and DNA sample preparation modules, and then will design and demonstrate requisite performance of the integrated test cartridge and system. Arcxis Biotechnologies is expected to contribute key DNA sample preparation technology to the integrated cartridge. Finally, the performance of the system (instrument, cartridge and assay) will be validated, first in internal tests using prepared blood samples and then a significant pilot study. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid, Portable HIV Detection and Monitoring System A rapid HIV POC diagnostic and monitoring device would facilitate diagnosis and monitoring of antiretroviral therapy in resource-limited settings. POC tests can make HIV testing accessible in areas with limited laboratory facilities and can provide immediate test results that are needed to make clinical decisions. In particular, easy-to- use HIV tests could transform the management of pediatric HIV/AIDS in developing countries, averting millions of infant deaths, and help alleviate the threat to public health represented by the current practice of treating millions of HIV patients with antiretrovirals without monitoring their viral loads.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past decade, there has been a surge of interest in amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) for ocular surface reconstruction. A number of studies have shown that AMT using cryopreserved AM (AmnioGraft(R)) manufactured by Bio-Tissue, Inc., a subsidiary of TissueTech, Inc., is effective in facilitating epithelial wound healing and reducing stromal inflammation, scarring and formation of unwanted new blood vessels. To facilitate the ease of patient care and reduce the overall medical cost, we have obtained SBIR Phase I and II grants (R43/R44 EY014768) to develop a  sutureless  AM graft so that AMT can be performed in a physician's office or at the bedside of an Intensive Care and Burn Unit without bringing the patient to the operating room. As a result, we have successfully developed ProKera(R), which has received the FDA's 510(k) clearance as a type II medical device. In 2008, we have distributed more than 4,000 units in the U.S. market for treating patients inflicted with a number of sight-threatening corneal surface diseases characterized by poor wound healing, unwanted inflammation, and excessive scarring. We envisioned that AM's inherent anti-inflammatory and anti- scarring actions can further be deployed to treat ocular surface diseases unmanageable by AmnioGraft(R) or ProKera(R), and to any other body sites where inflammation and scarring are of great concern. We further speculated that one solution to the physical constraint of AmnioGraft(R) or ProKera(R) is to develop a gel formulation based on AM extracts (AME). Through SBIR Phase I grant support (R43 EY017497), we have successfully validated the key manufacturing steps of generating AME and its lyophilized powder (AMP), and compared the relative potency of using collagen or hyaluronic acid (HA) as a vehicle to deliver their anti-inflammatory and anti-scarring actions (Aim 1). In addition, we have biochemically purified and characterized one covalent complex (HC7HA) containing HA and heavy chains (HC) of inter-a-inhibitor (IaI) as the active component in AME responsible for most, if not all, anti-inflammatory and anti-scarring effects observed in AM stroma (Aim 2). In Phase II, we thus propose to validate the potency of purified HC7HA complex in exerting in vitro anti-inflammatory and anti-scarring actions, verify the consistency of manufacturing HC7HA complex regarding its biochemical composition and purity, and optimize the HA gel formulation containing HC7HA complex (Aim 1). In addition, we propose to demonstrate clinical efficacies of the aforementioned gel formulation containing HC7HA complex in exerting an anti-inflammatory action in a murine model of HSV1-induced necrotizing stromal keratitis, and an anti-scarring action in a rabbit model of excimer laser-assisted photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) (Aim 2). Successful completion of the above two Aims will allow us to gather sufficient and pertinent data for IDE/IND submission to the FDA so that we may begin to commercialize the first ophthalmic topical formulation and continue to build a pipeline of new therapeutics based on AME or purified HC7HA complex so that we may expand our market spaces not only in ophthalmology, but also in other medical and surgical subspecialties.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application proposes to develop a novel pipeline of therapeutics based on anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic actions of amniotic membrane extract as well as its purified covalent complex containing hyaluronan and heavy chains of inter-a-inhibitor.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The aims of this proposal are to complete development and evaluation of a computerized adaptation of a new tool to more accurately identify toddlers with signs of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and to make this tool accessible to varied populations. Early screening for ASD has recently become standard for pediatric practice following evidence of the efficacy of early intervention. The most widely recommended screen is the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (MCHAT; Robins, et. al., 1999). While the MCHAT has good psychometric characteristics, a major obstacle to its use in primary care is its large over-referral rate. While a structured interview (MCHAT Follow Up; Kleinman, et. al., 2007) was developed that reduces over-referral, it is impractical in its original form for brief well child visits. The platform for this project is a web-based decision support system, CHADIS that delivers pre-visit questionnaires such as the MCHAT for completion online, scores them and presents results to the clinician. CHADIS also provides decision support in an electronic textbook linked to screening results and resources in handouts for parents. A computerized version of the MCHAT Follow Up completed by clinician interview has been created in CHADIS (CHADIS MCHAT F/U). CHADIS MCHAT F/U is practical because it prompts doctors to ask the parents only a few questions to follow up on the answers causing the positive MCHAT score, with the test automatically rescored after each clinician input until a positive or negative result is obtained. It is anticipated that the computerized MCHAT and CHADIS MCHAT F/U will cut the over-referral rate by more than half, saving costs and parent agony. CHADIS is being used nationally and in Maryland for a sizable network of practices in an autism screening program. However, use in settings with large numbers of low income families has been limited because they are unable or do not remember to complete questionnaires online prior to visits. Phase I of this project will involve development of waiting room alternatives for administering the MCHAT including Interactive Voice Response (IVR) phone system, touch screen kiosk, and laptop computer that will allow results to be linked to CHADIS MCHAT F/U. A reminder system will also be created. These methods will then be assessed in parent and physician focus groups in 3 populations. Phase II will involve: assessing satisfaction with the waiting room methods in 160 parents in the 3 populations, and testing positive predictive validity of the CHADIS MCHAT F/U method. Validity will be determined by screening 4500 children in the Maryland network using the MCHAT, and completing the CHADIS MCHAT F/U and complete evaluations for ASD on the expected 300 positive children. Finally, relative costs and savings of these methods will be estimated. It is hypothesized that the new system will show advantages, savings, and acceptability that support widespread Phase III dissemination. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The aims of this proposal are to complete development and evaluation of a computerized adaptation of a new tool to more accurately identify toddlers with signs of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), now affecting 1 in 150 children, and to make this tool accessible to varied populations. Early screening for ASD is a new standard for pediatric practice but the most widely recommended screen, MCHAT, has a large over- referral rate and low income families are less able to or do not remember to complete it prior to their visits. This project will create methods for using the MCHAT in the waiting room by phone (IVR), touch screen kiosk and laptop and a phone reminder system; pilot them for acceptability; then measure preference, satisfaction and costs of these methods in 3 populations. A computerized version of MCHAT and of a Follow Up prompted interview designed to reduce over-referral has been created in an existing web-based decision support system (CHADIS) and will be validated by evaluating 300 children for ASD who have positive MCHAT screens regardless of their MCHAT Follow Up results. It is anticipated that the computerized MCHAT and CHADIS MCHAT F/U will improve rates of valid screening for ASD, important to early identification and intervention, but cut the over-referral rate by more than half, saving costs and parent agony.",

        "abstract": "Industrial high-temperature furnace insulation materials currently consist of either carbon or graphite in various forms. Due to these limited materials choices, the results include significant heat loss, expensive maintenance costs incurred due to frequent replacement of the carbon insulation, and long lead times due to supply tightness of carbon fibers. End-users need to reduce expensive energy and maintenance costs, through the utilization of the latest advanced materials for insulation. Significant advancements have been made in the field of aerogel materials in recent years, and these nanomaterials have great potential to lead to significant energy savings across various industries. The proposed work seeks to determine the technical and economic feasibility of utilizing a carbon aerogel encapsulated into carbon fiber insulation for use in high-temperature furnaces. The project will focus on characterization of high-temperature thermal properties, pilot-scale testing of these new insulation materials, and determination of the economic benefit from energy-efficiency improvements and reduced maintenance costs.   In the Phase I effort, significant reductions in the thermal conductivity of standard carbon felts were measured, up to a 56% improvement. Test quantities of the new composite insulation were tested in a pilot-scale furnace for initial thermal performance evaluations. This initial testing verified the laboratory results using an un-optimized aerogel formulation and infiltration process. An initial economic analysis was performed and shows the potential to significantly impact the solar silicon and carbon fiber production industries with the impact being a reduction in energy costs of 1.2 MM MWhrs annually. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  There is significant potential to dramatically lower the thermal conductivity of industrial carbon insulation materials by utilizing encapsulation of carbon aerogels. Use of these composite insulations can result in major improvements in high-temperature furnace insulation and increase energy efficiency. Commercialization of this technology will lead to new job creation in the manufacturing and sales/marketing process.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation therapy is one of the primary weapons in the battle against cancer, but even with the advances we have made, there remains significant room for improvement in radiation-based treatment technologies. Proton therapy is now considered the most advanced form of radiation therapy available for cancer treatment, but the size and cost of currently available proton therapy devices have severely limited the technology's use and availability. The high voltage machines required to generate proton beams are massive-weighing several hundred tons and requiring 90,000 square feet to house. They also cost  100M or more to build. A substantial reduction in the size and cost is required for proton therapy machines to be rendered practical for use in typical cancer treatment centers. Ideally, a proton therapy machine would be miniaturized to the point that it would fit into a standard linac radiation vault and could replace existing photon machines. TPL Inc., in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), TomoTherapy Inc., Compact Particle Accelerator Corporation (CPAC) and UC Davis Cancer Center, has defined a technical approach that we believe will allow development of the first low-cost, compact proton-therapy machine. As envisioned, the new device will be an order of magnitude smaller and one-fifth the cost of the machines being used today. The key to developing this next-generation proton-therapy device is an extremely compact accelerator design based on a novel, high-voltage insulating material (dielectric) developed by TPL. This enabling material, developed initially for defense-related pulse-power applications, is a composite structure comprised of a formulated polymer resin and nano-size ceramic particles. The Phase I program was successful in demonstrating feasibility for producing pulse power components that enable development of the envisioned compact proton therapy device. Manufacturability and performance characteristics of the accelerator building blocks were successfully demonstrated. Pulse forming lines were fabricated and tested by TPL Inc. and LLNL to system level specifications. All results support the proposed technical and economic feasibility of TPL's innovative approach to developing the next generation, compact and low cost proton therapy device. Proof of feasibility in the Phase I has set the stage for prototype development and demonstration by TPL and its collaborators. The proposed Phase II project will transition the demonstrated component technology to the development, approval and manufacturing of system level components for  Phase III  commercialization. We anticipate that success in attaining our goals of substantially reducing cost and size of proton-therapy units will open up a very significant new marketplace in the U.S. and abroad for this type of cancer-treatment device.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Millions of Americans are lost every year to cancer, and although radiation therapy is one of our primary treatment tools for cancer, there remains significant room for improvement with even our best radiation based treatments. Proton therapy is considered the most advanced form of radiation therapy available for cancer treatment, but the size (hundreds of tons with a 90,000 square foot footprint) and cost (more than  100 million to build) of currently available proton therapy devices have severely limited the technology's use. For this project, TPL is teaming with Lawrence Livermore, TomoTherapy Inc., Compact Particle Acceleration Corporation and UC Davis Cancer Center to demonstrate the potential for using TPL's enabling technology to achieve an order of magnitude size reduction and an 80% cost reduction - with the entire effort focused on making next generation proton therapy practical for widespread use throughout the U.S. and internationally.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this Fast Track project is to develop an interactive voice response (IVR) application that will resolve three obstacles hindering the widespread adoption of telephone-based interventions in the healthcare arena. First, the process of creating an IVR campaign is labor-intensive, time-consuming and cost-prohibitive. Second, the collaborative aspect of IVR campaign development is not enabled by currently available IVR systems in which no clear guidelines or resources exist to assist healthcare workers in designing and implementing such campaigns. Third, there is a lack of dedicated IVR systems for use in healthcare, as existing proprietary IVR systems are designed primarily for corporate clients and are thus inadequate for adaptation to health outreach campaigns. Numerous studies have shown that IVR is a particularly effective means of communicating health information to patients with limited English proficiency (LEP) and low functional health literacy (FHL). This project will create a system that is tailored to the needs of healthcare personnel and will significantly reduce the time, cost, and labor requirements of adapting IVR technology to outreach campaigns. Phase I research will evaluate the efficacy and adoptability of a set of sample messages with LEP patients and providers and determine the optimal features of the proposed IVR system. During Phase II, a fully- functional prototype of the IVR system will be developed and evaluated via a pilot study with clinicians and researchers who are experienced in IVR health interventions. Finally, a randomized control trial will be conducted in conjunction with a diabetes management program at a leading New York-based medical institution. Clinical outcomes and qualitative feedback from providers and patients will be assessed according to pre-determined benchmarks. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology offers tremendous potential to enhance public health education efforts and to facilitate enhanced patient communications among populations with limited English proficiency (LEP) and/or low functional health literacy. The proposed VoiceReach++ System, a user-friendly, web-based, automated message-delivery application, will harness health educators' expertise in conducting outreach campaigns, reduce time and costs associated with telephone-based communications, and develop a body of quality-controlled voice messages for dissemination into the community. The multilingual, culturally-appropriate telephone messages housed in the VoiceReach++ System's collaborative clearinghouse will serve to increase LEP patients' health knowledge, appointment attendance, and treatment compliance, improving individuals' ability to manage chronic disease, engage in preventive care practices, and improve overall health outcomes.",

As foreign-trained nurses become an increasingly integral component of our nation's healthcare system, it is important that efforts be undertaken to help them attain and maintain adequate proficiency in the English language. To date, there has been a near-total absence of language-learning resources devoted to English instruction for foreign-born medical professionals. In addition, nurses frequently lack the time to pursue professional development; any educational product targeting this population should be available anytime, anywhere to maximize efficacy and adoptability. The proposed mobile application will contain a comprehensive set of interactive, dynamic learning activities featuring nursing-specific vocabulary words, phrases, and grammatical concepts all accessible on the users' smartphones, thus providing a valuable resource to cement one of the cornerstones in Secondary Language Acquisition.

Sand casting is a relatively inexpensive casting method not traditionally used to manufacture superalloy castings.  Instead of expensive \"invested\" ceramic shells found in investment casting, the molds are produced from a mixture of inexpensive fine sand and/or graphite powder.  Friction stir processing is an emerging microstructural modification technique based on friction stir welding (FSW).  It can be applied to enhance the microstructure-properties of the cast material thus improve the damage tolerance capabilities.  This step is needed to allow cast superalloy rocket propulsion components to be used without casting factors.  If this unique technology can be successfully developed and applied, it will have the tremendous potential for reducing the weight and cost of Ni-based superalloy castings that are used in industries as diverse as rocket propulsion, aircraft engines, land-based gas turbines, and chemical process industry pumps and valves.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rat is a favored model for many types of human disease for which mice are not suitable. As opposed to the mouse, rats and humans also share more similarity in their cytochrome P450 genes, making the rat a more useful model for toxicology and pharmacology studies. The rat is also a favored model for diabetes, arthritis, behavioral disorders (including drug addiction), and brain imaging. However, until recently, generating engineered mutations has been problematic due to the lack of rat stem cell lines capable of contributing to the germ line, and the lack of efficient technologies to modify genomic sequences. Transposagen Biopharmaceuticals has pioneered the use of mobile DNA elements (e.g., transposons) to generate insertional mutations in the rat germ line. To date, we have over made over 100 insertional mutant lines (referred to as TKOTM Knockout Rat Models). This approach utilizes gene-trap strategies to select for randomly integrated transposons, which enable the rapid identification of sequence-tagged mutation sites. In Phase I studies, we focused on synthesizing hyperactive transposases, from three different families of transposons, Sleeping Beauty (SB), piggyBac (PB), and TcBuster (TcB), to increase the efficiency of transposition in the germ line. We report the successful generation of a number of hyperactive transposases in the PB family. In Phase II studies, we will generate a rat embryonic stem (rES) cell bank containing over 200,000 dual reporter gene-trap insertional mutations; a EGFP reporter system will be used as a polyA trap to maximize the probability of generating insertional mutations in each of the approximately 30,000 rat genes, and a promoterless tdTomato reporter to screen for lineage-specific gene disruptions. In the long term, we intend to use the rES cell bank to generate rat knockout lines in each locus. In Phase II studies, we will focus on developing transposon-mediated knockout lines in neural, cardiac, and endothelial cell lineages, using the hyperactive PB transposases created in Phase I studies, with the aim of generating a bank of knockout lines that that will be valuable for a wide variety of applications such as toxicology, behavioral, and cardiovascular research. We will develop high-throughput in vitro differentiation protocols to screen pools of rES cells cultured in 96-well formats. Potential mutations in neural, cardiac, and endothelial cell lineages will be identified by screening for wells that contain tdTomato positive cells after lineage-specific differentiation protocols. rES cell pools in positive wells will be subcloned and re-screened to identify the individual clone that carries the potential lineage specific mutation. Genomic DNA will be isolated and used as template for splinkerette PCR, which is used routinely to amplify sequences that flank DNA insertions. We will determine the genomic sites for each insertion and screen each gene for lineage-specific expression to rule out insertions that affect ubiquitously expressed loci. We will develop two products for academic and pharmaceutical end users. First, we will generate chimeric animals from selected rES cell clones by injecting these cells into host blastocysts, and segregate away the  irrelevant  mutations by several rounds of backcrosses to generate additional TKOTM Knockout Rat Models for human diseases. Second, we will market rES cell clones, containing mutations in genes that are beyond our core interests to academic and pharmaceutical end users. Mutant animals, sperm isolated from mutant males, and mutant rES cells will be distributed by the National Rat Resource and Research Center and shared with the academic community according to NIH policies for sharing model organisms for biomedical research.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the application  Creation of hyperactive transposases for mutagenesis in rodents,  we are seeking Phase II funding to use the novel transposases we created to generate new models of human disease. We have demonstrated the value of creating transposon-mediated mutations to model human diseases for basic and therapeutic research application. All of our previous models were obtained by random mutagenesis. In this proposal we outline studies that will enable us to identify transposon mediated mutations that will likely affect neural, heart, or blood vessel function. Such rat models will provide new and valuable tools to develop new therapies in classes of diseases that are particularly prevalent in humans. Thus, if successful, this project would benefit many goals of public health by making the production of mutations in the rat that model human diseases readily accessible to the research community.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Flow cytometry is used to rapidly gather large quantities of data on cell type and function. The manual process of classifying hundreds of thousands of cells forms a bottleneck in diagnostics, high-throughput screening, clinical trials, and large-scale research experiments. The process currently requires a trained technician to identify populations on a digital graph of the data by manually drawing regions. As the complexity of the data increases, this gating task becomes more lengthy and laborious, and it is increasingly clear that minimizing human processing is essential to increasing both throughput and consistency. In clinical tests and diagnostic environments, automated gating would eliminate a complex set of human instructions and decisions in the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), thereby reducing error and speeding results to the doctor. In many cases, the software will be able to recognize the need for additional tests before the doctor has an opportunity to look at the first report. Currently no software is available to perform complex multi-parameter analyses in an automated and rigorously validated manner. FlowDx will fill an important gap in the evolution of the technology and pave the way for ever larger phenotypic studies and for the translation of this research process to a clinical environment. Specific Aims 1) Fully define the experimental protocol, whereby a researcher can compare two or more classifications of identical data sets to study the differences, biases and effectiveness of human and algorithmic classifiers. 2) Describe and evaluate metrics that compare the performance of classification algorithms. 3) Conduct analytical experiments on our identified use cases, illustrating the potential of this technique to affect clinical analysis. 4) Iteratively implement the tools to automate these experiments, improve the experimental capabilities, and collaborate in new use cases. These aims will be satisfied while maintaining quantitative standards of software quality, establishing measurements in system uptime, throughput and robustness to set the baseline for subsequent iterations.

The FlowDx Project 1) Fits the  translational medicine  model of the NIH Roadmap 2) Reduces error in the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases 3) Speeds results to physicians. Patients learn the outcome more quickly. Therapeutic intervention is faster. 4) Accommodates large-scale research by allowing greater volumes of complex data to be much more quickly examined, compared, and quantified 5) Reduces the expense of cell analysis by as much as 50% 6) Conforms to 21CFR Part 11 guidance",

As an example of the far reaching potential for a panel of DNA repair deficient cell lines, we show that DNA glycosylase deficiency modulated both the transcriptome and epigenome, implicating some DNA glycoylases in methylation maintenance and genome expression diversity. Further, by combining both DNA glycosylase and BRCA1 knockdown, we have begun to investigate the requirement for DNA glycosylases in the effectiveness of PARP inhibitors in a BRCA1 knockdown tumor line. Phase II of the project wil utilize the successful work-flow paradigm optimized in Phase I for the development, functional characterization, cell banking and transcriptome analysis of isogenic human cel lines deficient in all known DNA repair genes. These include genes involved in Base Excision Repair, Direct Reversal of Damage, Mismatch Excision Repair, Nucleotide Excision Repair, Homologous Recombination, Non- homologous End-Joining, the modulation of nucleotide pools, DNA polymerases, editing and processing nucleases, the Rad6 pathway, Chromatin Structure, DNA Repair genes defective in diseases and conserved DNA Damage Response genes. The studies described in Aim 1 involve the preparation of the shRNA expressing lentiviruses, transduction and generation of three different human tumor cell knockdown panels for all known DNA repair genes (gt150), followed by the mRNA expression characterization (qRT-PCR) of the knockdown cell lines and optimized scale-up and step-wise characterization to prepare for cell line distribution (Cell Banking). In aim 2, the cell lines will be validated for the expected DNA repair functional deficiency by protein expression profiling and genotoxin challenge. Finally (Aim 3), whole-genome transcriptional profiles will be conducted to quantitate transcriptional reprogramming mediated by changes in endogenous DNA repair capacity and where appropriate, following specific genotoxic stress. With the expectation that DNA repair capacity impacts basic cellular functions both spontaneously and in response to genotoxic stress, alters the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape and dictates the cellular response to stress, the development of a complete panel of isogenic DNA repair deficient cell lines across multiple backgrounds will be a valuable platform for gene and drug discovery, validation of inhibitor specificity and the identification of response biomarkers and novel targets for gene/drug synthetic-lethality combinations. The ready availability of this panel of cell lines will permit both academic and pharmaceutical scientists to study the molecular etiology of tumor genomic instability and to exploit it in oncology research. We envision robust market demand for the cell lines and information that relates to the global transcriptome.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this Phase II proposal we plan to utilize the successful work-flow paradigm optimized in Phase I for the cell-line development and transcriptome analysis of isogenic human cells lines deficient in all known DNA repair genes. These highly characterized and annotated isogenic cell lines will form the basis for a platform for gene and drug discovery, validation of inhibitor specificity and the identification of response biomarkers and novel targets for gene/drug synthetic-lethality combinations.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA ligases are more frequently being used as a tool in molecular biology applications that include nucleotide sequence detection, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection, protein detection, and  next generation  sequencing by ligation. With the increased demand for DNA ligases in the field of biotechnology, so is the need for improved fidelity of ligation. Although many approaches to improving ligation fidelity have been employed, most involve use of ligases from different biological sources, point mutations of key amino acid residues, and modified reaction conditions. Herein, we propose a slightly different approach to improving the stringency of ligation, which employs a set of chemically modified ligation components. In our three-pronged approach, we propose the evaluation of chemically modified variants of the ATP cofactor, the donor probe, and the acceptor probe. The significance of this approach is great because each of these three components makes contacts with different key amino acid contacts within the ligase. It is hoped that subtle chemical alterations to the nucleic acid component of DNA ligase may in turn induce an improvement in the fidelity of ligation.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The field of molecular diagnostics is a growing market with a current estimated value of  20.5 billion. One key class of enzymes that are used in these efforts is the DNA dependent DNA ligases. To further improve the accuracy of the DNA joining reaction catalyzed by DNA ligases, we propose the investigation of chemically modified components.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thyroid cancer is increasingly prevalent and the most common malignancy of endocrine tissues, and most patients require lifelong surveillance with diagnostic thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-stimulated radioiodine uptake as well as thyroid remnant or tumor ablation with radioiodine therapy. Other imaging techniques including ultrasound and positron-emission tomography have also gained increasing importance as follow-up surveillance methods. However these other methods are not intrinsically specific for thyroid tissue and there remains a need for novel thyroid specific imaging methods, especially for tumors increasingly recognized by thyroglobulin production but with poor radioiodide uptake due to absent or decreased sodium-iodide symporter expression. The PI, who was both co-inventor and co-developer with Genzyme of wild type recombinant hTSH (Thyrogen), currently approved for diagnostic imaging of thyroid cancer, now proposes to develop novel radiolabeled high affinity hTSH analogs and/or analog-coated nanoparticles for imaging of thyroid cancer through targeting the highly specific TSH receptor. During our highly scored and successfully completed phase 1 SBIR study we have achieved all the aims including optimization of stable cell lines producing high levels of the final two candidate super active analogs; optimization of large scale bioreactor production methods; development of novel, high capacity purification methods suitable for commercial scale-up; and rigorous quantification and characterization of purified analogs by multiple physicochemical methods. We also used a selected radiolabeled TSH super agonist analog to develop a novel technology for enhanced imaging of thyroid cancer and provided preliminary data for even a newer technology of analog-coated nanoparticles containing imaging agents. In the current phase 2 proposal, we plan to produce and purify additional large amounts of the final two TSH analog candidates sufficient for all the phase 2 studies using the methods of production, purification and radio labeling optimized in the phase 1 study. We also plan to continue development and optimization of various xenograft, transgenic and orthotopic models of thyroid cancer to be used in the various imaging studies proposed with both directly labeled analogs as well as analog-coated liposome nanoparticles containing fluorescent and radiolabeled imaging agents. In addition, quantitative uptake studies of radiolabeled TSH analogs will include various thyroid tumor models and biodistribution to multiple organs. This novel labeled TSH analog or targeted nanoparticle imaging method may later be extended to improved therapeutic approaches for thyroid cancer including TSH receptor-mediated delivery of therapeutic agents such as radionuclides or toxins as well as radioguided surgery.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy of endocrine tissues and most patients require lifelong surveillance with diagnostic thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-stimulated radio-iodine imaging to detect recurrent tumor. The PI has developed a much improved form of TSH and proposes a completely new method of thyroid cancer imaging using novel recombinant TSH superagonist analogs that should greatly improve early detection and lead to improved cancer treatment and survival.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Cerebral edema is arguably the most serious complication of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). The central HYPOTHESIS is that increasing osmolality of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will move free water out of tissue into the ventricles where it can be removed, thereby reducing cellular swelling, intracranial pressure (ICP), and cell death; ultimately improving cerebral function. Approach: The applicant proposes to undertake a pilot human study of an innovative catheter for the reduction of cerebral edema. The initial clinical application of this catheter will be severe TBI, and will involve replacing standard external ventricular drain (EVD) catheters with Reductive Ventricular Osmotherapy (RVOT) Catheters that 1) remove free water from CSF 2) remove bulk CSF acutely if needed to control ICP, and 3) monitor ICP. Removal of free water increases osmolality of the CSF, which will theoretically result in removal of interstitial brain water minimizing cerebral edema and improving nutrient exchange and Cerebral perfusion. A controlled study of experimental TBI in swine was performed, which demonstrated elevation of CSF osmolality, reduction in intracranial pressure (ICP), improvement in CSF chemistry variables such as lactate, and reduction in intracellular edema and cell death. Controls were treated with EVD catheters. The analyzed variables consistently indicated that RVOT produced either significant improvement or a favorable trend compared to EVD, supporting the central hypothesis that RVOT reduces cellular swelling and cell death while ultimately improving cerebral function. Specific Aims: (I) The RVOT System design will be refined and tested to optimize performance for clinical studies and for obtaining FDA Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approval. (II) A multicenter clinical study will be conducted to assess patient safety issues and effectiveness of RVOT in controlling ICP and intracellular edema in TBI patients.This pilot study of 15 patients at three sites is expected to demonstrate RVOT Catheter equivalence with conventional EVD catheters and provide clinical data to support the design of a pivotal study intended to demonstrate RVOT superiority to conventional drainage. ICP will be the primary endpoint. Study results will be used to support a FDA 510(k) product approval. Significance: Cerebral edema is a life threatening condition that is refractory to conventional treatments in a significant population of TBI and severe stroke patients. Completion of Phase II aims will make pivotal human studies of RVOT catheters possible.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     In 2003 over 1.2 million Americans with traumatic brain injury were treated at hospitals emergency departments, 290,000 were hospitalized, and over 50,000 died. Secondary insults from cerebral edema may be responsible for one-third of TBI deaths. Innovative approaches to this problem have been lacking and the current therapies available to treat this critical medical condition are limited in their effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "Cool roofs have been used on commercial, industrial, and residential buildings to reduce their interior temperature and energy use. However, cool roofs have a winter time heating penalty because they reflect solar heat that would help warm the building, thereby increasing the heating load. To maximize the energy savings by reducing both heating and cooling loads, an intelligent roof coating that can tune the reflectance and transmittance of solar light based on the environmental temperature will be developed. This proposed technology concerns the development and commercialization of a waste cooking oil based thermochromic intelligent roof coating that can autonomously respond to temperature changes by adjusting the light transmission. In Phase I, this bio-based coating was successfully prepared, coated asphalt shingles were fully evaluated, the optimal operating conditions were determined, and an economic analysis was conducted. The technical feasibility of this technology has been successfully established. The overall objectives of Phase II are to bring this proven and viable technology from a laboratory scale to a pilot scale, produce coated shingles for field tests and for evaluations at other companies, and demonstrate its commercial viability. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The success of this project will bring an energy efficient, cost effective, environmentally friendly technology to the roof market that will bring significant energy and cost savings to the end-users, protect the environment and improve human health, and reduce the use of petroleum based fuel. This bio-based roof coating technology is innovative and practical. Compared to conventional cool roofs, this coating not only reflects solar light when the temperature is high, but also it transmits solar light when the temperature is low, thereby reducing both the heating and cooling loads of the buildings. The use of a renewable and agriculture based coating product will also eliminate the odor and volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions associated with traditional roof coating products and generate more economic opportunity for the agricultural sector.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Rabies is a deadly disease, estimated to cause 40-70 thousand deaths per year. It is most often spread by a bite and saliva from an infected wild or feral animal (e.g., bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, ferrets, cats, or dogs). Oral vaccines in bait have been successful with animals that chew their food, thus allowing the vaccine bait to come into contact with the mouth and throat mucosa to elicit the immune response. However, canid species (dogs, foxes, coyotes) ,the primary vectors of the disease to humans, do not chew their food or the bait;  rather it gulped down causing the vaccine to be destroyed in the stomach acid.    For our Phase 1 project, we combined two technologies to prepare a novel form of rabies vaccine, designed to be stable at ambient temperatures and in harsh environments, such as during the journey through stomach acid and bile secretion on its way to the small intestine where we propose it can immunize the animal through the intestinal mucosa. The PI's patent pending  Preservation by Vaporization  (PBV) technology which immobilizes sensitive biologicals in the  glass state  so they are stable at ambient temperatures has been utilized with alginate gel encapsulation to protect vaccines from heat and chemical damage. UST utilized PBV to dry-preserve two alginate-encapsulated vaccines VRG (vaccinia-based) and ERA (Rabies based). We  exceeded our original target specifications for vaccine stability during 1 hour equilibration at 60 C, and after 2  weeks at 37 C.    The specific aims of the Phase II project are to: 1) Optimize formulation of dry preserved rabies vaccines encapsulated in alginate gel microspheres. 2) Formulate Rabies Vaccine Animal Bait Nucleus (RVABN) filled with VRG and with ERA vaccines. 3) Evaluate efficacy of the vaccine products in animal studies - specifically foxes and dogs - against a rabies challenge.    The long-range goal of this project is to produce an oral vaccine for rabies secreted in bait that is stable in the wild. This vaccine, once eaten by wild animals will not be destroyed in the GI tract and will produce a strong immune response in the intestine. UST will partner with CDC and Merial Ltd. who will provide the vaccine and help to perform animal studies.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The number of deaths that rabies causes each year is estimated to be between 40,000- 70,000. The cost of living with rabies in America is high and growing, exceeding  300 million per year. Although rabies vaccinations have been available for domestic animals for many years, only recently have such preventive measures been developed to control rabies in wildlife. Development of baits that would have stable rabies vaccines embedded in edible hydrogenated oils such that the vaccines are protected from the elements, including sunlight, temperature, humidity and gastric juices, could allow vaccination of wild animals so they do not get rabies, and thus could help eradicate the disease.",

However, all current biogedarable materials used in making DESs are not successful due primarily to their sever inflammatory response to stented arterial walls. VasoTech Inc. has preliminarily developed an inflammatory-free, highly biocompatible and biodegradable material--BioDe(r) material by blending Amorphous Calcium Phosphate (ACP) with Poly (Lactide-co-Glycolide) (PLGA). The major purposes of this SBIR Fast Track application are to further characterize BioDe(r) polymer's biocompatibility and degradation kinetics (Phase I), and further utilize it as drug carrier to develop a powerful new generation of DES-PowerStent by coating BioDe(r) polymer and Combo(r) drug formulation--a potent anti- restenosis formulation consisting of equal amount of Sirolimus and Paclitaxel onto VasoTech(r) metal stent. In this Fast-Track application, Phase I studies will be 1) to optimize BioDe(r) polymer formulation and its coating process (SpecificAim1), and 2) characterize the biodegradation kinetics of optimized biodegradable polymer from Specific Aim 1 study through a well established rat carotid arterial stenting model (Specific Aim 2). In Phase II, PowerStent will be created by coating developed BioDe(r) biodegradable polymer with Combo(r) anti-restenosis drug formulation onto VasoTech(r) metal stent surface.

An alternative approach to protecting humans from Lyme disease is to vaccinate the disease reservoirs to reduce or eliminate B. burgdorferi from vector ticks, thereby suppressing enzootic transmission and preventing them from passing the disease to humans. A number of lab studies have shown that orally administered OspA vaccines successfully vaccinate rodents, and reduce prevalence of infection in ticks. Our objective is to develop a novel approach for preventing human exposure to Lyme disease spirochetes by significantly reducing infection prevalence in the tick vector, Ixodes scapularis, using reservoir targeted vaccines (RTVs) derived from rice grain. In phase I SBIR, we demonstrate that we can produce immunogenic rOspA in rice grain and mice were protected from B. burgdoferi challenge after immunization with rOspA via needle injection. In the present Phase II SBIR proposal, we will develop stable rice lines via field selection in multiple generations to establish seed stock for animal study and for future commercialization. We will test the effectiveness of rOspA in laboratory animals via oral administration on clearance of B. burgdorferi in tick's gut. Finally, we will conduct a field test to determine the reduction of infected tick population in endemic area. Since rice grain is naturally a food of many of the animals expected to serve as B. burgdorferi reservoirs, producing rOspA in rice provides a distinct advantage over other expression systems and more importantly, rice-based rOspA will offer an excellent safety profile to humans, animals and the environment.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lyme disease, caused by a bite from ticks carrying B. burgdorferi, is a major threat to human health in many areas of the United States. Previous studies show that the prevalence of B. burgdorferi in ticks can be dramatically reduced by vaccinating rodent reservoirs with outer surface protein A from B. burgdorferi. Development of an affordable oral vaccine would enable large scale vaccination of animal reservoirs, and decrease the risk of transmitting Lyme disease to humans.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transferrin plays a crucial role in controlling cell growth and survival by regulating cellular iron uptake, transport and utilization, and thus is an essential culture media ingredient used for cell culture-based production of therapeutic proteins and vaccines. With the concerns over the increasing risks of transmission of infectious pathogenic agents through the use of animal/human-derived protein ingredients, recombinant transferrin is preferred to replace the plasma serum-derived human or bovine transferrin by the biopharmaceutical industry. In a Phase I SBIR project, we successfully completed the feasibility study of expressing recombinant human transferrin in rice grain by showing that the recombinant transferrin is functionally equivalent to the native human transferrin in terms of their capacity of binding iron reversibly and promoting cell growth. The expression level of the bioactive recombinant transferrin is up to 0.88% of rice seed dry weight, which is over eight fold higher than our targeted expression level (0.1%) and 88 fold higher than the threshold level (0.01%) required for commercial application. In this phase II proposal, we propose to further develop the transgenic plants selected in Phase I into homozygous transgenic lines with stable high level expression of transferrin and high grain yield; perform comprehensive compositional and biochemical analysis of the recombinant transferrin; and compare the recombinant transferrin to commercial native human transferrin for examining their equivalency in proliferating hybridoma cells and culturing stem cells. We anticipate that as a result of phase II, a safe and affordable recombinant transferrin as an alternative to human or bovine plasma-derived transferrin will be made commercially available to both the cell culture market for the production of vaccines and therapeutics and the stem cell research for regenerative therapies at a price of about 20 times less than that of the currently available recombinant transferrin. This will benefit millions of patients and the health of a large population of healthy people including children and the elderly.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transferrin plays a crucial role in controlling cell growth and survival by regulating cellular iron uptake, transport and utilization, and thus is an essential culture media ingredient used for cell culture-based production of therapeutic proteins and vaccines. To address the safety concerns over the increasing risks of transmission of infectious pathogenic agents through the use of animal/human-derived protein ingredients, we use rice to produce recombinant human transferrin as a safe and affordable alternative to plasmas-derived human or bovine transferrin for cell-culture-based production of vaccines and therapeutics and the stem cell-based regenerative therapies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the considerable success of our phase 2 SBIR, we have achieved the completion of lung image analysis software that segments and thoroughly measures the lungs and their five lobes along with the airway tree. We have recently just achieved 510(k) FDA clearance for Pulmonary Workstation (PW 2.0) which now opens the door to the use of the Phase 2 software in the clinical arena. Our first phase II grant period, for which we seek and extension, was targeting the use of this software in the context of a clinical setting, guiding decisions and interventions associated with the placement of endobronchial valves and guiding other endobronchial interventions such as is associated with lung cancer assessment. While enthusiasm for PW2.0 remains high in interventional circles, it has also been adopted by numerous large multi-center NIH sponsored research projects as well as commercial and device company clinical trials in the US and abroad. In order to improve the workflow and to minimize human interactions, as well as to accommodate improved measures related to low lung volume scans being gathered to assess air trapping in both COPD and Asthma trials, we have established a new series of specific aims, and these new goals are directly in line with PA-08-056 seeking Phase II SBIR renewal which are associated with the building of complex instrumentation and clinical research tools to establish new biomarkers to differentiate phenotypes in a disease entity now lumped together as a single pathology. The goal of this application is to focus specifically on COPD and Asthma to complement our original emphysema focus. 1. Registration for longitudinal analysis and air trapping: we will integrate a method for accurate (1  mm or better) matching of lung volumes across time and change of lung volumes. 2. Speed up analysis for high throughput sites: The original software was designed to handle a  typical clinical load in a pulmonary bronchoscopy suite that would typically be at most 3-4 cases  per day. With the software being used to analyze up to 20,000 lung volume scans over a three  year period in just one project, we have devised a plan to introduce batch processing steps and  further develop our segmentation approaches to minimize human interventions. 3. Measurements of airway at bifurcations: Because many disease processes begin with irritant  deposition and inflammation at the airway bifurcations, VIDA proposes to measure the whole  airway tree using the optimal surface finding techniques developed for the segments in phases I  and II. 4. Improved segmentation and automatic naming of six key airway paths: COPDGene and others  have developed a phenotyping strategy for identifying and characterizing airway disease using  the scion of six specific segmental airways. VIDA herein proposes methods for reliable  automatic segmentation, naming and measurement of these smaller airways. All the newly developed tools resulting from the four aims above will be integrated into Pulmonary Workstation. Throughout the project we will continuously make updated versions of Pulmonary Workstation available to the NIH sponsored COPDGene and SPIROMICS image coordination and analysis centers for evaluation including time trials throughout years one and two. During this period user feedback will be used to further optimize the tools. A full rollout and testing of the system is planned for year three        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project defined herein is to extend VIDA Diagnostics' successful Phase II SBIR, (Tissue and Airway Assessment for Emphysema Interventions) which resulted in an FDA approved lung densitometry and airway measurement software application. Our goals are to further develop the airway and parenchymal measurements to provide more ways to phenotype subjects and more repeatable endpoints for clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abusive head trauma or Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) is the most common cause of death from child abuse. Hospital-based, parent education programs targeting parents of newborns have been proven effective in reducing significantly the incidence of abusive head injuries. Massachusetts and eight other states have adopted legislation mandating education designed to prevent SBS. Federal and additional state mandates may be forthcoming. Males - biological fathers, mothers' boyfriends and stepfathers - are the most frequent perpetrators of SBS. Infant crying is the most common precursor to incidents of SBS. Building on preliminary work with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and The Medical Foundation, Vida Health Communications, Inc. will produce and evaluate  All Babies Cry , an educational media package for parents of newborns. It includes a media part to be shown to parents in the hospital, and a DVD and booklet to take home, containing explicit demonstrations of strategies for soothing a crying infant and managing parental stress. The media format is expected to appeal to men more than printed material alone. Research and development activities throughout Phase I and II will include: 1) completing development and production of DVD media in two parts and an accompanying booklet (all in English and Spanish) with formative (Phase I) and summative (Phase II) input from parents and Experts; 2) a rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness of the media package in improving fathers' knowledge of infant behavior and parental stress, behavior to reduce and cope with infant crying and to assess and manage their own stress, realistic expectations of their infant's behavior, greater belief in the efficacy of infant soothing strategies, greater perceived ability to implement them, and greater intention to do so. At the conclusion of Phase II, Vida will have a completed educational media package that has been thoroughly evaluated and will meet the requirements of the State of Massachusetts Department of Public Health Shaken Baby Syndrome Prevention Initiative for distribution of all new parents in the Commonwealth. The program will then be adapted as needed to meet other states mandates and marketed nationally. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Infant crying is considered the most common precursor to shaking a baby.  All Babies Cry  addresses critical public health concerns surrounding the incidence of Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) by filling a need for parent education about normal infant crying behavior, strategies for soothing a crying infant, as well as strategies to assess and manage parental stress in response to infant crying.

The lack of sufficient expression levels Factor VIII (FVIII) in hemophilic patients indicates that further improvements of the current gene delivery systems are needed to generate a therapeutic product. In the Phase I of this project we initiated a study to address the issues of FVIII expression level and duration based on findings showing that FVIII expression is limited by unstable mRNA, interaction with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones, and a requirement for facilitated ER to Golgi transport through interaction with the mannose- binding lectin LMAN1. Vectors for FVIII expression in gene therapy applications typically have used a B domain deleted (BDD) cDNA in which the coding sequence for this domain is removed to yield a shorter construct for protein production and gene transfer. Of note, the expression of BDD FVIII within the cell has the same limitations as the whole FVIII molecule. However, the inclusion of several asparagine-linked oligosaccharides within a short B-domain spacer increased ER to Golgi transport resulting in secretion of functional FVIII at levels 15- to 25-fold higher than full-length or B domain deleted FVIII both in vitro and in vivo. Phase I initiated the testing of the hypothesis that therapeutic FVIII production can be significantly enhanced by addition of parts of the B domain in hemophilic dogs, the most relevant animal model to the human disease and a prerequisite test for clinical studies, Two FIV vectors were constructed and tested which contain canine FVIII with different lengths of the B domain added. The constructs were prepared with the canine FVIII genetic sequence to reduce complicating cross-species factors when introduced into the hemophilic dog. Also, in Phase I the parameters for preparing high titer virus were optimized and the innate immune response to VSV- G and GP64 pseudotyped vectors were analyzed. The completion of the Phase I aims puts the project in position to conduct the FVIII expression level and duration studies in hemophilic mice and dogs and to select the most favorable FVIII cDNA for safe and long term expression. In this Phase II study the aims are to evaluate expression level, duration and clinical benefit from FIV delivery of canine FVIII with no B domain or with two different lengths of the B domain included. Also, additional elements that may further enhance FVIII production significantly from transduced cells will be incorporated into the transfer vector and tested. This Phase II also includes the development of methods to provide increased production of the virus vector for these and subsequent studies, which will require large amounts of the vector.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinical application of Factor VIII gene therapies to hemophilia A patients have suffered from insufficient production of Factor VIII. Using an FIV lentiviral vector capable of long-term expression in host cells, Factor VIII gene sequences with improvements designed to overcome the problem of poor expression will be tested in hemophilic dogs, the animal model which closely resembles the human disease. The goal is to advance the best product as determined from this study toward application in the clinic to human patients.",

        "abstract": "Improved production yield is a constant objective of increasingly sophisticated agricultural practices. As Earth's population grows, higher yield is a critical mechanism for insuring adequate food supply. An effective way to increase yield is by reducing waste. Crops begin to ripen when encountering ethylene at low levels and sustain the ripening process by self-generation of ethylene. Because ethylene is a ripening agent, the increased production of this gas accelerates the maturity of the crop and causes it to rot and become inedible. If these increased levels can be detected, the harvesting of fruit and vegetable crops can be precisely timed to be most economically viable before crop viability is compromised. Further, detection of elevated ethylene can also eliminate compounding of post-harvest waste due to rot or senescence. Present monitors are inadequate due to sensitivity, selectivity, ruggedness or cost. The proposed high performance ethylene sensor will provide research plant physiologists a tool with which to correlate the causes and effects of ethylene release and the means to quantitatively measure resulting mitigation strategies. This project will develop a compact, rugged, low parts-per-billion (ppb) gaseous ethylene optical analyzer, ultimately suitable for widespread application in the agricultural industry. New monitors will be enabling components for controlled plant growth, early detection of stress, precise application of ripening inhibitors and other chemical agents, and successful long-term storage and delivery. This tightly monitored life cycle will provide modern agricultural industry the tools to continually increase production yields.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The analysis of complex natural mixtures presents a significant scientific challenge in biomedical studies involving natural products and other complex biogenic samples, particularly when the need for isolation of minor constituents arises. Countercurrent chromatography (CCC) offers high loading capacity, complete sample recovery, and high purity fractions. It makes use of a gentle liquid stationary phase that prevents degradation of labile samples, and is already a valuable tool in natural products research. CCC separations consume relatively little solvent and don't require the use of expensive solid supports, making them highly economical, both environmentally and fiscally. The frugal use of consumables makes CCC much more  green  than other competing technologies. Determination of partition coefficients (K-values) is a unique analytical capability offered by CCC. However, accurate measurement of analyte partition coefficients with modern CCC instruments requires that sample loading be constrained far below system capacity. With current technology, the unique practical advantages of CCC are essentially lost when the conditions are optimized to determine K- values. In addition, successful use of CCC currently requires specialized training and considerable operator time. Automation, as it has for many other technologies, could effectively mitigate both the academic burden of assimilating decades of key information spread over hundreds of journal articles, and the practical burden of operating a complex multi-component system. Challenges imposed by the dynamic nature of the liquid CCC column had prevented the development of automated CCC until the SBC achieved a breakthrough proof of concept during Phase I of this SBIR project. The long-term objective of this project, and the ultimately marketable product, will be a fully functional automated CCC controller that will provide the separation power of CCC to minimally trained users, as well as enhance current capabilities and provide new functionality to experienced users. Automated CCC will provide a significant contribution to the goals of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), empowering biomedical researchers in their quest to analyze complex bioactive samples and alleviate human disease. The success of this project will be demonstrated by its application to the purification and study of bioactive natural products present in commonly consumed botanical products, one of which has shown promise in the fight against tuberculosis.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The analysis of highly complex chemical mixtures presents a significant scientific challenge, particularly in biomedical studies involving natural products and other complex biogenic samples. Countercurrent chromatography (CCC) is a technique, originally developed at NIH, which is able to solve many challenges in this area. This SBIR research proposal provides the key piece of technology required to bring the immense potential of CCC's analytical capabilities to realization, empowering biomedical researchers with a much-needed new tool in the arsenal to combat disease through biochemical discovery.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary medicine is facing a broad spectrum of unmet clinical needs, mainly for three reasons: (1) Lack of regional and quantitative information about lung function especially in obstructive disease; (2) Lack of a radiation-free diagnostic modality in pediatric lung diseases to initiate treatment at the right time; (3) Lack of a grading scale for inflammatory activity and diffusion barriers in interstitial lung disease. The availability of a safe, affordable, and highly quantitative modality for 3-D imaging of lung function would improve early diagnosis and discrimination of diseases, accelerate testing of therapies by pharmaceutical companies, and assist in personalized disease management and intervention decisions for children and adult patients. Hyperpolarized xenon (HXe) MRI is a leading candidate to address this need. Since the depolarization of HXe atoms in lungs is dominated by the presence of paramagnetic oxygen gas molecules, an imaging sequence that determines the rate of signal loss can be interpreted as a map of the local alveolar oxygen concentration. Our recent hundred-fold improvements in HXe production technology deliver high polarizations of HXe in multi-liter quantities. We have incorporated this technology into a compact platform, delivered it to clinical partners, and operated it remotely over periods of several months. Our xenon-tuned 32-element parallel receive coil with integrated asymmetric birdcage transmit coil achieves highly uniform flip angles with maximal speed-up factors, allowing several 3D images in a single breath hold. Our Phase I project demonstrated feasibility for a robust, quantitative, high resolution protocol by implementing and performing pulse sequences that determine the rate of signal loss of pulmonary HXe, applying novel image registration techniques, and estimating corrections due to loss of HXe into the bloodstream.  In this Phase 2 project we propose to establish HXe mapping of local alveolar oxygen as a clinically validated and commercially viable diagnostic protocol. We will implement imaging sequences that reconstruct oxygen-induced signal loss with three state-of-the-art acceleration schemes to compare their resolution, SNR, susceptibility to artifacts, and biomarker accuracy. We will compare these sequences against three truth standards: precisely mixed bags of gas, healthy volunteers performing tidal breathing with their exhaled gases calibrated with gas concentration analysis, and hyperventilated healthy volunteers with exhaled gases calibrated with gas concentration analysis. Comparing measurements after tidal breathing to others after hyperventilating will allow calibration and improvement of our models correcting for lt 10% xenon signal lost to the bloodstream. Finally we will explore and demonstrate the utility of this protocol in the diagnosis and severity staging of several patients with COPD (ventilation abnormalities), interstitial disease (gas exchange abnormalities), and sickle cell disease (perfusion abnormalities). The US FDA has approved our hyperpolarized xenon for Phase 2 trials in subjects with lung disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pulmonary functional magnetic resonance imaging with hyperpolarized xenon, a technology which recently improved by two orders of magnitude, has the potential to address unmet needs in managing a full range of lung diseases, including COPD, asthma, cystic fibrosis, and interstitial diseases. We propose to develop an innovative, robust, and quantitative probe of regional alveolar oxygen concentration with high resolution in three-dimensions and validate it against truth standards. This non-ionizing, well-tolerated, quick, and affordable imaging modality would provide pulmonologists caring for children through adult patients with maps of the highest measure of lung function: regional oxygen exchange into the bloodstream.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate rapid, nondestructive, quantitative analysis of trace-level toxic elements in both substrates and coated layers for consumer products in a device fit for purpose on a factory floor. Restrictions such as the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA) are expanding world wide beyond lead to include additional harmful elements at trace levels. The analyzer will provide manufacturers the means to conveniently test their products, raw materials, and components for compliance with the new standards. Currently, there is no practical method to accurately test outside of a lab. The objective is to construct an analyzer for quantifying ten toxic elements at or below regulated levels. The analyzer will use XOS's world-leading x-ray optics to produce multiple monochromatic beams from a single x-ray tube, providing excellent sensitivity, lower limits of detection, and short measurement times for the entire relevant part of the periodic table. It will include advanced software for processing the combined data sets and separating the results for the coatings and substrates. The low-power consumption, reduced maintenance, and compact design are fit for purpose in manufacturing, distribution, or regulatory environments.\nThe broader impact of this research is the mitigation of inadvertent exposure risk. Toys and other consumer products will be safer as adults and children are protected from toxic elements. American manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and regulators are facing increasing global regulations restricting hazardous substances in manufactured products with associated costs and liability risks. This new testing capability would reduce testing costs by more than 75%, currently more than $1B, compared to existing laboratory-based methods. It would also assist U.S. manufacturers and distributors in cost-effective compliance by testing before the products leave the plant or distribution center, thereby, gaining or preserving their competitive position and avoiding the loss of sales and jobs due to offshore migration of manufacturing. This analyzer will also enable manufactures to safely explore new materials as a substitute for restricted materials. Consumer fears provide U.S. manufacturers an opportunity to increase market share if they can demonstrate safety. Additionally, the societal benefits for consumers are significant. Consumers can be certain the products they buy are safe. The ability to accurately detect toxic elements will help to reduce their proliferation into the marketplace and improve public health. This enables improved quality of life and a reduced health care burden.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hands-on training is a widely accepted methodology, especially for learning clinical procedures as they can be complicated and difficult to master. Virtual Reality (VR) based training systems can be highly successful in training operators because they can be accessed anytime anywhere as a refresher without the need for a human expert, can simulate various scenarios, can objectively monitor a trainee's performance and provide feedback. Yantric, Inc proposes to develop a comprehensive hands-on virtual reality based system for clinical education and training in order to improve training effectiveness and patient safety. In this collaborative effort involving medical experts in three medical centers, we will develop a virtual reality based central line placement trainer with integrated touch feedback. Yantric has vast experience in developing medical simulation systems and we will take full advantage of our existing hardware and software architecture for the design and development of this system. At the end of this project, the system will consist of the following key components. (1) A customized training system containing a haptic interface that allows the user to insert real instruments, such as needles and catheters while receiving touch feedback. (2) A medical simulation and training system for the infraclavicular central line procedure with 3D Anatomical Viewer and ultrasound guidance. (3) General user interface and didactic content presentation that is internet browser based, developed with HTML/CSS and capable of user's performance recording and evaluation. (4) A virtual reality based medical trainer that is verified in terms of content and validated for training effectiveness with experts and medical residents. In terms of commercial potential, there is a large demand for virtual reality based medical trainers for needle and catheter insertion procedures in general and regional anesthesia procedures in particular. An increasing number of central line placement procedures are being performed by anesthesiologists, intensivists, cardiologists, surgeons and interventional radiologists and each procedure is complex enough that there is a strong demand for a good training simulator. Once our training system is developed, it can be installed at educational facilities, medical institutions, hospitals, urgent care or health care centers, clinics, laboratories, and radiology centers.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed hands-on virtual reality based medical training system is expected to radically transform how medical trainees gain expertise in performing infraclavicular central line placement procedure in particular and complex needle and catheter procedures in general. This in turn will decrease the number of complications in the operating room and increase the number of successful cases leading to better patient care.",

        "abstract": "Z4 Energy System, LLC's Compressed Air Water Pumping (CAWP) system is a new water pumping product that uses compressed air produced by wind power to operate a water pump, and stores compressed air for pumping during times with no wind. CAWP will be employed in areas where municipal water systems and grid provided electricity to operate water pumps are not available or practical. CAWP will provide a solution for water problems experienced by livestock growers that raise animals in remote pastures, organic/natural livestock producers, off-grid homeowners and recreational landowners, off-grid commercial and government facilities and municipal waste pond operators, wildlife habitat conservators, humanitarian and water relief organizations, and international users with similar requirements and site conditions. Water is a basic requirement for virtually all agricultural, industrial, urban, and recreational activities, as well as the sustained health of the natural environment. In the last 100 years the global population has tripled and the global water demand increased by a factor of six. Worldwide, a billion people do not have access to clean, sanitary water. In the U.S., the agriculture industry is the largest consumer of fresh water resources and includes 856,143 livestock operations that consume more than 1 billion gallons of water per day. During Phase II, a prototype system will be fabricated and tested under controlled, laboratory conditions to verify that operating efficiency meets computer model predictions. A prototype will then be field tested for 12 months to confirm actual performance to laboratory test results. Field trials are expected to show that CAWP features enable 21 key benefits: CAES - (1) water pumping during times of no wind, (2) no batteries required, (3) energy storage method is maintenance free and (4) is not temperature dependent. On-demand water pumping - (5) no need for oversized water tank, (5) eliminates water tank overflow, (7) reduces water evaporation losses, (8) eliminates mud and ice buildup around stock tanks, (9) pond or stream water can be pumped away from riparian areas and (10) eliminates need for water holding tank for domestic use. Wind-powered air compressor powers the system - (11) excess air aerates stock tank to delay wintertime freeze-over, (12) water can be available in remote pastures longer during winter to improve pasture utilization and (13) better pasture utilization reduces cost of feed. Water pump powered by compressed air - (14) pump can pump dry without damage and (15) pumping sludge will not damage the pump. Low cost air hose transfers energy for pumping and energy storage - (16) air compressor tower can be sited in the best wind resource area and (17) air compressor tower can be centrally sited with low-cost air hose used to run multiple wells. 100% wind powered - (18) no recurring fuel costs, (19) sustainable energy, (20) benign impact on the environment and (21) eligible for renewable energy rebates, tax incentives and cost sharing programs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women. Roughly 190,000 women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009, and 40,000 will die. The majority of breast cancers originate in the lobular or ductal cells of the milk-producing glands. In these structures, there are two main cell types: the inner luminal cells surrounded by basal myoepithelium. These cells types are distinct and are the precursors to various forms of breast cancer. As such, it is it is important to study these cell populations independently as well as in co-culture models systems. There are no commercial sources of quality-controlled, matched basal and luminal cells (from individual donors), forcing researchers to isolate and characterize the cells on their own. This process is time-consuming, requires access to human tissue, and introduces variation in the preparation and characterization of the cells. Primary cultured human mammary-derived cells are an ideal model currently used to investigate the genesis and understanding of human breast cancer. Because a consistent commercial source of primary human cultured breast-derived luminal and basal cells is unavailable, Zen-Bio, Inc. will address this need by providing a well characterized system to the research community.  Phase I of this project focused on generating an optimized primary human mammary-derived basal/luminal cell system from non-diseased tissue. Isolation and propagation of normal human basal and luminal mammary epithelial cells was achieved. Based on the successful completion of Phase I, we are eager to extend our research in Phase II by focusing on making this cell system commercially available. Additionally, we will expand the cell system to include basal and luminal mammary epithelial cells from breast tumor tissue. Aim 1 of this project is to continue detailed characterization of normal basal and luminal cells focusing on quality control and release criteria for commercialization. Aim 2 is to establish isolation and propagation procedures and detailed characterization of human breast cancer tumor derived cells building on our existing capabilities. Aim 3 is to perform comparative analyses between normal and malignant human cells to establish quality control criteria for commercialization and additional contract assay services at Zen-Bio. Multiple product offerings are expected from this proposal: matched, primary human mammary cell systems from non- diseased and malignant tissue, support media and reagents, contract assay services, and kits for breast cancer research.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At the completion of this project, a fully characterized human primary mammary-derived basal/luminal cell system from normal and malignant breast tissue will be commercially available to researchers. These systems will provide a currently unavailable opportunity to investigate the etiology of breast cancer and to identify potential cures.",

This membrane will be optimized to perform molecular separation and purification of fuels and chemicals from cellulosic biomass. The research objectives are to create a membrane with the desired pore size and orientation features.  A prototype membrane will be produced and tested for its ability to dewater biofuels by pervaporation.  It is anticipated that the selective ceramic membrane layer will provide efficient separations and have high temperature and chemical tolerance.  The membrane will have applications for a range of industrial markets including wastewater purification and desalination.\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of an innovative membrane technology that will contribute significant energy savings to the production of alternative fuels from cellulosic biomass.  Potential end users will include biorefineries that convert cellulosic biomass to fuels and chemicals.  A great advantage of molecular separations by membranes rather than distillation is the 40- 50% savings in energy.  If successful, this project would lead to a new class of high-throughput ceramic nanofiltration membranes that will have applications to other industrial sectors, including wastewater purification, natural gas purification, and coal gasification.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Bcl-2 family proteins are key effectors of cancers. Recent studies indicate that Myeloma cell factor-1 (Mcl-1), a member of this protein family, is a key regulator of lymphoid cancers including Multiple Myeloma (MM), Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), and other cancers.  Mcl-1 is regulated by distinct protein-protein interactions. Manipulation of these interactions using compounds that mimic the crucial binding domain, the BH3 domain, is a valid approach to developing oncology drugs. Efforts by commercial and academic groups have yielded several classes of compounds that target certain members of the Bcl-2 family. To date however, there has been no successful effort to develop a drug  that targets Mcl-1. There is a clear unmet need for such a drug.    In this application we propose the continued development of a novel compound that is highly active against Mcl-1. In our phase 1 study we identified a lead compound, characterized its in vitro and in vivo on-target activity, and demonstrated efficacy in a mouse xenograft model.  We are now proceeding with a comprehensive med chem. optimization strategy that utilizes NMR analysis, computational modeling, and a novel mitochondrial assay that guide development of an IND candidate. We will also incorporate results from a small molecule library screen performed with The Scripps Institute Molecular Screening Center (TSIMSC) under a grant from the NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Center Network (MLPCN) to help further guide SAR and provide potential backup compounds. .

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metastatic bone cancer and multiple myeloma affects over 600,000 people every year in the United States and cause progressive bone destruction that results in severe pain, fractures, and the inability to walk. Patients usually present with incapacitating pain secondary to osseous involvement, with or without vertebral collapse, and to spinal cord and/or nerve roots compression, commonly leading to paraplegia and quadriplegia. Conventional therapy consists of bed rest, bracing, anti-inflammatory, or narcotic analgesic medications, and radiation therapy. These conservative options (except radiation therapy) are not dissimilar from the management of osteoporotic compression fractures and are associated with the same type of complications, i.e., atelectasis and pneumonia, deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Surgical options are not possible for all patients, but when indicated, they consist of heavy interventions such as corpectomy or cage placement, with significant postprocedural recovery periods and high morbidity and mortality rates in patients who often have limited life expectancies. In addition, multifocal vertebral lesions are common and may contraindicate surgery. Vertebroplasty affects the pain symptom and was not designed to treat cancer. Current options for local treatment of metastatic spine cancer are insufficient. The hypothesis is that thermal ablation with high intensity interstitial ultrasound (HIIU) specifically matched to the tumor size and shape can be safe and efficacious in the management of metastatic spine cancer. We propose to develop a mechanism to perform minimally invasive conformal ultrasound ablation under combined computer tomography (CT) and CT fluoroscopy (CTF) guidance. Our work indicates that this method may provide a consistent, reliable, and safe treatment option in a simple and cost-efficient manner. The unique aspect of our approach is the ability to destruct an asymmetric target volume with a single needle that does not need to be placed in the center of the lesion. Under CT/CTF image guidance, we insert the ablator, localize the ablator with respect to the target zone, and then electronically shape the energy output to conform the target. Thus moderate placement errors can be simply corrected electronically. We also can ablate difficult shapes located nearby sensitive structures. There is a strong clinical need to deliver a means to kill the tumor in a focused and safe way in this sensitive area, protecting the spinal cord, around which the tumor is likely to have caused significant bone destruction already. The ability to conform the energy to the shape of the tumor with a sharply defined fringe field is critical and would add very significant clinical value. This program will develop an integrated instrumentation - ablative treatment delivery system, establish safe and accurate percutaneous HIIU needle placement and tumor ablation under real-time quantitative CT/CTF guidance, develop appropriate clinical workflow, and demonstrate use in clinical application.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vertebral metastatic disease is the most common malignant disease of the skeletal system and the most common causes of bone destruction in adult patients. Over 600,000 patients per year have progressive bone disease requiring treatment. Progressive bone destruction results in debilitating pain, fractures, and the inability to walk. Traditional techniques have been based on open surgery with potentially substantial surgery-associated morbidity. In addition, many patients may not possess sufficient cardiopulmonary reserve to undergo major spinal procedures. As a result, many of the affected patients are receiving palliative care with only symptomatic treatment of pain and paraparesis or quadriparesis. The first objective in treatment is to alleviate pain and prevent complications such as pathologic fractures, which is especially important in patients with spinal metastasis to avoid instability and neurologic dysfunction. The standard treatments include radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and, recently, therapy using systemic radiopharmaceuticals and biphosphonates; radiotherapy remains the treatment of choice. However, the long-term results of these treatments are not satisfying; an effective, minimally invasive local therapy that can be performed at a single outpatient setting would be beneficial. Minimally invasive procedures have been developed to replace standard procedures but most patients still require general and regional anesthesia and the procedures are only moderately minimally invasive. Percutaneous image-guided needle- based surgery is the least invasive mode of intervention practiced today and numerous variations of these techniques have been demonstrated to have high efficacy with low morbidity and low cost across many diseases and organ systems. It is, therefore, a logical imperative to explore percutaneous therapy in the management of metastatic spine cancer. For patients with tumoral spine disease, currently there is no adequate alternative to the immediate pain relief and minimal-invasiveness of percutaneous vertebroplasty. At the same time, however, the mechanism for pain relief in neoplastic lesion is not completely understood, thus vertebroplasty is still debated, and its efficacy has been proven so far on a very limited basis. Besides, the aim of vertebroplasty is pain relief and not eradication of the cancer. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is currently best indicated in patients complaining of a severe, focal, and mechanical back pain related to a neoplastic vertebral collapse without epidural involvement. In our practice, without spinal cord compression or epidural involvement, partial osteolysis of the posterior wall of the vertebral body is not a contraindication [Murphy-2000, Vasconcelos-2002]. Preventive treatment of osteolytic lesions at high risk of vertebral collapse in asymptomatic patients seems to be highly appropriate. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is rarely indicated at the cervical and cervicothoracic junction but may be of value in cases where surgery is contraindicated. These are the patients who would benefit the most from percutaneous US ablation of their bone cancer. Our approach thermal ablation with high intensity interstitial ultrasound (HIIU) specifically matched to the tumor size and shape can be safe and efficacious in the management of metastatic spine cancer. Toward proving this hypothesis, we propose to develop a mechanism to perform minimally invasive conformal ultrasound ablation under combined computer tomography (CT) and CT fluoroscopy (CTF) guidance. In summary, the most unique aspect of HIIU ablation is the ability to destruct an asymmetric target volume with a single needle that does not need to be placed in the center of the lesion. Under intraoperative image guidance, one could insert the ablator to a safe location with respect to the surrounding anatomy, localize the ablator with respect to the target zone, and then electronically shape the energy output to conform the target. This approach will allow for electronic compensation of moderate needle placement errors and for the ablation of difficult shapes located nearby sensitive structures.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The advent of next-generation (Next-gen) sequencing technologies has begun a surge in whole genome sequencing and resequencing, exemplified spectacularly by four papers describing five complete human genomes in 2008 alone. One company, Knome, now even offers customers their entire genome sequence using Next-gen sequencing technology. These developments, together with targeted resequencing of genome, presage the day of the  1000 human genome. Broad-scale whole human genome resequencing (WHGR) will have enormous impact on the areas of personalized medicine, human evolution and human diversity. To fully realize that potential, however, software capabilities must be dramatically enhanced to meet the significant challenges posed by the sheer volume of data generated in these projects, the diversity of technology-specific data characteristics and simply analyzing the 6 billion base pair diploid human genome. Moreover, we see the day when technology improvements and cost reductions make WHGR as commonplace as bacterial genome sequencing has become today. For that to occur, assembly and analysis software must be accessible to a far broader and less computer savvy range of researchers than the highly specialized bioinformatics teams that decode the information now. Also, computer resources are far more limited even for a well funded research laboratory than available to a large sequencing center. Therefore, the overall goal of this proposal is to develop a Next-gen sequence assembly and analysis pipeline, DESKAPP, that will run on an affordable ( 5000) high- end desktop computer and produce a human genome sequence in a reasonable timeframe (days, not weeks). WHGR by DESKAPP will involve a reference-guided main assembly as well as a de novo assembly branch to characterize unique regions of the new genome relative to the reference. Merging of the assemblies produces a complete sequence that can be evaluated for gene content, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and structural variation (SV; indels, inversion, translocations) both by web-based searches of external databases to identify known allelic variation and by direct examination of the sequence to identify new polymorphisms. A Disk Sort Alignment algorithm allows the data sets which are far too large for in-memory processing to be evaluated and clustered for assembly by SeqMan N-Gen (SM N-Gen), our desktop assembly engine. Using a prototype DSA-SM N-Gen pipeline, we have processed the entire 7.4x 454 data set from the James Watson genome to a layout file in 31 hours using DSA and have assembled three chromosomes: 8; 21; and X; using SM N-Gen. Assembly times varied from 1 hour for Chromosome 21 to 10.6 hours for an average- sized chromosome, such as Chromosome 8. Together, these results demonstrate the feasibility of constructing a DESKAPP pipeline for WHGR. The Phase II Aims are designed to build upon this foundation and produce a seamless pipeline for the desktop assembly and analysis of a human genome in a matter of days.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Next-gen sequencing technologies have started a new revolution throughout biology by providing DNA sequence data in unprecedented quantities at continually decreasing costs. This data will be invaluable in the emerging era of personalized medicine and in exploring the immense diversity of life. The goal of this project is to develop desktop computer software that will enable research laboratories and clinics of any size to realize the promise of these new technologies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart disease frequently leads to cardiac fibrosis. In almost all cases of chronic heart disease, the myocardium exhibits fibrosis developed by activated cardiac fibroblasts. These fibroblasts are quiescent in the healthy heart. Interstitial fibrosis due to extracellular matrix deposition by fibroblasts increases the stiffness of the tissue and impairs cardiac relaxation. Discovering pharmaceutical treatments that can reverse fibrosis is a critical unmet need; no such drugs currently exist. This project will develop a novel high-throughput screening platform for drug discovery that measures the physiological properties of live, engineered tissue samples, and their controls, cultured in 96-well plates(the PalpatorTM system). This platform will measure drug-induced changes in the physiological properties of engineered tissues. The Phase I project focuses on completing the development of the PalpatorTM screening system and obtaining feedback from academic and industrial collaborators. In addition, the algorithm used for the data analysis software will be modified to reduce failure rates. The modified software will be beta tested for its ability to obtain meaningful values for the physiological parameters used to indicate that treatment with the panel of chemical compounds has altered the properties of the engineered tissues. The final packaging of the project-related software will be outsourced for its launch. The Phase II project focuses on scaling up the engineered tissue-based screening system to make it amenable to high-throughput applications in industry. The tissue culture consumables for growing engineered tissues in 96-well plates will be produced in collaboration with Engineering Industries, Inc. (Verona, WI). The scaled-up engineered tissue production will significantly improve screening efficiency. This highly efficient Palpator screening system will be used to profile the effects of 50 commonly prescribed cardiovascular drugs on engineered heart tissues. Although the engineered heart tissues are constructed to mimic the physiological properties of native heart muscles, profiling known cardiovascular drugs will validate the utility of employing engineered heart tissues in drug discovery and toxic compound testing. To further validate the engineered tissue model, a library of compounds with known cardiovascular effects will be screened using the Palpator system. A novel phenotypic screening protocol that employs both engineered tissues cultured with highly contractile fibroblasts to mimic the fibrotic heart and 'normal' engineered heart tissues will be used to identify chemical compounds that reduce the contractility of the fibrotic engineered tissues but yet maintain the healthy contractile activities of normal engineered heart tissues. The combination of the engineered tissue models and the Palpator screening device will accelerate drug discovery and reduce the need (and associated costs) of extensive animal studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the United States today, about 5 million people suffer from heart disease, one of the most prevalent chronic conditions and the number one complication of heart attacks. This proposal describes an entirely new method for testing potential drugs to learn if they can help repair the heart or if they are toxic to the body, by measuring whether a drug changes how a heart tissue model behaves. This research may provide a breakthrough in accelerating drug discovery and reducing costs, because it is rapid, high-throughput, and may reduce the need for animal testing.",

        "abstract": "Nitrogen affects proteins, enzymes and metabolic processes and is essential for crop growth. While annual usage varies based on world economic conditions, approximately 80,000,000 metric tons of fertilizer N are applied annually in the world, of which more than 10,000,000 tons are applied annually in the United States. If crops don?t have an adequate supply of nitrogen, significant yield losses can occur. Consequently, growers typically apply an extra margin of fertilizer as insurance against possible yield reduction from under-application. Excessive nitrogen applications create a number of problems. First, excess nitrogen rates can contaminate water resources. Nitrogen lost from Midwest farm fields is a leading cause of the hypoxia zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Second, wasted nitrogen can cause a significant reduction in profitability, well beyond the cost of the wasted nitrogen. On crops like potatoes and sugar beets, excess nitrogen can cause a reduction in crop quality. Third, there is a negative impact to our atmosphere from applying nitrogen that is not consumed by the crop. Unused nitrogen enters the atmosphere as a potent greenhouse gas. As US farm policy becomes increasingly based on soil and water-quality initiatives, individual farm sustainability may be affected by a farmer?s ability to maintain production levels under closer scrutiny, and even mandates on the amount of fertilizer used. For each of these factors, improvements in managing nitrogen properly will increase the sustainability of their agro-economic production systems. These improvements include accurate assessments of available nitrogen already in the soil. Current approaches employ conventional soil sampling and lab analysis. Sampling depths required for nitrate are relatively deep. As a result, nitrate sampling is laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. Because the samples must be submitted to a testing lab for analysis, the delay in receiving results is a major problem for growers needing to apply fertilizer immediately. As a result of these and other obstacles, many fields that would benefit from improved nitrogen management are not sampled at all, or not sampled with the density required for accurate variable rate prescriptions. The Veris Technologies Automated Soil Measurement System will collect and analyze nitrate and other soil properties to a depth of 24? rapidly, accurately, and economically. The System will perform the measurements automatically, with no action required by the operator. Based on typical zone sampling for nitrate, this system will have a daily capacity of several hundred acres, and will be able to perform these measurements for a competitive price versus conventional sampling and lab analyses. This will offer growers major improvements in fertilizer management, reducing sampling cost, shortening turnaround time for soil test information, increasing precision of site-specific fertilizer applications.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aims of the Phase II research are the development and testing in an animal model of minimally invasive microwave balloon catheter instrumentation for producing biological stents in pancreatic ducts and bile ducts and for producing biological occlusions in blood vessels of the liver. Twelve pigs will be used in the study. The intent will be to dilate the pancreatic ducts to approximately 2-3 mm beyond their native size, to dilate the common bile ducts to larger diameters with and without artificially generated strictures, and to occlude the mesenteric venous and arterial arcades of some of these animals. Gross and histological examinations, as well as liver function tests and imaging will be performed to determine optimum treatment parameters. The temperatures of the treated tissues will be monitored with miniature thermistors that are integrated into the balloons and also with a microwave radiometer. Several of the animals will be maintained in standard animal facility for periods of three and six weeks postoperatively and monitored and tested for any side effects that may have resulted from the procedure. The animal studies are designed to lay the groundwork for follow- on clinical trials of the use of microwave ballooning for dilating pancreatic and biliary strictures and for producing occlusions in blood vessels that supply blood to hepatic tumors. Microwave ballooning of hepatic strictures, if proven to be safe and effective in the proposed animal studies has the potential to lead to better, less complicated, and more durable treatments in the clinical management of such strictures. Similarly, if the animal studies prove that lasting occlusions can be safely produced in hepatic blood vessels; this would have the potential to lead to improved clinical management of hepatic tumors. Since FDA approval is, of course, required before any clinical trials and subsequent commercialization can even begin, part of the program will be devoted to starting the additional animal studies that will be asked for by the FDA, and also to develop prototype instrumentation that will conform to all FDA requirements for use in follow-on clinical trials. The hope is that the microwave balloon catheters and instrumentation developed during the proposed Phase II program will eventually find application not only for producing biological stents in pancreatic ducts and bile ducts and biological occlusions in blood vessels of the liver, but also for dilating strictures in general and for occluding blood vessels that supply blood to a variety of solid malignant tumors. Relevance The microwave balloon catheter instrumentation that would result from the proposed program would enable physicians to safely enlarge the diameters of pancreatic and bile ducts that are narrowed by disease, and to close blood vessels that feed liver cancers. The procedure is minimally invasive, and could be accomplished without having to introduce foreign materials into the body, materials that can sometimes cause serious side effects.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tactile feedback is essential for dexterous use of the hand. Physical therapists working to rehabilitate hands with neurological damage understand that tactile sensation is a key indicator of ultimate hand function. Neurophysiologists have identified that rapid reflexive adjustment of grip is essential for handling objects and depends on tactile feedback via the spinal cord. Autonomous robots can deal only with rigid objects in known orientations specifically because they lack tactile feedback. Engineers developing telerobotic manipulators have demonstrated improved performance when vibrotactile feedback is provided via  haptic displays  to the operator's hand. The limiting factor in all of these applications has been the absence of sensitive yet robust sensors that can be incorporated into anthropomorphic mechatronic fingers and used in the diverse and often hostile environments in which hands need to function. We have developed and demonstrated the basic feasibility of novel biomimetic tactile sensors that provide wide dynamic range sensing of normal and shear forces, microvibrations associated with slip and texture, and temperature and heat fluxes associated with the material properties of contacted objects All of these sensing elements and connections are located in and protected by the rigid core of a finger that is covered with skin, pulp and nail elements that are mechanically and cosmetically similar to biological fingers. In this project, the signal processing electronics and molded core and skin components that were developed in Phase I will be assembled into complete modules. These DigiTAC  modules will be integrated mechanically, electronically and functionally into a variety of prosthetic and robotic hands intended to provide function for patients with loss of normal hand function as a result of trauma and disease. Tactile feedback from these multimodal sensor arrays will be used to adjust grip forces automatically to prevent slip and to stimulate innervated skin to provide conscious perception of interactions with objects.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Between 1988 and 1996 alone over 700,000 people underwent upper limb amputation (Dillingham et al. 1998). The development of electromechanical replacement limbs has been hampered by the lack of robust sensors for touch and grip adjustment. We are developing prosthetic fingers that imitate the appearance, mechanical properties and sensory capabilities of human fingers, and integrating them with prosthetic and robotic hands.",

Recent studies suggest that CTCs could represent a potential alternative to biopsies as a source of tumor tissue for the detection, characterization and monitoring of non-hematologic cancers. However, current strategies for isolating CTCs are limited to complex analytic approaches based on epithelial cell surface markers. Since markers specific for cancer cells are lacking, the molecular identity of CTCs remains to be investigated. We postulate that the ability of cell adhesion matrix (CAM)-coated devices developed in Vitatex to isolate, characterize and propagate CTCs could lead to the identification of novel cancer stem or progenitor cell markers and expand the understanding of the mechanism of tumor progression and metastasis. To address this need, a panel of tumor progenitor cell markers upregulated in CTCs that were recently resolved by this team will be used to improve the CTC detection specificity and sensitivity in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, as well as to evaluate the potential role of CTCs in ovarian tumor peritoneal metastasis. Initially we will select novel tumor progenitor and invasiveness markers and optimize a cell-based flow cytometry blood test by validating its performance using fluorescence microscopic imaging to improve the sensitivity and specificity of CTC detection. We will then develop a nucleic acid-based blood test using a focused panel of tumor progenitor cell markers in multigene quantitative PCR analysis to phenotype patients with ovarian cancer who are treated at the Stony Brook University Medical Center and to monitor treatment response. To evaluate the relevance of CTCs in metastatic progression, cells sorted by both CAM adhesion and expression of a tumor progenitor gene will be examined for their ability to progress into peritoneal, liver and lung metastases by using an experimental ovarian metastasis animal model. The commercialization objectives are to manufacture an efficient rare cell separation system as a research tool for molecular analysis of epithelial cancers in peripheral blood, and to develop a novel blood test product that allows more sensitive diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of cancer, particularly relating to its metastatic potential.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary The broad long term goal of this research program is to reduce or eliminate deafness by developing sustained release intracochlear drug delivery systems. The goal of this project is to develop a steroid eluting cochlear implant. Currently, cochlear implantation leads to loss of residual hearing and the procedure is therefore reserved for the profoundly deaf. Inflammatory events at insertion are thought to contribute to this loss, and intracochlear steroids have demonstrated the potential to reduce inflammation and preserve residual hearing. The potential for implanting cochlear devices into people with residual hearing expands the world market to 278 million people suffering from moderate to profound hearing loss. In Phase 1 we formulated sustained release delivery systems for fluticasone, tested in vitro release, and confirmed sustained release and safety in an animal model. We furthermore formulated prototype cochlear implants releasing fluticasone, and have laid the basis for further commercialization with a corporate partner: Cochlear Corporation, the market leader in the field. In this Phase 2 work we propose to develop an inner ear delivery system for the steroid fluticasone to be used in cochlear implantation, and to test this formulation in an animal model of insertion trauma. The specific aims of this proposal are to 1, manufacture steroid eluting cochlear implants; 2, confirm the in vitro release characteristics of these implants; and 3, test the in vivo efficacy of these implants after insertion into the inner ear of the guinea pig in a trauma insertion model. We have an understanding with Cochlear Corporation: when we demonstrate efficacy in an animal model they will license our technology. They have committed the donation of implants and technical expertise in the manufacturing of their system to this project. The team of investigators is expert in polymer chemistry, pharmacokinetics, drug development intracochlear pharmacokinetics and clinical otolaryngology. We have experience in all aspects of the drug development process, from concept to approval and marketing.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative Cochlear implants are medical devices that electrically stimulate the auditory nerve fibers of the inner ear of patients who are profoundly deaf giving them a sensation of sound. Historically, cochlear implants were used for patients who had no hearing within the ear. Cochlear implants that elute steroids have the potential to reduce the loss of hearing from the traumatic insertion of the implant. This greatly expands the number of people who could benefit from obtaining a cochlear implant from those with profound hearing loss to those with moderate hearing loss.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) provides a new mechanism for assessing patient-reported outcomes. Using CAT can: (a) increase measurement precision, leading to a decrease in the number of participants necessary to achieve statistically significant results, (b) decrease test burden on respondents, compared to administration of fixed length surveys, thereby increasing the potential number of participants willing to participate in research, and (c) provide a common metric for assessing the effectiveness of varying treatment modalities. All of these capabilities will speed the transfer of clinical intervention effectiveness research into clinical care. The highly successful NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) roadmap initiative has developed a diverse set of well-validated IRT-based clinical symptoms and functioning item banks as well as a web site for administering the items as fixed-length and CAT surveys. However, the PROMIS Assessment Center is not  21-CFR-Part-11  compliant, and therefore cannot be used in FDA clinical trials. In addition, it does not currently permit the creation of Interactive Voice Response (IVR) surveys, nor does it allow clients to store data privately or run surveys on a corporate website. In fact, at present, no software package is available that can be deployed on a corporate server to administer web or IVR surveys using CAT algorithms. Unless commercial survey software with 21-CFR-Part-11 compliant CAT functionality is developed, the benefits of the PROMIS initiative may not be realized. The overarching goal of this proposal is to create a CAT software module ( SmartCATTM ), using FDA- standard 21-CFR-Part-11 Best Practices, that can be integrated into existing survey software products. We will develop SmartCATTM with assistance from Seung Choi, PhD, and Steve Reise, PhD, two outstanding IRT-CAT researchers. SmartCATTM will be tested via formal design review, manual and automated operational testing, validation of actual algorithmic operations against existing standards, and two full rounds of field testing with potential customers. SmartCATTM will also be integrated into two existing TeleSage software packages: (1) SmartQ-WebTM for web survey administration and (2) SmartQ-IVRTM for automated telephone survey administration, as well as software packages created by Interviewing Services of America and SurveyGizmo, two large survey research companies with whom we have partnered for this project. Once successful integration into all four of these programs has been demonstrated, we will develop and integrate advanced CAT features, e.g., content balancing and enemy item control. The resulting TeleSage SmartCATTM and SmartQ survey suite will provide tremendous flexibility for CAT survey administration, thereby promoting greater measurement precision while decreasing respondent burden. For these reasons and because the proposed software package will make widespread private sector use of the existing PROMIS item banks possible, we believe that this is likely to be a high impact project.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The commercial suite of CAT survey administration software products proposed for development in this application, namely SmartCATTM, SmartQ-Web-CATTM, and SmartQ-IVR-CATTM, will afford significant reductions in the time required for patients to complete symptom and functioning assessments, thereby reducing the test burden on patient respondents, without significant loss of measurement precision. Making CAT survey software products available to a wider audience, including commercial entities, will speed the translation of research into clinical care and facilitate the realization of the goals of the NIH PROMIS roadmap initiative.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Patch Clamp technique has evolved in recent years from an esoteric method of basic electrophysiological research into properties of cell membranes, into a practical technique for mass screening compounds for potentially therapeutic pharmaceutical properties. The commercial market for such equipment is now in the region of  40M annually. Its role as a tool of basic research has also continued to expand, as a means of discovering types and functions of ion channels through cell membranes, and characterizing their response. Phase I SBIR funding has enabled us to develop a digital clamp amplifier that functions in whole cell clamping and produces waveforms identical to those from comparable analog instruments. We have demonstrated some novel and potentially useful applications, not available with analog devices, such as providing instant  feedback  to a second neuron (dynamic clamp), thus driving one neuron off another's firing rate, and voltage clamping using only a single electrode without an external switch, multiplexing the stimulation and recording stages. This project will lead to a new patch clamp amplifier based on a high-speed digital signal processor to interact with excitable tissues. The instrument integrates the traditional voltage clamp, current clamp, dynamic clamp, and patch clamp into one unit, allowing for transient-free switching among the clamping modes and interactive controls of the neurons. The focus for Phase II includes hardware improvements for patch clamping, software techniques for controls, and experimental validations with mammalian neurons. Patch clamping developed from whole cell voltage clamping, in which measured current is fed back through one of two electrodes in the cell in an amount to keep the voltage across the cell membrane constant, as measured on the second electrode. Ions cross the cell membrane through proteins on the surface which escort them through. These ion channels are frequently voltage gated, open to passing only at certain voltage ranges, or may be chemically gated, thermally gated, or other. Even different voltage gated channels for the same ion may open at different voltages. For patch clamping, the electrode tip is very small, commonly sub-micron, in contact with a part of the cell membrane surface, and a small suction is applied to seal the membrane to the pipette tip. This allows measurement and feedback over only a small bit of membrane, and recording of even single ion channel events. There is a continuing and growing need to catalog all the ion channels across cell membranes, characterize their gate controls, and their function in cell metabolism, and effects on whole animal function and health. A common application is to screen compounds for binding to ion channel proteins to open or close them. Ion channels have become a major target for development of new pharmaceuticals. Variations include voltage clamping, current clamping and conductance clamping. In present application and technology, these 3 techniques each require different analog instruments for the fast responsive feedback needed, and the different parameter measured. Single channel events occur at change rates of up 250K/sec. The high speeds of ion channel events have required analog circuitry. In previous work and publications, it has been shown that a digital throughput of at least 500 KHz would be required to allow a digital instrument to perform as well as the analog instruments in voltage clamping. Very recently, digital signal processing chips (DSP's) operating at as fast as 600 MHz have become commercially available. Digital clamping would save the added cost of A/D and signal conditioning units, and one instrument would be able to perform any of the 4 types of clamping. Other emergent properties allow new avenues of research with digital clamping amplifiers. This proposal is to develop low-noise bi-directional headstages and accessories needed to use this digital clamp amplifier in patch clamping applications, including a chilled headstage to minimize noise, and to develop a library of algorithms for adjustable feedback schemes for different applications, and test the suitability of the instrument for patch clamp experiments. The resulting product is expected to achieve a substantial share of a large market.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patch clamp technique has emerged as a practical applied technique to test compounds for functional effects on ion channel proteins. Defective ion channels are implicated in several human diseases. The proposed instrument will replace 3 types of analog clamping instruments, and digitizers and signal conditioners with a single, versatile, more powerful digital clamping device capable of serving as a voltage, current or impedance clamp.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rabbit is a good animal model for the study of many human diseases because of its anatomical, genetic and biochemical similarities to the human. It is also used for drug screening, production of antibody and production of therapeutic proteins. The rabbit is large enough to provide adequate quantities of tissue for experimental work, produce sufficient amount of antibody or therapeutic proteins, and yet it is small enough to be economical for most laboratories.  To date, pronuclear microinjection remains the primary method to produce transgenic rabbits. There are no germline competent rabbit embryonic stem (rbES) cell lines available. Pronuclear microinjection, however, is of low efficiency, results in random integration, and cannot produce gene targeted transgenic animals.  The purpose of this SBIR project is to establish germline competent rbES cell lines for the production of gene targeted transgenic rabbits. In Phase I we established rabbit embryonic fibroblasts as feeder layers, synthesized recombinant rabbit leukemia inhibitory (LIF) factor, and derived putative rbES cells.  In Phase II, we will work to validate if these rbES cells can contribute to germ line cells after blastocyst injection and we will work to produce gene targeted transgenic rabbits from these cells. Specific Aims in Phase II project include: (1) derive new rbES cell lines with inhibitors of differentiation; (2) evaluate germline competency of rbES cells; and (3) produce gene targeted transgenic rabbits. The success of this project will establish the first germline competent ES cell lines in a non-murine species, improve the transgenic efficiency in rabbits, and make the production of gene targeted rabbits possible.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The rabbit is a good animal model for the study of many human diseases because of its anatomical, genetic and biochemical similarities to the human. It is also used for drug screening, production of antibody and production of therapeutic proteins. The main reason that rabbit has not been in these fields is that there have been no established germline competent rabbit embryonic stem (rbES) cell lines. The success of this project will establish the first germline competent ES cell lines in a non-murine species, improve the transgenic efficiency in rabbits, and make the production of gene targeted rabbits possible.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project addresses the looming optical detection bottleneck in sequencing by developing an ultra high-throughput 250nm-scale optical scanner. In addition to a 50X gain in throughput, the approach also supports a 4X feature-size reduction path that can help drive down reagent usage by a factor of 16X. Together, these throughput and density gains provide the needed instrument-side support in the push to break the 1,000 genome barrier. The approach is based on a novel imaging technique called Synthetic Aperture Optics (SAO) that allows a high-resolution image to be reconstructed from a series of low-resolution samples. In this manner, a SAO scanner trades off expensive, time-intensive stage movements with relatively fast imaging samples. Another advantage of SAO is that the number of samples can be dynamically adjusted as the demand for resolution increases or decreases. This fundamental property of SAO allows superior resolution over conventional light microscopy, as well as significantly higher scanning throughput. This project intends to develop a commercially viable prototype SAO scanner and verify its accuracy and throughput by sequencing an ePCR-amplified genomic reference library on 250nm-scale beads. The scanner can potentially be integrated with a range of chemistries and can be used both for de novo sequencing and for re-sequencing. The success of this project will enable the industry to fully exploit gains in sequencing chemistries to drive reagent, instrument, and operation costs down below the 1,000 genome target. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to develop an advanced optical detection technology that will significantly lower the cost of DNA sequencing. This cost reduction will drive innovation in basic research, drug development, and medical diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent events such as the spread of swine flu and potential future detrimental mutations of influenza viruses point to an urgent need for a point-of-care influenza typing system; particularly because over 90% of hospitals and smaller clinical labs in the U.S. cannot perform DNA-based diagnostic analysis. To enable a quick response to a potential influenza outbreak, it is desirable to have a fast, accurate diagnostic method capable of simultaneously typing and subtyping influenza viruses. Innovative solutions are needed in sample preparation, DNA/RNA extraction, microfluidics, DNA amplification methods as well as instrument miniaturization to make bacterial and/or viral point-of-care molecular diagnostics a reality. This project leverages a feasibility of on-chip, real time rolling circle amplification of DNA on an electronic microarray platform demonstrated in Phase I with our efforts in miniaturization of DNA detection and development of platforms for integration with the sample preparation. The following innovative solutions form the basis of the proposed technology:(i) novel real-time fluorescence detection of (branched) rolling circle amplification of DNA on the electronic microarray platform; (ii) a disposable cartridge that incorporates a unique fluidics enabling magnetic bead DNA/RNA extraction, reverse transcription, DNA amplification and microarray detection; (iii) low cost, screen printed carbon electrodes-based microarray for electric field-assisted acceleration of DNA hybridization. The Phase II project specific aims will demonstrate the feasibility of the technology that will consist of: (1) Optimization of real-time rolling circle amplification (RCA) conditions on the carbon-based electronic microarray; (2) Development and optimization of influenza virus genotyping assay based on hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (N) typing; (3) Development of sample preparation chemistry for influenza typing assay and incorporation onto a disposable cartridge using magnetic bead based separation of RNA/DNA, reverse transcription and RCA amplification; (4) MDx system development and adaptation to influenza assay; and, (5) Validation of the influenza assay using spiked and clinical (archived) samples.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The recent spread of the H1N1 swine-origin influenza virus and potential detrimental mutations of influenza viruses point to an urgent need to develop point-of-care systems that will be capable of typing influenza viruses. Molecular diagnostics methods providing accurate typing of a virus will ensure a quick and appropriate response and enable improved management of patients and limit transmission of viruses. Standard techniques for viral typing are mostly based on PCR or real-time RT-PCR methods that are complex and require several hours to perform the analysis. This project brings a new real-time method for detection of DNA based on an extremely rapid rolling circle amplification of DNA/RNA targets on the electronic microarray platform. In the proposed project, the instrument and the assay will be fully developed and provide a low-cost, portable solution to diagnose influenza and/or other infectious diseases.",

The measurement strategies so generated will meet the objective of reducing overall costs to near-minimal values, based on consideration of costs associated with both the direct use of the suggested measurement strategy and with its attendant risks of Type I and Type II accept/reject decision errors. The measurement programs will be created in a CMM-independent format (DMIS) to be applicable to any selected CMM software system. Design of the system will fully leverage existing, related software technologies. The resulting software, when fully developed and commercialized, will enhance the competitive position of manufactured products by reducing waste, both in manpower and raw materials, by improving the utilization of energy-intensive raw materials and will enhance the perceived quality of items so measured and certified.",

Scale-up of this new catalyst will have the greatest impact on commercialization because it will enable biodiesel to be made from inexpensive feedstocks like yellow grease, rendered fats, and other low quality fats and oils. Very recently, continuing its research beyond Phase I, Down to Earth Energy developed a novel base functionalized biochar from peanut hulls that is efficient for catalytic transesterification (100% conversion in 3 hours at 65&deg;C). The use of a base catalyst will greatly reduce amounts of waste pollutants that are generated compared to current methodology that uses sodium or potassium hydroxide and generates more pollutants than biodiesel product.\nFirst year activities will focus on: (1) optimizing production of the acid and base catalysts, (2) optimizing recovery and reuse of the acid and base catalysts, and (3) the design and development of pilot-scale, continuous-flow catalyst test beds. Scale-up research and commercialization activities will occur concurrently with the optimization of production and reuse of the two chars, and will involve reactor design specifications for batched slurry and continuous fixed-bed configurations; the effect of free fatty acid concentration, temperature, flow rate, and particle size on kinetics and reaction rates; and determination of optimal char volumes at practical industrial flow rates. Char production and engineering partnerships also will be formalized and production of the acid catalyst using a gaseous functionalization reagent will be evaluated in place of the current liquid phase production methods.",

This technology is digital in nature, i.e., individual molecules are quantified by their presence ( on  signal) or their absence ( off  signal). By focusing detection at the single molecule level, dramatic improvements in sensitivity are achieved for proteins. Phase I of this project demonstrated that single molecule detection makes it possible to detect concentrations of proteins at levels a thousand times lower than ELISA. Using single molecule detection, prostate specific antigen (PSA) was detected in serum at concentrations less than 1 femtomolar; current immunoanalyzers have an LOD of about 3 picomolar for PSA. The Phase II project has three specific aims that would build on these proof-of-principal experiments to broaden and strengthen the use of the technique for detection of cancer protein markers, and to move the technology closer to commercialization for use by medical researchers and clinicians. First, the ultra-sensitive PSA assay will be used to detect the marker in human clinical samples, specifically to measure the levels of PSA in prostate cancer patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy. Current technologies cannot detect PSA in these samples; this technology could enable the early detection of the return of PSA in serum, which would indicate residual disease. Second, the technology will be expanded to cover more classes of proteins, such as fusion proteins and post-translational modifications, to enable its broader implementation. Third, methods will be developed to measure panels of proteins at low concentrations using small sample volumes. These panels would enable the diagnosis of difficulty to detect diseases, such as ovarian cancer, with greater sensitivity and specificity. The long term objective of this research is to establish a new standard in high sensitivity detection of biological molecules (proteins, peptides, RNA, cells) using instrumentation that would be widely employed in both academic and clinical laboratories. Such an innovation would enable researchers to detect cancer markers at unprecedented levels for early diagnostic applications, and would facilitate the discovery of new low abundance cancer markers. This long term goal satisfies several aspects of the mission of the NIH, in particular, to develop innovative research strategies towards improving the diagnosis, prevention and cure of human diseases. The early diagnosis of cancer is determined by the ability of the clinical oncologist to detect the disease. Quanterix is proposing to develop a technology that would enable clinicians to detect very low concentrations of proteins in blood and, therefore, enable the early diagnosis of disease. This technology has the potential to help medical researchers and doctors to identify and detect many more early cancer diagnostic markers and improve outcomes for patients.",

A large part of the global warming impact comes from the unavoidable release of the refrigerant into the atmosphere. There are other approaches to refrigeration, such as Transcritical CO2, Peltier Cells, and Sterling Coolers, but they are often expensive, inefficient, and heavy.Machflow Energy, Inc. is developing new cooling and heat transfer technology based on the Bernoulli Principle. The technology can work in a closed cycle where the refrigerant (noble gasses with no ill effects on the environment) is always in the gas phase and also the manufacturing cost of the system is inexpensive due to small number of components. Our goal for Phase II projects is to build a functioning building air conditioner prototype that can then be modified for manufacturing.In Phase I of this project demonstrated key improvements of the performance of our system. We set up a rapid development system where we can quickly move from computer simulations, to building prototype parts, to experimental verification. Finally, we developed a Phase II development plan.

        "abstract": "Existing biodiesel production processes results in very low quality waste water which is high in fats, oils and greases and BOD (biological oxygen demand). This material is most often discharged to city sewer systems, causing problems in the pipes and at the waste water treatment plants themselves. Furthermore, crude biodiesel glycerin, a co-product of the process, has little or negative value, causing some producers to offload it at a loss or even worse into streams, lakes, or sewers. By developing an enzymatic biodiesel production method the washing step, and the wastewater, in the production process can be eliminated. The current biodiesel production methodology forms soaps or salts in both the biodiesel and glycerin phases, which would be eliminated using enzymes. During Phase I a method was developed which consistently produces ASTM quality biodiesel using virgin soy, yellow grease, and brown grease. In addition, as of the writing of this summary, a 15 day life cycle trial showed no significant loss in enzyme activity. Phase II will continue enzyme life trials and process optimization and build and test a 500 gallon per day full scale pilot unit. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: As this project progresses to and beyond Phase III, biodiesel plants utilizing this process will eliminate their wastewater sidestreams, reducing cost and stress on local waste water treatment plants. Greater demand on brown grease will spur more local trap grease collectors to begin removing this valuable energy stream from our waste and reduce costly illegal discharges of trap grease. The technical grade glycerin produced will increase profitability and availability of glycerin for use in bio-based products. Finally, as the US ramps up alternative fuel use through the RFS II mandate, biodiesel producers must return to full capacity and find new feedstocks to feed the demand. Enzymatic biodiesel serves these needs by expanding feedstocks, reducing waste, and increasing profitability.",

        "abstract": "Despite its clean and green nature when utilized in fuel cells and other devices, most hydrogen is currently produced primarily from non-renewable sources, such as natural gas, oil, and coal. Anaerobic digestion provides a potentially improved alternative to manufacturing hydrogen from petroleum and natural gas. Anaerobic digesters can produce hydrogen from inexpensive and renewable energy sources such as organic wastes (e.g. food processing waste and animal waste). Recent studies have shown that certain strains of bacteria (e.g. bacteria from the genus Clostridium) are effective at producing hydrogen as a by-product during anaerobic digestion With help from two USDA grants, one of them an SBIR grant in 2005, a new type of high rate anaerobic digester was develop and patented by Hansen Energy and Environmental (HEE) and called the Andigen Induced Blanket Reactor (IBR). Andigen was licensed to sells the patented IBR anaerobic digester. Then again in 2006 with the help from a USDA Rural Development Grant, HEE operated a 1996 Chevy truck on biogas (methane) produced by the IBR digester. A review of literature revealed that if a small percentage (10% to 20%) of hydrogen is added to methane (biogas) it crates a much better fuel and reduces emissions by as much as 50%. Therefore, research into the production of hydrogen was started that resulted in the SBIR phase I award. The technology of the Andigen IBR high rate digester has the ability to control the parameters needed to produce hydrogen on a continuous flow through basis using agricultural waste products, including animal manure and food waste Phase I replicated earlier lab trials for anaerobic production of hydrogen and was able to determine the best method to inhibit the growth of methane producing bacteria in order to create an environment where the hydrogen producing bacteria would thrive. The method used needed to have the potential to work in the Andigen IBR digester. The lab trials have resulted in a patented process that has produced 40% hydrogen. With phase II funding a continuous flow through process for the production of hydrogen will be developed using agricultural waste products that have little or no value. This Phase II project will also show that there is a net energy gain from the same amount of waste by producing both biohydrogen and biomethane. By using biogas as a fuel for his trucks and tractors a farmer can realize a much higher return on his digester investment than the generation of electricity. The production of hydrogen has many commercial applications in a \"hydrogen society\" but the commercial application waiting for the development of this technology is for use as a fuel mixture for the biomethane and biohydrogen produced by the Andigen IBR digesters. This Phase II grant will also include a collaborative effort with Ceramatec of Salt Lake City, Utah to produce a liquid fuel (synthetic Diesel) from hydrogen. An economic analysis will be made to examine the economic feasibility in producing a liquid fuel from the biohydrogen. Ceramatec has made great strides in cutting the cost of producing synthetic diesel from biogas.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revision of Phase II of our Fast Track SBIR consists of the addition of a new specific aim that addresses an important technical consideration that emerged after the submission and subsequent approval of this proposal. This aim involves adaption of our multi-core parallel computation code developed in Phase I of the SBIR to also run on graphics processor units (GPUs), which are now applicable to a variety of general-purpose scientific/engineering calculations. Use of GPUs has the potential to decrease hardware costs, maximize the realism of the simulation, accelerate market introduction, and broaden the product's potential market. The work requires that SimQuest dedicate an additional computational physics software engineer to the project and fund the work of a graduate student to apply these new technical advances to the open surgery simulator product.         The new specific aim will enable (1) completion of an initial evaluation of our existing computation codes and re-architecting them to take advantage of the specific strengths of GPU-based computation, (2) development of new code to work on the GPU, (3) assessment and refinement of that implementation to maximize benefits, and (4) integration of this code with the simulator.         Adding this specific aim will enable SimQuest to explore a newly available approach to meeting our product needs that has the potential to expand its market adoption through enabling a lower cost entry price as well as speed its introduction to surgical training through expanded simulation capability.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The wound closure training simulator that will result from this proposed effort will meet the training needs of numerous groups of US healthcare workers, from surgical residents to nurses to emergency medical technicians to military medics.

More than 20 million patients have chronic kidney disease (CKD) and these numbers are increasing annually. As a result, the number of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is expected to double between 1999 and 2010. These increases in CKD and ESRD are associated with significant morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Early detection and treatment of kidney disease has been shown to improve outcomes, but kidney disease is often under diagnosed resulting in lost opportunities to treat. The importance of early diagnosis and treatment of kidney disease has been extensively reviewed and published as a K/DOQI clinical practice guideline by the National Kidney Foundation. Monitoring changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) provides the best means for early detection of kidney disease. The test that is most widely used in the US to screen abnormalities in GFR is serum creatinine. However, estimated GFR values using serum creatinine have limited diagnostic value over methods that directly measured GFR using an ideal filtration marker, such as inulin. This Phase II application seeks support to further develop a novel readout system, based on immunoassay technology, to directly measure GFR. As demonstrated during Phase I, our test is accurate, simple-to-use, inexpensive and can be widely assessable. The test utilizes FDA-cleared compounds that are known to be GFR markers. As a result, our proposed GFR test will be able to more quickly enter the marketplace.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will further develop a diagnostic test to measure kidney function. The test will utilize well-known and widely available analytical technology and will utilize clinically available compounds. Therefore, this test will be able to quickly enter the market-place.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project is designed to develop and optimize a prototype environmentally friendly, chromium-free, corrosion-resistant, hybrid ultraviolet (UV) coating system with demonstrated properties suitable for industrial, automotive, and aerospace corrosion protection. The objectives of this Phase II project include the optimization of individual formulation components in the development of a fully formulated system suitable for a more complete evaluation according to the major appearance and physical property requirements of aerospace primer specification MIL-PRD-23377 and aerospace topcoat specification MIL-PRE-85285. A commercial objective of this work is the development of a product that meets design specifications for aerospace primer or combined primer/topcoat without requiring the use of a hazardous component such as hexavalent chromium. This proprietary hybrid UV coating system provides immediate cure when exposed to UV light along with a secondary cure mechanism. It has a suitable rate of cure in the absence of UV light to dry overspray to reduce the possibility of contamination from spray painting operations and to dry material in shadow areas where the coating may not be exposed to sufficient UV energy for typical UV cure. An important aspect of this technology is to significantly reduce exposure of workers and communities to hexavalent chromium, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and hazardous air pollutant (HAP) materials. Phase I research demonstrated feasibility and provided sufficient groundwork for Phase II development of the technology. Light Curable Coatings is a technology leader for solvent-free environmentally compliant coating systems, which include proprietary technology for rapidly cured heavily pigmented coatings with UV light, including low gloss camouflage color UV coating systems. The described chromium-free corrosion-resistant hybrid UV coating system is proprietary to Light Curable Coatings.\nAnticipated benefits of the proposed approach include dramatically improved environmental friendliness, economics, and productivity capabilities. Because this hybrid resin system contains safer components, application in confined and occupied spaces should be possible without the hazards presented by conventional materials. Environmental savings apply not only in production, but also throughout and beyond the operational lifecycle of industrial parts and vehicles by reducing environmental risks associated with maintenance, storage, and disposal.

        "abstract": "Wastewater treatment facilities serve a critically important environmental and public health function, but do so at a very high cost. Implementation of microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology in wastewater systems could change the fundamental energy budget of treatment nationwide.\nThe Phase I SBIR project, entitled &quot;Electricity Generation from Anaerobic Wastewater Treatment in Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs),&quot; successfully demonstrated that MFCs can treat municipal wastewater and generate electricity simultaneously. In this pilot-scale project, which had considerable outside funding, a multi-anode/cathode granular activated carbon-based MFC (MAC-GACMFC) was designed, constructed, operated, and modified to treat municipal wastewater at temperatures of 25 to 30&deg;C with a hydraulic retention time of 20 hours and external resistances of 100 ohm. Electrical power was produced, and effluent chemical oxygen demands (CODs) less than 50 mg/L were achieved in continuous-flow anaerobic MAC-GACMFC systems treating primary effluent.\nIn the proposed Phase II scope of work, two major tasks will be conducted to optimize MFC operation and improve power generation for future commercialization. In the first task, the MAC-GACMFC capabilities will continue to be tested at alternate operating conditions in order to develop a rational basis for design. Specifically, the first task will:\n\n    Determine treatment performance with primary effluent as the substrate;\n    Examine performance with higher strength dairy-based wastewaters;\n    Determine performance impacts at lower temperatures;\n    Investigate performance at alternate hydraulic retention time (HRT) levels; and\n    Examine the impact of alternate external resistance levels.\n\nIn the second task, the MFC system configurations and materials will be modified and developed with the objectives of improving power generation and treatment efficiency and developing a practical, cost-effective commercial product. The design improvements will be critical to commercializing the technology. Specifically, the second task will address:\n\n    Improvements to anode/cathode pairs to minimize internal resistance and improve access for maintenance and repair;\n    Optimizing anode to cathode ratios and anode density in the GAC bed; and\n    Testing alternate (lower cost) catalyst coatings on the cathode material to replace the costly platinum coating. Lab-scale tests have shown encouraging results with alternative catalysts.\n\nThe anticipated results of Phase II will be used to develop a greatly improved and engineered MFC system for future commercialization. In the opinion of the Project Team, this unique MFC technology has great potential to be developed as a modularized system, enhancing its feasibility as a cost-effective, practical retrofit for municipal wastewater treatment systems.",

        "abstract": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in its publication Technology News and Trends in 2009 featured the Navy's work that saved 6 years and $3 million delineating chlorinated solvent plumes in soil and groundwater. The Navy used EPA's TRIAD process, which incorporates systematic planning, field analytics, and dynamic work strategies, during its hazardous waste site investigation. A direct sampling ion trap mass spectrometer was used to transport pollutants from depth to the surface for analysis. Although excellent data were obtained, the technology cannot collect and analyze semivolatile organics (SVOCs).\nOnly Ion Signature Technology, Inc. (IST) has developed technology to collect VOCs and SVOCs at depth and transport the sample to the surface for analysis without organics adsorbing or condensing in the transfer line. In Phase I, IST found new material to develop a high temperature membrane inlet probe (MIP). When the MIP is at 300&deg;C, organics efficiently desorb and extract from soil and at 100&deg;C, collect from groundwater without bringing soil or groundwater to the surface for analysis. In addition, two new freeze traps and a new transfer line gas flow system were designed and tested, which met their respective specifications as established in the objectives.\nThe goal of this Phase II SBIR is to integrate all of the disparate technologies into a turnkey system so that end users can &quot;sniff&quot; EPA method 8260 VOCs and 8270 SVOCs as the MIP is advanced into the subsurface at the rate of 2 cm/sec. The thermal extraction and detection system (TEDS) will incorporate electron capture and photoionization sensors to provide real-time, in situ chemical detection of pollutants. Once sensor responses exceed baseline signals, the MIP will stop automatically, with gas flow switching from the sensors to the freeze trap so that pollutants can be concentrated and quantified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). All analyses will be made online, at discrete depths, and recorded electronically for upload into site conceptual models. When combined with geological and hydrogeological data, conceptual models emerge that depict the location and rate of movement of subsurface pollutants. TEDS fits squarely within EPA's mission and importantly, EPA's TRIAD process. The objective is to provide defensible data to better manage site investigations and cleanups. EPA has shown that when projects employ the TRIAD process, which encompasses systemic planning, dynamic work strategies, and real-time chemical measurements, remediation costs are reduced.",

        "abstract": "This project develops an electronic-controlled version of the advanced hydraulic foot/ankle (MCI Foot) demonstrating the feasibility of the automatic adjustment of resistance throughout the range of motion. The advanced MCI Foot, especially the automatic-controlled version, contributes to the function of the prosthesis wearer, resulting in advanced and more natural walking benefits. The project objectives include: (1) Implementation of electric servo-valves into the existing foot-ankle design. Manual valves have been developed at present, and in preliminary testing, shown to be successful at setting the foot wearer&rsquo;s preference for dorsi-flexion and plantar flexion; (2) Development of sensor for ankle position, inclination, temperature, and load for integration into the ankle electronic Controller. The sensors utilize a rugged design, for long-term reliable usage in the foot, and small size to fit within the anatomical shape of the foot; (3) Implementation of an algorithm for ankle control by microprocessor. The automatic control of ankle resistance depends upon the variable of position, inclination, and load, indicating the point in the gait cycle in which the walker&rsquo;s step is taken. The temperature is automatically compensated for as the hydraulic fluid warms and changes viscosity. Success in the function of the auto-controller is evaluated in-house, in the Foot Testing Center.\n",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a real-time high-data-rate multicarrier underwater acoustic modem for aquatic applications. The modem to be developed will achieve a data rate that is more than one order of magnitude higher than all competing commercial products in challenging shallow water environments. It will have robust error performance in the presence of impulse-like noise and undesired disruptions. In addition, the modem will be power efficient to sustain long operation time, have a user-friendly interface, and maintain an easily-extendable architecture to facilitate advanced networking functionalities. Bringing the advanced multicarrier technology into the underwater modem market, this project solves one long-standing problem in the field, i.e., making multicarrier modulation work in underwater channels (earlier attempts all had only limited success). With one order of magnitude data rate increase, this project will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in underwater telemetry. \nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the high-data-rate multicarrier underwater acoustic modem will significantly improve the operation of a wide range of aquatic applications, such as underwater environmental observation for scientific exploration, commercial exploitation, and coastline-protection/target-detection in military or anti-terrorism. It will also directly facilitate the development of emerging and fast-developing underwater wireless sensor networks and autonomous underwater vehicle networks. The significantly enhanced monitoring capability of aquatic environments will help us better understand and exploit the earth, preserve and protect it for our future generations. As more than 85% of underwater applications are envisioned to be in shallow water, this project will have enormous commercial impact in multiple market sectors including environment, energy, fishing, tourism, and national defense, etc.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to create a new, innovative system to manage a highly-scalable, geographically-distributed labor force through wireless technology - what is refered to as \" mobile crowdsourcing.\"  The plunging cost of handsets and the introduction of prepaid call plans have allowed individuals throughout the world to have the ability to communicate and transact electronically. This project will create the infrastructure needed to provide wireless subscribers the ability to do work and earn money - leveraging today's mobile phone's ability to send, receive and display images, audio files and text. The system will: deconstruct a client's work into \"micro-tasks;\" preferentially route micro-tasks to individuals most likely able to complete them; statistically analyze completed work across individual responses to automatically reach a decision on when work is complete, and who has provided the most useful input; compensate workers in proportion to the value they have added; and, finally, reconstruct the completed task for the client, with a statistical assurance the work has been accomplished correctly.\nThe first application of this system will be for the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry. The company will integrate with several mobile carriers in Africa and South America to allow subscribers direct access to transactional BPO tasks including transcription, translation and text categorization. Communicating with workers directly through phones  and emphasizing quality control on work, rather than worker will enable users to perform tasks when they want, where they want, and as they want. Automated compensation through existing mobile payment and airtime transfer systems will allow for much lower overhead costs. In addition to cost savings, however, clients who use this system to complete work will also have the benefits of: increased security (no one worker will be able to see an entire document or hear an entire audio recording), access to a scalable workforce (when \"spikes\" of work come through, labor can be seamlessly scaled up), and potential for very fast turnaround on work (micro-tasks can be done in parallel by many individuals, greatly reducing total time to complete a workload). Additional applications of the mobile crowdsourcing platform include data gathering related to local content and surveys, productivity tools for auditors, and mass reporting abilities following disaster-related events.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will catapult open ocean mariculture far offshore, away from the restrictions caused by competing user groups, site lease requirements and mooring restrictions, by developing the technology for Velella ? an untethered, open ocean regional drifter cage. Since 2005, Kona Blue?s open ocean mariculture operation has produced up to 500T per annum of Kona Kampachi, with negligible environmental impacts, from a 90 acre site. Growth and investment are constrained by site limitations. Mariculture expansion in U.S. waters is similarly limited by regulatory constraints for moored structures, and the technological challenges of operating further offshore. The Velella Project is developing essential technologies for drifter net-pens that can be entrained in regional ocean eddies. This will allow increased scale and reduced labor requirements, and greater farm profitability. Phase II will also expand eddy predictive capabilities, and launch a Velella beta-system maiden voyage. \nThe broader impacts of this research are to be accrued through benefits to the environment, coastal economies and public health. The oceans are in deep trouble; over 90% of the ocean?s larger predator fish are gone, and over a quarter of fish stocks have ?collapsed?. Heavily exploited or overfished wild stocks cannot meet the growing global demand for healthful seafood. Still, increased seafood consumption is imperative for American consumers? health. Inshore and onshore aquaculture offer only limited expansion opportunities, or lower-value products. Open ocean mariculture can meet this burgeoning demand, improve product quality and reduce pressure on wild stocks. Overcoming the industry constraints requires highly-automated husbandry systems, and demonstration of a scalable production model for deep water that meets current regulations. This research could significantly expand sustainable, eco-friendly mariculture in U.S. waters, without environmental impacts or user-group conflicts associated with other site-constrained aquaculture. Increased automation can increase production volumes and improve profitability, fish health and worker safety offshore. Increased domestic mariculture could reduce America?s $9 billion seafood trade deficit.",

        "abstract": "The availability of fresh potable water is restricted in many environments. This could be corrected by the distillation of sea water; however the cost is very high due in large part to the requirement for titanium heat exchangers to provide the required corrosion resistance. A new low cost process combined with very low cost raw materials is being developed to provide a substantial reduction in the cost of the titanium heat exchangers. The low cost process was successfully demonstrated with the fabrication of the very thin titanium sheets which are used for heat exchanger manufacture. The low cost fabrication of the low cost titanium sheets will be scaled up to larger sizes. The large sheets and tubes used for the heat exchangers will be fabricated and tested.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Titanium alloys have a unique combination of excellent strength and mechanical properties that make them desirable for a wide range of applications including automotive. However, their use has been restricted by their high cost. The low cost titanium process developed in this program will result in a major expansion of titanium alloys into these applications.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to establish that a units-based approach to retrieving quantitative data from scientific and technical documents is a powerful alternative to keyword and document based search models. Keyword approaches to data extraction and contextualization are limited due to poor semantic contextualization and because quantities are often written in a wide variety of numeric and unit formats. The proposed approach to reliable numeric data extraction begins with quantity-intelligent indexing that recognizes many numeric formats and converts quantities to standardized base-unit tokens, to significantly enhance search recall over keyword approaches. The resulting number-unit pairs will anchor the index to enable efficient scientific exploratory search with high semantic precision, but without overly relying on sophisticated imposed semantic ontologies. Research will focus on a proprietary search-time data scoring algorithm that utilizes context-sensitive numeric spectra, to score otherwise ambiguous results based on probabilistic methods. This approach is expected to improve both precision and recall of contextual numeric data extraction. In turn, the resulting search engine will enable instant visualization and analysis of collective technology landscapes and trends, which will guide researchers in any area of technology represented by the indexed documents.\nThe broader impact of this project will be to enable reliable and efficient extraction of numeric data from diverse sources such as scientific literature and patent databases. These unstructured document sets contain a wealth of latent quantitative data which, if properly extracted and aggregated, can enable powerful modes of data exploration. The unit-based index and data-scoring algorithm are customized for an exploratory search model that will allow non-expert users to rapidly aggregate thousands of relevant data points, with simple keyword inputs and without laboriously opening and parsing individual documents. Researchers and students may thus explore data sets that were previously inaccessible, or known only to experts in a field. This will also contribute to knowledge discovery within large unstructured databases, since patterns and correlations between seemingly disparate variables can be immediately visualized. The platform will provide the capability to efficiently generate technology landscapes, anticipate emerging trends, and recognize competitive technical outliers. If successful, this will be valuable for high-tech industrial innovation including for engineers involved in R&D as well as business development executives and intellectual asset managers who focus on asset allocation, new technology ventures, prior art and patent infringement within a technical parameter space.",

        "abstract": "Early childhood dental caries represents the most common, and possibly the most commonly overlooked, chronic childhood disease in the United States. National health leaders recognize that families with young children living in rural communities face significantly more barriers to sustaining positive oral health than the general population. Low-income families in rural communities experience even greater challenges in regularly accessing oral health care for young children whose health problems, as research has shown, will generally escalate as they age. Therefore, a key health strategy in early childhood in rural communities must include prevention. The proposed Phase II research will develop a prototype of video-based learning tools representing an innovative approach to health prevention through family education in rural communities, combining groundbreaking science in early childhood development with advanced video technology designed specifically for rural families with young children. Webfish Pacific will: 1) create a full prototype of ?enhanced family-centered video education tools? related to oral health in early childhood; 2) conduct in-depth research in the use of these videos within Early Head Start programs in Hawaii; 3) conduct broad research in the use of these videos within Early Head Start programs in Hawaii and two other states; and, 4) analyze evaluation results. We are committed to contributing to building economic capacity among communities nationally and achieving healthier outcomes, especially for low-income families with young children living in rural communities across the country.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A safe and reliable procedure to perform transcervical sterilization could replace laparoscopic tubal ligation - the most popular permanent birth control method. Over 700,000 American women are expected to receive the tubal surgery this year. The transcervical approach offers a significant improvement because it shortens recovery for the patient and increases practice efficiency for the physician by making an office-based sterilization procedure feasible. Novomedics' transcervical procedure takes advantage of the body's natural healing effects to scare off the fallopian tube. Our approach uses a proprietary thermal catheter to treat a sufficient amount of the tubal lumen. Pilot in vivo and survival data with an early prototype have demonstrated effective and reliable tubal occlusion in two weeks without leaving any foreign materials in the fallopian tube. In addition, pilot human safety data has also been obtained. In the proposed Phase II program, we will incorporate novel safety features demonstrated in Phase I and strengthen the design and quality of the NovoSeal system to be ready for large scale clinical evaluation in Phase III. The end result of this effort will be a new technology for safe and effective transcervical female sterilization: Specific Aim 1. Evaluation of NovoSeal catheter system and treatment method in freshly extirpated human and animal reproductive tissue in preparation for quantitative in vivo preclinical and clinical studies. Specific Aim 2. In vivo characterization of the NovoSeal catheter and treatment method in an established animal model. Specific Aim 3. In vivo characterization of the NovoSeal catheter and treatment method in human reproductive tissue during peri-hysterectomy surgery. Specific Aim 4. A pilot study for in vivo characterization of the NovoSeal catheter and treatment method in human pre-hysterectomy patients.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative The clinical practice of transcervical sterilization is growing and Novomedics' proposed technology has numerous advantages over current product offerings. Our technology solves problems with previous thermal approaches and will offer physicians a simple, cost effective, and efficient method for achieving permanent sterilization without the requirement of a surgical procedure or the use of implants. The commercial potential for such a technology is without doubt very large, especially in light of the increased patient benefits of avoiding invasive surgery as well as the time and convenience to physicians who use the technology for an office-based sterilization procedure.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the Latino population totals over 46 million people, with projections  indicating Latino individuals will account for nearly 1 in 3 U.S. residents by the year 2050 (USCB, 2008).  Currently, nearly 40 percent of the Latino population is under the age of 20 (Ramirez and de la Cruz, 2003).  Concomitant with this population growth is a pressing need to address significant social-emotional, behavioral, and academic disparities between Latino children and non-Latino white children (Farkas, 2003; USDHHS, 2001; Wright and Troop, 2005). Perceptions of a closed school community have been found to create or exacerbate problems with academic performance, educational aspirations, and behavioral-emotional functioning for Latino youth (Romero and Roberts, 2003; Szalacha et al., 2003; Vega et al., 1995). Intervention and prevention research suggests social acceptance of Latino students and integration into the school community are key environmental factors that promote positive functioning (Ibaqez et al., 2004; Suarez-Orozco and Suarez-Orozco, 1995; Valencia, 2002). The goal of this Phase II SBIR project is to continue the research and development of a school-based cultural heritage curriculum for upper elementary school students, Cultural Heritage Stories for Kids: Latino Series (hereafter CHSK:LS), to create the full product, including a story library of traditional and acculturation stories from different Latino cultures (e.g., Mexican American, Puerto Rican,  Cuban), presented by professional Latino storytellers in both English and Spanish. CHSK:LS will provide school professionals with an innovative effective universal classroom intervention specifically designed to celebrate Latino cultural heritage, promote understanding of cultural diversity in the classroom, and engender a more integrated, accepting classroom environment. During Phase I, the CHSK:LS prototype materials were evaluated very positively by school professionals as well as parents and children. However, specific suggestions for Phase II development were noted. The first aim of Phase II will be to revise and extend based on the feedback attained during Phase I, Phase II stakeholder input, and expert advice of Advisory Board members. Once the CHSK:LS product is completed, the second aim of Phase II will be to conduct a rigorous test of the product efficacy via a randomized treatment-control experimental design assessing change as a function of participation in CHSK-LS for two sets of outcomes: (a) individual student-level social, behavioral, emotional, and academic functioning at school and (b) overall classroom climate. The third aim will be to the finalize all product materials based on Phase II findings and evaluations from product testing, package all components for commercialization, and ready the product for  broad-scale dissemination through our commercialization partner. The proposed Phase II SBIR project will result in a highly innovative intervention package with substantial competitive advantages, providing schools with a much needed evidence-based intervention package to promote multicultural awareness and integration, and address behavioral health disparities for Latino students.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the Latino population totals over 46 million people, with projections  indicating Latino individuals will account for nearly 1 in 3 U.S. residents by the year 2050 (USCB, 2008).  Currently, nearly 40 percent of the Latino population is under the age of 20 (Ramirez and de la Cruz, 2003). From 1993 to 2003, the number of minority school enrollments increased from 34 to 41 percent, with Latino students accounting for the majority of that increase (6 percentage points; NCES, KewalRamani et al., 2007). Compared  to non-Latino white children, Latino children are at profoundly greater risk for a wide variety of academic  problems (Farkas, 2003; USDHHS, 2001; Wright and Troop, 2005), including lower school engagement, grades,  and test scores (NCES, KewalRamani et al., 2007; NCES Status and Trends in Edu of Hisp, 2003). In addition, perceived discrimination and insecurity about ethnic identity has been linked to externalizing behavior problems, increased depressive symptoms, and diminished self-esteem (Umaqa-Taylor and Updegraff, 2007, Vega et al., 1995). Culturally specific factors, such as a cultural mismatch between the home and school community, low school integration, and negative stereotyping, have been shown to contribute to decreased school performance (Kroth, 2009; USDEd, 2000; Viadero, 2000). Further, an increasingly frustrating school environment for Latino students can foster high levels of absenteeism and school dropout rates. Nearly 50 percent of Latino students do not graduate from high school (Orfield et al., 2004). Dropping out of school, in turn, has serious consequences for Latino youth, placing them at risk for unemployment, reduced income, diminished health outcomes, use of public assistance, and increased likelihood for delinquent, criminal, and risk-taking behaviors (see Sweeten et al., 2009). Furthermore, the financial costs to society of school dropout are great.  Approximately 600,000 youth drop out of high school each year in the Unites States (Muennig, 2000). It has been estimated that if those students had completed their high school diplomas instead, states could save more than  2.3 billion in public insurance utilization and student gains in lifetime earnings could be as much as  72 billion dollars (Muennig, 2000).",

These abilities find little purchase in both keyboard/mouse User Interfaces (UIs) and newer UIs with single displays. \nThe proposed platform provides a UI that can address a broad range of human-computer tasks, from media creation to data analysis to social communication.  Historically, the entertainment domain has provided a profitable staging area in which to introduce novel UI systems - this market is large, has price flexibility, and its consumers have a demonstrated desire for novel interactions. This domain will provide a path to profitability, familiarize consumers with multi-object interfaces and allow the Siftables technology time to mature before other market opportunities are pursued.  If successful, this system will allow the company to advance the state of the art of distributed operating systems and sensor networks.",

        "abstract": "The United States particularly through DOE and USDA has very strong and often integrated programs targeting the development of new energy sources (e.g. biofuels, wind energy, geothermal, etc) and improvements to sustainable energy sources especially solar power. Billions of dollars have been invested in diverse programs. In contrast, similar integrated efforts at similar scales directed towards new approaches to energy conservation (aside from lighting) have not received the same emphasis despite the fact that this should be of equal National importance. The byproducts of biofuels and direct burning processes (of agricultural wastes for example) will always contain a major inorganic fraction likely to be primarily silica because plants selectively extract and concentrate silica from the environment excluding heavy metals. Thus, the resulting silica is relatively pure compared with natural silica sources (e.g. sand), amorphous and high surface area allowing it to be chemically extracted at low temperatures with minimal costs. Mayaterials' researchers have developed a low temperature, green and inexpensive process to extract this silica from agricultural wastes, rice hull ash in particular. Using the various products of this process, Mayaterials is proposing to develop a new type of inexpensive vacuum insulation panels (VIPs). The use of VIPs in refrigeration and housing is currently limited in the USA due to their very high cost. By using agricultural waste as the raw ingredient and getting rid of the complex and expensive processes currently used to make good quality VIPs, Mayaterials plans to decrease the cost of VIPs several fold. This would allow for a more widespread use of VIP insulation which has the potential for tremendous energy savings if widely adopted. Just in the home refrigerator market, use of VIPs has the potential to save up to 76 Twh each year (50% higher than the USA total wind power electricity generated in 2008).",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project's overall goal is to commercialize a robust, continuous culture production system for rotifers (Brachionus rotundiformis; s-type), the major live feed source for marine larval fish. A major bottleneck in the expansion of the marine aquaculture industry in the United States remains the lack of commercial live feed production technologies to support the grow-out industry. Specifically for rotifer culture, there exist limited standardized design and operational criteria for continuous culture methods that could facilitate increased productivity and consistency of supply. The inability to supply microalgal/zooplankton feeds cost-effectively (quantity) and consistently (quantity and quality) continues to be a major limitation to the expansion of the marine aquaculture industry.\nThe broader impacts of this technology are simplification of fingerling production which will lead to rapid expansion of marine hatcheries and hence a dramatic increase in the availability of lower cost marine fry and fingerlings for aquaculture grow-out in ponds, ocean cages and/or indoor recirculating systems. This research has the potential to help jump-start the marine aquaculture industry by eliminating one of the key limiting factors to increasing the production of many marine species, i.e. the unavailability and the high cost of fry and fingerlings. Aquaculture production of the more popular marine finfish will relieve the pressure on commercial fish stocks that are currently severely threatened or overfished and allow culture under highly controlled, biosecure conditions using commercial formulated diets.",

        "abstract": "We have discovered the easternmost commercial population of hard clams, Mercenaria mercenaria (L.), in the U.S., in the waters of Eastern Maine. In 2007, we received permission from the State of Maine to lease a 6-acre tract in the shallow subtidal of Goose Cove (Trenton) to farm cultured hard clams. This is the first-ever lease of this type in eastern Maine. Working with our research partners from the Downeast Institute for Applied Marine Research & Education in the town of Beals, we received Phase I USDA SBIR funding to examine seasonal growth and survival of cultured seed (6-12 mm shell length, SL) at multiple sites in eastern Maine from Trenton east to Cobscook Bay. That effort demonstrated unambiguously that the waters of far eastern Maine (Washington County) are too cold, and predators such as moon snails and green crabs too numerous to undertake farming operations in that region. Survival and growth of cultured seed in Goose Cove, however, was excellent in small plots where seed was planted in mid-Spring and protected with flexible netting. We observed > 85% survival through December, with animals attaining SL > 20 mm. We propose to extend our experimental approach to larger, pre-commercial scales to test hypotheses concerning both spatial and temporal variation in cultured hard clam growth and survival during the nursery, overwintering, and grow-out phases at Goose Cove and sites west of there in Hancock County. Specifically, we wish to determine what configuration of a field-based nursery system, and which nursery locations, will allow us to produce the largest transplantable hard clam seed; what the most efficient method is to store pre-planting size seed over the winter to optimize survival and growth; what field grow-out methods will produce market size animals in the most effective and efficient manner; and, to what degree interannual variability plays in hard clam growth and survival, both in the field nursery and grow-out phases. Answers to these questions will affect plans to commercialize our rearing methods and procedures.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Organophosphorus (OPs) compound are potent neurotoxic chemicals that are widely used in medicine, industry and agriculture; most notably as insecticides. The neurotoxicity which is primarily a result of AChE inhibition,\n may take the form of cholinergic crisis and death as a consequence of acute exposure or psychiatric symptoms and delayed neuropathy following chronic exposure. Usually, treatment of insecticide poisoning consists of supportive care and specific therapy e.\ng. atropine and oximes, which often fail to prevent morbidity or death. Currently, recombinant (r) BChE is a leading pre-exposure treatment candidate for OP toxicity due to its potent bioscavenging ability but because of its 1:1 stoichiometry with OP, larg\ne doses will be required if delivered by i.m. or subcutaneously routes. In order to reduce the dose required for systemic approaches for delivering BChE, we plan to create a protective  BChE bioshield  of aerosolized tetrameric rBChE into the lungs to deto\nxify incoming (inhaled) OPs in situ, thus preventing the OP's entry into the systemic circulation and avoiding the respiratoty usually associated with inhalation exposure. Phase I represents a feasibility study in mice to examine (i) the patterns of deposi\ntion of either liquid or powdered PEG-rMaBChE radioaerasols delivered to the lungs by Microsprayer or insufflator respectively (ii) the persistence of the  bioshield  and (iii) the degree of protection it affords against 50% LD50 of the liquid aerosolized \nOP insecticide paraoxon as measured by percent inhibition of RBC AChE and serum BChE. In Phase II, the efficacy of the aerosolized PEG-rMaBChE to protect against OP toxicity will be tested in a homologous macaque model. A homologous system, which does not \nmake anti-BChE antibodies, is critical for accurate efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety testing of a recombinant therapeutic protein which may be required as a multiple administrations. During this time, Master and Working Cell Banks of CHO-K1 producing \nrHuBChE will be generated and process development begun on the production, purification and PEG-ylation protocols. The efficacy of an aerasolized PEG-rHuBChE  bioshield  to prevent paraoxon toxicity will be tested in macaques and compared with the homologo\nus rMaBChE enzyme. It is anticipated that aerosol delivery will reduce the dose required for protection because of its concentration in the same areas as the inhaled insecticide. The development of an innovative  Microsprayer  type device would permit a us\ner friendly treatment to be delivered before the known use/release of insecticides.        Public Health Relevance: Many glycoproteins which are potent antidotes, exhibit very important physiological functions but cannot be used as therapeutic treatments b\necause they are quickly removed from the circulation or their ability to protect requires large doses if given i.m. The aim of this project is to butyrylcholinesterase as an aerosol in a pulmonary delivery device to that it deposits in the lung and forms a\n  bioshield  and detoxifies inhaled indecticides poisons in the lung and prevernts them from reaching the blood and the neuromuscular junctions where they can quickly cause severe toxicity.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work is aimed at developing two new tactile aids for the deaf. Tactile aids transduce acoustic signals for display as vibratory patterns on the skin and can be appropriate assistive devices for some deaf persons who receive no benefit from cochlear implants or hearing aids. Tactile aids provide oral communicators with a speech signal that supplements lipreading, and all users with useful signals associated with environmental sounds and music. Currently, no tactile aids are commercially available for those deaf persons who can benefit from them.  One of the new tactile aids to be developed in this project is specifically designed for use by infants. This device, which has the form of an arm-worn strap, is designed to be waterproof, small, and lightweight. For young deaf children awaiting a cochlear implant, this tactile aid may be an alternative to hearing aids that is more comfortable and convenient, as well as acoustically richer. The second tactile aid being developed is a wristwatch-type device for older children and adults. Both the infant and adult aids will have wireless microphones and signal processing that extracts low- and high-frequency envelopes for display on two vibrators.  Work in Phase I produced a prototype tactile aid that can be comfortably worn on the arm by an infant or toddler. This prototype meets specified criteria for weight, water resistance, battery life, physical ruggedness, and stimulation level. Work in the first 15 months of Phase II will be devoted to refining the design of the infant aid and completing the design of the adult aid. Copies of these refined prototypes will be produced for six-month field trials with infant and adult users. Three clinical sites have agreed to cooperate in identifying candidates and in conducting the infant trial. The aims of the trials will be to identify usability issues and to assess efficacy of the aids for both groups of users. For infant/child subjects, efficacy will be assessed with questionnaires addressed to the parents and audiologist covering such issues as responsiveness to sound and change in frequency and quality of vocalization. Adult users will be given tests to assess lipreading ability (when appropriate) and environmental sound recognition; they will also be questioned on their reactions to the device.  It is the goal of the present work to update and expand the role of tactile aids in aural rehabilitation with improved, easier-to-use devices designed specifically for infants and adults.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project to develop new tactile aids will fill a void in the array of devices that can be provided to assist speech communication, environmental-sound recognition, and music appreciation for some deaf persons. Although the size of the population of deaf persons who can benefit from tactile aids is small, it is a population for whom innovative technological assistance is greatly needed to support habilitation and independent living.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the approval of the proteasome inhibitor Velcade for multiple myeloma therapy, the ubiquitin pathway has been validated for drug discovery. An alternative ubiquitin-associated degradation pathway is lysosomal; for example, the ubiquitin E3 ligase Cbl promotes degradation of membrane bound epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) by ubiquitylating the receptor, marking it for lysosomal degradation rather than recycling to the membrane. Removal of ubiquitin by an isopeptidase would spare EGFR and favor recycling and enhanced mitogenesis. This proposal is focused on AMSH, a ubiquitin isopeptidase that prevents endosomal sorting and lysosomal degradation of EGFR. Chronic pulmonary diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) are characterized by airway and vascular remodeling and remain extraordinarily common illnesses. EGF and EGFR are associated with the pathobiology of chronic pulmonary diseases. The aim of this project is to develop agents active against these diseases by promoting the natural degradation of EGFR. In phase I, a high throughput screen was configured for inhibitors of AMSH activity utilizing an N-terminal ubiquitin-fused substrate reporter. A similar counterscreen was validated for the isopeptidase UBPY. In addition, a cell based assay detecting EGFR degradation was validated, completing the aims of Phase I. In phase II, first, several chemical libraries will be screened using the AMSH high throughput assay, and selected hits characterized in secondary assays for selectivity. Next, efficacy studies will be performed; the ability of the best hits to promote EGFR degradation and inhibition of EGFR activity will be evaluated using human airway smooth muscle (ASM), pulmonary arterial vascular smooth muscle (PVSM) cells and human lung fibroblasts. It will be determined whether lead compounds regulate EGFR levels in these cells and whether the effects modulate EGF-induced cell proliferation in a concentration and time-dependent manner. Concentration dependence of effects on EGF-induced activation of EGFR levels will be established by Western blot analysis. Effects of lead compounds on EGF-induced ASM, PVSM and HLFs proliferation will indicate physiological relevance. This study will provide critical information about potential efficacy of the selected leads. Finally, medicinal chemistry will be employed for the establishment of structure-activity relationships (SAR) and chemical optimization, leading to the selection of candidates for progression to preclinical development for treatment of lung disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic pulmonary diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) are characterized by airway and vascular remodeling and remain extraordinarily common illnesses. A prominent cellular growth factor (EGF) and its receptor (EGFR) play a role in chronic pulmonary diseases. The aim of this Phase II project is to develop agents that cause the natural degradation of EGFR in cells as a means of combating pulmonary disease. This will be accomplished indirectly by using inhibitors of a cellular enzyme, AMSH, which normally keeps cellular levels of EGFR high, thereby promoting airway inflammation and pulmonary disease. Several collections of small chemical molecules will be screened to identify inhibitors of AMSH. Screening will be accomplished using an assay developed in Phase I of this project. The most promising of these inhibitors will be tested in cellular models to see whether they act in cells to reduce EGFR levels and activity as predicted. Additional chemical modification will be performed on the best of these inhibitors to generate candidate molecules for development as drugs to treat pulmonary disease and airway inflammation.",

        "abstract": "Based on our success in developing the world&rsquo;s first commercial 10 W femtosecond fiber laser system and our leading technology development in ultrashort pulsed fiber laser, PolarOnyx proposes, for the first time, a compact high power dual band integrated fiber laser source. The integrated system will be the first extremely compact comprehensive system to address NIST&rsquo;s current and future needs for accessing molecular fingerprints via chemical imaging of materials and biological systems. The key for the commercialization of BBCARS is the development of advanced performance laser system. In the current proposal a new approach is suggested for generation of compressible Supercontinuum covering from 800-1300 nm and a probe beam at 850 nm. In this approach a photonic crystal fiber PCF with flat dispersion wavelength is pumped by 100 fs fiber laser at 1030 nm wavelength and 850 nm probe beam is through an OPA system. In Phase I, these key functions have been demonstrated. A prototype with turnkey operation will be developed and delivered to NIST in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop an integrated femtosecond high-energy fiber source for high-throughput photonics device fabrication.  The final goal of the project will be a laser oscillator/amplifier that confines the pulse to the fiber throughout the generation and amplification process.  This will lead to high stability, robustness, and easy integration into other systems. These characteristics will make the fiber laser system superior in terms of production throughput, size, and cost. Phase II will develop a functional prototype of the fiber laser. To demonstrate the ability of the laser to fabricate real-world devices, experiments will be carried out involving the microfabrication of glass and waveguide channels.  \nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be a breakthrough in understanding of high-energy femtosecond fiber lasers and an unprecedented new design for laser products across a wide range of applications.  The new laser product will offer a combination of high power, high repetition rate, and low cost which surpasses any existing laser on the market today.  Potential markets include photonic device fabrication (e.g. for waveguides, couplers, modulators, and switches), metal processing (welding, cutting, annealing, and drilling), semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturing, general materials processing (e.g. rapid prototyping, desktop manufacturing, micromachining, and photofinishing), medical equipment, and biomedical instrumentation.  In the medical area, potential applications include ophthalmology, refractive and general surgery, photocoagulation, therapeutics, imaging, and cosmetic applications.  Biomedical measurements which might be affected include cytometry, DNA sequencing, laser Raman spectroscopy, spectrofluorimetry, ablation, and laser based microscopes.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application in response to NOT-OD-10-034 through the NIH Basic Behavior and Social Sciences (b-BSSR) Opportunity Network (OppNet). The parent grant (2 R44 AG026815),  E-Technology for Chinese Dementia Caregivers,  supports a Phase II SBIR randomized trial that tests a web-based education and social support intervention for Chinese-speaking dementia caregivers. The proposed OppNet research fits within the first b-BSSR funding category, that of  research on behavioral and social processes,  and more specifically, on the  influence of sociocultural processes on cognitive and emotional responses  of Chinese dementia caregivers. The proposed research will expand significantly the scope of the funded parent SBIR project by allowing an in-depth examination of basic sociocultural processes and mechanisms that influence caregiver outcomes. This supplement will enable us to incorporate additional cultural variables that will allow us to conduct sophisticated analyses using structural equation methods to model the direct and indirect pathways of the relationships between cultural values (e.g., familism, reciprocity, and tolerance) and other culturally situated variables (e.g., coping styles, social support, and self-efficacy/control) on caregiver outcomes. While there has been significant research documenting differences in the nature and effects of dementia caregiving for specific cultural groups, there is little understanding of the factors that influence these differences. The proposed application will allow us to analytically distinguish elements of caregiving from those mediated by the representations and experiences of specific cultural groups, from those cultural values that may moderate caregiver outcomes. Such an analysis is necessary to elucidate the complex and multidimensional influences of cultural values and culturally-situated variables in the socioculural stress and coping model. The proposed supplemental study will (a) verify cultural and content validity of measures used to assess outcome, mediator, and moderator variables in a qualitative study, and (b) incorporate findings from the qualitative study into the current Phase II outcome assessment, analyzing the influence of cultural variables on mechanisms and processes (mediator and moderator variables) that affect caregiver outcomes.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed SBIR examines the influence of cultural variables on stress and coping mechanisms and processes for ethnic Chinese caregivers, relying on a sociocultural model of stress and coping",

        "abstract": "Among the Army\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s many responsibilities, Counterinsurgency (COIN) operations are assuming growing importance. FM 3-24 Counterinsurgency, defines the role, importance, and general properties of an effective COIN campaign design process: exploratory, multi-dimensional, collaborative, and iterative responding to ongoing assessment. COIN campaign designers must draw on sources and knowledge representing all components of national power, must develop campaign concepts by thinking creatively and critically, and must refine their designs by learning from experiences within and across campaigns. We propose to develop a System to Aid Counterinsurgency Campaign Analysis, Design, and Evaluation (SACCADE). SACCADE will combine, adapt, and extend several Stottler Henke tools and technologies. Innovation will focus on (1) data modeling that provides limited, appropriate, and flexible structuring of data about a complex changeable world, (2) appropriate and flexible visualization of that modeled data, (3) exploitation of limited system understanding of both the data and the design method, (4) tools to support efficient creation and ongoing adaptation of complete designs. During Phase II we will refine requirements, carry out a cognitive task analysis of the Army\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evolving design method, explore and develop appropriate technologies, validate our resulting SACCADE prototype with Army users, and prepare for Phase III transition.",
