        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II proposal describes the design, fabrication and evaluation of a Self-Calibrating Vector Magnetometer (SVM) breadboard model. The SVM is an innovative high-accuracy instrument capable of making both scalar and vector component measurements of Earth and planetary magnetic fields. The SVM scalar mode employs Optically-Driven Spin Precession (OSP) magnetic resonance. An OSP single-cell locked digital oscillator magnetometer was demonstrated for the first time under the Phase I Project achieving 3 pT/root-Hz sensitivity. Laser pumping with optical fiber coupling permits miniaturization of the SVM sensor by reducing helium cell volume by a factor of 8 and placing the laser and IR detector in the Electronic Unit. High-accuracy SVM scalar measurements are used to calibrate the SVM vector measurements thereby eliminating both fluxgate vector magnetometers and the scalar magnetometers required to correct for fluxgate drifts and offsets. The feasibility of fabricating a breadboard model SVM in Phase II has been established under the Phase I Project. By providing scalar measurements with an accuracy better than 1.0 nT, scalar sensitivity of 3 pT/root-Hz, vector component sensitivity of 5 pT/root-Hz, and calibrated accuracy of 1 nT, the SVM offers a significant advance in space magnetometer state of the art.",

The innovation in this approach is that it is an extremely streamlined solution to a very difficult guidance and control problem. The guidance module of the proposed architecture is built around a simulation of a system of particles whose motion is a result of attractive and repulsive forces generated through simulated potential fields. Desirable characteristics of the guidance system are: 1) that a large number of satellites, starting at some initial conditions, can move amongst themselves to some desired final conditions with a guarantee that undesirable interactions between individual satellites will not occur, 2) that the path taken by each individual satellite can be achieved using minimum Delta-V, and 3) that the guidance system is distributed. In order to guarantee stability for the satellite constellation as a whole, we designed a distributed satellite control module with a specifiable convergence rate. This in combination with our ability to specify the convergence rate of the guidance module, allows us to ensure that each satellite will stay within a certain distance of its commanded path (tracking error has a known bound).",

Successful completion of Phase I studies showed that the UBM-ECM can be configured into a tube shaped device with mechanical and material properties suitable for the repair of esophageal tissue. These studies also showed that primary canine esophageal epithelial cells could attach, proliferate and differentiate in vitro upon the UBM scaffold. Finally, a preliminary study in a dog model demonstrated the ability of the resorbable UBM scaffold to replace native esophageal tissue with host derived tissues that included an intact squamous epithelium, submucosal vascularized collagenous tissue and subjacent bundles of skeletal muscle appropriate for the resected segment of cervical esophagus. The present Phase II SBIR proposal seeks support to pursue the development of the UBM bioscaffold as a device for the repair or replacement of damaged or missing esophageal tissue; a surgical application that currently has very limited options. There are three studies described, each of which addresses a clearly defined specific aim: (1) to determine the fate and mode of degradation of the porcine derived UBM scaffold when used as an esophageal repair device in a dog model; (2) to complete ISO-9001 testing as a prerequisite to regulatory submission of an Investigational Device Exemption (DE); and (3) to examine the safety and efficacy of the UBM device in a definitive chronic study using an animal model. The work will be conducted by an experienced interdisciplinary group of investigators and will combine the expertise of ACell's professional staff, the certified laboratories of the North America Science Associates (NamSA), and a university partner.

Approximately 750,000 people suffer a stroke each year and over 80% of these are ischemic. Yet only 1% of this number receives medical treatment such as TPA that is known to dissolve clots and promote favorable outcome if administered within 3 hours of onset. Among the many causes of this serious health and ultimately economic problem is the inability to rapidly differentiate ischemic from hemorrhagic strokes to allow intervention. The device is a small non-invasive system that measures the acoustic signature of the brain and compares it with the patient's arterial waveform. Active Signal will add code to calculate those signal features identified in Phase I as indicative of the patient's stroke condition, and the team will clinically test on 200 patients the hypotheses for stroke identification determined in Phase I.  The system will be miniaturized for EMS units to use at the scene of injury.

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating mental disorder that results in a progressive loss of cognitive functions. However, there is no effective treatment for this disease. The neurotoxin AB peptide plays a central role in AD, involving increased production and accumulation of AB in brain amyloid plaques. Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is required to generate AB, which requires B-secretase cleavage of APP to produce AB. Strong evidence indicates that inhibitors of B-secretase should block AB production and be an effective treatment for AD. The key to drug screening for inhibitors of 8-secretase is a rapid high throughput formatted assay for authentic 3-secretase activity obtained from a natural, in vivo tissue source, with a complementary cell-based assay from the same in vivo tissue source. In the phase I grant period, endogenous B-secretase secretase activity was identified in isolated chromaffin vesicles (secretory vesicles) of neuronal chromaffin cells. These isolated vesicles contain all the known components required for production of AB consisting of APP, AB(1-40), B-secretase activity, BACE 1, and presenilin; these vesicles, therefore, provide an ideal model system for screening inhibitors of B-secretase. The Phase I grant developed the chromaffin vesicle system into two assays for screening inhibitors of B-secretase and AB production: (I) sensitive and rapid high throughput in vitro assays of authentic B-secretase activity, and (2) chromaffin cell-based assays to assess effects of inhibitors on cellular AB production. This Phase II proposal will use these assays to screen structurally diverse and focused combinatorial libraries for compounds that selectively inhibit B-secretase activity and AB production. Drug \"hits\" from these assays will be tested in initial animal toxicology studies for safety and pharmacokinetic properties, and in preliminary studies for reduction of AB in a transgenic mouse model of AD. This phase II project will, thus, provide lead compounds for B-secretase inhibitors that will be developed with pharmaceutical partners for new drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease.",

        "abstract": "\"The Air Force and other branches of the Armed Forces require new eyesafe short-pulse laser sources for many applications.  These include laser rangefinders with improved range resolution, high-resolution range-gated imaging from UAVs and missiles, and asoptical drivers for frequency conversion to longer wavelengths for the identification of explosive materials, and biological or drug related threats.  To meet these future needs, Aculight proposes to develop a short pulse, eyesafe, high power, and highrepetition rate laser source based on innovative fiber amplifier technology.  This new approach uses many components developed recently for the telecommunications industry to develop an all-fiber-based laser source.  It utilizes the best properties ofdiodes and fibers:  high efficiency, compactness, reliability, and reduced thermal issues, as well as providing direct eyesafe output.  In the Phase II, Aculight proposes to develop, build, and deliver a prototype laser to provide a proof-of-conceptdemonstration of a novel eyesafe laser source for potential application in a variety of DOD applications.\"",

        "abstract": "65657     Coal-fired power plants represent the single largest source of mercury emissions to the atmosphere, and the EPA has announced its intent to regulate the emission of mercury from these plants in 2007.  Estimates by EPA and others predict that the annual cost of controlling 90% of current mercury emissions will be $2-5 billion.  This estimate is based on the injection of activated carbon, which acts as a sorbent to the collect the gas-phase mercury.  This project will develop a new family of sorbents consisting of chemically amended silicates, materials that have shown a remarkable capacity for mercury, leading to a 35% cost reduction over the use of activated carbon in the removal of mercury from coal-fired flue gas.  In particular, the mercury capacity of the new sorbent will be maximized, and the cost per pound of mercury removed from the flue gas will be minimized.  In Phase I, ten different sorbent formulations were prepared and tested in a simulated flue gas stream.  Two amendment chemistries and one silicate substrate showed significant capacity advantages over the others.  The new sorbent was also mixed with fly ash and tested as a concrete additive.  In contrast to activated carbon, which requires fly ash to be landfilled rather than sold as a byproduct, the fly ash/sorbent blend was shown to have a beneficial effect when added to concrete.  In Phase II, the process to prepare sorbent in uniform batches will be improved, so that performance can be predicted by process parameters.  The new sorbent will be tested in flue gas from a laboratory coal combustor and in a slipstream from an operating power plant, over a range of gas compositions and temperatures.  Lastly, cost models will be prepared for the full-scale use of the sorbent in a power plant.                Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In addition to the anticipated market of $2-5 billion for power plant mercury control, the sorbent should find use as a \u00bfdrop-in\u00bf replacement for activated carbon wherever it is used as a mercury sorbent.  Its use would allow utilities to continue to sell fly ash for use as a pozzolan, saving billions of dollars.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION: (provided by the applicant) Surveys conducted by municipal wastewater treatment plants across the country have concluded that 10 percent to over 70 percent of the mercury reaching the plants comes from dental offices. These findings, combined with increasingly stringent regulations on mercury discharges, have placed pressure on the dental profession to reduce their discharges of mercury-bearing amalgam.\n\nThe objective of this project is to enhance the performance of sedimentation-type amalgam separators by controlling the water chemistry within the separator. Dental wastewater contains mercury in three general forms: large particles of amalgam, fine particles of amalgam, and dissolved mercury. Simple sedimentation traps can capture the large particles and many of the fine particles. However, colloidal particles and dissolved mercury can still exceed\ndischarge limits. At present, expensive and maintenance-intensive adsorbents are needed to achieve discharge concentrations in the low-ppb range. During Phase I ADA Technologies showed that safe, inexpensive additives could be used within a sedimentation device to minimize the release of dissolved mercury. In Phase II, we intend to document the effective use of optimized versions of these additives at several dental clinics, demonstrating ppb-level mercury\nconcentrations at costs significantly below those for adsorbent-based processes.\n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: US dentists use some 45 tons of mercury per year for new amalgam fillings.  European, Canadian, and some US municipalities limit dental office discharges of mercury.  New regulations are pending across North America. Successful completion of this project would yield a low-cost, field-proven amalgam trap, capable of reducing mercury in dental wastewater to the low parts-per-billion range.  ADA Technologies will utilize its network of partners and experience in dental waste treatment and equipment manufacturing to bring this enhanced trap rapidly to the marketplace.",

Current state-of-the-art prehensors intended to increase upper-limb function do not serve this population well. This Phase II SBIR project addresses that situation by focusing upon optimizing a body-powered voluntary-closing (VC) prehensor offering variable mechanical advantage (VMA) and passive holding-assist. Extensive Phase I laboratory testing and field trials with amputee volunteers has established the devices technical feasibility and potential cost-effectiveness. The overall goal of this multi-phase project is to make a next-generation prehensor available to individuals of all ages for whom existing devices are unsuitable or otherwise unsatisfactory. Practical VC prehensors have long been desired for their natural and intuitive operation that promotes proprioception. However, engineering difficulties have prevented the realization of such designs. The device being developed under this project overcomes those technical barriers. In Phase II, units for adult and child use will be designed and fabricated. They will incorporate the comprehensive feedback from experts, amputees, and prosthetists obtained during Phases I and II. Manufacturing processes will be established, and extensive testing and volunteer field trials will be carried out to confirm that the devices perform as required.

        "abstract": "Description (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to construct a prototype narrow-bandwidth x-ray source for mammography using a\nthin, efficient hybrid radiator driven by a relativistic electron beam of\nmoderate energy and current. The high x-ray yield (photons/electron) of the\nsource permits the use of modest electron-beam currents, preventing thermal\ndamage to the radiator itself. The radiator is thin, permitting the electron\nbeam to pass through it many times, thereby proportionally increasing the\nemitted x-ray flux. Since the source is inherently collimated and\nquasi-monochromatic, it will produce higher quality radiographic images while\nlowering the dose to the patient. Phase I experiments have demonstrated intense\nquasi-monochromatic x-rays in the range optimum for mammography (15 to 25 keV).\nCalculations of the x-ray yield and the average current passing through the\nradiator have demonstrated that there is adequate flux for imaging. The\nresearch will proceed by improving the design of the thin hybrid radiator and\nexperimentally demonstrating its feasibility by producing images of inanimate\nphantoms. The potential for successful development of the prototype imaging\nsystem is very high because our Phase I research has already experimentally\ndemonstrated, both electron recycling and narrow bandwidth, tunable x-ray\ngeneration.

These arrays will support advanced processing strategies including field steering techniques and parallel, high rate, phase coherent stimulation being developed by Advanced Cochlear Systems.

The best electrode materials for use in electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC) possess three characteristics: (1) high surface area; (2) high electrical conductivity; and (3) surface area easily accessible by electrolyte.  While ruthenium-based ultracapacitors exhibit almost ideal characteristics, the ruthenium was found to be too expensive for the large-scale manufacture of ultracapacitors.  As an alternative, specialty carbon materials could satisfy these characteristics at reasonably low cost, provided that the pore-size distribution could be controlled.  This project will develop high-performance carbon materials for ultracapacitors, using a proprietary carbon manufacturing technique that would ensure good control over the critical characteristics.  Phase I demonstrated that the proprietary carbon material exhibited a capacitance per unit weight of ~100-200 F/g, up to ~30% better than the capacitance of the best cabon-fiber electrodes currently used.  On a per-unit-volume basis, the electrodes were 3-4 times better than the reference electrodes.  A preliminary economic analysis indicated cost reductions 4-10 times lower.

        "abstract": "In this research project, Advanced Fuel Research, Inc., addresses two important environmental problems: (1) removal and recovery of mercury from combustion/incineration flue gas, and (2) reprocessing of waste tires into value-added products. Coal combustion and incineration of municipal and hazardous wastes results in air pollution due to emissions of trace amounts of heavy metals. Because of the high toxicity of these species, their emissions are or will be regulated. The high volatility of mercury makes control of this metal particularly difficult. Scrap tires present formidable disposal problems, as they are known to be immune to biological degradation. The proposed approach is based on mercury adsorption on low-cost, sulfur-rich activated carbons derived from scrap tires. The sulfur added to tire rubber in the process of vulcanization makes the tire-derived sorbents particularly effective in mercury removal due to the high chemical affinity between mercury and sulfur. Two possible implementations of the process are envisaged: (1) sorbent injection into the flue-gas duct (near-term applications), and (2) a patented regenerative scheme (long-term applications). The overall objective of the project is to develop a novel and effective technology for mercury control using sorbents derived from waste tires. The objective of the Phase I project was to demonstrate the superior price-performance characteristics for waste tire-derived activated carbons under simulated industrial conditions, which was successfully accomplished. The Phase II objective is to optimize sorbent properties as a function of carbon-preparation conditions, and to advance the product to pilot scale (Phase II Option). This will be accomplished through the following tasks: (1) sorbent optimization, (2) sorbent performance, (3) product evaluation, and (4) pilot-scale testing (Phase II Option).",

In recent years, there has been exponential growth in time-lapse seismic project activity.  Time-lapse seismic analysis facilitates the management of oil and gas reservoirs by imaging fluid movement in the reservoir over time.  The results are used to guide reservoir management decisions-such as where to place a new well or where to inject water, gas, or steam to stimulate hydrocarbon movement-and help maximize the life of both new and existing fields while minimizing recovery costs.  The computer algorithms needed to process time-lapse seismic data are complex and require advanced computational hardware-typically multiprocessor Unix workstations or clusters of personal computers-that many potential customers do not have.  The proposed innovation will allow customers to process their data on a centralized PC cluster, using the Internet to control the processing and to visualize the results remotely.  The proposed innovation will improve the links between the components of the time-lapse seismic workflow, leading to greater understanding and more widespread commercial acceptance of the technology.\n\nPotential applications of the research proposed by Fourth Wave Imaging include petroleum industry mapping of by passed oil, monitoring of costly injected fluids, and imaging flow compartmentalization and the hydraulic properties of faults and fractures.  Non-petroleum applications include monitoring groundwater reserves, subsurface monitoring of contaminant plumes and environmental clean-up projects.  The web-based parallel software system developed for this project could be applied to other computer-intensive fields such as earthquake seismology and medical and satellite imaging.  Tools from this web-based software platform such as those for modeling rock physics and seismic data may also be useful for educational purposes.",

The method allows testing in slow motion, separates model and test support frequencies, greatly improves signal-to-noise ratios, and provides unparalleled flow visualization.

This is important in understanding air quality, aerosol formation, visibility, and the impact of energy production and usage on global climate change.  This project will develop a compact tunable infrared laser differential absorption spectrometer.  Based on recent advances in room temperature pulsed quantum cascade lasers, it will greatly improve the sensitivity of real-time airborne measurements for the detection of ammonia and nitric acid at the 10 parts-per-trillion level.  In Phase I, detection limits for atmospheric ammonia and nitric oxide, as a surrogate for nitric acid, were demonstrated using Peltier-cooled pulsed quantum cascade lasers at sub-part-per-billion mixing ratios.  Measurements of laser line width as a function of electrical pulse shape were combined with a model of thermal heat flow in the laser junction and used to implement an improved pulse driver circuit that will minimize line width and improve detection sensitivity.  A siloxyl-coated sampling cell and glass inlet were demonstrated, which minimize surface artifacts when sampling ammonia from the atmosphere.  Phase II will design, build, and test a prototype instrument employing multiple quantum cascade lasers for detection of up to four gases simultaneously.                Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A sensitive, cryogen-free, mid-infrared absorption method for atmospheric trace gas detection should have wide benefits for environmental research, medical diagnostics, and industrial process monitoring of gaseous compounds.  Examples include air pollution monitoring, breath analysis, combustion exhaust diagnostics, and plasma diagnostics for semi-conductor fabrication.",

The proposed sensor will measure the relative intensity of plant fluorescence in two wavelength bands corresponding to emission from Photosystems I and II. The compact size (1000 cm3), light weight (3 kg) and low power consumption (15 watts) of the sensor make this instrument ideal for robotic operation in confined spaces such as might be found on manned space missions or on ground-based facilities such as Bio-PLEX. Use of a novel active fluorescence stimulation source and compact detector enables the device to remotely sense plant fluorescence (at the single leaf, whole plant, or canopy level) from a distance of at least several feet without using a large, high power laser and large focusing optics.

        "abstract": "To assess the effectiveness of new controls, new measurement techniques are needed to measure emissions from in-use diesel vehicles. The goal of this project is to develop a portable remote sensing instrument for particulate matter (PM) and gaseous pollutants. Aerodyne Research, Inc., already has developed a dual-wavelength tunable infrared laser absorption instrument for the crossroad remote sensing of CO, NO, and CO2 for indexing emissions to fuel consumption. This existing remote sensing instrument allows for longer range and more sensitive measurements than conventional, nondispersive instruments. Aerodyne Research, Inc., is developing a remote sensing device for particulate emissions by extending its gaseous pollutant laser instrument designs. This novel approach probes the exhaust plume with several coaligned laser beams that have a range of wavelengths from mid-infrared to visible. All of the beams sample the same absorption path, simultaneously measuring the column density of soot and gaseous pollutants. Multiple wavelength opacity is used to determine the mass density of soot. Multiple wavelengths yield a more precise measurement of opacity, and hence, more accurate soot density. Multiple wavelength measurement also has the potential to distinguish changes in particle characteristics with varying engine state. During Phase I, both theoretical and experimental investigations were conducted to determine the practicality of multiwavelength opacity measurements for the remote sensing of diesel soot. A prototype instrument that remotely measures opacity at three wavelengths simultaneously with CO2 at a data rate of 25 Hz was assembled and tested. This instrument has been tested in the laboratory and outside the laboratory, including measurements of plumes of passing automobiles and a diesel fuel pool fire. The results were highly successful and encouraging. The instrument demonstrated sufficient sensitivity to measure soot densities at current fleet average emissions from heavy-duty diesel vehicles. Simultaneously, CO2 was measured with a noise level of 25 ppm-m.In Phase II, Aerodyne Research, Inc., will build new instrumentation that employs the multiple wavelength particulate system. This instrumentation will be extended to include more wavelengths, and possibly will include scatter information for particle sizing. Quantum cascade lasers will be used for the mid-infrared spectroscopic measurement of gaseous pollutants, allowing for a noncryogenic system. The integration of these techniques into one instrument will provide a powerful tool for survey measurements of both PM and NOx emissions of heavy-duty diesel engines in real-world situations, with the mix of engine loads encountered in normal driving. Phase II efforts will be conducted in association with a commercial partner that builds remote sensing instruments to detect motor vehicle pollution.",

Several known enzymes exhibit hydrolytic activity on target organophosphorus compounds including nerve agent chemical weapons such as sarin and soman as well as many commercially available pesticides, including parathion, methyl parathion and chlorpyrifos. Many of these enzymes have been derived from bacterial sources and are unfortunately not conducive to use as an in-vivo medical treatment for a variety of reasons including acute antigenicity, poor enzyme stability, and brief in-vivo residence times. When one considers that annually 3 million cases of severe poisoning and 220,000 deaths worldwide are associated with OP pesticides, there are obviously unmet needs associated with their use. There is a clear need for technology capable of protecting individuals from overexposure to OP compounds. Successful Phase I research has demonstrated that the concept of protecting a person from an otherwise debilitating dose of OP toxins with chemically modified enzyme is viable. Modified OP hydrolyzing enzymes have potential utility as medical treatments for exposed individuals as well as preventative security for individuals at high risk of OP exposure. Such treatments have potential utility at hospitals, agricultural sites employing OP pesticides, civil defense treatment centers for chemical terrorism, and with the armed forces.

        "abstract": "Agriculture needs new bio-rational pest control agents to replace outdated synthetic chemicals. Safer, smarter, target-specific control measures are required for use in sustainable integrated pest management (IPM) systems. New technologies are essential to IPM in high value fruit, nut, and vegetable crops where the most widely used insecticides are organophosphates (OPs) and carbamates. In 1998, 37 registered insecticidal OPs accounted for approximately 50% of the agricultural area treated by insecticides. Maize, cotton, and other row crops received 74% of the OPs, where as 26% went on fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Apples and potatoes represented 43% and 53%, respectively, of the total OP-treated acreage. Many of these pesticides face tolerance reassessment under EPA's Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA). In many cases, regulatory authorities have restricted or eliminated OPs due to their high toxicity. In other cases, the registrants may have no option but to cancel certain uses, because the cost of complying with new registration requirements may not be justified by the size of the market. Loss of registered products will severely weaken or eliminate IPM programs that are built around a rotational use of different classes of chemicals with different modes of action.

Large acreage row crops are developing a reliance on a limited collection of Bacillus thuringiensis toxins and other transgenic protein-based events. In vegetable and tree crops, controversy and industrial consolidation have extended the event horizon and limited the deployment of transgenic opportunities. Microbial natural products offer an untapped source of agrochemical diversity. Successful products in this category, including the avermectins and spinosyns, achieved acceptance and rapidly captured market share because of their efficacy and highly specific pesticidal activities. Recent advances in industrial fermentation coupled with a rapidly expanding understanding of the genetics of secondary metabolite production are enabling a revolution in the industrial production methods for large complex bioactive molecules. Completion of Phase II SBIR research will demonstrate the commercial efficacy of a novel microbial bioinsecticide in agricultural applications. Completion of the following technical objectives are anticipated: 1) Complete isolation and characterization of the biologically active components from a Streptomycetes-based bioinsecticide, 2) Development of analytical detection methods and mode of action studies, 3) Strain improvement, 4) Fermentation process optimization at industrial scale, 5) Formulation studies, 6) Expanded laboratory and field scale evaluation of pesticidal efficacy, 7) Toxicology and EPA regulatory submission. Completion of these goals will demonstrate the commercial potential of this bioinsecticide, and provide important regulatory data necessary for EPA registration.",

When available, this tool provides an acoustic engineer access to both the experimental data being measured and analytical predictions that are derived from empirical models and a database. Thus, the proposed tool takes advantage of an existing database that includes pertinent extensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data. As data are being recorded, the tool generates acoustic spectra at locations that are not part of the experimental setup to provide in-situ prediction. Furthermore, this high-level analysis tool improves the quality of the experimental data by detecting potential problems as the data is being taken; hence, the engineer can intervene in the process to eliminate anomalies or improve results. The analytical prediction tool, once calibrated, can be used to predict acoustic spectra during launch at various locations on and around the spacecraft. These acoustic load predictions can then be used for structural dynamic analysis. The proposed tool incorporates several input parameters that an analyst can change to simulate or eliminate perturbations in the experimental conditions.

Based on a new spectral analysis technique called Coherent Phase Line Enhancer (CPLE), the DSA will significantly enhance critical speed-related signatures in vibration measurements thus providing early detection for machinery health monitoring and diagnosis. Unlike the conventional method for Power Spectral Density (PSD) function estimation, the CPLE technique incorporates phase information into the spectral estimation process. This is achieved through detection of a unique coherent phase relationship associated with all speed-related signal components in the wave-number domain. Accordingly, the CPLE spectrum detects well-hidden fault-mechanism signatures (bearing, gear, rotor instability, etc.) that are often unnoticed by a conventional PSD. The significance of the proposed innovation is attributed to its enhanced capability to cope with severe operational environments where health-monitoring measurements are heavily corrupted by background noise. Successful development of CPLE-DSA can enhance incipient fault detection capability, reducing catastrophic engine failure risks and will improve reliability of NASA's advanced propulsion systems.

Its fundamental advantage is that functional data can be obtained non-invasively, allowing each animal to be studied repeatedly. Thus, each animal can serve as its own control in studies with a longitudinal design. There is significant interest in small animal PET within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry because in vivo quantification of biological processes to measure an agent'smechanism of action and its concentration at the site of action are of great importance in drug development. \n\nWhile the advantages of small animal imaging with PET are obvious, the challenges are also very significant. The main barriers to using PET in studies of laboratory animals have traditionally been poor spatial resolution, low sensitivity, and high cost. To address these deficiencies, we propose to develop a detector that can achieve extremely fine spatial resolution and high sensitivity in a cost-effective manner. The detector will be based on finely pixelated monolithic block of scintillator coupled to a position sensitive detector.

The current multi-step amplification process introduces a source of variability, time and expense. As the amount of input mRNA is lowered, likewise, confidence is reduced and the array experiments themselves have questionable validity. We recognized this limitation as an opportunity that our research group should study, specifically, how can we use our expertise and our supply of high quality transcription reagents to establish a R&D program to enhance the performance of RNA amplification methods? We will design an exhaustive optimization plan to explore a large matrix of conditions, work that is most suitable for a robotic platform. Careful microarray analysis with numerous internal controls will be used to monitor the progress of the optimization program to insure that the representation is accompanied enhanced yields. The optimized enzymatic steps will be integrated on to automated platforms, which will increase the throughput and consistency of the method for research demanding a large number of samples.

Building upon existing inverse kinematics, rule-based control, and neural network learning technology, the training method enhances robot capabilities through operator supervision. The current innovation enables the online construction of rule-based plans of action through verbal dialogue between operator and robot, and uses verbal, visual, and manual cues such as spoken words, hand gestures, and the pushing of buttons and joysticks to teach neural networks how to improve nominal rule-based performance. Phase I results indicate that given an underlying library of intelligent behaviors, non-trivial robot task plans can be created and modified verbally by an operator in a straightforward manner. Phase II will optimize the behavior control system, training process, and operator interface. Validation will focus on two scenarios: assisting EVA astronauts with tool preparation and handling using the Johnson Space Center?s Robonaut system, and assisting a physiologically degraded astronaut in partial gravity environments.

For example, compact power transmission cables, motors, and generators could be attained by using high temperature superconductors (HTS) with a high critical current density Jc at 77K and magnetic fields of up to 1.5 Tesla.  The superconductor YBa2Cu3Ox (YBCO) could be employed as the enabling material.  However, for this to occur, the superconductor must have a high degree of bi-axial texture along long lengths.  This project will produce YBCO coated conductors by combining buffered, high quality deformation-textured alloy substrates with a low cost solution-based YBCO deposition process.  In Phase I, various experimental alloys were made in long lengths and evaluated for suitability for the YBCO coated conductor process.  The most suitable candidate was identified for further development.  In Phase II, long lengths of coated conductors will be made with further performance enhancements.  The conductors will be tested in an environment that closely simulates a commercial application.            Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  High performance, low cost, superconducting YBCO coated conductors should have application to the electric power industry.  Power transmission cables, motors, and generators should receive a performance boost from HTS use, and lead to a far wider acceptance of High Temperature Superconductors for power applications.",

These implants are made from a selected proprietary Nutraporer micro-porous hydrogel that allows transport of fluid and nutrients satisfying the needs of the human cornea. There is no permanent solution for hyperopia today. Implantation is done using a procedure to be called Sutureless Synthetic Keratophakia (SSKTM). This involves lamellar dissection to generate a flap (like in LASIK surgery), placing the lens on the stromal bed and closing the flap without sutures. Rehabilitation is quick. The power of the lens is predefined and pre-tested during manufacturing so the surgeon can accurately correct the power in one sitting. The procedure is reversible and adjustable. Improper power correction/lens placement can easily be corrected by re-lifting the flap and replacing/repositioning the lens. During Phase II we propose to develop final lens design(s), manufacture clinical supplies, conduct a Phase I clinical trial under an approved USFDA-IDE, develop commercial packaging and sterilization process, determine shelf life and photo-stability, select a marking material/method to confirm proper lens placement/orientation which was found difficult during the one year GLP swine study (completed), develop commercial manufacturing process(es), and perform validations.",

This reduces the weight of major elements (e.g. Jet engines, wing, and landing gear)by 60%, and allows us the margin to use the same principles and advantages commercial airplanes use to achieve very safe operations and low operating costs. Using Alchemist, a completely reusable RLV, weighing less than a 777 at takeoff, can operate out of existing commercial airport facilities and deliver the same usable payload to the International Space Station as the Space Shuttle . Turbofan engines are an integral partof the Alchemist system, providing not only takeoff, climb, and cruise propulsion, but all-envelope intact-abort capability, plus ferry capability. With the turbofans on board we have single-fault tolerance against catastrophic failure on all flight critical systems including main propulsion. Single-fault tolerance on all systems provides the operational breakthrough necessary to transition from artillery-like to airplane-like launch systems.

        "abstract": "\"Recent developments in DNA microarray generation technology have made entirely new methods of gene analysis feasible.  The DNA microarray can greatly facilitate research in the areas of drug and vaccine discovery, disease screening, and toxicology, amongothers.  Therefore, the importance of a low-cost, high-resolution, high-throughput DNA microarray generation system cannot be understated.  Current DNA microarray generation techniques suffer from severe limitations.  The development of a new DNAmircoarray generation technique that has the high resolution of photolithography with the low cost of operation of mechanical deposition would significantly accelerate the pace of gene research.  In this proposal, we present a method to generate DNAmicroarrays using a maskless lithography system.  The maskless lithography system incorporates a large-array spatial light modulator to serve as a programmable mask.  The spatial light modulator technology is integrated with Anvik's patented large arealithography technology to produce a breakthrough in lithography system development that allows rapid, high-density DNA microarray generation at low cost.  In the Phase I program, we have developed the maskless lithography process specifically for DNAmicroarray generation.  In the proposed Phase II program, we will construct a fully functional maskless lithography system and demonstrate the generation of DNA microarrays with an optimized process.\"",

As much as 40 percent of chronic liver\ndisease is HCV related and this results in up to 10,000 deaths each year.\nDespite improvements, treatment of remains suboptimal, and new therapeutic\noptions are critically needed. Apath, LLC has developed cell-based assays for\ntesting and screening of compounds with antiviral activity against hepatitis C\nvirus (HCV). These assays are based on Huh7 cell lines that contain a\nconstructively replicating subgenomic HCV replicon. The cells have been\nanalyzed extensively and have been demonstrated to contain an HCV replicon that\nexhibits autonomous HCV RNA replication. We have promoted these cell lines as\ndrug-discovery tools by formatting assays for compound screening that are\namenable to high throughput screening. In this Phase II proposal we describe\nour plans to use these cell-based assays to identify compounds with anti-HCV\nactivity. Toward this goal we will plan to utilize a unique source of natural\ncompounds and to screen over 40,000 wells containing up to 200,000 discrete\ncompounds to identify \"hits\" that inhibit replication of the HCV replicon. We\nwill confirm antiviral activity of all \"hits\" in secondary HCV replicon\nquantitation and cytotoxicity assays.

        "abstract": "\"Fretting is a wear phenomenon that occurs between two mating surfaces: it is adhesive in nature, and vibration is its essential causative factor. Usually fretting is accompanied by corrosion. In general, fretting occurs between two tight fitting surfacesthat are subjected to a cyclic, relative motion of extremely small amplitude. Fretted regions are highly sensitive to fatigue cracking. Under fretting conditions fatigue cracks are nucleated at very low stresses. Nucleation of fatigue cracks in frettedregions depends mainly on the state of stress on the surface and particularly on the stresses superimposed on the cyclic stress. The time to nucleation of cracks can be significantly reduced as a result of fretting. Common sites for fretting are in jointsthat are bolted, keyed, pinned, press fitted, and riveted. These sites are common in the assembly of most air vehicles, ground vehicles, power plants, equipment, and machinery. All applications that have safety issues, maintenance issues, and service liferequirements will benefit from quantitative methods that provide the impact of fretting on the component's service.The multi-task objectives of the plan discussed in this proposal are:1) Integrate and implement the techniques of modified fretting fatigue predictive analytic models into structural integrity framework,2) Demonstrate integration for applications to present and future U.S. military weapons programs, commercial aviation, auto",

The metal surfaces are protected by passive oxide layers, yet basic questions about how these layers break down and initiate corrosion are not answered.  This project will develop a non-invasive, video microscopy technique to assay the initiation and subsequent dynamics of localized corrosion on metal surfaces.  Phase I developed a system to control a video microscope, image capture board, and a proprietary in-house video analysis software program to create a visual assay of a corroding metal surface in an aqueous solution.  Areas of change less than 8 microns in diameter were clearly seen on an aluminum sample surface within 6 seconds of immersion in a corrosive solution (with 10x magnification).  Phase II will improve the video assay and merge it with scanning probe techniques and standard electrochemical techniques within a single platform.  This system will provide four simultaneous non-invasive methods to monitor localized corrosion on metal surfaces in corrosive solutions.  All techniques will have three-dimensional capability.              Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This non-invasive assay combining different techniques should be used in corrosion laboratories to study basic mechanisms of passivity breakdown and thereby improve metal alloys and corrosion protection.

Studies were conducted on how to adapt existing deep rooting technology to minimize installation costs and improve deep rooting efficacy to enhance carbon sequestration.  In Phase II, a field study will be conducted to evaluate the application of the deep rooting technology to the establishment of non-irrigated trees in semi-arid conditions with ground water 50 or more feet below ground surface.  Also, to provide additional incentive to utilize the carbon sequestration benefits of deep rooting technology, greenhouse and small-plot research will be conducted to evaluate the potential for expanding deep rooting technology to trees that have greater commercial value, such as fruit, nut, and valuable hardwood species.               Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The establishment of self-irrigated low-maintenance windbreaks or shelterbelts in semi-arid climates, where carbon is not readily recycled, should create an enhanced net positive carbon sequestration regime and be potentially useful in blocking desertification in some areas.

This is consistent with the fact that the absorptance of satellite solar panels increases with age and thereby increases its temperature; whichin turn creates a stronger radiometric signature. In order to ascertain the current thermal health, the first step is to build detailed mathematical models of the GPS satellites for radiometric evaluation. The second step is to implement a library ofalgorithms for determination of material degradation. The third step is to perform data fusion of the LWIR and Visual Spectrum intensity values for purposes of robust estimation of material degradation and also for use in multi-view tracking.

Unlike current approaches, this system can measure and cancel coupled interactions between instrument and platform at high frequency. The melding of low-frequency and high-frequency data and the use of a novel sensor will enable low-cost, low-weight, low-power, precision pointing for NASA's terrestrial and extra-terrestrial balloons and aerobots.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will investigate the use of a new high temperature amorphous oxide material, CerablakTM, as a protective coating on components used in the molten aluminum industry. CerablakTM is a newly discovered sol-gel derived material that is thermally stable up to 1400 degrees Celsius over many hours. A patented precursor is used to form a continuous, dense, and smooth thin film using a simple dip coating process. The key property of CerablakTM is its relatively low oxygen diffusivity which enables its use for oxidation protection of metal and alloy surfaces exposed to elevated temperatures. The Phase I project showed that the material is non-wetting and compatible with molten aluminum. CerablakTM coatings developed on full-size thermocouple protection tubes showed excellent durability and non-wetting behavior. The Phase II project will optimize the coating quality for use in protection of thermocouple protection tubes, riser stalk tubes, molds, and dies. The commercial applications include protective coatings for metals and alloys used in turbine components and petrochemical refining, molten metal processing, thermal protection systems for space propulsion, cookware, and glass",

We propose to develop a computer based hardware/software solution where it will be possible to tag and locate individual files with precision.

In every area, Artann Laboratories fulfilled the proposed accomplishments of Phase I. A proof-of-concept prototype of the BUSS was designed, constructed and extensively tested in laboratory experiments with bone composite models. In Phase II, the BUSS team will enhance system hardware and software quality and design to the level of a final product and will validate BUSS functionality through comprehensive laboratory and clinical studies.

The availability of suitable instruments for measuring particulate emissions from engines and vehicles will benefit two broad categories of users: (1) it will directly help in the development of low emission engines, and (2) it will allow the appropriate government agencies to establish roadside checkpoints for monitoring the particulate emissions from vehicles and take enforcement actions against violators of environmental regulations. Laser-induced incandescence (LII) has emerged as a technique for measuring soot concentration and size (it appears that non-soot matter is evaporated and/or does not contribute to the signal). In the Phase I proposal, Artium Technologies, Inc., introduced a novel LII method for precisely determining the primary particle size and the number density of primary particles, in addition to particulate concentration in diesel exhausts. The proposed LII technique is capable of real-time particulate matter (PM) measurements over any engine transient operation. LII also has orders of magnitude more sensitivity than the gravimetric technique. The wide dynamic range and lower detection limit of LII make this technique a potentially preferred standard instrument for PM measurements. The Phase I effort clearly demonstrated the capabilities of the LII technique. The Phase I effort established the feasibility of building an instrument using this technique, and the proposed Phase II effort will further develop the technique and instrument as well as verify its suitability for PM measurement in a variety of applications. The Phase II Option effort will focus on cost reduction leading to the development of a roadside monitor as well as a portable version of the LII instrument.",

        "abstract": "65064    One of the factors that limit the productivity of DOE workers performing decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) work is the heat stress induced by the protective clothing that must be worn.  Currently, there are no personal cooling products available that meet all of the needs.  The product that comes closest circulates cool water through a tube-lined garment worn by the worker under the protective clothing.  However, the cooling is supplied by blocks of ice that are heavy, have limited endurance, and impose significant logistic burdens on the operation.  This project will develop a complete cooling system using a previously developed miniature compressor.  The ice block and pumping unit would be replaced by the miniature vapor compression system.  In Phase I, the requirements for a personal cooling system for the DOE\u00bfs D&D activities were defined; a laboratory breadboard test system was designed, fabricated, and tested; and a packaged prototype unit was designed, assembled, and demonstrated.  In Phase II, prototypes will be field tested and evaluated, anti-contamination methods will be designed, and a hermetic compressor housing will be designed.  A manufacturability analysis will be conducted to prepare the cooling unit for production in Phase III.                 Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new cooling system should allow D&D activities to proceed more efficiently, thus reducing cost and time to complete environmental restoration, while improving worker safety.

First, it provides for a study to determine current industry trends and user needs and to trade-off design issues so as to provide the most useful functionality in the Phase-II development.

Since some of the elements used currently in the Displacement Method violate equations of stress equilibrium, an additional analysis by the Force Method in which element stresses do not violate the equations of equilibrium will provide bracketing on the solution (i.e. upper and lower bounds on stresses and displacements) thereby ensuring greater confidence in numerical results. Since the Force Method stresses are derived directly from internal forces they are more accurate than the stresses in the Displacement Method which requires differentiation of the displacement field within the element. The method will be illustrated on a typical multispar wing structure.

        "abstract": "Most buses, heavy-duty fleet vehicles, and construction and farm machinery are equipped with diesel engines. The diesel engine is an energy-efficient machine, but its exhaust emissions present a serious health and environmental problem. Drastic reductions in exhaust soot have been mandated throughout the world, including the recent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandate to reduce smog-causing nitrogen oxides from these vehicles by 95 percent, and particulate matter (PM) by 90 percent. EPA proposes a PM emissions standard for new heavy-duty engines of 0.01 grams per brake-horsepower-hour in engine model year 2007. Soot emissions would be reduced by 110,000 tons each year when implemented. Current control technologies, such as catalytic converters, alternative fuels, and advanced diesel engine combustion systems are only partially effective in controlling the soot generated from diesel engines. Most of today's filter-based technologies experience high operational backpressures, causing unfavorable fuel consumption. The key to the acceptability of barrier filters for diesel exhaust is the ability of the filter to be regenerated, or cleared of trapped particles, so that the exhaust backpressure remains low. Atmospheric Glow Technologies resolved the inadequacy of filter regeneration by developing the Regenerative Plasma Filter (RPF) System. A metallic porous filter collects 90 percent of the soot from the diesel exhaust, which subsequently is oxidized with periodic exposures of the patented One Atmosphere Uniform Glow Discharge Plasma (OAUGDP). The molecular radicals produced by the plasma oxidize the captured soot at the ambient temperature of the exhaust stream (40-150 C), providing a safe means of filter regeneration at low energy costs without the need for catalysts or fuel additives. In Phase II, a full-scale commercial prototype will treat the entire exhaust stream from a 2.0 L diesel engine. The pressure drop across the filter and the mass distribution of penetrating particles will be measured. In addition, NOx, SOx, CO, and O3 concentrations will be measured to determine if secondary pollutants are generated. In 2010, the world market for motor vehicle exhaust emissions control technologies is expected to approach $72.3 billion. Approximately 330,600 heavy-duty diesel powered vehicles is are produced each year. Initial market entry estimates 5 percent, or 16,350, of these vehicles could be fitted with the RPF System, with a 20 percent market share 5 years out.",

        "abstract": "The proposed research is designed to demonstrate the functionality, safety and effectiveness of an innovative disposable retractable trocar system intended for thoracostomy and chest tube insertion. When tension pneumothorax is suspected, the conventional clinical procedure is to perform a needle thoracostomy, in which a large needle is thrust blindly through the anterior chest to decompress the pneumothorax emergently. When pneumothoracies, hemothoracies, pleural effusions and empyemas occur, insertion of a chest tube is indicated, requiring a combination of sharp and blunt dissection to gain access to the pleural space. Our new device for chest access is similar in concept to retractable tracers used in pararascopic surgery. Preliminary testing in swine indicate chest tube thoracostomy with the retractable trocar is quicker and easier, results are more uniform, and it is thus presumably safer than techniques used currently. We propose to conduct a clinical study to evaluate device, safety, and effectiveness. This research is expected to lead to new and improved methods for emergency management of traumatic chest injury.",

Designing a guidance law that performs across this broad flight envelope presents several challenges. Robustness to uncertain aerodynamics is of paramount importance because of the sparse amount of wind tunnel and flight test data that exists for reusable launch vehicles at hypersonic Mach numbers. The need to compensate for potential control surface failures imposes additional guidance requirements. Barron Associates, Inc. (BAI) has teamed with Orbital Sciences Corporation to develop control and guidance systems that can reconfigure in real time to significantly increase the reliability of reusable launch vehicles. An innovative modular architecture, presently under development, will be used to reshape trajectories on-line. We believe that leveraging this concurrent effort is a main strength of the proposal. The approach autonomously identifies the closed-inner-loop dynamics and adapts the guidance for off-nominal performance. In Phase I, a modification of the existing X-34 energy management approach will be investigated. A more formal optimization technique developed and matured by BAI will also be considered. Studies will focus on aerodynamic uncertainties and control failures that primarily affect lateral-directional maneuvering capabilities, which are critical in managing vehicle energy for unpowered descent.",

We add autofocusing to a focusing distance measuring interferometer to keep the beam focused on the test piece. The measurement is unaffected by small autofocusing errors. Thus, the range is extended to the lens-servoing range; the servoing has loose tolerances; and the sub-nanometer accuracy is preserved. In another innovation, we add coma (by tilting the lens) to enlarge the focused spot on the test piece to be immune to surface defects. The coma is canceled on the return trip through the lens, preserving wavefront quality. These innovations can greatly improve the optical profiling of astronomical and space optics.Our Phase I project was successful - we arrived at a workable design including mechanics, optics, actuation, and servoing architecture.

Thus, pharmaceutical companies have an immediate need for better methods to determine whether their potential drug candidates will be glucuronidated, and if so by which UGT isoform. In the longer term, it is hoped that fully defining the \"chemical space\" recognized by each of the key hepatic UGTs will lead to in silico metabolism screening approaches. The proposed Phase II studies will generate the molecular tools needed to address these needs. The key hepatic UGT isoforms will be expressed, purified and incorporated into HTS assays that can be used to rapidly screen large numbers of diverse chemicals for binding and metabolism by isolated UGT isoforms. These novel molecular assays will fulfill the immediate need for improved preclinical drug glucuronidation assessment, and will accelerate efforts to delineate the key determinants of substrate binding and catalysis for the hepatic UGTs, thereby enabling faster and more cost-effective drug development.",

Paddle sports are one of the fastest growing recreational activities. Current canoe seating products cradle the paddler in a flexible fabric or plastic bucket but do not provide the stable base of support required for efficient, independent and equal participation by users with movement limitations. The universal canoe seating system will support the pelvis, torso and legs creating a stable base of support that will increase upper body function, balance, endurance, strength and movement efficiency. Technological innovations will mechanically link paddler and canoe, enable personal cushion use and enhance the function and effectiveness of paddlers with movement, strength, balance, positioning or endurance limitations. Phase I results demonstrated enhanced paddler strength,  comfort and balance without compromising safety. Phase II user testing will demonstrate the functional benefits of the seat through comparative measures of fit, support, user satisfaction, paddling strength and endurance. The durability and safety of the seat will be established through strength and load testing. With the new seat, individuals, outdoor recreation programs, rental companies and outfitters will have a system that enables safe, effective and equal canoeing opportunities for people of all abilities.",

An approach now followed by all major observatories is to make the large mirror of smaller segments that are phased together. Hexagons 1 meter in diameter are a possible segment size. Over one hundred one meter segments are required even for a 10 meter diameter primary. Segments will have a long focal length, f/20 or more, even if the resultant large mirror is f/2 or less. Means for making and measuring high quality, low scatter, long focal length, large adaptive optic deformable mirrors economically is thus greatly needed, as stated in the subtopic. This proposal presents one solution. Effects of turbulence and air layering are largely eliminated by making most of the long focal length path virtual. A technique for economically superpolishing large mirrors for low scatter is presented and will be domonstrated. A precision fiber optic interferometer said to increase the measuring precision of commercial interferometers by an order of magnitude will be evaluated in Phase I.

This innovation, termed Venturi Off-Set Technology (VOSTtm), addresses four critical needs for effective storage, transfer and use of cryogens in aerospace. These are: thermal isolation to minimize heat leakage,low pressure drop to accommodate high flows without cavitation, minimal mass and space requirement due to low profile, and adaptability to electromechanical actuation. Existing cryogenic valves require elaborate insulation measures to mitigate heat leakage through actuator stems, they are also characterized by: high pressure drop at high flows, large mass to envelope ratio, and high actuation torques. VOSTtm valves eliminate actuator contact with internal wetted parts, potentially improving thermal and fluid containment characteristics necessary for densified propellants while maintaining high flow. VOST valves are suited for electromechanical actuation due to low torque requirements. These features combine to improve valve reliability necessary for use of cryogens in Earth, space, and extra-terrestrial environments. Phase 1 will determine the feasibility of adapting the innovative VOST tm design for cryogenic service. Tasks include material evaluation, sealing technology investigation, performance modeling and a conceptual design. Phase II will prototype, test, evaluate and deliver a cryogenic valve for system testingand integration.",

Current PSG and CPAP titration\npatient interfaces use sensors and conventional electrode assemblies that are\ntoo busy, cumbersome to wear and generate indirect or noisy data. The proposed\ndevice will improve signal sensitivity, patient comfort and reliability by\ndeveloping a new dedicated patient interface. The proposed device will\nincorporate three innovative features: I) miniaturized 23 channel headwom\namplifier system for EEG/EOG, 2) non-contacting upper airway microsensors that\nplug in-line with the air hose proximal to the mask, and 3) a small recorder\nunit with novel micro data storage medium and wireless data transmission\ncapability. BIOMEC will capitalize on technologies being developed for other\napplications. Although the primary targeted market is the lab, in-home studies\nwill also benefit from such a device. Compactness and wearability will make the\nproposed device the first in-home sleep disorders monitor with in-lab\ncapabilities. In Phase I, we tested the feasibility of embedded microsensors,\nminiaturized wearable hardware and micro data storage. In Phase II, we will\ncomplete the hardware design by integrating all the components together, and\nconduct clinical studies on 12 patients. The final product promises to set the\nstandard for a new class of full PSG and CPAP titration for the lab and home.\n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nThe proposed device will have the capability of in-lab PSG devices but with the mobility and ease of use of home devices.  The commercial potential include lab and home screening and monitoring of sleep disorders such as OSA, and isomnia.\n\nThe total number of sleep labs is expected to exceed 2500 in the US alone.  The total market for sleep diagnostic products is estimated at $104 million and is growing at 8% annually.  One of the biggest drivers is the untapped OSA population, which is estimated at over 11 million.  there is a huge need for improved diagnostic devices that generate sensitive recordings in a more comfortable patient interface.  Also, a more compact and reliable patient interface will permit home use, which is one of the high growth market segments due to lower cost and more convenient procedure setting.",

Materials have been developed with bulk physical properties needed for transport of aqueous mixtures; however, the development of biofilm on the wet surfaces is a continuing serious problem in the dental, pharmaceutical, food processing, and marine transport industries. Surface modification of waterlines could decrease the formation of biofilm while retaining the desired bulk properties of the tubing. Photochemistry has been proven commercially successful in enhancing the surface properties of medical devices with radical-based surface modification initiated by RF plasma or ultraviolet light. However, these energy sources are not effective for modifying the inner surfaces of opaque tubes such as waterlines used with dental units and plumbing in pharmaceutical plants. This project is designed to develop latent-reactive radical generators activatible with thermal energy which penetrates these opaque devices. This innovative approach to scheduled activation of radical generators will provide a method to modify inert surfaces which cannot be activated with external light or plasma sources. Microbial colonization and biofilm formation remain a major cost and threat to human health and product quality for dental and pharmaceutical industries, health care and public lodging, and marine vessel utilization. Successful development of microbicidal and antifouling coating technology for the luminal surface of opaque transport and storage vessels for aqueous liquid ingestible products, constitute an incremental market size of tens of millions of dollars, not subject to current commercial coating technology.",

This creates several problems including difficulties in sharing data between laboratories and poor interoperability between equipment, data processing tools and spike classification software from different vendors. Moreover, neuroscientists wanting to develop their own data acquisition hardware or analysis software are forced to support a limited set of proprietary formats or create their own. In Phase I, Bionic Technologies, Inc. will work with all interested data acquisition companies and representative users to develop an open, industry-standard file format for neurophysiological data, create a web- based user forum to support this standard, and provide a C/C++ code library for importing and exporting data in the open format. In Phase II, the usability of the format will be increased by the development of public-domain, open-source software tools for: importing/exporting the data in various programming languages and between a variety of analysis environments; editing, splicing, annotating and reviewing experiment data in the standard file format; generating data files for analysis from simulation environments, and classifying spike waveforms with classical or custom algorithms.

The combined technology will save electrical energy, improve paper quality (strength and optical properties), and reduce the environmental impact of pulping cost-effectively compared to the present process of producing the same products. Biopulping, defined as the treatment of wood chips with a lignin-degrading fungus prior to mechanical pulping, is a new technology for papermaking. In this process, at least 30% electrical energy is saved and paper strength properties are improved. Unfortunately, the process reduces the brightness and opacity of the resulting paper. High brightness and high opacity are critical for the production of high quality papers, particularly when the trend in the pulp and paper industry is towards producing lightweight papers. We have also developed another new technology called fiber loading. In this technology, calcium carbonate is deposited as filler within, on the surface of, and outside the fibers. The process improves brightness, opacity, and bonding strength, and reduces energy consumption during drying. Thus, this fiber loading technology has the potential of overcoming both the problems associated with biopulping. During Phase I, the technical feasibility of combining the two newly developed technologies was established at a laboratory scale.",

        "abstract": "\"The U.S. Army is conducting extensive research involving the development of innovative algorithms for detecting and classifying high-value military targets using LADAR sensors.  Many of these designs employ a model-based approach in which targets,background, and target/background interactions are modeled.  A central tenet of this approach is that the large number of target, sensor, and background combinations found in realistic scenarios precludes the use of automatic target recognition (ATR)algorithms that rely solely on pre-computed templates or \"brute force\" model matching.  These approaches can be costly and the form factor impractical for a variety of military applications.  As an alternative to model-based approaches, feature-based ATRsystems have also been investigated whereby target and scene features are extracted from the data for target detection and classification.  The SBIR Phase I program demonstrated a feature-based ATR system that exploited evolutionary algorithm (EA)technology.  The ATR system accepted a feature vector extracted from synthetic LADAR imagery and output a target classification decision with a high probability of correct classification.

The objectives of this project are to develop and test tent-related technology which results in a vestibule and a combined tent and vestibule accessible to people of varying abilities, including people with mobility, dexterity, cognitive and visual impairments. The universal vestibule will be able to be used with a wide range of 2-6 person tents. Its zipperless, accessible door will enable individuals to quickly and independently get out of the rain. Inside the vestibule, there will be enough headroom for people to sit upright, for others to assist in transfers, and room to maneuver a wheelchair. Secondary applications will be its use as a stand-alone, accessible, private shelter for a commode, gear storage, or as a screen house in group camping situations. A means for attaching the vestibule to a stationary vehicle will also be developed. It is anticipated that the features and benefits of the universal vestibule will appeal to a wide range of campers, not just those with disabilities. A 2-3 person accessible tent/vestibule will also be developed. The structure will include a vestibule area and a sleeping area, with insect-proof netting separating the two areas. Hardware and frames developed for both structures will enable campers who are standing upright, seated in a wheelchair, or sitting on the ground to assemble the tent. Window closures and the insect barrier between the sleeping and vestibule portions of the tent will be easy to open and close by those with limited dexterity, as well as those at ground level. The overall technical objectives include structural stability, withstanding wind and rain, and insect resistance. Production and manufacturing objectives include optimization of the designs for ease of manufacturing and control of costs, development of processes and specifications to ensure finished goods meet established quality criteria, identification of potential domestic or overseas manufacturers, and identification of existing tent manufacturers who may license the technology. Information dissemination activities regarding the project will increase the awareness of the outdoor industry, camping programs, and disability communities.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most human protein therapeutics require frequent dosing due to rapid clearance of the proteins from the body. Development of second generation protein pharmaceuticals that can be injected less frequently is of considerable interest to patients and healthcare providers. We propose to create long-acting forms of IL-11 and TPO by creating larger versions of these proteins with longer circulating half-lives. These modified IL-11 and TPO proteins will possess biological activities equal or superior to natural IL-I 1 and TPO in vivo, but will require less frequent dosing, on the order of once every one to three weeks, rather than daily. During Phase I we constructed IL-11 and TPO fusion proteins and demonstrated that certain of them possess near wild type in vitro bioactivities. We also demonstrated that one of the IL-11 fusion proteins has a significantly longer half-life than IL-11 in a rat. During Phase II, we will manufacture sufficient quantities of the modified proteins for more extensive pharmacokinetic and animal efficacy studies. The improved characteristics of the novel IL-11 and TPO proteins will reduce the amount of protein required per patient, improve patient compliance and quality of life and result in considerable cost savings to patients and healthcare providers. These proteins will find utility in treating thrombocytopenia resulting from cancer chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Non-mechanical beamsteering eliminates the need for massive optomechanical components to steer the field of view of optical systems. This benefit is to come in the form of compact, low-power, light-weight optical phased arrays that provide better control with greater flexibility in their steering capability than their mechanical counterparts. Currently, high-speed, high-resolution, fully-programmable non-mechanical beamsteerers with good optical efficiency do not exist forcing system developers to use mechanical systems for controlling the field of view of an optical system. This proposal offers a means to correct this deficiency. Recent advances in VLSI foundry processes have made possible high-resolution, light-efficient backplanes capable of driving electro-optic modulators with high-voltage signals. The high-voltage signals provide the excitation to achieve sub-millisecond response times with a wave of phase modulation. By combining high-speed phase modulators with high-voltage VLSI backplanes, compact spatial light modulators become available for the various applications that need this type of performance such as optical signal routing or beamsteering, active diffractive optics and adaptive wavefront correction.",

The most advanced SLM is our 512x512 pixel multi-level SLM that can operate at frame rates exceeding 1000-Hz.

However, physical access to samples is often difficult and time-intensive, and laboratory testing is expensive.  This project will utilize conductive composites of wire and cable insulation material to provide a simple, non-destructive, in-situ electrical measurement correlating to the age-related degradation of the insulation, thereby providing an indication of the remaining life of the cable.

In Phase II, high power (50-100MW) measurements of the electrical properties of various ferrite materials will be made.  Based on those measurements, a design for a prototype 50-100MW TE01 based circulator will be completed.  This design will then be built and tested to its maximum power level.                 Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The circulator technology should have direct applications for pulse compressors for high-power radars and medical accelerators.  The technology should also find application in development of components for W-band radar and industrial heating that are not available using current technology.",

In addition, sample data from model fluids will be used to both illustrate the functionality of the CaBER and to highlight the broad applicability of the instrument. Ongoing developments of the CaBER include more robust software analysis, cheaper manufacturing costs and a more intuitive user interface. These improvements will result in an instrument that is invaluable to industry in both a research laboratory and a process control environment. Currently there is only one commercially available extensional rheometer and a handful of academic rheometer designs.

The overall objective of ADEPT development is to enhance patient care in Special Care Units (SCUs) through the further development and testing of a computerized, self-directed, training toot for Nurse Aides (NAs) which enhances their capacity to provide high quality support to patients in the core ADLs of bathing, dressing, and eating.  The underlying philosophy for ADEPT development is to apply the principles and methods of human factors engineering (HFE) to the improvement of care for patients with dementia.  The major HFE method to be implemented is task analysis to model patient activities in each ADL, and to identify the requirements associated with successful performance of each task.  ADEPT allows caregivers to identify those task performance elements that require assistance and provides recommendations for appropriate intervention strategies.  This approach enhances the independence of elders, fostering their ability to maintain/retain functioning to the maximum level at which they are capable or motivated to achieve.  Furthermore, the tool provides the health care industry with a method for appropriately training staff to match the capabilities and limitations of the elderly with appropriate care provided by Nurse Aides.  The Phase I ADEPT project resulted in the development of a prototype tool that incorporated the dressing ADL.  ADEPT-It will build on this by improving the prototype toot, increasing it's usability and interactivity by subjecting the tool to usability testing with prospective users, and extending its application by incorporating the eating and bathing ADLs.

        "abstract": "65020      Although, there is an abundant supply of methane in natural gas, the costs of transporting it are very high; therefore converting the gas into a highly desirable value added product would result in enormous benefits.  Because methane is a very stable molecule, this project will utilize a catalytic approach for its conversion into a high-tech material, graphite nanofibers.  These solids would be suitable for use in a variety of applications, including electronic materials as well as energy storage and generation devices.  Phase I demonstrated that high conversions of methane could be achieved by catalytic partial oxidation into a mixture of CO and H2 and that the decomposition of equivalent CO/H2 mixtures could generate highly crystalline nanotubular structures.  A preliminary economic evaluation of the process indicated that these materials can be produced at relatively low cost.  In Phase II, the two processes, partial oxidation and carbon nanostructure synthesis, will be integrated, and the effect of impurities present in both natural gas and the purification processes will be evaluated.  Finally, in collaboration with industrial partners, a pilot plant for the large-scale production of carbon nanostructures from natural gas will be constructed.            Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Carbon nanostructures should have applications ranging from anti-static shielding to advanced energy.  The high production costs, which have hampered commercial implementation in the past, could be overcome by the use of natural gas as the source of solid carbon.  A further advantage is that the hydrogen, which is formed in the process, could be used as an energy source for electricity generation using fuel cells.",

While small research crystals can be obtained routinely by cooling a lead-based flux, large crystals suitable for incorporation into PET instruments are not readily grown. However, by introducing a proprietary, environmentally benign solvent developed to replace the lead-based flux, we believe high temperature solution (HTS) growth or top seeded solution growth (TSSG) could be the key to commercial production of large Ce:LOP crystals. The temperature and composition range for phase stability of Ce:LOP was investigated as part of the Phase I research program in order to define a robust production technology. Since the new solvent system can be applied to the growth of all REOP crystals, some of which have application as ultraviolet, visible, and infrared lasers, a commercial source of REOP crystals could ultimately lead to other new or improved medical instruments. The partial phase diagram derived from the temperature/composition study shows that Ce:LOP can be grown over a wide temperature range.

In Phase I,the feasibility of a turbine burner that is compact, lightweight, durable, has low pressure loss, and rapidly mixes fuel and air was demonstrated through a combination of cycle analyses and CFD calculations. In Phase II, the turbine burner will be designedfor the requirements of an existing engine through a collaboration with Allison Advanced Development Corporation (AADC). CFD Research Corporation will also collaborate with Williams International during Phase II. Turbine burner concepts will be optimizedthrough systems studies, cycle analyses, mission studies, CFD analyses, and prototype cascade experimental tests at full scale pressure and temperature. At the end of Phase II, the turbine burner technology will be at a TRL of 3 to 4, and detailed planswill be made for demonstration of a turbine burner in a turbine demonstrator rig at AADC and/or Williams in Phase III that will extend the technology to TRL 5 to 6.\"",

The overall goal of the proposed study is to design, fabricate and test an improved pediatric spacer with optimal drug delivery patterns. During Phase I a sophisticated CFD analysis was used in combination with in-vitro experiments to identify specific design characteristics favorable/(un) favorable for overall drug delivery. Based upon the simulations a novel spacer was designed which used purely geometrical changes that (a) reduced drug deposition in spacer (b) increased emitted drug in the respirable range (c) lowered velocity of the emitted drug. The improved performance was confirmed through in-vitro experimental comparisons between the prototype spacer and several commercial spacers. In Phase II, the CFDRC spacer design will be further optimized using more advanced computational techniques, followed by manufacture of prototypes for more sophisticated and rigorous bench-top testing, clinical tests of the fully optimized spacer, and preparation for Phase Ill commercialization.  \nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:\nThe improved design(s) developed in this study will have a direct impact on the 40-50 million asthma/allergy patients in the U.S. alone.

The majority of HRV serotypes bind ICAM-1 on nasal epithelial cells as the initial step in the infectious cycle: therefore preventing HRV from binding to ICAM-1 should prevent HRV attachment and thereby either prevent or shorten the duration and decrease symptoms of existing colds. A human clinical trial using intranasal administration of an anti-ICAM whole antibody delayed the onset of colds by up to 2 days and decreased symptoms 50% but failed to prevent initial infection, It is now known that the antibody CAM-1 dissociation rate is similar to that of the HRV virion itself indicating that the antibody has no innate advantage in functional affinity over the virus in occupying available receptors. We have generated a tetravalent humanized antibody against ICAM-1 for the prevention and treatment of human rhinovirus (HRV) infections. This protein shows significant functional improvement over the monodonal antibody and it can be produced in bacteria at much lower cost. The goals of the proposed phase II study is to fully characterize the biological, physical and chemical properties of the tetravalent anti-ICAM antibody, optimize the production process, establish quality control assays and to optimize the nasal spray formulation.

For example, a SESAME equipped robot can quickly build a low-resolution 3-D model of a row ofcars, automatically detecting occupied spaces, then approach a specific car and build a high-resolution model from a few stereo snapshots. This can be used onboard to determine the type of car and locate its license plate, or the high-resolution model canbe segmented out and sent back to an operator who can view it from a person-height viewpoint rather than robot height. As new views of the scene are obtained, the model is updated and changes are tracked (such as cars arriving or departing). Since therobot's position must be accurately known, we also present techniques for determining the position and orientation of the camera with respect to existing maps. We will deliver SESAME as an integrated system capable of near-real-time operation.\"",

However, there is a difficulty with getting studnets to work together in specific areas in large numbers, as bringing them together is very prohibitive. To encourge students collaboratiton, Cybernet proposes to develop, deploy, and evaluate a virtual reality based modeling kit that will enable students to collaboratively build, co-habit, and present virtual models of the solar system within a web-based inquiry framwork. Cybernet, collaborating with top researchers at the University of Georgia, is uniquiely qualified to develop this system based on their years of experience with virtual reality, distance learning and human-computer interaction. We believe that this instructional approach and base technolgoy will open up an entirely new mode of instruciton that will be extendable to many other mathmatics, science, and technology domains. For the Phase II effort, we will enhance our eduational Phase I contacts, expand the user interface, complete ther terrain system, and implement full testing, evaluation, and enhancement to lead the full pre-prodction prototype of the system.",

Two types of AR coatings were identified with great commercial potential.For display screens, combination sol-gel Ormosil/sputtered TiN systems have performance comparable to existing all-sputtered commercial products, at a significantly lower cost.  Sol-gel Ormosils/titanium oxide AR systems for resin (ophthalmic) lenses andother applications exhibit qualities similar to the AR coatings deposited by sputtering.  In Phase II, we will continue work on both systems.  Development of sol-gel Ormosils/sputtered TiN AR coating systems on plastic films will be with an industrypartner.  Sol-gel Ormosils/Titanium oxide AR coating systems will be optimized for ophthalmic lens applications, as well as for non-CRT display substrates, with another strategic partner.

However, the operational advantages of this acousticsuperiority are only realized if the towed array system is available to support the mission requirements.  The primary focus of this SBIR is to improve the operational availability (Ao) of the towed arrays currently in the US Navy's inventory.  Based onthe conclusions of the Phase 1 contract two design improvements are to be developed, prototyped and evaluated: 1) Vibration Isolating Tow Cable (VITC), and 2) Improved Array Coupler.  The VITC integrates the functions of the Vibration Isolation Modules andthe tow cable to obtain a single assembly that serves both purposes. The benefits are improved vibration attenuation performance, lower system cost and higher reliability.  The Improved Array Coupler distributes the functions performed by the coupler andthus reduces the rigid body length of that critical component.  The benefits are improved array reliability and lower recurring cost.  Both of these products have \"Dual Use\" applications to the seismic industry, creating a larger market and furtherreducing production costs.BENEFITS: The anticipated benefits are improved towed array system robustness and reliability, better performance, and lower system-level costs with minimal design changes",

The system will consist of a rugged, compact instrument with low mass and low power consumption, and a proteomics biosensor chip array integrated into a microfluidics cartridge.

The objective of this effort is to develop generic capture microarrays that will allow for the site-directed self-assembly of tailor-made, user-defined high-density multi-component assay chips. This is accomplished by immobilizing a library of short oligonucleotide PNA (peptide nucleic acid) probe molecules on a chip in a site-specific manner using covalent attachment chemistry and a spotting method. Capture molecules that will compose the array are tagged (off-line) with a library of complementary PNA sequences. Then, the microarray is assembled by flowing the complex mixture of different PNA-tagged compounds over the chip, which through hybridization reactions, form site-directed self-assembled arrays. A set of microarrays will be produced and a complementary set of protein-PNA conjugates relevant to microgravity research.",

The site will direct health information seekers via a structured approach to assist them in defining their SA/MH information needs and then using these needs to find appropriate websites.  Websites are cataloged in a database indexing ownership or authorship disclosure, purpose, standards met, language support, and user experience. The guide will also catalogue support for features such as Q&A, bulletin boards, chat, news, MEDLINE searches, email lists, and screening forms.  Users will be able to provide structured feedback on the listed sites to other health information seekers as well as to the website developer. The guide could be used to help developers of existing and future SA/MH websites enhance and improve their content. In Phase I we created and evaluated a prototype site that indexes Internet resources on the topic of alcohol and alcoholism. Phase II will extend the site to a broad range of topics in substance abuse and mental health and evaluate the site's utility for both consumers and physicians.",

        "abstract": "The expanding field of molecular genetics has quickly outpaced the knowledge of medical providers, due in part to the Human Genome Project. The genetics of brain illnesses are only beginning to be understood, nevertheless, providers treating patients with mental health, substance abuse and neurological disorders need to understand clearly what is and is not known about genetics and brain illnesses. It is likely that genetic aspects of schizophrenia, autism, mental retardation, bipolar disorder, among others, will be further identified in the near future, creating confusion and difficult choices for patients and families. Current and future providers must be prepared to explain and understand genetic susceptibility as it applies to a full range of illnesses. In Phase I, we will develop and evaluate an Internet-based CE program focusing on genetic issues related to alcoholism. We will also use the course the discuss upcoming technologies as well as issues related to discussing genetic risk with a patient. Phase II will produce 7 additional course on a variety of topic related to illnesses of the brain including Mixed Substance Abuse, Alzheimer's Disease, Schizophrenia, Affective Disorders, Attention Deficit, Huntington's Disease, and Mental Retardation. For each course we will highlight: 1) how genetic knowledge may affect patients and be used in clinical practice; 2) communication of genetic knowledge with patients and families: preparing for patients' questions; 3) where relevant, ethical, legal and psychosocial issues related to genetic testing, and 4) understanding emerging technologies and findings in genetics. A multidisciplinary team including representatives from psychiatry, genetics, genetic counseling, and primary care will create the content. We will evaluate the courses' effect on knowledge, clinical skills and self-efficacy using simple randomized studies comparing subjects using the genetics course to subjects using an online CE course on another topic. If successful, the training will expand the capabilities of the existing pool of providers and improve the training of future providers regarding the role of genetics in illnesses of the brain. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Physicians are required to obtain CME credit to maintain licensure and privileges. Managed care organizations (MCOs), such as large HMOs, may be interested in purchasing access to CE that can be offered to participant professionals. Pharmaceutical companies may also want to support development of courses based on the model described in this application.",

Protocols for childhood leukemia involve multiple cycles of chemotherapy that can be administered at home. However, the proper administration of these potentially life-saving medications in the home is a safety issue. Pediatric Cancer CareLink will support the care of these children by helping their parents manage medications, side effects of treatment, and potential complications. Pediatric Cancer CareLink will provide families with a direct link to the oncology team responsible for their child's care. In our Phase I research we identifed clinician and patient requirements for Pediatric Cancer CareLink. We determined that families and clinicans would be likely to use the Internet-based support system and that they believed the system would provide benefits and advantages compared with not having the system available. In Phase II our primary objectives will be to evaluate whether parents with access to Pediatric Cancer CareLink are more comfortable with managing their child's medications and medication side effects at home, and whether they report a higher level of satisfaction with the overall outpatient care that their child receives, than are parents without access to CareLink. We will also evaluate whether patients with access to Cancer CareLink report less at home medication errors or missed medication doses, than do patients do not have access to CareLink. Twenty parent volunteers who do not have access to Pediatric Cancer CareLink will be asked to complete two questionnaires at 2 months and 6 months into their child's therapy. Results from these questionnaires will be compared with the same questionnaires from twenty parent volunteers at 2 months and 6 months into their child's therapy, who do have access to Pediatric Cancer CareLink. Pediatric Cancer CareLink will provide families a direct, secure Internet care support channel to their cancer care team. This innovative system will empower providers and families to improve care processes and outcomes for children with ALL. PediatricCancer CareLink will serve as a model for enhancing care processes and outcomes for patients and families dealing with other forms of cancer and with other treatment regimens.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are associated with, and may be predictors of diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and cancer. In Phase I, we discovered novel and selective substrates for the MMP collagenase 3, an enzyme implicated in OA and cancer progression. Substrates were obtained by modifying sequence data gained from substrate mapping on protein expression libraries in phage lambda (phage display). We will extend this study to include other MMPs that are potential disease markers for not only OA and cancer, but also RA, so that we may obtain a profile of activities for a specific disease state. Phage display results are reported for stromelysin 1, gelatinase A and gelatinase B while a synthetic peptide library was used to determine the substrate specificity of collagenase 1. One goal is to use this knowledge to develop an \"assay\" kit that can measure these MMP activities directly in biological fluids. We will develop this kit by using two approaches: fluorescence substrates that are selective for the above MMPs, and neo-epitope antibodies to the protein fragments generated by collagenase 3 and/or gelatinase B cleavages. This \"assay\" kit can then be used in arthritis and cancer by assessing disease progression.",

        "abstract": "\"Recent world events highlight the need for portable, robust, standoff sensors that can provide early warning of chemical and biological attacks.  Sensors are needed to provide search, detect, track and identification functions.  Differential absorptionlidar (DIAL) has been demonstrated as one of the most promising techniques for standoff identification of chemical agents.  However, to date, these sensors utilize CO2 laser transmitters which are large, cumbersome, not highly robust, have difficultyaccessing certain critical wavelengths, output nonideal pulse formats and have significant prime power requirements.  The proposed work will develop an innovative optical parametric oscillator (OPO) based laser transmitter capable of replacing these CO2lasers.  The end goal is a DIAL sensor suitable for use in civilian, military installation and battlefield settings; man and UAV portable; efficient enough to run off battery power; and capable of providing chemical identification functions with minimalfalse alarm rates and no false negatives.  Advantages of the proposed transmitter over competing solid-state laser technologies include (1) an innovative, power-scalable, mass-manufacturable, patent-pending drive laser technology, (2) afrequency-conversion architecture enabling very high optical efficiency, (3) an electronic tuning scheme that provides rapid OPO wavelength selection and (4) a patent-pending bandwidth selection technique enabling",

A significant barrier to using composites in these applications involves processing limitations with respect to part size and volume. Processing routes utilizing chemical vapor deposition/infiltration (CVD/CVI) require high-temperature pressure reactors and rely on time/temperature dependent diffusion. As a result, CVD/CVI facility reactor dimensions limits the maximum part size while process physics limit the practical thickness/volume of parts to be infiltrated. Polymer infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) processing may overcome such limitations. Although significant development has been done in the PIP processing of SiC/SiC systems, little work has been done with PIP C/SiC CMCs. Insufficient data and material properties exist for PIP processed thick cross section parts, which has hindered acceptance and application of this process. The work proposed here provides a baseline mechanical property database for PIP processed C-SiC CMCs, and provides the initial evaluation of thick section composites processed using the PIP approach and incorporating the latest advancements in process cost and schedule reductions.",

Optimization of solar sail booms may result in significant mass reductions, which could in turn boost the mass budget of the ultra-thin sail films. This could in turn cause significant cost savings and risk reduction due to the fact that more material can be applied to the sail to make it more robust. Phase I will focus on mass and load study, sail and boom interface issues, and stowing configurations. In addition, a small proof-of-concept sample will be fabricated tested.

The unique innovation of the DSC is to take advantage of the changes in apparent solar width, and use a concentrator with limited acceptance angle to reduce the light transmitted to the solar cell at near-sun conditions, when the apparent solar disk angle and collimation angle is large, and transmit more solar energy to the solar cell when at far-sun conditions, when the apparent solar disk size and collimation angle is small. In the Phase I SBIR, we demonstrated the basic operation of the Deep Space Concentrator through optical and thermal analysis and the fabrication and test of a Demo Model.

NASA has identified CMCs as the only materials that will meet the combination of increased safety, reduced cost, and reduced weight as operational temperatures climb to higher levels (per AeroMat 2000 Annual Conference, June 2000). The current UEET (Ultra Efficient Engine Technology) initiative at NASA is looking at components such as combustor liners and vanes in particular. In light of these needs, this Phase II SBIR proposal addresses lightweight, high temperature, and low cost CMCs for engine and propulsion applications, particularly in the temperature range of 1200-1400C. The work specifically addresses the optimization of a hybrid PIP/MI SiC fiber-reinforced SiC-matrix composite (SiC/SiC). Effort will focus on using SiNC- and SiC-yielding preceramic polymers and a combination of PIP and melt-infiltration processing routes that will reduce the cost and time for producing SiC/SiC composites compared to traditional CVI/MI processing. The intent of this work is to refine and optimize the PIP/MI process developed in Phase I, generate a database of thermal and mechanical properties, and demonstrate fabrication capability of subcomponents. The innovation of this work lies in the ability of PIP processing to protect the fibers and interphase coating in a uniform manner compared to the CVI process, resulting in faster and less expensive processing as well as less variability in material properties.",

Our goal is to develop a simple, safe and inexpensive, topical vaccine delivery system that targets dendritic cell precursors in the epidermis called Langerhans cells.  Lancell's approach is to deliver antigen to large numbers of Langerhans cells and induce them to migrate to draining lymph nodes where they can activate naive T cells.  In Phase I, we developed a quantitative assay that is sensitive and directly measures immunogenic peptides associated with Langerhans cells after their migration to skin draining lymph nodes.  The proposed Phase II studies will optimize each parameter of our vaccine delivery system for the induction of tumor immunity in a murine model system.\n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nNearly 1.5 million new cases of cancer are diagnosed in the U.S. annually, and virtually all of these patients are candidates for an effective tumor immunotherapy.

For over four years NIA has supported The ACTIVE (for Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly) Study to show that group-based cognitive intervention can help reduce disability, delay nursing home placement and improve quality of life in later adulthood. Alternative modes of cognitive intervention for the elderly are needed and can be as effective as in vivo group-based interventions like ACTIVE. The Web is a new mode of distance learning for older adults that promotes social interchange, via E-mail and online Chat, an important concomitant of late life learning and a deterrent to loneliness among the elderly.  \n\nThis study examines the effectiveness of individualized Web memory training via MemoryUniversity.com.  As in ACTIVE, we will assess the effect of our cognitive intervention on \"proximal\" outcome measures directly related to memory performance in everyday life and \"distal\" measures more strongly associated with hospitalization and need for formal care. Phase II aims: 1) produce Web courses offering a curriculum focused on memory improvement, including background information, strategy training assessment, and practice components; 2) assess the acceptability and functionality of the Web site among older adults; 3) test the efficacy of the courses in changing older adults' knowledge, attitudes, and intended behaviors toward memory enhancement specifically, and quality of life more generally.  \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nThe On-Line Memory University memory skill training courses is for individuals via the Practical Memory Institute (PMI), and PMI mini-sites at membership organization web sites e.g., Novarti's HealthAndAge.com, AARP.org, SeniorNET.org, ThirdAge.com etc.; 2) to corporate and governmental organizations via license to Global Learning Systems, Inc.; 3) to online seniors at assisted living facilities (e.g., LinkAges.org & Sunrise Assisted Living); 4) to Professional memory trainers via APA's Div 20; and 5) rehabilitation professionals at the VA, Society of Cognitive Rehabilitation, American Speech Language Hearing Assn.",

        "abstract": "65445     Consumption of diesel fuel and gasoline have led to significant dependence on foreign fuel as well as increased carbon dioxide emissions with the associated concern for global warming.  Diesel engines are much more fuel efficient than spark/gasoline engines, but unfortunately diesel engines produce high NOx emissions.  This has been addressed by a process known as exhaust gas recycle (EGR), which lowers NOx emissions by 50%; however, it also reduces engine life and puts significant stress on the cooling system.  This project will utilize high productivity membranes in a combination with modest engine design changes to produce nitrogen-enriched air (cold/clean ERG) with overall NOx emissions reduced by 85% and little change in other emissions.  The productivity from these membranes is sufficiently high to allow systems to be placed under the hoods of trucks.  Using a single cylinder engine, Phase I demonstrated that the synergy of nitrogen enriching membranes and the unique combustion process can lead to 80-90% NOx reduction with no significant change in other emissions.  In parallel, a viable route to large-scale membrane manufacture was established.  Phase II will improve the membrane fabrication and engine design.  The combustion process will be assessed over the full engine map and validated as a system.            Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The initial commercial focus will be for heavy duty diesel trucks that can meet the EPA regulation of 80-90% NOx reductions.  Passenger vehicles should be a second tier opportunity.",

        "abstract": "Diesel generator sets (gen-sets) are used routinely to supply electrical power. Hospitals, businesses, and small communities use gen-sets to help reduce costs by load leveling and provide emergency power during blackouts (either scheduled or unscheduled). Recent power outages in California have led to large increases in the purchase of gen-sets, primarily for providing emergency power. In addition to providing value associated with load leveling and emergency power, gen-sets have an added value in that they can be installed relatively rapidly. Although gen-sets are, in principle, under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation, many of these gen-sets are being rapidly installed with minimal concern for EPA emissions and exclusively focus on providing back-up power to avoid blackouts. The net effect of these events should be an increase in air pollutants (mostly NOx) as these gen-sets are brought online.  In Phase I, Compact Membrane Systems, Inc. (CMS) met and exceeded all project goals. This included: (1) demonstration of 50 percent NOx reduction while having minimal effect on other pollutants, (2) fabrication of prototype membrane systems/devices for easy installation or retrofit into diesel generators, and (3) enhanced overall membrane/system performance to perform better even when only low turbo pressure is available. This success has led to the active participation in the project of a major industrial gas membrane company, a major diesel generator company, the U.S. Navy, and a major university. The participation of these groups will enhance Phase II and subsequent commercialization. In Phase II, CMS will design and build full-size retrofit kits and install them on intermediate-scale diesel generators (e.g., 1,500 kw). Working with their diesel generator partner, CMS will modify turbocharger operating conditions and engine operating conditions to reduce NOx emissions and have a minimal effect on particulate emissions. Working with their industrial gas partner, CMS will optimize membrane design to match engine needs. The company also will demonstrate performance over an extended period of time to show system ruggedness. CMS will perform an economic evaluation to demonstrate that the retrofit system is cost effective compared to alternative systems.",

Currently available insulation systems either will not meet these requirements, or will compromise the magnet system design or economics to such an extent as to make them unfeasible.  This project will develop new high-pressure laminate (HPL) hybrid organic and inorganic insulation systems, providing high radiation resistance and enhanced cryogenic and elevated temperature performance.  In Phase I, new HPL hybrid organic and inorganic insulation systems were demonstrated to provide suitable processing and performance characteristics meeting NSO requirements.  Performance and processing criteria were developed for evaluating HPL insulation performance in fusion magnet systems.  HPL insulation systems were tested mechanically and electrically at 76 and 373 K.  In Phase II, the new HPL hybrid systems will be further optimized and characterized, before and after exposure to radiation, and validated for NSO applications.

Inherent in this use of wick injection is that the flow rate of propellant liquid, and thus the thrust level for a particular thruster, is determined entirely by the applied voltage without any need for additional flow rate control circuitry. Moreover, this inherent simplicity, relative to other colloidal propulsion systems, means that multiplexing of such wick injectors is simple and straight-forward so that any desired level of thrust over a wide range can be achieved simply by varying the number of these simple wick thrusters.

        "abstract": "\"In many applications of current and near-future interest, significant departures from Fourier's law are observed in the thermal conduction processes of engineering materials important to Army applications.  Such discrepancies may  result in inadequateprotection, excessive weight or premature hardware failure.  To correct this, non-Fourier conduction modeling can be exploited to optimize current design tools.  In particular, the dual phase lag (DPL) thermal model can be used to provide a very generaldescription for the thermal response of many materials both at the microscale and macroscale.  In Phase I, we successfully developed a 1D DPL model and demonstrated potential thermal lag problems with a rocket nozzle design.  In Phase II, we propose to:(i) develop a 3D finite element model of the DPL equation; (ii) construct an easy-to-use graphical interface to simplify problem set up; (iii) interface the DPL model with the ABAQUS finite element software; and (iv) conduct experiments to determine thephase lags for selected materials used by the Army.  Successful completion of this effort will provide the Army with the software and material data necessary to analyze rapid thermal transients in rocket nozzles, and heat transfer in various applicationssuch as nanotechnology, laser technology, and MEMS.\"",

New SMA device technology will allow improved performance for diverse rotorcraft operating conditions while drawing minimal steady-state power, and will be the enabling technology for a family of adaptive rotor designs for next generation MRCs.

Micro- as well as macro-scale devices with applications on micro air vehicles, unmanned vehicles, jetliners, and over the road vehicles such as tractor-trailer trucks can be developed.

Among the challenges in enabling high-volume terminal area RIA operations are identifying potential hazards of this flight regime and developing simulation technology for a complex aeromechanical environment involving the interaction of multiple types of air vehicles (e.g, RIA, fixed-wing,V/STOL). Fast, high-fidelity full-vehicle aeromechanical models and simulation tools are thus needed for RIAs that may be used in such roles. To meet this need, a suite of physics-based tools are being developed that capture challenging problems such as vortex wake encounters, modeling the airwakes of structures/terrain, ?self-interactions? such as vortex ring state, full vehicle gust response, and surface/ground vortex effects. Key technical innovations include novel fast viscous/turbulent wake decay methodologies tailored to RIAs, coupled with state of the art Real Time Free Wake simulation capabilities of CDI?s CHARM full-aircraft analysis.

Phase I laboratory results demonstrated that the new technology works in the laboratory and that critical laboratory variables can be determined from field data.  The oil recovered with surfactants varied from 15 to 640% of the oil recovered with reservoir water alone.  Artificial Intelligence was used to correlate well logs with core information.  The correlations were then used to develop pseudo porosity, bulk volume oil, bulk volume water, and aspect ratio logs of seven wells.  These pseudo-logs were then correlated with the average oil rate of the first 12 producing months indicating that the methodology may extend to the incremental oil resulting from field experiments.  In Phase II, the laboratory experiments will be scaled-up to field experiments.

The proposed software is designed to lead to an order of magnitude improvement over current methods in the estimation and detection of fMRI activation. \n\nThis phase II project has three main aims: 1. to extend the utilization of a optimal spatial filtering technique to increase the SNR in the fMRI signal; 2. to develop a computer-aided design tool to permit the creation of novel fMRI experiments; and 3. integration of this software into an integrated suite providing a wide variety of spatiotemporal measurements of human brain function from structural MRI, fMRI, EEG, and MEG. \n\nThe software will also incorporate methods to greatly increase the statistical power and reliability for detecting task-related physiological responses with fMRI, including the use of correlated noise compensation, and optimal spatial filtering. These methods will be applicable to both blocked and event-related paradigms. The software will generate optimal rapid-presentation event-related (RPER) fMRI designs. Such designs allow for new classes of functional imaging experiments and permit comparisons between fMRI and traditional electrophysiological or behavioral studies. \n\nThe software will be designed to be utilized within our suite of MRI software tools. In particular, the results will be able to be presented on flattened and inflated cortical surfaces for superior visualization. The area of multi-modal brain imaging will be greatly advanced by supporting event-related designs and cortical surface formats within a single computational platform.  \nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:\nThe proposed would be of interest to researchers using functional MRI, i.e., well over 1000 worldwide and growing rapidly. The proposed software will increase the functionality of fMRI by at least 20% but we propose to sell it for only about 0.1% of the fMRI equipment cost. Put another way, the proposed software could have the number offMRI sessions needed to achieve a given level of significance, and thus would play for itself after a single study.",

However, many of the monitoring points in today's electrical grid provide incorrect data due to faulty wiring, poor equipment performance, or lack of utility resources to process raw sensor data. In addition, many sensors are needed to replace aging instrument transformers, equip new generation plants, and monitor new locations within the transmission and distribution grids. The installation of new sensor technology should require as little infrastructure change as possible, in order to minimize total cost.  This project will develop a low maintenance, self-powered, clamp-on power interface pod for metering, for identifying incipient equipment failure, and for power quality processing.  It will rely on wireless communication to interface with a centralized control center, specific equipment at a distributed energy resource, and individual consumers.  In Phase I, the voltage monitor, current monitor, and power supply for the clamp-on sensor pod were evaluated, and a viable scheme for achieving 0.3% accuracy class for both voltage and current was developed.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nursing home industry has come under increasing pressure to contain costs and improve quality. We propose to develop a software product that will enable managers of nursing home chains or managers of individual facilities to perform comparative evaluations of the performance of nursing homes. With this product, they will be able to use public data on cost, utilization, and quality to find out how they rate compared to their peers and then set targets for improvement. The software product will be based on Data Envelopment Analysis, a mathematical technique for comparing \"decision-making units\" using several performance measures. Although Data Envelopment Analysis has been applied to the nursing home industry as a research tool, we propose to make Data Envelopment Analysis an operational tool, accessible to people with little knowledge of the underlying technique. In Phase I, we built a prototype of this product as a spreadsheet add-on and used it to experiment with data from nursing homes in Massachusetts. Based on this experience, we developed a methodology for guiding users through the various steps of the analysis. We propose now to develop a nationwide database of state and federal data on nursing homes along with a full-fledged software product incorporating our methodology.",

A representative example of this type of system, and the primary focus of the proposed Phase 2, is the DART telescope concept currently being advanced at JPL. Of immediate interest are multi-degree-of-freedom parallel actuator hexapod systems that can be used to adjust the orientation of the two primary reflectors relative to one another in the presence of manufacturing, deployment, and on-orbit disturbances. The desirability and feasibility of such systems was established in the course of Phase 1 activities. In Phase 2 we propose the continued development and hardware demonstration of hexapods with asymmetric attachment planes and suchsystems capable of functioning at the cryogenic temperatures required for infrared science as well as laying the groundwork for scaling up to on-orbit implementation.

To eliminate this problem and to provide a path for growth into the future, NASA needs to start afresh and obtain a new generation of analysis tools that take advantage of modern software technologies and computational environments. A new analyzer would not have size limits, it would be extensible with custom thermal objects, and would provide analysis techniques such as adaptive nodalization that do not exist in present tools. A new analyzer would provide for distributed computation, concurrent engineering and easy integration with, or embedding into, other tools. It would accept input diverse sources and would provide multiple forms of output and results analysis. It would not require a third party compiler for a simple analysis and would easily communicate with widely used tools such as Microsoft's Excel and Word. A new analyzer would have built-in case management for handling sets of related models and tracking the dependencies between these models.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term objective of this research is to establish ultrasound as a safe, effective, and non-invasive method for assessing fracture risk, an important component in clinical management of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis afflicts over 20 million people in the U.S., responsible for more than 275,000 hip fractures annually. Currently, the primary means for assessment relies on densitometric techniques. These methods subject the patient to ionizing radiation, are relatively expensive, and do not always provide good estimates of bone strength. Ultrasound offers several potential advantages. It is non-ionizing and relatively inexpensive. Moreover, since ultrasound is a mechanical wave and interacts with bone in a fundamentally different manner than electromagnetic radiation, it may be able to provide more accurate estimates of bone strength compared with current densitometric methods. \n\nThe goal of this research is to significantly improve the effectiveness of current ultrasonic bone assessment techniques by demonstrating the feasibility of a new ultrasonic system to assess bone. The system employs a novel parametric signal processing approach which is ideally suited for analog and real-time implementation. Thus this research may enable less expensive and easier to use ultrasound devices, which are also less sensitive to various experimental artifacts. The specific aims are to measure a set of new ultrasonic parameters and compare them with presently used features, namely BUA and ultrasound velocity, in calcaneal bone samples. A comparison will be made of their respective capabilities to estimate bone density and bone strength. This comparison will include cost, ease of use, and accuracy and precision of the bone density and bone strength estimates. \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  Osteoporosis is a major health concern in the United States, afflicting over 20 million people, and whose incidence is increasing as the average age of the U.S. population increases.  An effective, relatively inexpensive and safe technique such as ultrasound for assessing osteoporosis would be an extremely emportant benefit to the patient population, and represents an enormous commercial opportunity. Ultrasound's importance will grow as various new pharmacologic agents are approved for treatment, thus requiring periodic assessments of efficacy.",

        "abstract": "The overall objective of this proposal is to develop a flow cytometry- based assay utilizing optimized flow cytometry instrumentation and cultured mammalian cells that can be routinely employed by pharmaceutical and other companies to measure the mutagenic potential of chemicals and drugs. The assay is based on a Chinese hamster ovary- human hybrid cell line, CHO AL, which contains human chromosome 11. The principal target for mutation is the gene for the CD59 antigen which is encoded on chromosome 11. The hypotheses are(1) that mutations in chromosome 11 can be detected accurately, sensitively and rapidly by flow cytometry measurement of the loss or presence of surface antigens encoded by chromosome 11 and (2) that this mutation assay system can be developed so that it could be used routinely to determine the genotoxicity of physical and chemical agents. Specific Aim 1 is to build a relatively inexpensive benchtop flow cytometer optimized for analysis of antigen loss in mammalian cells. Specific Aim 2 is to validate the flow cytometry assay for detecting mutations in CHO AL cells by measuring the mutation dose response from a panel of 25 physical and chemical agents at a range of doses. Independent studies will be done at an off-site laboratory. Specific Aim 3 is to extend the assay to include the analysis of intragenic and chromosomal mutations by measuring the presence or absence of multiple antibodies bound to different cell surface antigens encoded by separate genes on human chromosome 11.  The development of this assay system would allow for rapid, accurate, relatively cheap but informative screening of pharmaceuticals for genotoxicity and substantially reduce the cost of carrying out mutation analysis.",

The products will educate and inform children's peers about cancer, foster peer acceptance of children with cancer, and thereby promote the healthy psychosocial adjustment of children with cancer.  In Phase I of the project, the content of the three components will be developed in conjunction with a panel of experts in the field (practitioners, teachers and parents) and a stakeholder group of parents, children with cancer, and their peers.  In Phase II, we will film the video, write the guide and program the website.  The intervention package will then be subjected to an evaluation in classrooms to determine if classmates learn from the intervention and the child with cancer benefits.  Children with cancer have an increased risk for adjustment problems during the period of reentry to school.  By providing a multimedia intervention designed to create a supportive peer environment in the classroom, the frequency and severity of problems should diminish.  Once completed, the School Reentry Program will be marketed to schools, families and children.\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nPresently, no multimedia, integrated intervention package for elementary school-aged children\nwith cancer exists.  Once completed, the proposed School Reentry Program for Children with\nCancer will be marketed to diagnosed children, their families, and providers, as well as school\nsystems and relevant advocacy organizations.  Theses market segments will be reached \nthrough a combination of public relations opportunities and traditional marketing techniques\nsuch as direct mail, advertising, and creating distribution relationships with stakeholders in the\nfield.",

The software suite called \"Meals and Things\" (MAT) consists of two modules: (a) a meal planning and recording software module that operates on a hand-held device; and (b) a supporting customizable management module that operates on a  desktop PC (or commercial server). The final products will incorporate findings from a recent market test of the Phase I prototype. MAT seeks to help youths to adhere to their meal plans in order to facilitate better regulation of blood glucose and improve long-term medical outcomes. The final product will be examined with respect to: (a) its effectiveness to improve dietary self-management; (b) its impact on blood glucose regulation (HbA1 levels); and  (c) user's satisfaction. MAT will be tested in randomized trials with 50 recently diagnosed 8-13 year old children, using a pre-post-test design.

These creatures have evolved versatile techniques for mobility that can be mimicked by robots operating in complex unknown workspaces such as in rough debris fields or in diverse media such as water, sand, slush, or ice, as may be found on Mars or Europa. While we found a significant amount of prior research in related areas, it was confined to laboratory experiments in relatively benign environments, and none exhibited the ability of a mechanism to transition from one environment to another. For commonality of parts, our concept uses a single module design based on a three degree-of-freedom parallel kinematic linkage that is connected in series. The modules monitor their own specific orientations, which are then summed by a central processor. The vehicle's protective skin is one of the critical areas of innovation because it must resist abrasion and corrosion, yet be flexible and elastic. In Phase II, we will construct a working prototype, and conduct a series of experiments, both on the test bench and in the field, toward developing algorithms for locomotion.",

We will design and test a new generation of deep-sea craft that will substantially reduce costs of sample collection. These vehicles will require small to modest support vessels, be simple to operate, readily controlled and tracked, and have efficient communication systems. They will be unmanned, eliminating the risk of injury and the need to maintain a pressure hull. The room saved can be used for sampling and instrumentation.

        "abstract": "The use of tobacco represents a significant public health problem, with specific effects on oral tissue.  These effects provide dental health care workers (DHCWs) to help patients quit, yet, the majority of dental professionals cite lack of training as a barrier to providing these services.  There is a need for disseminable, empirically-validated tobacco education. Interactive computer-based programs can meet this need. The primary goal of the \"A Dental Education Program in Tobacco\" (ADEPT) project is to develop an interactive computer-based program to train DHCWs to provide brief, office-based tobacco cessation interventions to patients.  During Phase I, we developed and evaluated a prototype program.  During Phase II, we will completely revise the interactive training CD-ROM based on the evaluation data, develop and evaluate a hybrid program that combines the best features of CD-ROM and Internet technologies, and create a Digital Versatile Disk (DVD) version of the program. Our team has extensive experience in developing interactive training programs, tobacco education for dental health care workers, and creating and evaluating Internet-based health programs, uniquely qualifying us to conduct the research proposed herein. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: We will produce an interactive training program for 520 professional schools for DHCWs and for continuing education of the estimated 150,000 dentists, 100,000 dental hygienists, and 200,000 dental assistants in the United States.  The program will teach DHCWs to provide a brief, office-based tobacco cessation intervention to their patients in the context of oral health care. Though stand-alone CD- ROM and Internet delivery, this program meets the goals of professional organizations and training programs, and offers a unique opportunity to learn behavioral skills that are not currently offered.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a family of membrane proteins that mediate the biological actions of neurotransmitters and hormones and are a major target for pharmaceutical drug development. Of the top 200 best selling drugs, over 40 of them target GPCRs and those drugs generate over $20 billion. At least 5 percent of the Human Genome expresses receptors, the vast majority of which are orphan receptors for which functions and selective ligands have not been identified. These orphan receptors could provide an important new family of targets for drug development. However, there are few, if any, assays that can be successfully employed to identify drugs against these receptors. In our Phase I SBIR grant, we developed a cell-based assay that can detect GPCR activation using our proprietary CEDIA technology. Specifically, we developed an assay to measure receptor activation of NFkB/IkB signaling. The promiscuity of intracellular signaling pathways linked to NFkB/IkB signaling provides an ideal basis for an assay to measure orphan receptors. The objective of this Phase II SBIR grant is to develop this receptor assay to the point of commercialization. We will determine the breath of applicability of our GPCR assay to measure stimulation of receptors acting via different second messenger signaling pathways as well as measuring responses to orphan receptor activation. We will optimize our assay to be measured in HTS format. To expand the utility of our GPCR assay, we will adapt the assay to directly measure the translocation of NFkB to the nucleus as a response to GPCR stimulation so that the entire assay can be done in intact cells in a very simple and easy-to-use format. In addition to measuring responses to GPCR activation, our NFkB/IkB signaling assay measured the stimulation of growth factor receptor activation. In this grant we will develop and optimize our assay to measure responses to growth factors to commercialize the first HTS assay for growth factor receptor antagonists. The goal of DiscoveRx is to develop a suite of technologies that can aid in the discovery of a new generation of therapeutically important drugs that act upon the large family of orphan GPCRs and growth factor receptors.  \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: We will develop a HTS assay to discover drugs against the large family of orphan GPCRs.  This market is in the billions of dollars.  We will also be able to commercialize an assay for the large family of growth factor receptors which is a comparable size market.  Finally, our nuclear translocation assay will be commercialized as a GPCR screen, but will also have applications in the discovery of drugs against transcription factors and drugs to modify gene expression.",

Previous work has shown that gravitational changes can modify a variety of host cell-matrix interactions. Angiogenesis, an essential process for tissue growth and regeneration, is a coordinated process of activated endothelial cell proliferation and differentiation controlled by specific matrix and growth factor signals. However, little is known about the human angiogenesis process in microgravity, primarily due to the lack of defined functional models. We have created a new human biomatrix (Amgel) culture system which supports endothelial cell growth and function. This unique biomatrix simulates human cell morphogenesis only in the presence of specific modulators (FGF, VEGF). We now propose to employ this natural matrix to further develop an all-human angiogenesis model adaptable for microgravity studies. Endothelial cell cultivation models with controllable bioactivity utilizing Amgel-layered disk and microbead configurations will be evaluated in rotary culture systems. New 3-D bioassays, generated with GF-enriched matrix, would allow examination of both early mitogenic and late angiogenic events.

The novel phage display crystallization system is a high risk project that has a tremendous potential because the conditions for crystallization remain constant regardless of the protein molecule studied. The development of a multiple gene expression system, ?MaGEX,? for producing protein complexes also has a market that has drawn the interest and support of a premiere genetics company Athersys, Inc. for world wide commercialization. The development of the prototype MaGEX is required to implement the Trojan Phage technology. These products could result in a large number of proteins for structure determination which is synergistic with NASA?s Biological and Physical Research Enterprise that utilizes micro-gravitational effects to improve crystallization conditions. As part of the commercialization the systems would be offered as kits for expressing protein complexes recombinantly or for crystallization. In Phase I, we made significant progress in the construction of the MaGEX system which will be used to express the Trojan Phage. In Phase II, demonstration of the feasibility of this system to crystallize foreign proteins will begin.",

        "abstract": "65764    The Next Generation Linear Collider (NLC) will require 800 klystron modulators capable of providing 500 kV, 500 A pulses at 120 Hz.  The losses and non-ideal pulse characteristics inherent in currently available pulse transformers are a significant impediment to high performance, highly efficient modulator systems.  Further, modulator inefficiencies translate directly into increased operating costs.  This project will design, build, and assess a toroidal, low impedance pulse transformer for the NLC klystron modulators, which significantly improves on available designs.  Two full-scale designs will be constructed and tested with existing switch technologies, including a solid state switch.  Phase I analyzed the materials, design, and construction of a toroidal pulse transformer capable of achieving the NLC modulator requirements with high efficiency.  The design was assessed for cost, efficiency, and reliability within a NLC klystron modulator, and a full-scale, very high power, pulse transformer was designed for construction in Phase II.  Pulse transformer efficiency improvements of 20 \u00bf 50% (equivalent to overall power efficiency improvements of 3 \u00bf 10%) were shown to be realizable through this approach.  Two toroidal pulse transformers will be built and assessed in Phase II.  The first will be a quarter-scale model to verify the design and analysis and to demonstrate the commercial potential of this technology within the medical/industrial accelerator market.  Then, a full-scale NLC toroidal transformer will be built and tested at full NLC voltage and power at SLAC.                         Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Pulsed power systems are increasingly important to new materials modification and treatment processes, such as plasma source ion implantation.

The most demanding PCR reactions are especially dependent on a hot start. A heat switch can be added to PCR protocols by any of several manual or built-in methods, all of which have drawbacks, such as narrow conditions, extra expense, extra steps, prone to error, prone to cross-contamination, and/or lack of applicability to long PCR. We proposed to develop a Taq DNA polymerase mutant that is heat-switchable, which is much less active than the wild-type at room (reaction setup) temperature, yet normally active at 65-70 degrees, and still resistant to 95 degrees. \n\nIn Phase I we were able to isolate and initially characterize several mutants of Klentaq DNA polymerase that outperformed the parent enzyme in hot start PCR. We will test single amino acid changes found in these mutants to identify the ones that confer cold-sensitivity. We also plan to optimize the amino acid substitutions for each functionally significant mutation site. The best mutants will also be used to engineer cold-sensitive Taq DNA polymerase. Finally, we will purify mutant and combined-mutant enzymes to test their advantages in demanding PCR (short and long) that requires a hot start under a broad range of conditions.  \nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:\nHot-start methods for PCR more and more important to efficiency and reproducibility. An estimated 10-15% of the assays performed employ one of the current methods, with cost being a significant factor. Benefitting the most from hot start are forensic and diagnostic applications of PCR. Other important benefits are food and blood contamination PCR assays. All of these assays are rapidly growing areas and could benefically employ the proposed enzyme.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Improvements in signal to noise ratio (SNR) and ease of use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) RF coils are needed to improve image quality and patient throughput. The goal of this Phase II project is to continue the development of novel rf coil topologies and rf balancing circuits that have demonstrated substantially improved  technical performance, reduced cost, and greatly simplified tuning procedures. The success of the Phase I effort  demonstrated the unique contributions possible with our advanced, proprietary, simulation software and patented coil  technology. The circular polarization (CP) coils built and tested during Phase I demonstrated an improvement of a factor of 3 to 15 (depending on the reference CP technology) in tunability (ability to tune and match efficiently over a wide range of sample loading conditions at very high fields) for equivalent BI homogeneity. Also, much higher B1 homogeneity is maintained over the full range of load conditions. Substantial improvements were also achieved in signal to noise ratio (SNR) and passive Bo shimming, and further gains are expected here during Phase II. We denote these coils \"litzcages\", as they embody both paralleled conductor elements with insulated crossovers similar to that in our prior \"litz coil\" technology and capacitively segmented phase shifts and four-point drive to achieve highly stable circular polarization.  We have demonstrated feasibility of a quadrature, single-tuned, semi-open, passively shimmed rf litzcage with an axially asymmetric field profile. The Phase I saw the development and bench testing of numerous linear and CP litz coils, including one for human knee studies at 3 to 6 T, one for small-animal research at 500 MHz, one for single-resonance human head MRI at 3-4 T, and one for double-resonance human head MRI at 1.5 T.  The Phase II will continue with the development and field testing of quadrature single-resonance litzcages optimized for human head, knee, neck, and torso at 3-7 T, as well as smaller CP litzcages for animal research at the highest fields. Preliminary development of a 3 T double-resonance multinuclear 'HM head coil utilizing our linear litz  coils is also planned. The primary objective is to permit a substantial increase in MRI patient throughput (thereby reducing scan costs) via relatively inexpensive upgrades of head, knee, neck, and torso rf coils in existing high-field MRI scanners and/or to enable the more detailed diagnostic studies that are currently not practical because image acquisition time would be excessive. Field testing of a 3 T 'H head coil and a 3 T knee coil will begin early in Phase II at the Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA. The FDA approval process for head, knee, and neck coils will also  begin during the Phase II.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will refine the polymer matrix of glass fiber composites with ion exchangers in order to enhance their longevity in the alkaline environment of concrete. Glass fiber composites offer a desirable balance of performance and cost for replacement of corrosion-prone steel reinforcement in concrete; their rapid deterioration in the alkaline environment of concrete is, however, a major setback. Ion exchangers are insoluble solids carrying cations (or anions) which can be exchanged with ions of the same sign. Cation exchangers of hydrogen form replace alkali metal cations (e.g., K + in alkaline solutions diffusing into the polymer matrix) with H + . This exchange of cations neutralizes aggressive alkaline solutions by converting K + OH - (and Na + OH - , etc.) into H2O. Through laboratory investigations and industrial-scale pultrusion efforts, the Phase I research demonstrated that introduction of selected ion exchangers into the polymer matrix (or a surface layer of matrix) does not interfere with the pultrusion process, and yields significant gains in alkali resistance of glass fiber composites. The Phase I effort also established a theoretical context for selection of the dosage of cation exchanger in the polymer matrix of glass fiber composites, and verified the economic viability of our approach. The proposed Phase II project will: (1) develop refined theoretical principles and design procedures for formulation of polymer matrices with ion exchangers; (2) develop and experimentally verify optimum polymer matrix formulations incorporating ion exchangers; (3) optimize the pultrusion process of glass fiber composites with the refined polymer system, and fully characterize the end products; and (4) evaluate the structural performance and durability of concrete systems reinforced with refined glass fiber composite bars through comprehensive laboratory studies complemented with a field investigation involving design, construction and monitoring of a reinforced concrete bridge deck. The Phase II effort will receive critical support from major manufacturers of composite rebars (including Hughes Brothers, the world leader in this field), the leading supplier of ion exchangers (Dow Chemical), Michigan Department of Transportation, and Michigan Economic Development Corporation. Michigan State University (Composite Materials & Structures Center) will also take part in the proposed research effort.\nClose to one-third of reinforced concrete structures, including bridges, parking structures, buildings in coastal areas and offshore structures, are exposed to corrosive environments (deicer salt, seawater spray, etc.); domestic sales of steel for reinforcement of these concrete structures is about $2 billion/yr. Glass fiber composites embodying our technology are resistant to both corrosive effects and the alkaline environment of concrete; they offer a desirable balance of performance and cost to replace steel reinforcement in corrosive environments. Major savings in life-cycle cost can be realized at competitive initial cost through replacement of steel reinforcement with alkali-resistant glass fiber composites in concrete structures exposed to corrosive environments. Glass fiber composite jackets and sheets applied onto concrete surfaces for repair/rehabilitation purposes are also prone to attack by the alkaline pore solution of concrete, representing another market opportunity for our technology. We have filed a patent application, and have reached agreements with Dow Chemical (leading supplier of ion exchangers) and Hughes Brothers (world's leading manufacturer of composite bars for concrete reinforcement) towards transfer of the technology to marketplace",

This project will develop a ceramic rf power extractor as a simple device to meet this need.  In the ceramic rf power extractor, a train of high-charge electron bunches travels down the axis of a dielectric lined, circular metallic waveguide, radiating rf power into the ceramic tube.  The radiated power is then extracted from the ceramic tube and coupled to an output waveguide for subsequent use.  In Phase I, the properties of the rf power extractor were studied theoretically and numerically, and a ceramic power extractor capable of producing over 100 megawatts was designed.  The ceramic material was specified, fabricated, and tested for dielectric properties and conformity to specifications.  Fabrication and test plans for the ceramic rf power extractor were made.  Phase II will design and build a high-power (500 MW), high-efficiency (>95%) ceramic rf power extractor, and test it at a high-power test stand in a national laboratory.  As an intermediate goal, the 100 MW ceramic rf power extractor designed in Phase I will be built and tested for power handling and breakdown characteristics.

The MMMDS consists of two airborne, spatially separated, laser-pumped helium magnetometers capable of being processed in either single-signal mode, signal-differential (gradiometer) mode, or single-sensor with surface based referencesensor mode.  The DTI algorithms will operate in each of these modes, and will be designed to cancel much of the environmental noise present in both the magnetic anomaly detection (MAD) and extremely low frequency emission (ELFE) bands.  The environmentalnoises to be treated include those resulting from non-stationarity of the geomagnetic field, aircraft translation over subsurface magnetic anomalies, and buffeting through the geomagnetic gradient.  An adaptive noise cancellation module will also bedeveloped based on an algorithm derived by another project member.The proposed Phase II effort consists of four tasks, plus two options.  During the baseline effort DTI will develop a signal/noise simulator, perform system performance analyses, developprototype algorithms, and deliver a real-time processor design.  In the options, the algorithms will be evaluated using test data, and a real-time processor will be built.\"",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Liver disease remains a major challenge for accurate differential diagnosis. Several different types of lesions are commonly found in the liver. Liver is a prime focus for metastatic extension of numerous malignancies. Often, both benign and malignant lesions co-exist. It is critical for optimal treatment planning and follow-up to clearly differentiate each lesion type. Despite advances in technology, a large lumber of lesions are missed or incorrectly diagnosed. There remains a clear need for improved imaging 3gents that maximize the capabilities of rapidly evolving diagnostic technologies. Diagnosis of liver pathology using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) continues to be limited by the lack of a liver-specific imaging agent with a well-defined vascular phase. Eagle Vision Pharmaceutical Corp. is developing EVP-ABD, a manganese-based MRI agent, to address unmet needs for improved differential diagnosis of liver and abdominal diseases. Studies demonstrated the unique magnetic and kinetic properties of EVP-ABD provide high levels of enhancement for both blood vessels and liver. Additional studies have demonstrated a safety profile similar to marketed agents. These features should overcome limitations to the use of MRI for liver and provide better discrimination between various malignant and benign lesions. Such potential will be assessed in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Phosphoinositides are key lipid second messengers in cellular signaling. No approved diagnostics evaluate lipids as markers for cancer, but analysis of lipids in addition to protein and DNA may enhance overall accuracy of diagnosis and simultaneously suggest a molecular target for treatment. The tumor promoter phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) regulates protein trafficking, proliferation and differentiation, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis. Both PI 3-K and its lipid product PI(3,4,5)P3 are potential tumor markers for the early detection of cancer. PI(3,4,5)P3 accumulation is exacerbated by mutations in the tumor suppressor PTEN, a lipid 3-phosphatase. In Phase I, Echelon has demonstrated feasibility and developed reagents and assay platforms to measure PI 3-K activity and to measure lipid product PI(3,4,5)P3 in high-throughput microplate assays. In addition, we have developed and produced two monoclonal antibodies to PI(3,4,5)P3 that show striking results in immunodetection of PI(3,4,5)P3 in pathology samples from breast, ovarian, prostate, and colorectal cancers. In Phase II, we will validate our methods for identification of PI(3,4,5)P3 levels in drug discovery assays and in serum/cell extract detection formats. Anti- PI(3,4,5)p3, antibodies will be used for immunohistochemistry of cancer samples with known disease progression. The data will be analyzed quantitatively and used to establish protocols for human clinical trials to validate the prognostic value of these lipid markers for aggressive cancers. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Microplate assays for PI 3-K and PI(3,4,5)P3 quantification have value in research, clinical, and drug development settings. Systematic screening of cell extracts and pathology samples will allow rapid and early detection of an important molecular lesion in many cancers.",

Echo Technologies, Inc., completed a Phase I project that demonstrated a new approach for the identification of bacteria in aqueous systems. The approach uses bacteriophage as the molecular recognition element. Bacteriophage are virus particles that generally attach to and infect a narrow range of host cells. Biosensors based on this molecular recognition offer a rapid, selective, and potentially very sensitive method to detect bacteria and bacterial pathogens in potable and recreational waters.Feasibility of the concept was demonstrated by fabricating fluorescently labeled virus probes (FLVPs) to detect and identify bacteria for representative waterborne bacteria, including: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Vibrio natriegens bacteria. The preparation of FLVPs has been made quite reproducible. The adhesion to host cells is very rapid, good selectivity was demonstrated in samples with host cells and mixtures, and the response from a solid-phase FLVP biosensor was demonstrated. Several experiments were conducted with a customized detection system to demonstrate the feasibility of making a small in-line instrument capable of high-sensitivity detection. These cumulative results lay an excellent foundation for the Phase II development effort. In Phase II, a prototype rapid bacteria identification system will be designed, fabricated, and evaluated in the laboratory and at an independent test facility. The heart of the instrument will be an array of encoded FLVPs integrated with a charge coupled device (CCD)-based imaging/detection system. Application of the FLVP technology to solid-state optical sensing represents a new approach to real-time detection of bacterial pathogens. This approach will minimize the need for culturing to identify pathogens, and is an important departure from immunoassay- or DNA-based sensing concepts. The miniature probes are perfectly suited for incorporation in a sensor array for the simultaneous detection of many bacterial pathogens.",

A citrate synthase (CS) transgene was placed under the control of different plant promoters to overexpress the gene in roots. In Phase I, 100 lines of CS-transgenic tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum, were created and tested. Preliminary results with five hemizygous strains are promising, suggesting that higher-performing homozygous strains created at the end of Phase I may hyperaccumulate lead from soil (bioconcentration factor >1). Significantly, little soluble lead remained in the soil, indicating that the plants may successfully address leaching concerns. In Phase II, the highest performing transgenic lines will be demonstrated at a small arms firing range in Maryland and a residential site in Massachusetts. Phase II objectives also include concentrating lead in harvested plants to facilitate disposal or recycling, and mating transgenic lines of a proven lead-accumulating plant species, Brassica juncea.At many sites, applying rapidly biodegradable citric acid precisely at the root/soil interface where metal uptake occurs may eliminate the need for expensive chelating agents and liners. Attainment of the project's goals therefore may reduce the substantial public health hazard of soil lead by realizing phytoremediation's low-cost potential.",

Current technologies used to clean arsenic-contaminated water have significant drawbacks, such as high cost and generation of large volumes of toxic waste. Edenspace Systems Corporation proposes to create the basis for a cost-effective phytofiltration technology using a recently identified arsenic hyperaccumulating fern to remove arsenic from drinking water to concentrations below regulatory limits. Phase I research demonstrates that the fern can rapidly reduce arsenic concentrations in a variety of source waters, achieving levels less than the new USEPA drinking water limit of 10 mug/L. Phase II research will further explore the fern's arsenic removal capability by varying such important water treatment factors as arsenic valences, water pH, dissolved minerals including iron, sulfur, sodium and calcium compounds, chlorination/fluoridation, intensity and spectrum of light, and fern size and root density. The work will culminate in a continuous process demonstration conducted in collaboration with the City of Albuquerque, New Mexico and Virginia Department of Health.

The Virtual Workshops are to serve as comparable alternatives to traditional teacher-development programs when these traditional programs cannot be accessed or as supplementary materials for teacher-training courses. The focus of each Virtual Workshop will be on an empirically validated teaching routine that has been designed for delivering complex information in required subject-area courses. This project will result in inexpensive, effective, interactive professional development programs on CD ROMs for teachers. The Virtual Workshop will: (a) allow new teachers immediate access to training; (b) provide teachers timely access to state-of-the-art innovations available through the mail or on-line; (c) afford isolated teachers in poor or rural districts access to comprehensive professional-development experiences; (d) allow teachers to complete professional development activities at convenient times; (e) permit teachers to review the information whenever needed; and (f) furnish teachers access to the best professional developers in the nation. The CD ROM programs will feature instruction by experienced teachers in classrooms. The programs will be tested by local teachers. Experimental teachers (Virtual Workshop) will receive the CD ROM program and will implement the instruction. Comparison teachers (Actual Workshop) will attend a live workshop and will implement the instruction. Primary measures will include teacher knowledge of the program, teacher implementation of lessons, and teacher development of materials. A multivariate approach with multiple measures on the same subjects will be used. A pretest-posttest comparison-group design will be used to determine the secondary effects of the teachers' use of CD ROM program on student knowledge of key concepts related to each of the routines taught. The purpose will be to demonstrate that the CD ROM program prod uses at least equivalent results to the live training format. In addition, social validity of the program will be assessed.  \nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:\nThis project will result in inexpensive, effective multi-media professional development materials to enable teachers to deliver complex content to academically diverse classes. The products that will result from this project will be commercially published and distributed by Edge Enterprises and PRO-ED and marketed to teachers, administrators, and others nationally at approximately $40 each. This type of professional development package is not currently available and is particularly needed by isolated teachers, preserve teachers, and inexperienced teachers interested in providing barrier-free insturction for all students in inclusive classes.",

The objective is achieved by delivering abattery powered transceiver which provides communication through the dental bone conduction pathways of speech and hearing. This pathway is significantly less sensitive to ambient noise than communication systems used currently in extreme noiseenvironments. The communication system is called the Tooth Actuator Sensor or TAS Communication System. The novel components of the system are: (1)An intraoral battery powered transceiver capable of send and receive; (2) An actuator-sensor based on aninnovative design; (3) An extraoral transceiver capable of interfacing to a COTS two-way radio. The TAS should be capable of providing communication while on-the-run or under a wide variety of facemasks.\"",

All of the basic concepts were proven in the Phase I program, and feasibility was demonstrated. It was shown that a redox-active extractant can be dissolved in a water-immiscible, non-volatile, non-flammable alternative solvent, where it can be electrochemically oxidized to activate it for effective liquid-liquid ion-exchange extraction. The extractant is then electrochemically reduced, allowing recovery of the target ion in a small volume. There are issues remaining to be addressed for full-scale commercial application, including stability of the extractant phase, purification of used extractant phases, analysis of the simulants after extractions to determine if anything is added to them, selection of preferred anion- and cation-exchange membranes, extraction of other target ions, and use of more complex simulants and actual groundwater. In this program, a working prototype apparatus suitable for Phase III field-trial evaluations will be completed. Specific research objectives of the Phase II program include: 1) Synthesize alternative solvents. 2) Determine/improve stability of the extractant. Recycling studies will be done, and it will be determined how many extraction cycles an extractant phase can go through and remain effective. If instability of the extractants is a problem, a more stable extractant will be synthesized. 3) Develop a method to purify spent extractant phases so they can be reused. The extractants will eventually break down, and other contaminants may enter extractant phases from aqueous phases. Chilling, heating, extraction, and precipitation will be evaluated to remove contaminants. 4) Extract from more complex aqueous simulants and actual groundwater samples. Study effects of competing anions and other species present in groundwater. 5) Evaluate system for extraction of other anions. 6) Analyze aqueous phases after extraction to see if anything goes into them from the extractant phase. 7) Design/build a prototype apparatus consisting of two electrochemical cells, one for oxidation and one for reduction (with concomitant recovery of the target ion) of the extractant. For extraction, a commercially available centrifugal contactor will be used. Anion- and cation-exchange membranes will be evaluated during oxidation and reduction of the extractant, and recovery of the target ion. This approach to ion-exchange eliminates a major drawback to current ion-exchange technology. Ion-exchange materials, whether resins or dissolved extractants used in liquid-liquid extraction, are regenerated by contact with large volumes of a high-salt, acidic, or basic strip solution, creating a large secondary waste stream in which the target ion is contained in low concentration. Electrochemical regeneration of the extractant allows recovery of the target ion in a small volume without creation of a large, new waste stream.",

Phase II will focus on the optimization of the proposed Cr(VI) sensor in addition to the assembly and design of a prototype unit for field analysis of groundwater and surface waters using minimal analyte and supporting electrolyte. In Phase I, Eltron Research Inc., successfully demonstrated that self-assembled monolayer (SAM) modified microelectrode arrays could be used for the electrochemical detection of Cr(VI) in aqueous solutions. Cr(VI) solutions with concentrations varying from 0.1 ppb to 100 ppb could be detected using a sensitive electrochemical method. Using photolithography, a robust microelectrode array was fabricated and incorporated into a microfluidic flow cell for Cr(VI) detection. Furthermore, this flow cell was successfully coupled to a peristaltic pump to introduce analyte and supporting electrolyte for Cr(VI) detection, and was interfaced to benchtop electrochemical instrumentation (a potentiostat) for potential use in long-term monitoring situations. The performance of the miniaturized Cr(VI) detector was studied as a function of such variables as pH, supporting electrolyte concentration, SAM deposition time, Cr(VI) exposure time, electrolyte type, and Cr(VI) concentration. The electrochemical detection of Cr(VI) in water is a cost-effective method for long-term, remote monitoring of suspected environmental contamination sites. This approach could find general use in both specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency applications and those of the private sector; for example, the monitoring of Cr waste in the electroplating industry.

Acoustic images formed at the back focal plane of an acoustic lens were directly converted and photographed.  This method has the potential of allowinginexpensive hand held imagers for divers in littoral waters.  The Phase I work laid the foundation for measuring properties of liquid crystal (LC) materials, which are fundamentally important to acoustic imaging.  Chief among these was measurement of theacoustic anisotropy.  Also important were sensitivity, dynamic range, speed of response, and operational temperature.  All the necessary tests and analyses regarding acoustic lenses and general materials were developed during the Phase I for designing animager.  Phase II work involves investigations of specially engineered LC materials with enhanced acoustic sensitivity and a new method of LC imaging.  The new materials offer many enhancements unavailable in the LCs commonly used for displays.  This newmethod of imaging offers a simple, but effective method with the possibility of greatly enhancing the dynamic range.BENEFITS: The benefit to the Navy is the production of a small, portable, and inexpensive acoustic imager for deployment in low visibility,littoral environments.

As a result, a larger RF power source and a larger helium refrigerator are needed, increasing capital costs and reducing overall reliability.  This project will develop an active microphonics damping system based on magnetic \u00bfsmart\u00bf material actuators and high speed digital signal processing.  These actuators will be designed to operate efficiently at cryogenic temperatures.  In Phase I, the requirements of a microphonics control system were obtained through discussions with engineers at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, the National Superconducting Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, and the Spallation Neutron Source, and a prototype actuator was built and tested.  The tests demonstrated the feasibility of using magnetostrictive materials for cavity tuning: satisfactory load handling capacity, magnetostriction, and response time were shown.  Phase II, will develop a working tuner, install it on a superconducting RF cavity, measure its performance characteristics and sensitivity, and develop a comprehensive design for a control system.

Low frequency vibrations from auxiliary equipment and from local ground vibration cause relative motion of the two beams and therefore must be dampened.  Furthermore, longer-term ground motion requires periodic realignment of the beams through larger scale magnet movement.  This project will develop a high force, active vibration damping system based on magnetic \u00bfsmart\u00bf material actuators.  The system consists of motion sensors, a high speed digital signal processor, and high force actuators based on magnetic smart materials.  Phase I developed and demonstrated a reaction mass vibration control system, developed an innovative control algorithm, and characterized actuator motion sensors with the potential to achieve the nanometer stability required for the NLC.  Active vibrational damping of the final focus magnets was achieved without requiring a physical connection from the magnets to ground because very little space is available for the installation of support structures.  Phase II will develop and identify an advanced control algorithm, a cryogenic magnetostrictive actuator, a low noise power amplifier, along with high speed digital signal processors and motion sensors, to achieve stability at the 1nm level required for the NLC.

In Phase I, the automatic control system was designed, tested, and documented for three key functions of the whole tree harvester:  the track steering system, the tree accumulator system, and the endgate mechanism.  Mockups of portions of each of these systems were built and interfaced with a programmable logic controller ported to a personal computer for programming, simulating, and testing the control functions required of each subsystem.  Phase II will focus on procuring and fabricating the remaining components, assembling key subsystems (such as the tracks, the steering system, the engine and system controls), and testing the prototype whole tree harvester in the field on one of more plots of farm-grown trees.  The ability of the whole tree harvester to rapidly negotiate typical farm fields, cut and accumulate trees at high speed, load trees automatically (in both batch and continuous mode), and be successfully transported between fields will be tested and documented.

Two of these solutions are based upon switch-mode power supply principles driving currents in the neutral lead, and the third solution consists of magneticcancellation in the transformer core, i.e., instead of current cancellation, this is direct field cancellation.  All solutions are focused on eliminating the magnetic saturation of the transformer.  These solutions will be demonstrated on a 120 VACsingle-phase basis during Phase I.The Phase II work effort will consist of extending the design, analysis, and testing of the Phase I work to a three-phase 14 kV system with autotransformers.

All of the currently available positive inotropic agents have significant adverse effects with digitalis being the only orally available positive inotrope. ATP causes a pronounced positive inotropic effect. Receptors for ATP, known as P2 purinergic receptor, has been shown to mediate its positive inotropic effect. However, agonists acting at this cardiac P2 receptor with enhanced efficacy, potency and selectivity, are lacking. Preliminary data suggest that certain specific modifications of the AMP molecule will confer positive inotropic activity and selectivity vs. the vascular P2 receptor. Adult rat ventricular myocytes and intact heart model have been developed to determine the affinity and efficacy of new agents at the myocyte P2 receptor and their effects on the various functional parameters in the intact heart. The overall objective of the study is to use these cardiac models to test these specifically modified AMP molecules at the cardiac P2 receptor. New chemical structures will be correlated with the affinity and the positive inotropic activity and cardiac vs. vascular P2 receptor selectivity. The effects of these compounds on the heart rate and blood pressure in conscious rats will also be determined.

Several CPN editors, including Modasco's VSO Design, are now available or in development. However, these tools do not restrict the modelarchitect to realistic designs that satisfy the system's physical and functional requirements. Recent investigations by Modasco indicate that VSO Design can perform model architecture verification and validation during the design phase, insuring that themodels it generates satisfy the system requirements. The architectural building blocks (entities) of a system can be identified and stored in a database along with rules describing how these entities can be associated. The proposed verification andvalidation tool restricts alternative CPN designs to the predefined entity set and the entity associations. Additionally, designers can create a validated model and store it as a special entity type for later reuse. This is the first step to developing atrue Collaborative Virtual Prototyping environment allowing multiple users, working remotely, to build validated subsystem models that can be assembled into larger, more complex systems.  An important and timely application of this technology is themodeling and evaluation of evacuation plans as a part of an overall Homeland Defense strategy.\"",

This work represent an enabling technology for NASA's requirement for distributed optical fiber sensing for health monitoring, aviation safety, and aircraft morphing programs. The work is based on the Phase I feasibility studies which generated two approaches for producing OFDR targeted laser systems. These systems have the unique combination of rapid tuning and immunity to mode hops. The proposed designs have reduced alignment tolerances and built in wavelength tracking. These features provide a level of hardening to environmental influences that will make flight qualification of the systems possible as well as cost effective. An integral part to both approaches is the incorporation of a high speed, high resolution, tracking wavemeter. This feature allows for the use of tunable lasers both with and without mode hops.",

A Distributed Grating Demodulation System (DGDS) was constructed and tested using radiation-resistant fiber. Temperatue sensors were produced and calibrated. Two housings were constructed that allow an all-welded pressure boundary penetration. Radiation testing was successfully conducted on sensing fiber in a combined high-neutron and gamma environment. The key technological advantage offered by the sensors developed under this program is their ability to be highly multiplexed, allowing the placement of literally thousands of sensors along a single optical fiber. There are three strategic objectives for the Phase II: 1) Fully validate the DGDS technology for space reactor applications, 2) Expand the application base for DGDS sensor technology, and 3) Develop strategy for commercial development. The primary objective is to finalize sensor designs using specifications obtained from NASA and industry partners so that prototypes can be constructed. Resolving high temperature operation is a major portion of this objective. The application base will be expanded by designing sensors that can measure temperature, strain, pressure, and flow. Luna has an extremely successful track record in commercial development, having spun off four successful companies dedicated to the commercialization of technologies developed at Luna Innovations.",

The new transformer operates under resonant conditions with a very high mechanical factor. Consequently, the transformer can achieve a higher step-up ratios and higher power density compared to similar conventional magnetic transformers. The novel transformer is compact in size, light in weight, and does not generate magnetic interferences, since neither magnetic materials nor coils are involved in its manufacturing. Additionally, the specific design proposed for Phase I, based on a new paralleling-tapped concept developed by Face, allows for the supply of a different number of high voltages and high powers required to drive the TWT.The Phase II proposal is focused on the technical improvement of the proposed device in order to achieve the performance levels required for low and medium power TWTs. In order to achieve this goal the following objectives will be pursued: (a) increase power output of current design up to 100W, (b) electronic integration for space application, and (c) reliability testing for the final equipment.",

This is possible because a radio frequency (RF) weapon that attacks electronics can be effective over amuch larger radius than a high-explosive (HE) weapon. For example, a single 155-mm artillery shell has a disabling blast radius limited to a few meters for armored vehicles, while an RF weapon detonated at 500 meters above the battlefield can have aneffective radius in excess of 100 meters. Until recently, it was not feasible to incorporate RF weapons into munitions, due to the large size of the available sources and antennas. But compact sources are becoming available, and a compact antenna can bederived from the Collapsible Impulse Radiating Antenna (CIRA), which is an umbrella-like antenna that is already being sold commercially by Farr Research. The antenna must satisfy requirements for radiating a broad band of frequencies, and it must be smallenough to fit within a typical munition. The proposed antenna design is a combination of a parachute and an Impulse Radiating Antenna, and it is called a Para-IRA.

        "abstract": "Description (provided by applicant): High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU)      \n phased arrays allow flexibility in beam steering, beam shaping, and dynamic        \n focusing. These features enable them to create large and contiguous tissue         \n lesions of predetermined shape with high efficiency, resulting in shorter          \n treatments, increased accuracy, and ease of operation. The goal of this            \n proposal is to replace the current Sonablate HIFU transducers (mechanically        \n scanned, dual-element, HIFU and imaging capability) used in the clinic for the     \n treatment of BPH and localized prostate cancer with a 2-D HIFU phased array.       \n The array will eliminate \"probe switching\" during treatment, reduce the            \n reliance on mechanical scanning, and increase treatment effectiveness through      \n dynamic focusing and focal zone shaping. During Phase I, phased array              \n configurations were simulated to determine an optimum design for HIFU prostate     \n treatments. A 1-D truncated spherical annular array and electronics were           \n fabricated and characterized. In this Phase II application, we propose to build    \n on these encouraging results by: 1) defining and optimizing a HIFU phased array    \n with 2-D focusing capability, 2) fabricating and characterizing the array, 3)      \n integrating it into a transrectal image-guided HIFU probe to be used with the      \n Sonablate system, and 4) evaluating its performance in-vitro and in-vivo using     \n a canine prostate model.                                                           \n PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\n As our population ages, prostate disease (BPH & cancer) is becoming an ever-more-frequent\n malady for man.  The annual market for treatment of prostate cancer in the U.S. is estimated\n around $5 billion.  Focus Surgery Inc. manufactures the Sonablate(TM) system, which makes   use of HIFU technology to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  To extend the application of  this system to treat localized prostate cancer increased flexibility in focal spot placement and  less reliance on mechanical steering is required.  The current proposal directly addresses this \n challenge.  Successful completion of this project will open the enormous market of prostate\n cancer treatment to our Sonablate(TM) device.",

        "abstract": "Fort Environmental Laboratories, Inc.'s Phase I research project resulted in the development and standardization of an assay that tests substances that might disturb reproductive and developmental processes in animals by interfering with the endocrine system. The primary goal of the proposed research was to validate and commercialize the Xenopus laevis oocyte maturation germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) model as a system for the rapid evaluation of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) found in the workplace or the environment. Specifically, a 24-hour X. laevis assay modified from the original work of Pickford and Morris (Environmental Health Perspectives 1999;107(4):285-292) and Lui and Patino (Biology of Reproduction 1993;49:980-988) designed to evaluate progestin-active or anti-progestin EDCs in vitro was standardized and evaluated by conducting a preliminary validation study with a series of known EDCs, compounds found to be inactive, and chemicals with unknown activity. The relative inhibitory potential of the toxicants study was ethinyl estradiol>>Aroclor 1260>atrazine>dieldrin. Testosterone and the confined animal feed operation (CAFO) waste complex mixture sample had a stimulatory effect on GVBD. Bisphenol A had no effect on GVBD, even at concentrations of 5,000 \u00bfM. The binding capacity of the toxicants to the oocyte membrane plasma receptor (OMPR) relative to progesterone was low. Interestingly, testosterone possessed some binding capacity to the OMPR, indicating that the OMPR may be a more precocious binding site than originally anticipated. However, the relative binding affinity of the toxicants to the OMPR was expressed as progesterone>>ethinyl estradiol (-)>testosterone (+)>atrazine (-)>Aroclor 1260 (-) >dieldrin (-)>CAFO sample (+)>bisphenol A (NE). The washout studies indicated that although the competitive binding affinity of ethinyl estradiol for the OMPR was the greatest of the test compounds evaluated in the present study, testosterone, dieldrin, and Aroclor 1260 were bound more tightly to the OMPR than ethinyl estradiol. Because none of the currently developed high throughput EDC screening systems are capable of specifically screening for progesterone-active EDCs, the successful completion of the in vitro oocyte GVBD model development will provide the scientific community with a non-mammalian, cost-effective, rapid, and reliable method of screening EDCs. The ability to rapidly and cost-effectively screen for and evaluate the mechanisms of EDCs is an attractive alternative to the current laborious and expensive testing systems used today. Increasing concerns over the widespread finding of EDCs in the environment have dramatically increased the need for standardized assays, such as the X. laevis GVBD model, because few other progestin/antiprogestin-based in vitro assays are available today.",

To meet DoDneeds, significant increases in PEM fuel cell energy density/energy efficiency from the current state-of-the-art mass specific power (MSP) of 1 kW/kg to 5 kW/kg are required  over the next five years.  Foster-Miller, with support from H Power, Inc., aleading fuel cell manufacturer and BP Amoco, a major polymer producer, proposes to develop new high energy density/high energy efficiency PEMs that will overcome problems with current perfluorinated PEMs and enable affordable fuel cells of >5kW/kg MSP.During Phase I Foster-Miller demonstrated the feasibility of a new high energy density ion conducting polymer (ICP) that can be chemically stabilized to withstand high temperature, high efficiency fuel cell operating conditions. New affordable highperformance  PEMs are possible when this ICP is combined with Foster-Miller's novel PBO membrane support. The Phase II program will optimize these ICP/PBO materials to demonstrate PEMs and membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs), meeting DoD goals. This willlead to rapid commercialization by H Power and BP in Phase III. (P-002090)\"",

It will include a \"family orientation\" for newly admitted residents, and in addition, a facility-specific \"Family Communication Room\" will enable families and staff to communicate directly on an ongoing basis. A 12-month randomized trial with four facilities will assess family satisfaction, involvement and complaints as well as resident quality of care and quality of life. \n\nThe Phase I study successfully completed all stated objectives.

Development of a lighter weight binder with a suitable morphology, combined with environmentally friendly solvents to produce RAMs would offer significantadvantages in manufacturing and in the field. As in any functional filled polymer, interaction between the different components is a must. The presence of inactive materials or induced porosity lessens the overall efficacy. In other words, a functionalblend, preferably an interpenetrating network would be the ideal material. Fractal Systems, in collaboration with our aerospace partners, proposes to continue optimization of the resin formulations by manipulation of the polymeric binder and the modifiedRAM filler. This effort will take the successes achieved in Phase I, based on functionalization of the components, from material design and characterization to field use in Phase II and beyond. Our aerospace partners will provide direct input and willactively participate by assisting with the required testing of viable formulations. Our approach is based on the results obtained thus far. The low cost and simple techniques used in the new processes, are very likely to result in viable lighter,non-hazardous RAMs that will qualify for airborne, ground or naval-based applications.\"",

We have obtained excellent results relative to several aspects of the technology, particularly sensitivity and selectivity using few molecular layers of the different polymers. In the proposed Phase II program, we plan to optimize selected materials and their processing based on the feasibility study, and to elaborate on the viability of their sensors with respect to stability towards humidity, and heat, and gravity effects.

Gone are the days when new systems could be developed and produced simply for reasons of greater payload, better reliability, more weapons on target, improved technology, etc. Now the benefits of performanceimprovements must be balanced against cost to arrive at a \"best value\" solution. In other words, the technology must be affordable. In the past, affordability was not often a priority for Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) programs because the emphasiswas on new technology, and the focus was strictly on performance. AFRL is attempting to measure and report return on investment (ROI) for Science and Technology (S&T) programs. Since a cost saving can't always be demonstrated for a new technology thatprovides previously unattainable military capability, innovative methods of measuring both investment and return, need to be developed, especially for technologies that do not have a manufacturing focus.

The source of crude material for subsequent analytical chemistry testing will be first addressed: Echinacea seeds will be tested and identified for purity, then germinated and cultivated at different seasons/soil/field conditions, and morphologic, organoleptic, chromosome/DNA, and microscopic characteristics will be systematically monitored and recorded. Simultaneously, all marker compounds and testing methodology to be used later will be developed in the first 6 months. The marker compound testing will begin in the last 6 months using samples from Gaia Herbs organic farm. The testing will include samples representing the different factors that influence the potential medicinal activities of Echinacea, e.g., parts of plant, species, and horticulture. Different extraction preparations will be developed based on marker compound analysis, and products developed based on extraction quality. The most desirable delivery forms will then be developed based on retesting analysis. Thus, specific aims of Phase I include: 1) preparation of raw material source for use in Phase II, data collection on plant identity; 2) preparation of marker compounds and testing methods; 3) marker compound testing to identify promising end products using different extraction solvents and strategy (i.e., best combination extraction types correlated with chemical component concentrations in plant parts and species); 4) evaluate optimum delivery presentation and product stability; 5) execution and direction of Phase II to deliver Phase I milestone; 6) share the knowledge and practices gained with the herbal industry and regulatory agencies. The growing Echinacea planted in Phase I will provide samples for analytical testing and product development for three years in Phase II, and more critically, the carefully monitored and characterized 1,2, and 3 year old plants growing in different soil conditions and harvesting times must be available to start Phase II. Long-term goals include new technology development viable for herbal industry and herb farms. The ultimate hope is to provide consumers, researchers, herbal industry, and health- care providers with easily recognized product quality and identity, and to scientifically establish or disprove the medicinal value of Echinacea. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: In the process of manufacturing reproducible Echinacea products, new innovative technologies will also be developed  through out the production process.

Careful pharmacokinetic and activity data    \n measurements for lead compounds in an Aspergillus fumigatus spore-induced          \n murine model of airway inflammation using both oral and intratracheal routes of    \n aminosterol administration will subsequently be taken to select a few              \n aminosterols for formal preclinical development. These compounds will be           \n compared to the water soluble lead compounds MSI-1 432 and MSI-f 828 shown         \n active in phase I research for intratracheal delivery, while discovery of an       \n orally active aminosterol is given priority in parallel experimentation.           \n Preparation and formulation of a single lead aminosterol to GMP standards will     \n then be rapidly instituted for delivery by the preferred route of                  \n administration, along with necessary supporting analytical method development,     \n and a first acute rat toxicity GLP study will be initiated as the first of a       \n series of preclinical safety studies to support use in humans.

The health related costs of asthma are estimated for the year 2000 to exceed $14.5 billion, and asthma (and asthma costs) are on the rise among inner city residents. There is a significant need for better and more novel treatments for asthma, notably those with fewer side effects and that are easier for patients to use. Aminosterols are a new class of anti-inflammatory agents discovered by Genaera Corporation that are preferentially active with Th2-type T cells and that may offer several advantages to asthma patients, including the ability to self-administer.",

One of the most difficult tasks in developing a DNA vaccine is the identification of the antigen that will stimulate the most effective immune response against the pathogen, particularly when the genome of the infectious organism is large. A technology developed by Gene Therapy\nSystems Inc. under a previously funded SBIR grant (R43 AI47641-01) will be applied to the general problem of how to identify potent DNA vaccine antigens from complex organisms. The technology called Transciptionally Active PCR (commercial name \"TAP ExpressTM\") is a method for generating functional PCR fragments that can be used directly in in vitro transfection assays and in vivo. TAP fragments are as active as supercoiled plasmids in all assays examined including DNA vaccine immunizations, enabling high throughput functional screening of a very large number of genes, on a scale that has not been previously possible. In this proposal several enhancements will be added to the technology and it will be used to screen 424 malaria antigens with the goal of identifying new DNA vaccine antigens that have improved protective\nimmunological activity.\n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The resources from this grant will be used to continue the development of a practical method for generating transcriptionally active PCR (TAP) fragments, which can be used directly in in vitro transfection assays and in vivo.

The equipment replaces the current removal techniques, which are tedious, labor intensive, and inefficient.  Feasibility demonstrations in Phase I confirmed that a pulsed laser operating at 1064 nm with a radiance of 15 to 30 MW/CM2 iseffective in removing pre-specified surface layers of LO material.  Feedback electronics are able to control the laser firing circuit so that the removal process automatically terminates when the material substrate becomes exposed.

The demonstration unit was similar to that which the Air Force Safety Office (AF/SES) has stated is explosion safe.  In Phase II, GLC will refine thediode-pumped system design to ensure laser safety, waste collection, and user-friendly control features in a compact, small footprint package.

An objective is to further test techniques that have been developed and verified in Phase I work to overcome this problem. 2. The second objective is to further test a number of techniques for recovery of fumaric acid from the fermentation broth. Being an acid, its accumulation in the fermentation broth will reduce pH that in turn will inhibit further biological activities. The product acid has to be either neutrilized and/or removed as it is formed by the cells.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In current practice, radiation therapy planning (RTP) has often been treated as a two-dimensional (2D) problem, mainly due to the limitations in visualization technology and resources. The slice-by-slice display format makes it difficult to visualize the path of any radiation beam not perpendicular to the axis of the CT slices. This drawback also discourages consideration of all treatment plans that utilize radiation beam out of the transverse plane. Human body anatomical structures are inherently 3D objects, and the tumor and tissues/organs involved in the RTP are all of 3D shapes. A clear understanding of 3D relationships among these structures as well as dose distributions in 3D is essential for designing and evaluating radiation therapy plans. An interactive volumetric 3D display would significantly enhance the safety and speed of RTP procedure. It would offer \"understanding at a glance\", which is necessary to keep clinicians from becoming bogged down in endless details, as they would be if provided only with conventional 2D display of CT slices with overlaid isodose lines. Genex Technologies, Inc. has recently made an important breakthrough in the high-resolution volumetric 3D display technology and attempted to apply it to RTP applications. By \"volumetric 3D display\", we mean that each \"voxel\" in the displayed 3D images locates physically at the (x, y, z) spatial position where it supposed to be, and emits light from that position to form real 3D images in the eyes of viewers. In our Phase 1 project, we have demonstrated the feasibility of our system design and achieved a multi-color, large display volume, true volumetric 3D display system with an unprecedented high resolution of over 10 million voxels in a portable design. The prototype of this true 3D display system is already able to present dynamic interactive volumetric 3D images of a patient's anatomy with transparent skin. The powerful 3D visualization capability provides both physiological and psychological depth cues to oncologists in perceiving and manipulating radiation beam configuration in true 3D fashion, thus offering a unique visualization tool to ensure the safety, effectiveness, and speed of the RTP process. In our Phase 2 program, we will further enhance the performance of the volumetric 30 display, integrate the newly developed 3D display capability into the 'Interactive RTP Environment\" prototype, and perform preliminary pre-clinical evaluation on the effectiveness of the volumetric 3D display and the interactive RTP environment technique in realistic RTP applications. The ultimate goal of this SBlR program is to develop a clinically viable commercial product as an augmented visualization tool that will provide unique 3D display and visualization capability to aid oncologists in RTP.",

This processing difficulty is related to the hardness of the multifilamentary composite and the bonding of the filaments.  This project will investigate an ultrasonic processing technique to reduce drawing forces and increase bonding between the filaments.  Phase I demonstrated several ultrasonic wire drawing equipment designs.  The ultrasonic drawing forces were shown to be as little as 55% less compared to the non-ultrasonic wire drawing A15 type superconductors.  In addition, ultrasonic wire drawing was demonstrated for multi-filament composites, which was not possible with conventional conical dies.  Phase II will design and build a high power ultrasonic wire drawing setup.  The optimum ultrasonic wire drawing parameters, for preventing filament breakage and improving inter-filament bonding, will be determined for multi-filament A15 superconducting composites.                 Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Although the largest market should be for accelerator and fusion magnets, high field magnets (above 5 tesla) should also have applicability for MRI, NMR, high gradient magnetic separators, and SMES applications.",

        "abstract": "Dermal anesthetics are used to anesthetize the skin of patients for various reasons, ranging from minor cutaneous surgery and needle inserts to skin grafts. The dermal anesthetic market is dominated by a single preparation, called EMLA (AstraZeneca), which consists of a eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine bases. EMLA?s principal drawback is a long onset time for dermal anesthesia, requiring up to two hours for full effect. The results of our Phase I studies demonstrate that we have arrived at compounds that are superior to EMLA in every respect. The new compounds offer faster onset of anesthetic activity, deeper local anesthesia, and longer duration of anesthesia than EMLA. We have selected a lead compound - racemic TAC-34 - and a backup compound - TAC-HP. (The enantiomers of TAC-34 possessed similar activity.) Both lead and backup compounds meet and exceed our original selection criteria. The goal of the phase II project is to acquire the data package needed to select the Candidate Drug, and to prepare the Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for submission to the Food and Drug Administration. Specific aims designed to meet this goal include: 1. to develop scale-up synthesis methods, analytical procedures, and formulations of both isomeric TAC-34 and the backup compound TAC-HP to further evaluate efficacy and toxicity for selection of the Candidate Drug; 2. to carry out the preclinical toxicity testing and to prepare the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control information necessary to support the IND application for the Candidate Drug. After the first-in-man studies, we intend to license out this project to one of the pharmaceutical companies that has already expressed strong interest in this project.",

Our approach is based on the analysis of IC substrate chemical properties pertaining to opacityto laser emissions at various operational parameters (e.g., frequencies, modulation, etc.), and the resulting specification of requirements for IC laser illumination and capture of laser generated images. Multiresolution analysis and other imaging analysistechniques are used to examine the laser images to determine the existence of artifacts that may relate to the properties and characteristics of IC failure. These artifacts are then categorized for diagnostic use. With enhancements to the image resolution,this approach will be useful for both the current and future generations of ICs.

The SCM's performance represents an order of magnitude improvement over what is available now. In Phase II we will advance the SCM from laboratory prototype to flight prototype. We will develop flight electronics, a flight sensor head, calibrate the instrument, put it through a series of tests for flight worthiness, and deliver the fully tested flight instrument and documentation to NASA.

Unfortunately, current practice usually yields software that is generally unreliable and insecure.

Model checking is a verification technique that allows users to verify crosscutting properties of systems.  During Phase I of this project, we developed anew technique for model checking based on using context-free-language reachability algorithms.  These allow us to exploit the inherent modularity in procedural abstraction, and thus allow the technique to be scaled to large programs.

Research conducted at HERL has shown that only about half of the force being applied to the pushrim produces useful torque. In addition, researchers have associated several common injuries with pushrim propulsion. Surveys of manual wheelchair users show the prevalence of shoulder pain to be between 31 and 73% and of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome to be between 49 and 73%. \n\nA lever drive wheelchair transmission has the potential to reduce all of the risk factors for wrist and shoulder injuries. This Phase I program has demonstrated a lever drive with a mechanical efficiency of over 90%. The improvement in propulsion efficiency, coupled with the improved biomechanics of the lever drive, could substantially reduce new wrist and shoulder injuries, ameliorate existing injuries and allow some individuals the option of continuing to use a manual wheelchair. \n\nIn this proposed Phase II program, we will continue engineering development of the lever drive transmission begun in Phase I, incorporating shift-on-the-fly capability and dynamic braking. Metabolic testing will be conducted on two models to document improvements in propulsion efficiency and in biomechanics.  \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Wheelchairs are in widespread use throughout the world.  In the US alone, there are around 1.5 million wheelchair users.  Of these, it is estimated that one half will eventually develop CTS and/or shoulder injuries such as rotator cuff tears.

        "abstract": "65647              Recent advances in high frequency linear accelerator technology have resulted in steady-state electron beams having RF bunch widths of 50 to 200 femtoseconds, considerably shorter than the practical resolution of fast diagnostic streak camera systems.  Therefore, the accurate measurement of the longitudinal phase space of ultra short bunches using microwave power would be highly advantageous and economically attractive, especially if the complexity, sensitivity, and a priori assumptions associated with alternative electro-optic methods could be avoided.  This project will develop a circularly-polarized, beam-deflecting microwave structure that provides a highly amplified image display of the electron bunch, with phase and energy distributions projected in orthogonally-differentiated azimuthal and radial directions.  Combining such a microwave structure with a beam focusing element offers a simple on-line diagnostic for the definitive measurement of ultra short RF bunches.  During Phase I, a detailed microwave and beam optics analysis was performed, and the results indicated that, with an emittance-limited beam image focused at the analyzing plane, a dual-input circularly-polarized microwave structure could produce phase resolution less than 1 degree (100 femtoseconds at 17 gigahertz).  In addition, the design parameters of all major components were established, and an overall layout drawing was prepared to show how the bunch monitoring system could be integrated into an existing accelerator test facility.  Phase II will fabricate the microwave beam deflector and the associated rectangular waveguide network, the beam focusing system and diagnostic chamber, and the peripheral subsystems.  The electro bunch diagnostic equipment will be integrated into an existing 17 gigahertz linear accelerator test facility, and high power beam tests will be conducted to evaluate the performance of the overall system.                   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should result in an on-line beam monitoring system capable of accurately evaluating the RF bunch performance of advanced accelerator systems.  The attainment of very short RF bunches should be of considerable interest for free electron lasers, wakefield accelerators, linear colliders, and the generation of intense coherent radiation",

Detection of neuroactive          \n pathogens, at the earliest stages, would be a critical factor in the diagnosis     \n and treatment of any possible neuropathological consequences. Enzyme-linked        \n immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are already        \n being used separately as specific microbial detection methods. In the present      \n project, we propose to develop a technology of pathogen detection, which           \n combines the advantages of ELISA and those of PCR. This is expected to result      \n in a highly efficient, reproducible method for the detection of very small         \n numbers of pathogens, even before they can elicit the normal host immune           \n response. The project will be carried out in two phases. In phase 1, the method    \n of immuno-PCR will be standardized by measuring proteins and peptides that have    \n special importance in brain function or pathology. This will be done using         \n either brain cells where they are specifically and abundantly expressed, or in     \n heterologous cells, such as lymphocytes, where they are expressed at very low      \n levels, by a phenomenon known as \"'illegitimate transcription\". In phase 2 we      \n will extend the protocols developed in phase 1 to detect and quantitatively        \n measure some of the pathogens that are commonly found in human populations and     \n which are of great concern to public health authorities. Four different            \n approaches to immuno-PCR will be compared, based (a) on electrophoresis and        \n ethidium bromide staining of the amplified DNA and densitometry of the band        \n obtained: (b) measurement of fluorescence produced following reaction of the       \n PCR mixture with the dye, PicoGreen; colorimetry following reaction of             \n chromogenic substrate with digoxigenin-alkaline phosphate ligated to DNA; and      \n (d) fluorometry of the complex produced by the action of a fluorescent             \n substance (AttoPhos) on the DNA-digoxigenin complex.                               \n PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\n (a) Development of rapid and highly sensitive, early detection kits for neuropathogens in\n human and animal tissues and body fluids; (b) Evaluation of the efficiency of vaccines,\n commonly used in persons at risk for infection; (c) Evaluation of the immune reaction\n subsequent to primary infection or immunization, and (d) possible identification and \n treatment of microorganisms responsible for idiopathic neuropathogenesis.",

Research results from a previous Phase I grant provide the conceptual and scientific foundations for these products. Two independent research projects are proposed. In collaboration with the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Institute, ALERTS content will be developed and statewide system implementation will be promoted and evaluated by a regionally disperse network of diagnostic clinics and local chapters of the Alzheimer's Association. Modules to be included in ALERTS will be: (1) educational information about dementia; (2) current treatments; (3) informant-based or individual direct screening; (4) caregiver support; and (5) local resource referral. If successful in promoting early detection and initiation of dementia treatment, ALERTS design will permit nationwide expansion and multilingual delivery. Continued support and system expansion would be beneficial to public health agencies, private patient advocacy groups, and the pharmaceutical industry. In collaboration with the NIA-funded Alzheimer's Disease Center at Stanford University, a 24-week longitudinal study of TREND will be conducted with 105 subjects (N=35 from elderly controls, mild cognitive impairment, mild dementia). TREND data will be compared to clinical assessments using both the cognitive and non-cognitive items of the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) to assess the reliability and validity of IVR automated monitoring of longitudinal changes in cognitive functioning.  If successful, pharmaceutical companies could be provided the ability to collect reliable and valid data remotely with electronic storage of data for immediate availability during and after randomized clinical trials. TREND availability would permit frequent patient evaluation with fewer logistic difficulties than is currently possible. Such capabilities would promote more rapid submission of effective compounds to the Food and Drug Administration and reduce drug development cycles. Methodological proof-of-concept regarding IVR assessment of cognitive deficits would open new avenues for research into treatments of many disorders and diseases, such as schizophrenia, depression, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, alcohol and other drug dependence, and stroke.",

The significance of such a system is that it provides accurate, non-contact measurements of motion, as well as deformation of a flight control surface using digital photogrammetry. In Phase II, the system will also be enhanced to determine the stresses on flight control surfaces, based on motion and deformation measurements. This innovative system will be robust and easy-to-use, and suitable for a variety of aircrafts.",

        "abstract": "This project will develop a new microscopy instrument that is, in essence, a miniaturized fluoroscope. Samples are placed in direct contact with a grainless fluorescent-screen and illuminated with soft x-rays radiated by an extremely hot laser-produced plasma. The resulting luminescent shadowgraph is observed using optical microscopy. The device can produce images showing the three dimensional structure of unstained living cells at a resolution near 100 nm. An extremely brief exposure duration of several nanoseconds results in very sharp images, even in the presence of significant specimen motility. The instrument should find widespread application in many biomedical research areas. Phase I research demonstrated the feasibility of construction such an instrument using a design that was sufficiently compact for mounting directly onto the sample stage of a commercial optical microscope. This allowed the observation of both dry and hydrated test objects using either optical microscopy or soft x-ray microfluoroscopy. Phase II research will develop an advanced version of the instrument that will take full advantage of the unique imaging characteristics of the technique. The instrument will be appropriately designed for subsequent commercialization. Testing will include evaluating the instruments effectiveness in a real research investigation.",

The devices such as high-Q tunable filters will also achieve ultra-high sensitivity in signal interception and processing capabilities. Integrated with other receiver chain components, thesedevices will form the foundation of the microsensor-communication link vital to the successful performance of the Future Combat Systems (FCS). The concept of the FCS is accurate detection of threats and rapid and mobile deployment of forces to counter andneutralize these threats. In the detection phase, microsensors are deployed to uncover hostile combatants with lightweight weapons concealed in defensive and offensive positions within a battlefield range. These distributed microsensors collect seismic,magnetic, radiation, sonic and other outputs from the threats and transmit the information to the communication link for further processing and countermeasures. The sensitivity of these microsensors and quality of the communications channels must beoptimized. This proposal will contribute to this optimization process and therefore improve and enhance the sensing-communicating features of the FCS.\"",

In particular the program focus is on the development of 44 GHz LNAs.  Results of the Phase I contract are summarized as a part of this Phase II proposal.  A publication survey was carried out to identify both companiesdeveloping InP processes and to determine the optimal InP structures for the LNA application.  The conclusion is that InP HEMT and MHEMT show state of the art results at 44 GHz.  An industry survey was carried out and 19 companies were identified as havingInP HEMT, InP HBT or MHEMT on their road maps.  Eleven of the 19 are focused on HEMT devices suitable to this LNA application.  Noise and Scattering parameter models were received from one of the foundries and a four stage LNA with 30 dB gain, 1.6 dB noisefigure, and 18mW power dissipation was designed.  This represents a factor or four advantage in power dissipation over GaAs PHEMT.  Additional work carried out include linear and nonlinear device modeling, and simulation and or discussion of 10 additionalLNA circuit topologies that will further improve and enhance LNA performance.

An on-line flight control system monitor that will detect the onset of loss of control due to PIO will enhance flight safety in the 21st century. The real-time monitor looks at input and response states and compares the input/output relationships with known definitions of PIO. A pilot alert system will notify the flight crew that the event is a PIO and assist in decision-making about the criticality of the event.

An important feature of the proposed SAS it that it will provide handling qualities and divided attention characteristics that can be depended on to meet the FAA requirements for IFR certification. The proposed ACAH SAS would provide a low cost solution to achieve improved helicopter dynamics, and hence enhanced safety, in two critical flight regimes, the DVE and for IMC. There is substantial evidence from NTSB accident data to indicate that it is safer to operate IFR than to attempt to continue visual flight in low visibility conditions.

Many in-situ instruments are currently only capable of handling small amount of samples (0.1 - 1.0 cc) while missions with sample return requirements have a need for large volume of samples (100-500 cc). The proposed Subsurface Coring Sampler System (SCSS) is capable of acquiring small samples for in-situ science and larger samples for sample return by adjusting the sample volume. Another unique feature of the SCSS is its ability to obtain stratigraphy maintained surface and subsurface cores of varying lengths. Once the cores are obtained, the SCSS can function as precision material handling system, transferring the cores to sample return containers or depositing smaller sections of the cores to in-situ instruments for analysis. This low mass, low power sampling system will be developed with multiple mission applicability in mind, interfacing with a majority of existing in-situ instruments being developed by other NASA centers such as GSFC (CHARGE) and Ames (CIDEX). The SCSS will also be developed with interface commonality to a multi-chamber sample return container currently being developed by Honeybee Robotics for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",

As flight operations and flight crews interact with larger numbers of complex and semi-autonomous systems, it is imperative that less demanding, more cooperative interfaces be developed. However, creating such interfaces is difficult. We believe these difficulties can be overcome by cleanly separating the complex language issues such as noun phrase resolution and dialog management, from the simpler issues ofdescribing the components of the system. Such a separation is made possible by defining broad Conversational Interface Domains (CIDs) that incorporate expert algorithms and heuristics for processing language within the domain. Thus, the interface programmer need only describe the specific objects, actions, and relationships that make up the application behind the interface. We believe that CIDs will significantly lower the cost and development time of effective, conversational interfaces. We plan to create a stable, commercial-grade version of a CID software engine and development system. The engine will run on hand-held wireless devices (PDAs) and allow distributed, conversational interaction to other CID-enabled devices.",

During Phase I of this project, IA demonstrated the feasibility of monitoring DNA hybridization in real time using an evanescent fiber-optic DNA biosensor with fluorescence detection. The DNA biosensor was mounted within a temperature controlled reaction chamber. DNA sequences were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridized to specific probes immobilized to the DNA biosensor surface. During Phase II, IA will develop a multiplexed DNA Biosensor Fluorometer capable of simultaneously monitoring the hybridization occurring on eight or more DNA biosensors at a time. The increased sensitivity associated with evanescent sensing will allow detection of one DNA copy after 25-30 cycles. The small size of the instrument and associated sample prep cartridge will adapt it to point of care testing for pathogen identification. \n\nSpecific Aim 1 provides for incorporation into the instrumental methods, use of a probe for an internal PCR standard for normalization of the efficiency of each individual reaction. Specific Aim 2 provides a multiplexed sensor cartridge so that each cartridge can run eight samples simultaneously. Specific Aim 3 provides comparison of performance of the prototype instrument with established methods using plasmids containing sequences which are specific for HPV 16 or for Chiamydia trachomatis. \n\nA specialized cartridge for sample preparation will be developed under Specific Aim 4. This will allow biological samples of clinical interest to be prepared for PCR without the need of a centrifuge. Sample will be applied to the top of the cartridge and reagents will be pressed through with a syringe. DNA will be eluted ready for amplification in the easily portable sensor instrument. PCR will be performed in situ in the sensor cartridge while the instrument records the rate of hybridization for eight solutions and standards. This will provide for a control sample and a standard curve over an anticipated seven log range. \n\nThe system can be adapted to a variety of amplification formats, and has the potential for use in genetics research laboratories and for clinical determinations in hospital labs. It will provide an instrument and sample preparation method uniquely adapted to point of care testing for pathogens in a short period of time.",

        "abstract": "To build lower-cost and more-capable aerospace vehicles that are based on multifunctional structure and sensor systems necessitates innovative concepts and designs for assessment, test, and validation of design integrity. This, in turn, calls for a broadening of the tool set through the introduction of new kinds of design and analysis methods. To respond to this need, the proposed SBIR effort is intended to develop the Risk Assessment and Management Environment (RAME). As envisioned by Mr. Goldin, the Director of NASA, failure reports, maintenance actions, and operational experience should be tracked by tools and be used to update analytical models and data/knowledge bases in order to better predict future system performance and risk. Accordingly, RAME is intended to become a supervisory system that enforces design for safety and mission success, and enables learning from prior experiences. Unlike traditional analysis tools that play a passive role for system evaluation, RAME aims for actively escorting a system to undergo design, development, operation, and maintenance. Moreover, while its primary goal is to validate a system, RAME will facilitate validation of mathematical models, in terms of cause-effect relations, parameter values, etc., and thus be able to offer convincing risk-assessment results and risk-management recommendations.",

This system will provide the foundation for         \n clinical implementation of Ichor's proprietary therapy, which has shown promise    \n for treatment of solid tumors in the pancreas, head & neck, liver, and brain.      \n Preclinical studies performed by Ichor confirmed data reported in the              \n literature characterize the cytotoxic effects of EPT. However, these studies       \n also suggest that, unlike traditional EPT approaches, unique features of this      \n therapy make it highly selective for malignant cells. Thus, the technology         \n potentially offers a method of treatment for locally advanced tumors with          \n margins that extend into surrounding tissues.                                      \n                                                                                    \n Feasibility of the proposed EPT system will be established by designing,           \n constructing, and testing a microprocessor-based switching apparatus. This         \n system will directly control delivery of electroporation pulses to an electrode    \n array implanted in the patient. Research will focus on the components,             \n architecture, and control system best suited for safe application of the unique    \n electrical signals characteristic of electroporation. After feasibility has        \n been confirmed, integration of the switching apparatus with pulse generation       \n and control means will provide an EPT system appropriate for multi-center          \n clinical studies and eventual commercial use.                                      \n PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\n Electroporation Therapy with bleomycin (EPT-B) has potential as a locoregional treatment for\n both primary and secondary tumors.  In both preclinical and early phase clinical studies, \n EPT-B has shown significant anti-tumor effect in a variety of tumor types.  It appears that\n EPT-B could be clinically appropriate for several cancers including head & neck, pancreatic,\n liver, and brain.  The proposed research will focus on the development of an Electroporation\n Therapy system appropriate for commercial clinical use.",

We have successfully    \n commercialized the LightCycler, a real-time PCR instrument that combines a         \n rapid thermal cycler with a fluorimeter. We have developed sequence specific       \n probe systems that rely on fluorescent signal to detect PCR product. These         \n hybridization probes can also be used to detect polymorphisms after PCR by         \n probe melting. In phase I, we combined a method of competitive quantitative        \n end-point PCR with the ability of hybridization probes to differentiate single     \n nucleotide polymorphisms by probe melting temperature. We also developed a         \n mathematical method of melting curve analysis that can be used to quantify         \n allele frequencies in heterogeneous samples. This analytical method can            \n accurately quantify allele frequencies as low as 1 percent in pooled samples.      \n This method has great potential in the area of high throughput Single              \n Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis. In particular, quantification of allele    \n frequencies in pooled samples for disease association studies, quantification      \n of allelic patterns of gene transcription, and quantification of mutation load.    \n In phase II, we propose to develop a commercial instrument and analysis            \n software for quantitative melting curve analysis using a standard 384-well         \n microplate format. The proposed instrument is not a thermal cycler. Instead it     \n will analyze PCR products generated on any 384-well PCR thermocycler by            \n hybridization probe melting. This strategy will result in a low-cost,              \n quantitative instrument that is compatible with standard high-throughput PCR       \n instruments and automated workstations commonly used in many labs.                 \n Instrumentation and analysis software will be validated by high throughput         \n quantification of mutant-to-wildtype mitochondrial allele frequencies in           \n individuals harboring variable loads of mitochondrial disease muations.  \nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nIdaho Technology is looking to expand into the growing field of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis.

We propose to bring to market an instrument that offers these features, and incorporates quantitative features not currently available with other methods of SNP analysis.",

The workflow can be divided into 1) Mission and 2)Technical Objectives. Mission Objectives:The Library of Congress (LOC) provided the mission objectives for a successful MD treatment in 1990 by issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) detailing five required performance criteria for an acceptable MD process. Those RFP criteria have been widely adopted and are summarized below: 1.The process must be demonstrated as effective for mass deacidification. 2.The scientific soundness and safety of the process must be substantiated throughout with supporting data. 3.The process must add to the necessary alkaline reserve, treat substrates uniformly and not cause damage to the paper or bound volumes treated. 4.The process must demonstrate satisfactory levels of quality assurance. 5.The process must provide documentation of appropriate inventory and tracking techniques for documents undergoing treatment. Potential users have added criteria, which must be met by a process that is acceptable to their preservation department or institution as summarized below: A.The process must be economically feasible for mass deacidification. B.The process should be applicable for all materials without risk of damage to bindings, paper or ink. C.The successful process must be capable of being carried out in-house by resident library personnel without the presence of extraneous hazardous chemicals or processes and without the necessity of exotic equipment or utilities.Technical Objectives:Most of the work on technical objectives will take place using a scaled-up prototype for the paper treating process. These include: 1.Development of real-scale equipment to study the application variables of the MD process as an aid in the engineering process and to assist in its commercialization. 2.Increased understanding of treatment parameters as well as the optimization of treating formulations. 3.Development and control of a method to uniformly apply treating formulation. 4.Increase in the effectiveness of the treatments. 5.Continued research into the effects of treatments on the properties of treated paper utilizing accepted physical testing protocols and Scanning Electron Microscopy with visual and energy dispersive X-Ray characterizations. The technology above includes development, integration and proof testing of necessary prototype components and sub-systems. This will supply a satisfactory device for treating of single sheets of paper.",

The reduction of sex hormone levels in both men and women increase production of certain factors that lead to osteoporosis. One-third of all menopausal women experience at least one osteoporotic fracture during their lifetime. In addition, certain malignancies, including breast, prostrate, or lung frequently metastasize to long bones, spinal vertebrae, and/or pelvis. Primary and metastatic cancers involving bone account for approximately 400,000 new cancer cases per year in the United States alone, and >70% of patients with advanced breast or prostate cancer have skeletal metastases. Ongoing osteoclastic activity appears to be involved in the generation and maintenance of ongoing and movement-evoked pain. Recently, several protein factors, such as RANK, RANKL, and OPG have been identified that are important in the pathogenesis of disease. RANKL by binding to cell surface receptor RANK on the osteoclastic precursor cells induce formation of osteoclasts, which are involved in bone resorption. Administration of OPG (which acts as decoy receptor for RANKL) has been shown to halt further bone destruction, reduce a ongoing and movement-evoked pain. Blockade of ongoing osteoclast activity of RANKL by inhibitory molecules have the potential to reduce bone cancer pain in patients with advanced tumor-induced bone destruction. Since OPG/RANKL ratio play an important role osteoclast development, it is important to monitor the levels of RANKL and OPG in patients' blood circulation. In this Phase II study, using monoclonal antibodies, we propose to develop sensitive assays to measure OPG and RANKL in blood stream. We also propose to develop monoclonal antibodies that can neutralize RANKL activity in the development of osteoclasts, These monoclonal antibodies will have therapeutic application.",

Hysteroscopic surgery can even increase complication rates, especially for surgeons inexperienced with hysteroscopy. The simulator developed in Phase I and proposed for extension in Phase II will allow surgeons to learn in a standardized environment with low instructional costs, built-in performance evaluation, no patient risk, and varied pathologies determined by a curriculum, not by the random flow of patients. Phase I produced a prototype simulator for the common hysteroscopy tasks-cervical dilation, endometrial ablation, and polyp extraction. Here distinguished surgical educators evaluated the simulator, providing validation and guidance for Phase II. The Phase II will include instructional design and implementation of three training software modules, custom interface hardware development, and simulator evaluations, resulting in a refined simulator ready for delivery to customers.",

The system will include refined hardware, underlying software, and educational content created to meetneeds defined by clinical faculty. Structured evaluation will help guide and validate system development and validation.Proposed technical advances include using Immersion's patented haptic computer mouse to simulate detection and recognition of arterial pulses; developing a virtual needle that floats freely in space and provides multi-axis tactile force feedback to theuser; simulating the experience of striking bone (clavicle) with the needle; rendering and modeling relevant tracks of the human venous system; advancement of the software framework to allow customization of didactic elements, including institutionalpolicy, procedural flow, and tool parameters; and creation on 20 virtual patient cases. An Immersion Medical simulator for CVC would allow users to effectively increase their patient volume, thereby benefiting healthcare by reducing patient complications and their related costs. The proposed simulator would also be a valuable training toolfor the U.S. military, where central lines placement is a required element of requisite Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) and Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) training. Implementation of the proposed technology would bolster medical support to thewounded soldier through enhanced medical training. In success, the proposed project will improve military readiness through shortened recovery times, and will lead to the production of commercially viable products with educational and training benefits forU.S. hospitals and medical schools. Laptop portability will further allow training in field situations currently inaccessible for CVC training.\"",

However, current B-scan ultrasound, based on a fan of echoes, is very difficult to understand and requires specialized training to interpret. In this program, we propose to develop a speckle-free ultrasound imaging system which is low power, low cost, and can be made in a handheld format. The images generated from this system are striking for their radiographic appearance and lack of unwanted ultrasound artifacts. The system could be used to diagnose a variety of acute conditions as well as guide therapies during surgery. The solution proposed by Imperium is based on a proprietary 2-D monolithic integrated array in which a piezoelectric material is deposited on a CMOS integrated circuit, much like an infrared imaging array. The lens-based device produces video quality images which unlike current ultrasound systems, requires no special training to interpret. The proposed solution is a high resolution, real-time, speckle-free, portable, ruggedized camera which will allow for a Crew Medical Officer (CMO) to immediately diagnose internal features and organs. Alternatively, the device could be used to assess the air bubbles in the bloodstream both during and after space flights.",

STAP offers the potential to detect slow moving ground vehicles that would otherwise be obscured by strong background clutter for systems employingconventional beamforming.  In high target density environments, however, the radar data used to train the STAP algorithm will generally contain returns from ground vehicles causing the adaptive algorithm to cancel targets of interest as well as the groundclutter.  The focus of the proposed research is to develop STAP algorithms that are robust to the problems associated with vehicles in the training data.  The proposed algorithms will be tested using both ISL's site-specific radar simulation capabilitiesas well as experimental GMTI radar data.  Implementation issues including computational complexity will be addressed under the proposed program.\"",

The system is being developed for firefighters (estimated 5 year market of over $150 million) but is useful for any application requiring geolocation in buildings where GPS cannot work. Such applications include tracking personnel and equipment in crisis situations, military combat, inventory management and police and military training. This concept has significant advantages over competing technologies; ultra-wideband solutions pose frequency licensing problems, and man-portable inertial units are bulky, costly and have significant time-dependent errors. \n\nThe Wireless Firefighter Lifeline (WFL) system is completely mobile and supports multiple firefighters. It complies with Part 15 rules and will not require FCC licenses. Phase II will demonstrate the underlying technology over a wide range of conditions and will produce a prototype system that will serve as the baseline for future system development. It provides extensive commercial and societal benefit, offers performance superior to that of other potential technologies, and is well positioned to attract further funding.",

To achieve this goal a manufacturable device must be designed and fabrication processes established that result in a unit with extremely small, well controlled diameter orifices of approximately 2 nm through a multi-layered thin film sandwich of insulators and conductors.  \n  \nThe Phase I portion of this program established the methodology of: creating a thin (30 nm) SiN film over a 20 um square window in a 1 cm square silicon frame; Focused Ion Beam (FIB) milling a nanopore; subsequent deposition of a multi-layer thinfilm sandwich of conductor and insulating layers on the surface of SiN film; and building a cartridge to hold and seal the nanopore chip between two liquid cells, and provide electrical terminations for measuring the changes in current, potential, or capacitance resulting in the passage of a DNA molecule chain through the nanopore.  \n  \nIt was found that FIB milling produced a nanopore that was too wide and lacked the required sensitivity to map DNA molecules passing through the nanopore.. A new approach, TEM drilling will be used to achieve nanopores of 2 nm or smaller. Additional work will be invested in optimizing the leads and instrumentation, i.e., patch clamp amplifiers to achieve improved signal-to-noise ratios and increased detection sensitivity.",

The phase I material shows no breakthrough flux of mustard and nerve agents (HD and GB) (actual chemical warfare agents) for over 48 hrs, which exceeds the current 8hrs criteria for suits, as verified by an Army certified laboratory. \n\nThe composition presents a powerful self-decontaminating, triple defense concept- Chemical agent deactivation, barrier effect and biocidal effect. In addition the material is moisture vapor permeable (breathable) but not air permeable. The biocidal activities of the composites against Anthrax surrogate Bacillus var. niger spores and Anthrax spores were firmly established. Typically 4-5 log reductions (total kill) were noted when the samples were exposed to Anthrax, Bacillus spores and other pathogens. The capacity to kill over 70 million anthrax spores! 50 cm2 of the phase I material was recorded. \n\nThe phase II would concentrate on optimizing the assembly of the membrane to an outer shell fabric. The optimization of the thickness, composition, and production parameters will be done. Quantitative kill kinetic curves for aerosolized Anthrax spores and certain viral and bacterial species will be established. The deactivation of chemical agent kinetics and resistance to aerosol penetration will be demonstrated. A reputable team of experts from the Army laboratories and textile industry has been assembled to carry out all the qualifying tests for such a material. The protection factor offered by these suits will be characterized by the Army materials laboratory. Commercial partners have been identified.  \nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:\nThe market size for the protective clothing for civilians, police, medical personnel and fire fighters for domestic preparedness is expected to be 2 billion dollars by year 2004. ICET's market share is estimated to be about 200 million dollars five years after commercial entry.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A recently discovered mechanism of cell injury, the \"Poly (ADP-ribose) Synthetase (PARS) pathway\" has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neuronal injury. Triggered by oxidant-induced DNA single strand breaks, PARS catalyzes an energy-consuming polymerization of ADP-ribose, resulting in NAD depletion, inhibition of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, and the ultimate reduction of intracellular high-energy phosphates, which culminates in neuro injury. The applicants are developing novel classes of compounds with neuroprotective potential. In this proposal, we present evidence that PARS knockout animals, and animals treated with various classes of novel PARS inhibitors PJ34 are resistant against brain trauma. We also present preliminary data with PJ34, a novel, water-soluble, ultrapotent PARS inhibitor.  Inotek's mid-term intention is to develop an ultrapotent PARS inhibitor of the PJ class as a drug for the treatment of neural injury associated with various forms of CNS trauma. The specific aim of the present proposal is to synthesize novel PARS inhibitors, screen them for efficacy and toxicity in vitro and in vivo, and then to perform definitive in vivo studies with selected lead candidates in murine models of brain and spinal cord trauma. In vivo studies will also define the dose-response relationship, frequency of administration, and the therapeutic window. Finally, a single lead compound candidate will be selected, which will undergo formal preclinical safety and pharmacokinetic studies. By the end of a 2-year project, the applicants will be prepared to undertake a human Phase I safety trial with a selected ultrapotent PARS inhibitor with promise of efficacy in CNS trauma. \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The annual domestic impact of brain and spinal cord trauma on the health care market  is estimated at >$750 million.  The worldwide market is four times larger.  Given the absence of a specific, safe, and convenient existing therapy, Inotek anticipates market acceptance to be achieved rapidly, at high levels of penetration, and with a high sustained price point ($1000 per patient).  Estimated worldwide revenues after market entry and maturation (ca. 4 years after FDA approval)=$750 million (annual).",

In particular, we will examine detection of low probability of intercept spread spectrum signals; modulation format recognition;blind demodulation of the identified signal; and wideband signal processing issues.The algorithms we will provide to Army CECOM will be developed and implemented in C and Matlab.  We will demonstrate their use through omputer simulations of blind demodulation scenarios or on ponsor-directed applications.  We will provide research reportsdescribing the background and uses of the algorithms as well as the imulation results.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II research project proposes to develop user-friendly component software for classical econometric estimation and inference based on simulation methods, such as maximum simulated likelihood, method of simulated moments, and efficient method of moments. In the last decade different simulation-based methods have been developed to tackle complex economic/statistical models which cannot be estimated by conventional methods such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Although these simulation-based estimators have desirable theoretical properties, they have remained as research topics in academia and have not become useful tools for practitioners because of the lack of user friendly software. Building upon the Phase I research and development, Insightful (formerly MathSoft) plans to study two classes of models: mixed logit models for discrete choice analysis which represent cross sectional and panel data problems, and models for term structure of interest rates which represent discrete time and continuous time structural models. Extensive Monte Carlo experiments will be used to explore finite sample properties of various aspects of simulation, estimation and forecasting, with an aim of improving and stabilizing the current algorithms. The user-friendly component software will be developed using both object oriented S-Plus language and the state-of-art JavaBean technology, and it will provide intuitive graphical user interface. The S-Plus functions of the technology proffered by Insightful for econometric estimation and inference will serve the purpose of quickly gaining a broad user base, while the JavaBeans can be used to develop custom applications. The software will help economists and practitioners in other fields such as the financial industry, social sciences, and biotechnology to conduct flexible and extensible model estimation and inference.",

        "abstract": "Functional data arise in many fields of medical research, with examples from studies of growth patterns, gait, melanoma incidence rates, CD4 counts and many other areas. Indeed, any set of measurements gathered over time (or space), including time dependent covariates in survival analysis, may be thought of as functional data. There are many advantages of viewing such data as functions rather than disconnected points, perhaps the most important being the ability to routinely including derivative information into the analysis. Historically, functional data has been analyzed using multi-variate or time series methods, but these methods do not work well for irregularly spaced data or data measured at different times for different subjects. Recent advances make it possible to analyze such data as functions Here we propose to implement an S-Plus module for functional data analysis. This module will e a commercial implementation of the exploratory methods developed by Ramsay and Silverman (1997), with many extensions, including new methods for generalized linear models, survival analysis, and non-linear least square models, and extension to functions with different bases.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract verbatim): Identification and segmentation of    \n the constituent parts of a human brain in three-dimensional (3-D) magnetic         \n resonance imaging (MRI) studies is a starting point for much of the current        \n research into human brain structure and function. Accurate segmentation and        \n registration allows clinicians and researchers to track and measure changes in     \n the brain over time. Manual brain morphometry is a laborious and time consuming    \n task. The voluminous amount of data and the specialized knowledge required to      \n manually analyze a human brain image preclude clinical studies from rapidly        \n moving forward. In order to address this problem, we propose the creation of a     \n commercial software package that would register and normalize a subject's brain    \n image to a digital atlas of neuroanatomy as well as rigidly align two brain        \n images. Anatomic labels identified on the atlas can then be automatically          \n mapped to segment the corresponding structures in the registered subject image.    \n Normalizing to an atlas allows measurements of brain structure and function        \n from a group of subjects to be compared with respect to the reference space        \n established by the atlas. Rigid alignment of two brain images allows the           \n detection of changes in longitudinal studies. Our software will also provide       \n tools for region-of-interest analysis. We believe that the ability to              \n automatically make structural and functional measurements and to detect changes    \n in the brain is a major advantage of our approach.                                 \n PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\n There is no commercial software available that allows 3-D MR brain images to be\n automatically registered to an atlas, along with performing atlas-derived measurements.\n Our software would fill a niche in the conduct of brain imaging studies in the pharmaceutical\n industry and address the needs of academic researchers.  Part of our commercialization\n plan will be to provide a brain mapping service for customers who require standardized\n protocols or who cannot afford to access the necessary resources in terms of personnel,\n software, hardware, and training.  These customers would securely transmit their MRI brain\n data to MathSoft over the Internet for processing and receive the output electronically.  This\n technology can be extended to the segmentation of other parts of the body.  Another\n commercially attractive direction for future application of this software is screening and\n characterization for animal imaging studies.",

Prostate boundaries in TRUS images provide the anatomical description needed for diagnosis, for treatment planning, and for follow-up. Our proposed research enables computer aided prostate delineation using \"just-enough interaction\" with the expert. \n\nIn phase I, we have embedded several segmentation algorithms within a software environment allowing interaction with the physicians. The variability in (semi-)automated prostate delineation compared to manual delineation was reduced by half. Also, the delineation time compared to manual outlining was reduced by a factor of 2. \n\nBased on the feedback from several companies and end-users, who have shown interest in our technology, we find that in the past year, emerging intraoperative clinical procedures and post-treatment monitoring techniques have necessitated further automation and generated the need for prostate specific multimodality image registration algorithms. In phase II, we aim to further reduce human interaction in prostate delineation without compromising on algorithm performance by developing and validating more advanced segmentation algorithms. We will automate post-implant monitoring by segmenting the prostate from post-implant TRUS images by developing advanced segmentation and registration algorithms. We will validate the algorithms on large clinical dataset.\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:\nOur technology is of great interest to vendors of prostate cancer treatment planning systems, be it in the area of prostate brachyltherapy or in prostate cryotherapy. The movement of radiation treatment planning systems to inter-operative settings make automated delineation technology even more valuable to these vendors.

A major benefit of using agents to implement the simulation is that the network specific agents such as the explorer, worm, and node agents can be almost directly ported to embedded radio hardwareto implement the actual system.\"",

        "abstract": "\"During Phase I , IAI performed link budget analysis for using TM-UWB radios in IW sensor scenarios. We showed that 25mbps at 5miles is achievable in the near future. We have conductedextensive comparison of comparison of different antennaconfigurations, including diamond dipole antenna, Broadspecantenna, corner reflectors, and dish reflectors. We alsodeveloped several radio control programs to demonstrate theintegration of UWB's ranging and communication capability. Forexample, users can transfer files or send real-time messageswirelessly while tracking the distance between two radios.Another major effort we did for Phase I was to optimizecommunication performance of current UWB hardware. Weexperimentally evaluate several different communication schemes,and system parameters. We were able to obtain up to 1.25 mbpsover more than 200 feet with current UWB radios. In many IWapplications, moving (air or ground) vehicles are used to collectthe sensor data, so it is important to make sure radios canacquire signals and remain locked at higher speed. Therefore, wehave evaluated effects of vehicle motion on UWB communication.The results showed that UWB radios can work at more than 35 milesper hours. Higher speed tests will be conducted in Phase II.BENEFITS: While IW sensors do not represent a very large commercial market, the basic technology has very large commercial potential.

The proposed models are: (i) Data-sharing DST integration model: In this model, DSTs will primarily share data that is required for each DST to take a decision before an event happens. Based on the shared data each DST acts independently (ii) Interacting DST integration model: In this model, DSTs not only share data but also advise each other to act in such a way to reduce the level of conflict.

Low cost components which can measure delays down to 3 picoseconds are now available, and these now make it practical to build TM-UWB radar and communication systems which have no carrier signal. The only signals transmitted are single pulses. Impulses in the time domain generate very wide bandwidth signals in the frequency domain, and the signals generated by our current hardware have bandwidths in the gigahertz range. Because of this wide bandwidth, TM-UWB radar and radio is virtually impossible to detect and difficult to jam. TM-UWB radio requires no frequency allocation since energy is effectively transmitted on a wide band of frequencies simultaneously. Multiple non-interfering channels can be implemented in a single radio, hence very high data rates can be achieved, and the conventional problems with multipath do not affect TM-UWB. Because all that is transmitted is binary pulses, implementation of electronically steerable phased array systems is easy and effective. True time delay, the goal of past phased array development, becomes easy to achieve with TM-UWB radio and radar.",

        "abstract": "Our approach to aircraft wiring inspection is to inject a special type of low level probe signal into the cable to be tested.  The system response to this special input can be used to give the complete transfer function of the cable.  Incipient failures in the cable will be detectable as subtle changes in that transfer function, or cross-correlation between probe input signal and response, including discontinuities which cause signal reflections and hence standing waves.  Even very low probe signals can be used, and the test can be done on-line while the circuit is doing its normal function.  The required electronics can be fabricated into a low-cost single chip which would be built into the system or even built into the connector.  In this mode, the probe signal and test would be executing continuously.  Alternatively, the approach can be used offline.  Since very low level probe signals can be used, in many cases these signals can be induced into the cable and measured without disconnecting the cable.  We have been able to detect chafing, fouling, carbonization of insulation shorts and open faults.

Disruption of the internal auditory artery during surgical procedures to remove acoustic neuromas (ANs) probab'y account for many cases of postoperative deafness. Also, many cases of clinical SNHL, such as sudden SNHL, are thought to involve reduction of CBF. Previous experiments have demonstrated the utility of measuring cochlear blood flow using laser-Doppler flowmetry techniques. This proposal involves the refinement and clinical human testing of a novel otic probe and instrumentation capable of measuring CBF and electrocochleographic potentials. The probe will also have treatment capability in the form of irrigation and suction to present medications to the round window and inner ear. Phase I results demonstrated the feasibility of these functions in animal experiments using a prototype probe. In Phase II, a refined probe will be used to test safety and efficacy during human surgery. Ultimately, it is anticipated that this instrumentation will be used (1) intraoperatively to assist surgeons in preserving hearing during AN removal; (2) in research applications to elucidate the role of CBF in SNHL; (3) in the clinic for diagnosis and treatment of SNHL caused by vascular insufficiency.",

The objective of this research project proposal is to continue development of a prototype system design which has demonstrated feasibility to operate on natural gas or propane; both well-established burner-tipfeedstock at 100% of CONUS and 85% of world-wide base operations. The proposed design is one-twentieth in size to today's typical hydrogen fueling process systems and enhanced beta designs utilizing porous media reforming demonstrate the feasibility tooperate on JP-logistic fuels. Phase II will pursue advanced development of a small-scale hydrogen production prototype for direct fueling PEMFCs and simultaneous processing of high-purity hydrogen for multiple FC applications on the USAF flightline.Performance and durability validation testing is proposed to be performed by the DoD Fuel Cell Test & Evaluation Center for credibility toward commercialization.\"",

In Phase I, IDI produced and field tested three voice-activated programs that allow women with and without breast cancer to engage in \"face-to- face\" virtual dialogues with an oncologist, a nurse practitioner, and a breast cancer survivor. The research findings showed that significant learning gain concerning breast self-exam, risk factors, risk reduction, early detection, diagnostic procedures, and treatment occurred with this method, Also, subjects reported increased feelings of confidence regarding their ability to communicate with health professionals and distinct feelings of emotional support from their virtual dialogues. In Phase II, IDI will enhance and expand the Patient Education on Breast Cancer Series and specifically evaluate the capability of the virtual dialogue method to enhance communication between patients and health care providers. Five additional programs will be developed to include additional breast cancer experts and survivor perspectives. The programs will be field tested at the Lombardi Cancer Center of Georgetown University and on three campuses of George Mason University by female subjects of diverse ages, ethnicity, and socioeconomic backgrounds.

ICS is proposing to integrate Livingstone into an existing end-to-end architecture for real-time command and control. This flight proven architecture has been demonstrated recently with the NASA FUSE program. Adding the Livingstone component would fill a void in the SCL architecture and would significantly augment the capability of the spacecraft or rover for onboard autonomy. A significant deviation from the expected behavior of the model would be flagged to the inference engine. This would add an enhanced flexibility and versatility of the system in allowing the user or operator to use dynamic scripts and rules in order to complement a model and support progressive autonomy as necessary.ICS believes that the two technologies are highly complementary and would greatly benefit autonomous operations. The key to success is in the tight integration of those technologies into a flight proven environment and supported by an integrated ground development system. This includes the insertion of Livingstone in the flight architecture but also addresses the modifications of the ground development tools to merge the model-based and rule-based languages.",

Manual leak detection, using ultrasonic technology, was successfully demonstrated at Johnson Space Center by a project team within ES using techniques for leak detection in pressurized aircraft. Manual surveys are intrusive to space craft activities and crews. An automated process of leak detection and location is needed. IVC proposes to do this with (a) existing space qualified hardware, (b) an addition of wideband ultrasonic transducers, and (c) new smart software algorithms that process emitted leak energy in a manner that results in detection and location of the leak. The uniqueness of the proposed approach is the use of large numbers of self-powered, miniaturized, stick on ultrasonic sensory nodes that are all synchronized within a radio frequency network and are self calibrating. The network provides the data paths and synchronization. Ultrasonic transducers can act as transmitters as well as receivers. Thus the sensor network calibrates itself thus increasing detection and location accuracy. Numbers of MicroWIS units (organized into such networks) have already been flown on Shuttle and station and have operated in a completely non-intrusive manner in regard to radio frequency, physical encumbrance, and astronaut time.",

These sensors must measure ambient CO2 concentrations with an accuracy better than \u00bf1 ppm, at ambient pressures as low as 0.1 atm, and at temperatures that may fall to \u00bf60\u00bfC.  This project will develop a new class of Micro Electrical Mechanical System (MEMS)-based \u00bfsensors-on-a-chip\u00bf for CO2 concentration measurement.  These sensors will be compact, rugged, use low power, and low cost (< $20 each), and will combine all of the pieces for non-dispersive infrared spectroscopy into one component.  As optical sensors they are self-calibrating and not limited by ambient temperature or pressure.  In Phase I, detection of CO2 with the MEMS component was demonstrated at a precision of +0.15% over a very wide range of operating temperatures and pressures, using a lightweight, compact, multiple reflection optical cell that allowed rapid gas transfer.  Because the ultimate resolution was limited by noise in prototype electronic circuits, Phase II will improve the electronics to increase precision by a factor of five.  In addition, known temperature-sensitive materials will be used to further redesign the sensor chip to increase precision by another factor of ten, giving a +0.1 ppm accuracy instrument.  The prototype instrument will be field-tested and compared to existing instruments to demonstrate this precision.

Technical solutions that prove cost effective in the long haul arena are proving prohibitive to the implementation of optical communication for shorter distance applications.  Devices must be developed that will permit the advantages of optical communication to be realized over shorter distances, eventually leading to the integration of optical communication within individual computer chips for ultra high speed computing.  This project will use self-assembled, silicon-quantum-dot nanocomposites and related deposition processes to produce high precision micro-optical circuits that are \u00bftuned,\u00bf through local exposure to deep ultra violet radiation, for response after fabrication.  The Phase I effort screened materials and produced both ring resonator devices and Mach Zender interferometers with the self-assembled nanocomposites.  The response of the ring resonator devices was trimmed over a broad range.  Also, the ability of the interferometer to optimize transmission was altered with non-contact photoexposure.  Phase II will continue the nanocomposite engineering for microphotonic applications, develop designs and modeling tools to capitalize on the nanocomposite properties, and develop a precision local exposure tool to precision-trim the photonic circuits.  The results obtained from these three parallel efforts will be combined to construct and test precision-ring-resonator-based, all-optical, add-drop multiplexers for use in optical communication.

This configuration will include the camerathat will display imagery on a GFE HMD via a short-range covert wireless link.  This thermal weapon sight will only be 1.5x1.5x2.5 inches and mechanically hardened for operation while mounted to handheld weapons with a standard Picatinny Rail.  This cameracan be configured over an RS-232 link and includes non-volatile memory so that the camera can operate based on previously stored configuration data without the presence of an active control link.  The high degree of miniaturization is achieved through theuse of three unique innovations: elimination of TEC or DSP for providing temperature compensation; elimination of shutters or other techniques for re-calibration based on optics temperature changes; and, densification of the remaining electronics throughthe use of 3-D stacking.\"",

        "abstract": "Even with multi-layer insulation blankets, cryogenic thermal switches, thermal distribution systems (such as cryogenic heat pipes), and advanced thermal/structural isolation systems, the mission capability of a fully-passive, stored cryogen system is compromised by the lack of an active cooler to recharge the system. This shortcoming is particularly acute at very low temperatures ( 30 Hz) required to enable small, compact designs typical of existing flexure-bearing, space-qualified cryocoolers. Irvine Sensors Corporation proposes to develop an advanced regenerator, based upon the use of novel rare earth metal matrix designs to enable very-low-temperature Stirling and pulse tube cryocoolers for both ground and space applications. The matrix will offer the combined benefits of low porosity and an extremely high surface-area-to-volume ratio, both of which are essential for very low temperature operation. Our goal is to achieve a 50 percent improvement in efficiency for high-frequency regenerators operating around a cold head temperature of 5 K.",

        "abstract": "Because chondrocytes in culture are phenotypically unstable, techniques to grow tissue-engineered cartilage for the repair of injured or arthritic joints have met with limited success. Using human donor chondroctyes, we have developed an innovative method for producing what we call neocartilage, a viable, biomechanically stable tissue that we plan to commercialize for the repair of chondral defects in knee joints. Unlike native adult cartilage, which has no capacity for continued growth or repair, the chondrocytes in our neocartilage continue to produce cartilage molecules, resulting in a cartilage tissue that has the potential to repair chondral defects resulting from trauma. In this proposal , we will optimize tissue culture techniques needed for neocartilage production. As a preface to the transplantation studies, we will optimize methods for fixation of neocartilage allografts to the host tissue. In addition, we will evaluate the structural, biochemical, and biomechanical properties of the neocartilage allografts both pre- and post- transplanation in a weight-bearing sheep model. This proposal is unique because it combines biomechanical and biochemical methods of evaluating integrative repair of cartilage defects. We anticipate that upon completion of this proposal, the necessary data will be available to design a pre-clinical study for presentation to the FDA. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Our IstoCyte neocartilage has the potential to repair damaged chondral lesions in injured joints perhaps preventing these lesions from destroying bone and cartilage. Furthermore, the neocartilage allograft can offer arthritis patients an alternative to current therapies, perhaps preventing osteoarthritis or delaying total joint replacement.",

Two thin-film photovoltaics technologies are presently vying for use in space applications; copper-indium-gallium-diselenide (CIGS), and amorphous silicon. This proposal focuses on efficiency improvements to the CIS-alloy technologies by the continued development of a third possibility, copper-indium-aluminum-diselenide (CIAS). This wide-bandgap thin-film technology will be deposited by co-evaporation at low substrate temperatures on sub-bandgap light transparent back contacts and lightweight, flexible and sub-bandgap light transparent polyimide substrates. To achieve the optimum bandgap of about 1.45 eV for the space solar spectrum, less than half the amount of aluminum (Al) is needed in CIAS, then gallium (Ga) in CIGS. Thus, using Al may avoid a concentration limit (bandgap limit) similar to the amount of Ga in CIGS for the degradation of material electrical quality due to Ga-Ga defect complexes. Other advantages of the proposed technology include: higher-efficiency modules due to lower resistive and distributed diode losses; higher-efficiency modules at higher operating temperatures due to more favorable temperature coefficients of cell parameters and complete IR transmission; potential for backside array visible light collection, and high end-of-life-efficiency modules due to inherent charged particle radiation resistance of CIS based alloys.",

Recent data now indicate that patients with recurrent urolithiasis have a lower prevalence rate of Oxf in their stools than non-stone forming individuals. In addition, urinary oxalate levels are higher in non-colonized individuals as compared to colonized individuals. This indicates a clinical need for a test that can identify non-colonized individuals. Phase I of this grant resulted in the development of a reliable and rapid PCR ELISA-based microtiter plate assay for the detection of Oxf in human fecal samples. Pre-clinical performance data for the test (Le. its analytical sensitivity, analytical specificity, precision and reproducibility) were obtained as per the NCCLS guidelines. In Phase II of this project, we propose to complete the development of a production prototype of the XEntrix(TM) O. formigenes Monitor Kit. Analytical and clinical performance of the prototypic test kit will be determined in a multicentre clinical trial. The clinical studies have been designed not only to validate the test kit but also to strengthen the utility of Oxf determination as a diagnostic tool for the assessment of risk for calcium oxalate urolithiasis. By end of the proposed Phase II studies, we will have sufficient analytical and clinical performance data on this diagnostic kit to seek a pre-market approval under section 510K of the Food Drugs and Cosmetic Act, from the Center for Devices and Radiological Health.",

It causes about 300 million\nclinical case of malaria and 2-3 million deaths annually. There is no vaccine\nagainst malaria, so selection of drug resistant malaria parasites has been a\nmajor factor in increased malaria morbidity and mortality in the last two\ndecades. The few drugs that have been developed are too expensive for routine\nuse in malaria treatment in most developing countries where the main burden of\ndisease is felt. Inhibitors of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) like\npyrimethamine have been excellent antimalarials, but point mutations in the\ntarget gene compromised its effectiveness. The PS series of drugs are\nbiguanides that are metabolized to triazines that also inhibit the P.\nfalciparum DHFR. In Phase I, we have shown that these triazines do not show\ncross-resistance to any of the previously tested inhibitors of the P.\nfalciparum DHFR, pyrimethamine, cycloguanil or chlorcycloguanil. In addition,\nwe have recently discovered that these compounds are effective inhibitors of\nthe DHFR enzyme from P. vivax, the most prevalent human malaria parasite. A\nclinical candidate has been selected based on 90 day oral studies in mice. This\nproposal is to support the preclinical safety assessment to bring this\ncandidate to the clinic, to continue the yeast genetics program providing field\nmonitoring for the development of resistance, and to extend the mechanism of\naction studies.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a digital video surveillance system prototype. Over the past few years, video surveillance systems have been moving from analog to digital. The success of a digital video surveillance system depends on three key enabling technologies: compression, search and retrieval and network transmission. Existing commercial systems generally use standard video compression techniques, which often result in higher memory and bandwidth requirements and jerky object motion. In current video search and retrieval, the existing systems offer only search-by-time and no search-by-content. In network transmission, today's systems use relatively simple techniques that tend to make remote monitoring slow and sluggish. The company is using a highly efficient compression algorithm that exploits the special characteristics of surveillance video and is based on a segmentation technique. This technique, when applied to video search and retrieval, leads to search-by-content, which is more efficient and effective in practical applications. Finally the proposed system will employ fast network transport protocols and scalability techniques to make remote monitoring faster, uninterrupted by network traffic surges, and to allow display on a range of user devices.\nThis digital video surveillance system can be used to maintain the security of banks, airports, government buildings, corporate sites, homes, and small businesses. It can also be used to monitor the performance and operating conditions of machines and equipment",

The sensitivity and stability of the ESLI will be assessed and optimized accordingly.  The overall performance of the ESLI willbe optimized by conducting ex-situ testing.  In addition, shelf-life tests will be conducted followed by optimization of the ESLI performance, if needed.  The design and optimum location of the ESLI in the mask filter will be determined.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project proposes to research ways to increase accessibility and utilization of microdata from censuses of the U.S. and other countries in secondary school and college courses in mathematics. A seamless, XML-driven interface to a web server at the Minnesota Population Center will make it possible for teachers and students to specify, request, and import this microdata into Fathom Dynamic Statistics software. Enhancements to Fathom software will increase its already considerable ease and power for working with census microdata; curriculum materials in mathematics will provide teachers with effective ways to begin working with this highly motivating data--both to teach existing content and to teach data literacy. Phase I research suggested strong similarities between census microdata and school census microdata data that is gathered by K-12 schools about student demographics and performance, course offerings, and classroom practice. Accordingly, Phase II leverages this overlap to produce greatly needed interfaces for easily accessing school census microdata, survey tools for producing it, and extensions to Fathom for analyzing it. KCP Technologies' census microdata project exploits the merging web connectivity in American schools, thus symbiotically fitting a larger pattern of evolution of school technologies. The project offers a product that supports analysis of complex data through an easy-to-use interface which will contribute to data anlysis and learning from data analysis.

        "abstract": "There is an immediate and growing need for technology to remediate groundwater and soils contaminated with methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) as well as with associated benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) compounds. Gasoline containing MTBE has leaked into groundwater, presenting both health risks and objectionable odor and taste in lakes, aquifers, and urban wells in 49 states. Due to the specific physical and chemical properties of MTBE, conventional technologies cannot remediate MTBE-contaminated groundwater satisfactorily. In the Phase I research project, KSE, Inc., established the technical feasibility of a novel technology to remediate MTBE-contaminated groundwater and soils. One major innovation provides a novel technology to completely destroy MTBE and BTEX in air from groundwater strippers or soil vapor extraction. Extremely low temperature catalytic oxidation has been achieved with a new class of catalysts designed specifically for these compounds. Operating temperatures of 30-80\u00bfC were achieved. The new catalyst activity is orders of magnitude greater than that of the traditional platinum alumina catalyst. The low temperature operation allows use of advanced design materials to further lower pollution control costs to 5-15 percent of those of conventional methods. With the commercialization of this new class of catalysts, an inexpensive, compact, and effective technique will be available for cleaning up groundwater and soils contaminated by fuel oxygenates, avoiding the cost and size of traditional high temperature catalytic oxidizers, with their attendant heat exchangers and piping systems. This new class of catalysts will be commercialized in the Phase II research project. The project involves catalyst optimization and kinetic studies offering both mechanistic insight and design procedures. Large-scale prototype operation will be undertaken to demonstrate both the catalyst performance and such materials of construction as fiberglass-reinforced plastic, made possible by the low temperature catalyst operation. A competitive cost analysis of the technology relative to other alternatives will be performed for MTBE remediation. It is anticipated that a cost-effective technology will be developed for remediation of MTBE-contaminated groundwater that is capable of rapid deployment.",

The purpose of this project is to develop an anti-I. scapiilaris vaccine to block tick attachment and tick-mediated disease transmission. Rabbits or guinea pigs infested with I. scapularis acquire antibody-mediated resistance to tick bites, a phenomenon known as \"tick-immunity.''\nPhase I experiments evaluated Salp13 and Salp25D, two recombinant proteins expressed from\nI. scapularis salivary gland cDNAs, as candidate vaccines. Guinea pigs immunized with a combination of the two recombinant proteins demonstrated host resistance to tick bites. Phase II specific aims are to: (a) produce prototype Salp 13 and Salp25D vaccines suitable for extensive testing in animal models; (b) investigate Salp 13 and Salp25D contributions to the tick bite-induced tick immunity; and (c) determine if immunization with an optimized Salp13/Salp25D vaccine blocks pathogen transmission from ticks. These experiments will lead to Phase III development of a new vaccine designed to protect against multiple tick-borne pathogens.\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nA vaccine against Ixodes scapiilaris tick bites would potentially protect against several pathogens, including B. burgdorferi, Babesia microti, and the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis.

        "abstract": "\"Simulation of the real world has long been recognized as an effective means for testing military equipment. However, effective testing requires that simulation be of high fidelity. It becomes paramount, therefore, to model accurately the environment inwhich simulation takes place. For human-in-the-loop testing, the need for fidelity places severe demands upon display technology; demands that push the limits of virtual imagery with respect to resolution, brightness, field of view, and contrast ratio.This is particularly true when a display must be HUD compatible; i.e., when imagery must be projected from infinity. The Air Force's Preflight Integration of Munitions and Electronic Systems (PRIMES) facility provides a simulated environment wherein testsare conducted within an RF anechoic chamber.

During our Phase I program, we identified and demonstrated via proof-of-concept testing a combination of display technologies thatprovides infinity-based out-the-window imagery without involving either electronic or metallic surfaces within the chamber.

        "abstract": "This proposal requests SBIR Phase II support to complete and field test language intervention software designed to promote syntactic development in school-age children (5-12 years old).  Language delays are pervasive among school-age children. What's more, two thirds of children identified as having language-specific impairments previously nor have received any form of language intervention during their preschool years. Consequently, there is a clear need to develop language intervention strategies designed specifically to meet the needs of this population; that is, intervention designed to promote development of the more advanced syntactic constructions typically missing from the grammar of these children. In Phase I, a curriculum was developed for introducing the syntax of interrogative operators. Curriculum design was guided by contemporary linguistic research, which suggests ways in which treatment may be improved and more successful outcomes achieved. Software was developed to deliver parts of this curriculum, and was integrated with an artificial intelligence component capable of generating individualized lessons based on emerging competencies. Twenty-six kindergartners used the software successfully during field- testing. In Phase II these efforts will be expanded by developing an integrated series of language intervention modules and verifying that the modules are effective under typical classroom conditions. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Speech-language pathologists, teachers and parents recognize the importance of intervention when a child's language status is impaired, and such intervention is mandated by Federal Law. As such, we anticipate that our computer-based language intervention system, designed to facilitate language development in school-age children, will be a commercial success and will fulfill an unmet need for individual services.",

Visible light photon counters (VLPCs), fabricated several years ago, showed significant promise but suffered from significant variations in gain.  This project will utilize epitaxial process expertise to develop a new generation of VPLCs with improved properties, including much narrower gain dispersion and lower cost.  In Phase I, eighty 5-inch wafers were produced, 10 each of 8 different combinations of donor and acceptor doping.  Low defect density and excellent uniformity were demonstrated.  In Phase II, visible light photon counters will be fabricated from the Phase I wafers and tested.  Based on the results, the design will be modified and a second round of epitaxial wafers will be grown.  Devices fabricated from the second round will be provided to end-users.

In this context, availability of medical devices can enhance          \n medical care to the patient.                                                       \n                                                                                    \n Blood cell counters, which are used to count blood components such as red and      \n white blood cells, are ubiquitous in medicine as a diagnostic aid for disease      \n identification or as a general tool for many medical therapies. The pre-eminent    \n device in use today is the Coulter counter, which is expensive, large, and         \n generally not portable, requiring at least a desktop, household current supply     \n and a small support laboratory. The goal of this research and development          \n project is to design a prototype miniature blood cell counter for home-care, or    \n point-of-care analysis in doctors' offices, clinics, and hospitals.                \n\n The novel blood counter we propose to develop is based on new, emerging            \n micromachine technologies, and would be approximately the size of a small          \n cell-phone, requiring very low electrical power. Similar to an inkjet print        \n head, which is also a product of micromachined fluidics technology, the core       \n analytical components of the miniature blood counter would be inexpensively        \n mass-produced.

        "abstract": "Inflatable membrane concentrators for space solar power currently have two large weight penalties. The extra inflatant needed to make up for gas leaked through construction defects or meteoroid holes can dominate system weight for long missions. Also the inefficiency of the canopy over the reflector can be great, requiring doubling the reflector\u00bfs size to compensate. We plan to make the inflatable membrane concentrators for space solar power viable by reducing these two largest weight penalties. We can greatly reduce the first penalty by lowering inflation pressure to a minimum by constructing the reflector from formed gores, requiring essentially zero strain to obtain the desired shape. We will learn in laboratory testing how to seam such formed gores to retain surface accuracy. Thus we allow large hybrid reflectors of combined, formed gores to be made. The second penalty can be reduced by selecting proper canopy configurations to minimize oblique incidence of solar energy and by applying anti-reflection coatings. We will perform a system configuration study and laboratory tests to learn how to do this. Thus we will make viable the replacement of hard reflectors with inexpensive, light-weight, and easily deployed inflatable membranes.",

The Phase-I effort has extended our knowledge of pulsepropagation effects in the atmosphere, and has paved the way for the development of new innovative laser and lidar systems to produce and exploit long-distance light filamentation. In Phase-II, we will construct and field-test a high-power UV transmitterfor the purpose of demonstrating long-distance pulse propagation in the atmosphere. The long-term commercialization goal of this project is to develop commercial and military hardware to produce and exploit long-distance light filaments in the atmosphere.Potential applications of light-strings are: (1) lidar sources for measuring the density and distribution of molecular and chemical species in the atmosphere; (2) generating plasma channels for controlled lightning discharge; and (3) generating precisionpoint sources for use as guidestar beacons in adaptive optics systems. Light filaments have potential military utility in chemical and biological stand-off detection, and laser weapons delivery systems (adaptive optics).\"",

        "abstract": "NASA is actively pursuing the development of technologies that enable satellite-based laser wind sounding. Of particular interest are technologies that enable tropospheric wind profiling at low cost and high efficiency. Traditional laser-based wind sensors utilize coherent-mode detection, which depend on high aerosol concentrations to measure wind fields, and are therefore not suited for tropospheric wind profiling where the aerosol concentration is low. Direct-detection lidars do not suffer from this restriction because they can sense backscattered radiation from moving molecules as well as aerosols. A key component required for direct-detection lidars is a high-power, single-frequency, efficient, conduction-cooled UV laser transmitter.

Micronucleus (MN) formation is an endpoint which can be used to detect DNA damage resulting from clastogenic or aneugenic mechanisms. A sensitive and high throughput system to measure human blood for MN would have a myriad of biomonitoring applications. For example, such a system could provide information regarding the chromosome damaging activity of new drugs undergoing clinical trials, chemotherapy regimens, as well as accidental radiation or chemical exposures. A goal of the current application is to optimize methods developed during Phase 1 that allow for the flow cytometric measurement of MN in human reticulocytes (RETs0. Experiments are planned to test whether MN-RET measurements represent a sensitive indicator of cytogenetic damage. To achieve this goal, our Phase II aims are to. 1. COMPLETE optimization of cell staining and handling procedures. 2. DEVELOP biological standards to aid the calibration of flow cytometer parameters. 3. MEASURE the time-course and magnitude of MN-RET induction in radiotherapy and radio-plus chemo-therapy patients before and during the course of treatment. 4. MEASURE the time-course and magnitude of MN-RET induction in radiotherapy and radio-plus chemo-therapy patients before and during the course of treatment. 5.

PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The successful completion of this research project will enable Litron Laboratories to become an expert facility, capable of performing cytogenetic measurements on human blood samples on a fee-for-fee service basis. Additionally, by developing the necessary reagents into kit format, it will be possible to make this technology available to other laboratories having access to a single-laser flow cytometer.

Mechanical flex and shear property tests showed the expected increase in modulus with density and strengths sufficient to enable handling without breakage. Data from electron radiation exposure tests and theoretical modeling agreed well for the three densities thus there is confidence in modeling prediction that a 20-mil (0.051 cm) PolyRAD shield can reduce the annual TID in GEO to less than 5 krads/year. These technical performances, combined with its simple and low-cost application to individual parts or large board, are a clear indication that PolyRAD can reliably and cost effectively enable successful commercial and NASA/DOD space applications of state-of-the-art, commercial-off-the-shelf microelectronics.

At low x-ray energies (< 600 eV), the reinforcing fiber structure will have significantly higher transmission than the often-required metal mesh which it would replace. At higher energies above 3 keV, the Kevlar or carbon reinforcement will be nearly invisible, and improvements in mission throughput will be even more significant.

The results also demonstrated that this method for ammonia production has the potential to reduce production costs thus significantly lowering the cost of fertilizer (80 percent of the ammonia produced is converted to fertilizer) reducing the financial burden on the agricultural community. During the Phase I effort Lynntech's researchers overcame not only the difficulties associated with the chemistry but also many of the difficulties associated with the engineering. Many of the cell components were engineered using new techniques developed in house by Lynntech's technical staff. The goal of the Phase II effort is to use the technical know-how gained in the Phase I to build and test a prototype ammonia generator capable of producing 1 kg of ammonia per day.

Additional work will be done to improve the yield of the disinfectant, to examine various additives, and to conduct antimicrobial experiments in accordance with EPA test requirements.\nThe commercial applications of this project will be in the areas of domestic/personal healthcare, food service and healthcare delivery",

They operate closer to the ground and at lower cost than satellites, while being capable of staying over a small area for extended periods and remaining aloft for extended periods. The current generation of vehicles for fixed duration operations are based on conventional turbine or piston technology and have flight times limited to one or two days. There are no potential improvements that could extend this time to a week or longer. Missions of this duration can be achieved by electrically driven craft using liquid hydrogen fuel with a lightweight proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell to generate electricity using ambient air as the oxygen source. Fuel cells have adequate performance for this application without the need for precompression, as used with combustion engines, even when operated at the low pressures present at high altitudes (2 psia at 50,000 ft), but current densities are limited, requiring high active areas. Success requires lighter fuel cell hardware than is currently available. The proposed project will demonstrate a novel fuel cell architecture that substantially reduces the weight of a fuel cell stack.",

All the conventional techniques are based on DNA/RNA hybridization to a complementary DNA sequence of interest anchored to asurface.  The proposed method is based on electrophoretically separating and directing a single DNA/RNA molecule fragment of interest through a simple, self-assembled nanopore detector.  The method implies unprecedented sensitivity and uncomplicateddetection of each nucleobase and will offer a rapid, direct \"reading\" of a single DNA or RNA molecule as it passes through the detector.  In Phase I work to date, detection of DNA has been accomplished with AC-impedance spectroscopy, severalelectrochemical redox species that interact with DNA have been identified, nanopores have been inserted in membrane bilayers using a-hemolysin for DNA/RNA transport, and a unique sampling system for potential biological warfare agents has been developed.The Phase II project will provide and optimize integration of sampling and detection steps, increased speed and sensitivity, and further miniaturization of \"on-chip\" analysis in a field device.\"",

        "abstract": "New environmental regulations have identified many of the currently used oxidizing agents employed for industrial waste control, disinfection, and wastewater treatment as a caveat that must be addressed. Ferrate has potential for becoming the alternative of choice because of its aggressive oxidation properties and its negligible impact on the environment. However, there has been little industrial interest in ferrate because of the high cost of production. All known methods of ferrate synthesis are extremely expensive and hence, less effective oxidizing agents that are much more affordable to produce are commonly employed. During Phase I, Lynntech, Inc., developed an environmentally benign electrochemical process for the production of greater than 98 percent pure potassium ferrate that is at least one-tenth the cost of conventional methods. The most attractive features of this process are its reliance on low-cost starting materials\u00bfmost of which are recyclable, and the elimination of expensive ion exchange membranes. Utilizing continuous magnetic separation of ferrate from the electrochemical cell ensures that this process is ideally suited for industrial use. In Phase II, Lynntech, Inc., proposes to optimize ferrate production and extraction to develop a continuous, online system for yearly production of up to 100 kg of high-purity product. This project involves a collaborative effort between Lynntech, Inc., and leading companies in the specialty chemicals industry to develop this innovative process of ferrate production for implementation in the commercial marketplace. Widespread applications of oxidizing agents range from disinfection and sterilization to wastewater treatment and removal of hazardous waste materials as well as batteries and catalytic synthesis of explosives. However, many of the currently available oxidants are limited by the requirement of harmful starting materials or the generation of large volumes of negative-value byproducts. Ferrate has been shown to be effective in many of these applications, where the only byproduct of oxidation is environmentally benign rust. Lynntech, Inc., already has demonstrated the effectiveness of ferrate utilization in aluminum conversion coatings and nuclear waste remediation, which have combined markets in excess of $4 billion.",

Current technologies based upon ELISAs can not meet NASA needs as it only quantitate a single protein at a time. Due to the complicated procedure for antibody immobilization, limited stability, and poor compatibility for biological materials have strongly diminished the apparent attraction of immuno-sensors. Other newly emerging techniques in the field of proteiomics depend upon mass spectrometry methods thus require extensive laboratory support and equipment. These limitations could be overcome by using artificial receptors, which mimic the active sites of antibodies. During the Phase I, Lynntech has prepared sensor elements capable of recognizing different proteins selectively from complex biological samples. Results obtained in Phase I have demonstrated the feasibility of miniatuarization of this technology with minimal power requirements. The proposed research will result in a light weight, hand held device capable of specific recognition of small concentrations of target proteins from biological fluids at the end of Phase II and will be delivered to NASA/JSC.

The introduction of chlorination as a disinfection method caused a large drop in mortality from water borne diseases and was considered a major public health advance. Unfortunately, disinfection byproducts (DPBs) are formed when chlorine and other disinfectants are used in water treatment plants. Many disinfection byproducts can have serious health\neffects and are potential carcinogens. Current treatment options to minimize DPBs in drinking water are either inadequate or too costly to implement. A potential means to combat exposure to DPBs is through the widespread implementation of treatment methods near to the place where water is consumed (i.e., point-of-use treatment). In Phase I, we demonstrated a point-of-use\nwater treatment device based on photocatalytic oxidation. The method has a high potential to degrade DPBs to benign end products and provide safe drinking water at a cost lower than current treatment options. Significant accomplishments of the Phase I study included demonstration of the device's potential for mass production as well as its multiple applications, including control of microbial contaminants. The Phase II will focus on optimization of\nthe device's design and capabilities.\n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nThere are many economic advantages to the point-of-use water purification method described in this proposal.  The proposed device can be used as a stand alone treatment method, or its commercial potential may be enhanced by integrating it with siilar water purification devices that are used by millions of consumers in the U.S.  The market opportunity is substantial, given the large number of point-of-use devices that are used in health care facilities, homes, restaurants, food service establishments and hotels.  The market is estimated to be worth over $1.5 billion annually in the U.S.  Lynntech is well positioned to commercialize this technology, having secured intellectual property covering many aspects of the invention.

Thus, the quality of hemodialysis water is obviously very important.      \n Current practices in hemodialysis systems do not guarantee pyrogen-free water.     \n Several drawbacks exist in using available procedures to achieve pyrogen-free      \n water: (i) addition of chemicals, which have to be monitored and destroyed         \n before the water contacts the dialysis membrane. Otherwise, the chemicals may      \n come in contact with the patient about blood; (ii) formation of toxic              \n by-products from the reaction of pyrogens with the disinfectant; (iii) no          \n on-line means of providing pyrogen-free water (i.e., batch-mode operation), and    \n (iv) cost.

In addition, conformal FLAPS arrays will be developed for the microwave bands with 5.0 GHz as the target frequency.  Since emitter location is a necessary requirement, an interferometer system will beimplemented using commercial electronics where available, and evaluated using prototype antennas and Shadow 200 wing-boxes.  Because of the requirement for minimum aerodynamic impact, several new antenna concepts, in addition to resonant patch antennas,will be explored.  Among these are suspended strip-line and high dielectric constant substrates.  In order to minimize the impact of the antenna installation on the UAV performance, the antenna location and shape will be coordinated with the TUAV developerwho will design a suitable aerodynamic radome.Static tests of system performance will be conducted at contractor's facilities.  If Government furnished wind tunnel facilities are made available, dynamic tests of system performance may be conducted.\"",

Yet even given the broad success of\ntechniques such as electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser\ndesorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) there is still significant\npotential for improvement to address biochemical problems. A new and promising\nstrategy for mass spectrometry, laser desorption/ionization from a porous\nsilicon surface, is a marriage between micromaterial fabrication and\nmicrochemical approaches combined with laser-based desorption ionization\ntechniques. Desorption/ionization on silicon (DIOS) uses porous silicon to trap\nanalytes deposited on the surface and UV laser radiation is absorbed by the\nsilicon surface facilitating vaporization and ionization. Preliminary\nexperiments with DIOS-MS on biomolecules have allowed for the generation of\nintact molecular ions with little or no fragmentation and sensitivity at least\nas high as MALDI-MS. The primary goal of the proposed research is to optimize\nporous silicon preparation for a large variety of biomolecules, high throughput\napplications, and ultimately for the large-scale manufacture of these surfaces.\nGiven the tremendous growth in mass spectrometry-based applications for\nbiomolecule analysis, new technology that could further improve on small\nmolecule analysis and compatibility with microfluidics and silicon microchip\ntechnology as well as impurity tolerance, sensitivity, and automation will have\nan enormous impact in the biological sciences.\n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Given the tremendous growth in mass spectrometry-based applications for biomolecule analysis, new technology, such as desorption ionization on silicon (DIOS), that further improves mass spectrometry's compatibility with microfluidics and silicon microchip technology as well as in impurity tolerance, sensitivity, and automation will have an enormous impact in the pharmaceutical industry and biological sciences.",

One reasonable way to enhance the mass behind the nose of the penetrator is to augment its size. Theconflict between increased lethality for large projectiles and limited facilities for producing large penetrators leads to a need to join small pieces of heavy alloy into larger projectiles. Conventional methods to bond heavy alloy either use joiningmaterials that are not strong enough, or require such a high temperature that grain coarsening occurs with a resulting significant decrease in the joint strength. A better bonding method uses an interlayer consisting of high strength multicomponent alloys.These materials possess high strength and ductility. They have good adhesion to the heavy alloy and form strong ductile joints. Bonding of heavy alloy through the use of a high strength alloyed joint occurs at a temperature significantly lower than that ofthe W-Ni-Fe eutectic melting point. This excludes the possibility of grain coarsening and loss of mechanical properties of the heavy alloy. The strength of the joint is measured to be at least 87% of the bulk heavy alloy strength and there are projectedresults that will exceed it.\"",

The use of the composite core will provide high thermal conductivity, very high modulus/stiffness, high fracture toughness, and a pure \u00bf-SiC structure.  The SiC foam will eliminate the print-through problem.   During Phase I, a 4-inch diameter SiC mirror was fabricated that exhibited less than 10 kg/m2 areal density.  The core print-through was eliminated, and a very good microroughness of 4 nm was achieved.   Phase II will scale-up processing to 18-inch diameter SiC optics suitable for Inertial Fusion Energy optics.  Final polishing techniques will be developed to achieve a flatness under 150 nm combined with 2 nm microroughness.  An improved aluminum coating method will be developed to achieve an adherent coating layer that will survive pulse laser testing.                        Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Commercial applications should include space optics, such as lidars and cross-link communication, and ground based applications including high energy lasers",

LC progenitor cells were harvested from peripheral or cord blood samples, cryopreserved, and matured using cytokines into the LC specific CD1a+ phenotype.  By modifying the extracellular matrix substrate, these cells were successfully incorporated into a highly differentiated, serum-free epidermal model, albeit at a lower density than in native epidermis.  The LC derived from cord blood maintained their dendntic, CD1a+ HLA-DR+/- phenotype and expressed Birbeck granules within the cultures.  The exposure of 2 contact allergens resulted in the release of TNF-a and IL-lb. 2 cytokines known to be critically involved in the initial stages of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD).  Exposure to the common irritant, on the other hand, did not result in TNF-a or IL- lb release.  In addition, following exposure to UV irradiation, immuno-staining showed that LC were migrating out of the tissue, as is known to occur in vivo.Phase II studies will expand on the Phase I results to further develop an epidermal model containing immunologically competent cells.  Initial research will focus on the optimization of culture conditions to improve LC incorporation into the tissue model.  The effects of allergens on cytokine release and gene expression will be investigated.  Experiments designed to model LC migration from skin following exposure to allergens or UV light and subsequent T-cell activation will be performed to determine the degree to which the model's behavior corresponds to in vivo ACD reactions.  Finally, based on these studies, an assay kit to predict whether a material is likely to act as a contact allergen will be developed.",

Pulmonary impedance is related to the total work the right heart must pump against, and it is altered (primarily in the form of decreased compliance) in pulmonary disease and in the implantation of oxygenation assisted devices; this increase in work can lead to right-heart failure. The VCC can be attached to the right-heart or combined with an artificial lung to decrease the impedance seen by the right ventricle. One application of the VCC will be to augment bridge-to-transplant or recovery treatment of patients suffering from primary or secondary pulmonary hypertension. In Phase I, the optimal geometry and material of the compliant chamber were determined, fabrication techniques were developed, the compliance of the chambers were measured, and two methods for varying the compliance of the chamber were developed and characterized in an in vitro circuit.

To meet these needs, Phase II Aims are: (1) addition of other SCAN sections to support studies of co-morbidity; (2) extension of the data model and interface to support enhanced temporal measurement; (3) study of psychometric performance; (4) integration of automated diagnostic classification functions; and (5) implementation of functions and user interfaces for project and data management across multiple sites.  Field testing will be carried out at Washington University in St. Louis. The proposed system has potential to lead to further (Phase III and beyond) innovations in alcohol, drug, and mental health research and services by fostering efficient standardization of assessment, thus helping create centralized and pooled clinical databases.  Such databases would in turn provide a basis for further research and technical developments, such as scientific management and optimization of assessment and decision-making, or in linking community activities and university research.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator):  The proposed SBIR Phase II application is to develop and test Buddies OnLine, an Internet multi-player game for adolescent smoking cessation. Approximately 60-70% of adolescent smokers express a desire to quit, but the majority is not successful. The Buddies program is designed to provide social support and skills training to adolescent smokers to help them quit smoking within the context of a fun-to-play game involving real-time chat and mini-games. \n\nThe first primary aim is to finish development of the existing Phase I prototype. The second primary aim is to test the usability of a working prototype in an Interaction Design Laboratory. The third aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of Buddies OnLine by recruiting 440 past week smokers aged 13-17 from 10 sites in different states; coordinated by the American Lung Association of Minnesota. Smokers within each site will be randomized to one of two conditions: Buddies Online game or Internet cessation information and support. The primary outcome is biochemically confirmed self-reported 3-month follow-up abstinence. If shown effective in helping adolescents to quit smoking, the Buddies Online program holds great promise in providing a fun and effective alternative for adolescent smokers wanting to quit.\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nCurrently, Medical Works' Smoking Web-delivered game is one of very few in development.  Our design will be created with the goal of positioning the 'Buddies OnLine' Internet game as a standard in educational health care.  The potential buyers of 'Buddies OnLine' will be youths who smoke, parents, teachers, school districts, educational and probation facilities, public health departments, hospitals, HMOs, disease prevention societies, community based organizations, medical educators and physicians that have access to the Internet.",

Membranes have been used to separate hydrogen from these gases, but many membrane modules are needed; therefore, the footprint and complexity of the membrane plants are excessive.  This project will develop a new type of membrane module that will be 10 times larger than the current industry standard.  These large modules will allow large refining gas streams to be treated with compact equipment.  In Phase I, detailed designs for the large-membrane-area modules were developed and several prototype large modules were prepared.  The largest module produced, with a membrane area three times that of the current industry standard, exhibited appropriate gas permeation flow rates and was defect-free.  The absence of a measurable permeate-side pressure drop validated the design approach.  Phase II will further improve the design and produce even larger membrane modules.  Existing test equipment will be modified to allow for high-pressure testing.  A field test of the large-membrane-area modules will be performed in the second year with support from an industrial Phase II collaborator.            Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Much larger membrane modules should allow membrane processes to be more widely used in hydrogen separation, as well as in other gas and liquid separations.",

To meet new environmental regulations, this water will require treatment to reduce the oil content to less than 15 ppm before overboard discharge. Treatment by ultrafiltration can produce dischargeable water, but currently available membranes are subject to severe fouling by oil and particulates. The objective of this project is to develop a bilge water treatment process by combining a centrifugal separator pretreatment step to remove solids and large oil droplets, and a novel, fouling-resistant composite ultrafiltration membrane-polishing step to remove the remaining emulsified and dissolved oil and produce dischargeable water that meets the new regulations. In Phase I, Membrane Technology and Research, Inc., demonstrated the technical feasibility of the process. The system removed all of the free-phase oil and some of the dissolved organic compounds from the waste stream to produce dischargeable water. Fouling resistance of the new membrane was considerably better than that of commercial ultrafiltration membranes. An economic analysis showed that the capital and operating costs of the process are substantially lower than alternatives.

        "abstract": "Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, or white mold, is a resilient and devastating disease that has emerged as a significant threat to many of the broadleaf crops of the United States. Sclerotinia is known to infect about 408 species of plants. It has been estimated to cause hundreds of millions of dollars in losses annually to the United States' dry edible bean, sunflower, canola, and soybean crops. The disease has been especially problematic in the Upper Midwest, where the proliferation of susceptible crops has led to fewer economically viable resistant crop rotation options. The development and spread of white mold is highly dependent upon the weather. The prevailing weather conditions largely determine the reproductive nature of the fungus as well as its ability to infect plants. Available fungicides offer many susceptible crops protection from the disease. However, dwindling agricultural profit margins and the related growth in farm size make it increasingly impractical for producers to routinely scout and monitor all of their fields for impending disease problems. This is especially true in the regions hardest hit by the disease, where it is no longer uncommon for the various fields of a given farm to spread across areas of well over 100 square miles. Further, the considerable expense associated with applying these fungicides often prohibits preemptive action against the disease since there are currently no reliable decision support systems available to aid producers in determining the probability of disease development in their fields. The proposed program is directed at utilizing advanced site-specific meteorological analysis techniques and the ever-growing stream of weather observations (both in-situ and remotely-sensed) to support a fungicide application decision support system (FADSS). Specifically, funds from this Phase II award will be used to develop a FADSS for control of white mold in dry edible beans, although it will be easily extensible to other susceptible crops upon collection of datasets for those crops. This system will be designed to aid producers in evaluating the risk of white mold development and the potential for receiving a return on a fungicide investment in each field. The FADSS will integrate crop disease, leaf wetness, and soil models, a wide range of in-situ and remotely-sensed weather observations, sophisticated weather analysis and forecast systems, an economical tool for assessment of white mold spore concentrations, and internet and computer telephony technology into a comprehensive FADSS. The system will require only very infrequent interaction with the producer, and will use both the internet and computer telephony to notify producers of impending problems. The automated nature of the FADSS and its application of `push' technology will help it to succeed where others have failed by avoiding the pitfall of being a drain on the producer's time. This approach to minimizing disease losses stands to have a significant positive impact in a much shorter time than efforts to breed disease resistance to the disease.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial overgrowth is a condition found primarily in the elderly and is estimated to affect 33% of people over 65 years.  It causes great discomfort and clinically important nutritional deficiencies if left untreated.  The underlying cause is reduced gastric acid secretion associated with aging.  Management of overgrowth is hampered because low cost and easy to use diagnostic tests do not exist. Detection is meaningful because while the condition is never cured it can be effectively controlled through treatment. Our objective is to develop an easy to use and cost effective test to detect bacterial overgrowth. The clinical utility is the ability to detect the bacteria overgrowth as accurately as the gold standard (jejunal cultures) in patients exhibiting classic disease symptoms but whom ordinarily wouldn't receive expensive and invasive jejunal culture.  The test will accurately detect the condition pre- and post-therapy and lead to quality of life improvement. The novelty of this proposal is the use of a non-invasive breath test employing a naturally occurring sugar labeled with carbon-13 as a probe.  If overgrowth is present, the bacteria is present, the bacteria in the small intestine metabolize the labeled substrate and high concentrations of (13)CO(2) are expired in the breath. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: There are 25 million Americans over the age of 65 and they accounted for 10 million physician office visits with complaints of classic overgrowth symptoms The proposed test will significantly reduce national health care expenditures because proper diagnosis will lead to fewer office visits, more prudent use of drugs and better general health and well-being in the elderly.",

However, it has become increasingly evident that very significant delays and throughput degradations have arisen from en-route airspace problems and limitations, particularly from convective weather activity. This effort focused on the application of CDM technology and concepts to the management of en-route traffic (Collaborative Routing). In this phase II effort, we will implement, demonstrate and evaluate a number of different collaborative routing rationing algorithms (CRRAs) to assign use of en route resources to individual flights. We have found that such algorithms are both feasible and can be made consistent with traffic management goals and with the CDM paradigm. The CRRA algorithms will be implemented in NASA?s System-Wide Evaluation Planning Tool (SWEPT) and a major Human-In-The-Loop simulation experiment will be conducted with participants from the FAA Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC), Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs) and Airlines Operation Center (AOC) facilities.

However, the inability to remove coating materials from plastics in an environmentally friendly and cost effective manner results in the landfill of hundreds of millions of pounds of valuable polymer substrate materials each year.  Accordingly, trillions of Btus of energy are lost that could otherwise be conserved if appropriate techniques were developed for recovery and recycle.

Based on encouraging Phase II clinical trials for breast cancer treatment, complete response rates were shown to improve significantly when hyperthermia was added to radiation treatment protocols. This work will draw on the feasibility study conducted during Phase I where we demonstrated the capability of quantitatively monitoring temperatures to within 1 degree Celcius and a spatial resolution of 1 cm. Efforts by the Dartmouth College microwave imaging research group to develop a clinical breast cancer detection system has also established the feasibility of in vivo microwave breast imaging using a water-coupled interface in the clinical environment. The key components of Phase II will include refining the prototype clinical patient interface and integrating it with a scanned focused ultrasound hyperthermia device. A primary objective of Phase II will be to develop a clinical prototype system where data can be collected for image reconstruction at several vertical positions in less than one minute with quantitative difference images being available as treatment feedback information within 2 minutes after collection of each data set. Initial overall performance assessments will be conducted using phantom and ex vivo experimental configurations.",

The automation layer handles the translation of high-level systems requirements into module-level design space constraints, and buffers the detailed analysis results. The suite encompasses an archiving function, which enables the time evolution of the design to be explicitly tracked, facilitating the systems designer?s understanding of the design space, and providing a formal means to manage risk.

        "abstract": "Promising developments in diesel injection technology have given rise to an increasing acceptance of diesel engines in the passenger vehicle market, especially in Europe. As with heavy-duty vehicles, more stringent emission levels are achieved via control of the diesel combustion process through precise timing and metering of the injected fuel quantities. In particular, European manufacturers such as Siemens and Bosch are competing to bring the benefits of piezoelectric injection technology to the market (e.g., Pugeot in 2002). Their actuation mechanisms are state-of-the-art, but their techniques are typically \"on-off\" in nature, and although their engine control techniques work well, they rely on engine maps that enforce injection timing and quantity as a function of engine parameters, and they do not adequately handle transients and modifications due to age and wear. In contrast, Mid\u00bf Technology Corporation's proposed injection technique will provide proportional control over the injection process, and thus more degrees of freedom to control the problem. This new approach also closes an adaptation control loop in real time. Because of the associated injection and combustion modeling that govern controller operation, it is anticipated that this algorithm will converge faster than existing technologies, providing the ability to more effectively deal with transients. Phase I focused on generating a simplified combustion control model to predict and minimize the formation of NOx as a function of injection profile. These efforts were very successful in identifying an optimized shape and indicated that fine control of injection profile can have a marked effect on output emissions. The primary Phase II objective is to experimentally verify these analytical results. Working closely with an injector design sponsor, Mid\u00bf Technology Corporation will develop the actuation, control, and power components needed to realize the effect of injected trajectory on emissions. Additional Phase II objectives are to improve combustion modeling and predict an optimum injection shape for minimum NOx, hydrocarbons, and particulate matter. By succeeding in an experimental environment, Mid\u00bf Technology Corporation will be capable of commercializing this technology and marketing it to engine manufacturers as a critical method of satisfying environmental regulatory constraints. Furthermore, the development of breakthrough actuation and control technologies can be used to help realize innovative combustion control concepts, such as the Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition technology. Finally, the introduction of NO suppressants through separate but precisely timed injection mechanisms can be achieved by the proposed valve technology. For example, a four-way proportional valve allows relative control of a diesel packet followed by a suppressant packet.",

Fabricating x-ray, gamma-ray, and neutron collimators that have the precision necessary to achieve arcsecond or sub-arcsecond imaging is a critical problem. Lenses or mirrors cannot be fabricated due to the lack of efficient reflectors or refractors for these wavelengths. Collimators are required to achieve the necessary resolution. In order to achieve high-resolution images, fine collimator geometries are needed. Commercial collimator fabrication techniques provide structures with coarse cell sizes that require long structural lengths to achieve image optimization. Collimators with fine cell geometries help reduce the overall length of the collimating structure and increase resolution. Single collimators have been fabricated, with fine cell sizes, using photochemical machining and stack lamination. However, assembling a multi-grid array from single collimators requires demanding assembly and alignment schemes.

Thermal management of future high-power laser instrumentation will require power dissipation of 2-5 kW at heat fluxes beyond 100 W/cm2. Although localized heat fluxes as high as 100 W/cm2 have been demonstrated using bi-disperse wicks, the maximum average heat flux capability of present LHP evaporators is an order of magnitude lower. Cooling high heat flux loads with present technology would necessitate the use heat spreaders, which would substantially increase the thermal resistance and weight of the system. We propose an evaporator configuration that can operate at average heat fluxes an order of magnitude larger, and thermal resistances an order of magnitude lower than present LHP evaporators. A novel fabrication approach enables vapor/liquid distribution networks to maximize capillary pumping and substantially reduce liquid and vapor flow pressure drops. Phase I proof-of-concept tests and scoping analyses demonstrated the feasibility and performance potential of the proposed evaporator. In Phase II we will develop the evaporator technology through a combination of modeling, fabrication trials, and separate effects tests.

This particular technology offers a relatively simple radiator candidate to achieve ultra wideband array requirementsas compared to other conventional approaches.  One very important feature of this element is that a broad banded balun is not required.  Additionally, the elements are inherently circularly polarized, and therefore do not require a broadband hybrid.Lastly, no absorptive backing is needed to mitigate unwanted ground plane effects.  Physically, all of these features can be provided in a low profile, lightweight, conformal package.  During Phase II, MRC will continue to improve the bandwidth of thiselement by optimizing a number of different design parameters.

However, many challenges exist when wideband phasedarray radar systems are used for MTI.  Larger bandwidth causes more dispersions both in angle and Doppler.  The angle dispersion across the array reduces the number of wideband jammers that can be suppressed by the array, unless a tapped delay line type ofapproach is used with space-time adaptive processing algorithms for jamming suppression.  Yet the tapped delay line approach significantly increases the amount of computations and the need for a large amount of target-free secondary data.  To avoid theseproblems, subbanding approaches become an attractive alternative since they avoid angle and Doppler dispersion problems, as well as the need for a large amount of target-free secondary data, require fewer computations and hence the power consumption, andare readily suitable for parallel processing.  Our approach for addressing these key problems is based on 1) developing optimal statistical processing-based subbanding algorithms for performing both the moving target detection problem and the targetparameter estimation problem (velocity and direction of arrival), 2) developing an RF systems testbed environment for generating realistic radar signature data to test the algorithms, and 3) r",

Under normal biological conditions a tight balance between proliferation and cell death (apoptosis) is essential. An imbalance in these two opposing processes has been implicated in a variety of diseases which includes neurdegenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's disease), myelodysplastic syndromes, AIDS, ischemic injury, autoimmune disease and cancer. The ability to quantitatively detect (image) apoptosis is a significant advancement for its use in high-throughput screening and validation of novel therapeutic molecules for the above diseases. During the Phase I award period, we have developed and validated a novel molecular reporter cassette which when transfected into mammalian cells results in a polypeptide that has significantly attenuated levels of reporter activity. If the cefl undergoes apoptosis, a caspase (a protease activated during apoptosis) specific cleavage of the reporter protein occurs which activates the reporter enabling detectionhmaging of the apoptotic event. In this Phase II proposal, we will test the specifity of this approach to image three different proteases involved in apoptosis (Caspase-3, -8 and -9). Three different reporter molecules, each containing a different cleavage site specific for one of three Caspases will be constituatively expressed in D54 human glioma cells with either luciferase (for bioluminescence detection) or green fluorescent protein (for fluorescence detection) as the activatable reporter (Specific Aim 1). These cell lines will be used to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of these reporter molecules to \"report\" on specific Caspases activated during different anticancer therapies. Moreover, in Specific Aim 2 transgenic mice will be developed using these reporter molecules wherein the activation of apoptosis within the skin in response to UV radiation can be imaged. Overall, this reporter molecule will provide a unique opportunity to image specific apoptotic events non-invasively and in real time in intact cell and animals. This feature will provide exciting and important opportunities for both the pharmaceutical industry and scientists to study apoptosis using in vitro high throughput screening compounds with pro- and anti- apoptotic activity as well as for target validation in vivo in intact animals.",

This property allows biofilms toconcentrate trace quantities of hazardous substances, which can be used to improve techniques for the detection of chemical or biological warfare agents in the environment.

        "abstract": "Biofilm barriers are a promising new technology for the containment and remediation of groundwater contaminated with nitrate and other pollutants. These barriers are formed by subsurface injection of bacteria and/or nutrient solutions to stimulate the growth of bacteria that produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and also may degrade contaminants. The engineered accumulation of biomass and EPS in the subsurface is used to control groundwater flow and enhance treatment strategies. For example, a biofilm barrier can be used as a \"funnel\" to channel contaminated groundwater to a treatment zone. Unlike many other barrier technologies, biofilm barriers cause minimal surface disturbance and have no obvious depth limitation. MSE Technology Applications, Inc., along with collaborators at the Center for Biofilm Engineering, Montana State University, has successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of biofilm barriers in systems ranging from small laboratory models to a large-scale test cell. This test cell contained a 180-foot long by 20-foot deep biofilm barrier that was used as part of Phase I SBIR research to show complete denitrification of a nitrate plume. The next logical step in the development of this technology is field-scale research. The primary objectives of this research are to evaluate, under actual field conditions, the ability to control groundwater flow using a biofilm barrier system and to determine the effectiveness of the biofilm barrier to remove nitrate from groundwater. Following successful completion of this field demonstration, MSE will market the technology for the cleanup of nitrate-contaminated groundwater.",

        "abstract": "65339          The DOE uses a variety of stand-alone computer programs to analyze and identify seismic events for the monitoring of a nuclear test-ban.  However, these separate programs do not communicate adequately with one another so that they can exchange data easily, and newly developed analysis programs cannot communicate with them directly.  A new software architecture is needed to facilitate data flow among these legacy and new codes so that the results of one program can be sent to another and so that the programs can make function calls to one another. This project will develop two data communications protocols to permit data to be exchanged directly among seismic analysis codes and allow one program to make calls to another.  In Phase I, an interactive graphics program for seismogram data display and measurement was modified by adding an interface that allows data communications that are compliant with Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA).  A Java-language program for platform-independent interactive graphics display and for certain analysis operations on seismograms was similarly adapted with a CORBA interface.  Now, the two programs can exchange data within a single computer or across a network.  In Phase II, the CORBA interface will be further modified to transmit data segments for specialized processing by seismic analysis programs.  Corresponding CORBA interfaces will be added to those codes, and an overall integration architecture will be deployed.  A parallel effort will be directed at using \u00bfWeb services\u00bf protocols to allow these codes to communicate across an intranet.            Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A flexible architecture for integrating research tools for seismic reference events analysis should be applicable to the mission of the U.S. Air Force Technical Applications Center, the International Data Center of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization, and the National Data Centers of treaty signatories.

An ideal first response decontamination system would be hand portable, ready-to-use and effective on contact.Further, the decontaminant of this ideal system would not harm either personnel or materiel.  Nanoscale Materials, Inc. (NMI) has identified several unique reactive nanoparticle (RNP) formulations that hold promise as chemical and biological warfare agentdecontaminants.  RNPs have been shown to destructively adsorb a variety of chemical warfare agents and their related simulants.  By incorporating RNPs in a pressurized container it would be possible to develop a waterless handheld decontamination systemthat is portable, effective, and logistics free.\"",

Synthesis of gold and silver nanoparticle colloids for commercial use in the health care industry will be pursued as part of the proposed effort; the SMAD synthesis method will be optimized for commercial-scale manufacturing of gold and silver colloids. This approach yields high purity colloids, free of unwanted byproducts and ready for further processing without the cumbersome purification steps characteristic of other synthesis methods. This innovation significantly simplifies the manufacturing process of colloidal products and reduces production cost. The proprietary digestive-ripening step will be scaled up and developed to achieve monodispersion and particle size control of the metal nanoparticles contained in the colloids. Methods for transferring solvent-based colloids into an aqueous environment will be developed. Synthesis steps involved in the manufacturing of colloidal gold and silver will be integrated in a semi-continuous or continuous process. The commercial potential of this project will be for immunological labeling and DNA detection using the colloidal gold solutions. The project offers an alternative-manufacturing route that significantly lowers the cost. Silver-based colloids have potential applications in burn wound treatment or as effective disinfectants and anti-inflammatory agents. The development of SMAD technology will enable high-volume manufacturing of many nanoparticle materials whose availability is currently limited by production inefficiencies. These nanomaterials will support future technologies in industry and find application in both commercial and academic research, as highly reactive catalytic materials, magnetic information storage media, ferrofluids, and magnetic tracers.",

Because of their ultra-high sensitivity, exquisite specificity, low cost and remarkable stability, the gold nanoparticle probes could define a new industry standard for nucleic acid testing. The current proposal describes two objectives that will significantly broaden our SNP detection capability. First, we will continue developing a rapid test to identify simultaneously SNPs in three genes involved in hypercoagulation disorders [factor V (1691 G->A), prothrombrin (20210 G->A) and MTHFR (677 C->T)]. Phase I feasibility studies have demonstrated key capabilities of the system including detection and SNP discrimination in un-amplified genomic DNA. In Phase II, the individual genes will be integrated into a single test. The system requirements will be optimized and internally validated. In the second objective, strategies to further improve sensitivity and specificity will be evaluated with the goal of increasing our multiplex capability in PCR-less detection. Success in meeting these goals will provide clinical laboratories with a simple test to assess genetic risk factors in hypercoagulation. Further, it will provide the necessary framework for future development of SNP detection tests in genomic DNA for other medically relevant genes.",

The colorimetric change generated by the probes when bound to DNA target was recorded by spotting onto a membrane and visualized using a simple flatbed scanner or the naked eye. In phase II, Nanosphere seeks to extend this new assay to large scale analysis of SNP's. This will be accomplished by developing a new spotting methodology and simple colorimetric reader/software package that enables multiple PCR samples to be spotted rapidly and analyzed for the presence of specific DNA sequences with minimal user intervention. These developments will then be used to rapidly extend the assay to other SNP's and mutations (e.g. insertions and deletions) related to colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and cardiovascular disease.

We will apply SPT to the purification of simulated solid waste media (SWM)which has a well characterized composition and morphology. SPT is a physical process and does not involve the consumption of any resources except energy. SPT recovers the maximum amount of water because it reduces the wastes to a solid dry material as opposed to a concentrated solution. The recovered water is of high purity. The solid residues should have many desirable properties including very low moisture content, very low yield strength, and high surface area. Since solid residues will be low in moisture, incineration of the solid residue can be achieved using a minimum energy input. In the proposed work SPT performance data will obtained from SWM as a function of varying processing conditions. We will examine the feasibility of applying SPT to the space flight environment and investigate how SPT will be integrated into existing and planned space flight specific life support subsystem components.",

Upon binding to a complementary target, the beacon opens, the fluorophore and quencher move apart, and fluorescence appears. Sensitivity is dependent upon the \"signal-to-noise ratio\" of fluorescence intensities in the open and closed conformations. Conventional dabcyl-quenched beacons give intensity ratios up to 100. However, the 1.4 nM Nanogold cluster yields intensity ratios up to several thousand, and since it absorbs over a wide range of wavelengths, can quench a variety of fluorophores.

Fluorescence quenching properties of these labels will be made reproducible through the synthesis of modified ligands which increase the solubility, stability and biological compatibility of he beacon, while introducing specific affinities for fluorophores to hold the gold particle and quencher closer together and increase quenching in the closed configuration.

ABG measurements are the most frequently ordered tests in intensive care units. The results of Phase I demonstrated excellent accuracy and reproducibility of the optical-based measurements. In addition, optical methods were developed to perform calibration and temperature correction to the data. The multi-analyte sensor was composed of optodes (optical electrodes), one for each analyze of interest, one for calibration and two for temperature sensing. Most importantly, the new, all-plastic biosensor is designed so that it can be mass produced at high speed and low cost. Existing handheld, point of care ABG sensors have not been able to benefit from the very low costs results from totally automated production. As a result, these sensors have had limited success in displacing the service provided by satellite and central laboratories.

The instrumentation includes surface and downhole tools for the measurement of oil-water percentages, temperature, pressure, and flow.  The high temperature downhole tools will allow continuous well monitoring, optimized control, and eliminate the need for bulky separators or gamma ray analysis systems.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of a tool for the real-time determination of the water-to-oil ratio in a mixed flow, in-line, and without the use of a separator.  The tool was implemented using both conventional electronics and packaging to allow its use as a surface sensor in a production field.  High temperature electronics were incorporated for downhole operation capability without the need for a cooling flask.  In Phase II, multiple company partners will beta test both surface tool prototypes and high temperature prototypes downhole.                    Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The family of in-line instrumentation tools should have immediate and large-scale use in the oil and gas production industry, as well as in chemical and pharmaceutical markets.",

This will result in aprocess that, with the addition of a biocompatible and non-toxic photosensitizer /electron donor initiating system, will rapidly cure from a viscous liquid to a tough ductile polymer in a matter of milliseconds. This reaction occurs with a minimal heat ofpolymerization in an oxygen-containing aqueous environment at physiological pH. The free-radical cure reaction is easily triggered by applying a filtered and focused light beam of known power via optical fiber from a source with a broad wavelength range tothe synthetic solder (polymer/initiator) formulation. During Phase II, we would work with a biomedical institute partner and investor to further develop the tissue solder system by maximizing adhesion, minimizing cure/illumination time, and maximize watertransfer in the resulting system. Additionally, we plan to investigate an alternative biocompatible photosensitive endpoint indicator that responds (via cure) to visible wavelength stimulation and continue development of a compact light emittingdiode-based photon delivery system that can be easily integrated into existing soldier-based light sources.\"",

The proposed innovation is the creation of a new thermally conductive textile fiber using nanocomposite engineering. The immediate opportunity is reduced contact surface required for the plastic tubing. The loops can be spaced further apart greatly enhancing comfort and mobility. Improved rate of heat transfer and more uniform temperature distribution will provide the benefit of reduced water circulation needs, leading to an opportunity for reduction in the weight and bulk of the space suit and improved astronaut mobility.

This Phase II project will design and build a prototype pilot-scale CART apparatus to demonstrate the commercial viability of the technology as applied to the synthesis of nano-sized oxides of selected metals that are deemed to have the greatest commercial potential.\nThe commercial potential of ultrafine powders are in the production of catalysts, coatings and films, conductive pastes, cosmetics, electromagnetic components, electronic devices, fire retardant materials, magnetic fluids, sintered and injection-molded parts, ceramic composites, magnetic storage media, phosphors, pigments, polishing media, and toners. Indium-tin oxide (ITO) powders are used to prepare sputtering targets for deposition of transparent films for use in flat-panel display technology. Nano-grained materials can be employed to replace various load-bearing and non-structural parts in automobiles, infrastructures, off-shore structures, piping, containers, electronic equipment housings, etc. Nano-grained cermets and ceramics are outstanding cutting tool materials. Transparent nano-grained ceramics can be utilized in a broad array of applications, including transparent ceramic appliance components, clear \"glassware\" and artistic artifacts.

This research grant will demonstrate how a private marketing and agricultural based company can contribute to increasing private entrepreneurship among tribal farmers using innovative agricultural, cooperative, educational, and economic development technologies to create new economies, and sources of revenue to rural Native American reservations and communities. The resulting farming organization will integrate raw material production and 1st stage processing from Tribal member farmers organized into a farming cooperative model known as New Generation Cooperatives (NGC). In order to achieve the overall objective, five technical objectives will be accomplished in planned sequence so that the results will witness a replicable business entity, ready to start business. Objective # 1 will involve organizing and assisting the Cherokee Farmer Steering Council (SC) in research and development of an agricultural cooperative business plan in order to develop capacity for participation in the Natural Products industry as suppliers of traditional value-added herbal products. Objective # 2 will include the organization and development of an innovative herbal farming collaboration based on the existing model known as New Generation Cooperatives (NGC). The New Generation cooperative is an new innovation that has proven successful for small farmers to compete by pooling resources, combining investment equity, effectively using market information, and moving their products past the farm gate closer to the end consumer by adding value to the products through 1st and 2nd level processing. This will be the major and most resource-consuming objective. Objective # 3 will include the implementation and refinement of a new training and preparation curriculum for the Cherokee Nation's existing Individual Development Account (IDA) Small Business Program with components that include agricultural cooperatives and new horticultural technologies. The IDA program holds much promise in developing necessary skills, business and finance literacy, asset saving, and related education for new entrepreneurs preparing to launch or participate in small businesses and the NGC. Objective # 4 will involve the implementing the Cherokee Farmers' NGC business plan. This objective will take place in the second year after completion of the Cherokee Farmer Cooperative's Business Plan. Objective # 5 will conclude the research of this Phase II grant where the PI and consultants will have assisted the Cherokee farmers in research and development of value-added herbal infusion (tea) processing capacity enabling the cooperative to begin farming and plan for processing a line of distinct product offerings in the form of herbal infusions and teas.",

Because methods for transfer of frequency-domain impedance data to time-domain boundary conditions are still under development, Computational Aeroacoustics (CAA) has yet to be used widely either to design new liners or predict pre-installation performance of existing ones. In addition, the methods that do currently exist are not easily extended to cover finite amplitude effects, whether they are due to high sound pressure levels or liner material nonlinearities. Nielsen Engineering and Research proposes to fill this need for a general, nonlinear, time-domain liner characterization scheme by novel application of Volterra (integral) series methods. Applying this modeling technique to data from a given liner results in forced, time-domain, differential equations for liner velocity response to an imposed acoustic pressure. The differential equations can be linear or nonlinear, and are generated using either existing frequency-domain impedance data or new time-domain acoustic pulse experiments. Once in existence, the equations can be discretized in any fashion consistent with the CAA calculation where they are used.",

        "abstract": "A new fission powered space power and propulsion system based on using a non-moving fissile gas is proposed. The main innovation in the proposed fission based propulsion system is the use of well-established fusion plasma confinement and compression methods to achieve a supercritical condition in a highly subcritical fissile gas. In particular, electromagnetic induced shock wave compaction and gas dynamic trap techniques are merged to bring a relatively small volume ( 1 m3) of a fissile (235U, 233U, or 239Pu) compound gas (such as UF4) to prompt supercriticality condition, thereby, releasing an intense pulse of fission power. A magnetic field compaction scheme is designed to directly convert the fission energy to electricity. The specific energy of the proposed nuclear electric system for megawatt level power operation is well above 1 kWe/kg. An alternative direct propulsion system is designed based on using a merger between Magnetized Target Fusion (MTF) and hydrodynamic confinement techniques to achieve long duration ( 100 to 1000 ms) criticality and ultrahigh burnup in a fissile gas. The MTF technique induces a large pressure ratio ( 10) adiabatic compaction of fissile gas by rapid collapsing of a cylindrical layer of a low neutron absorbing metal (Al or Zr).

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) EEG technology has advanced substantially with respect to digital processing capability during the past 20 years. However, the process of transducing the very small cerebral electrical signals at the scalp surface remains difficult, requiring very low and balanced contact impedances to achieve acceptable levels of line frequency (60 Hz) noise. Preparation of scalp sites using solvents, abrasives and syringe needles to match amplifier system input requirements is time consuming, costly and especially burdensome in neonatal and critical care patients. Based on Phase I success, a preparation-free EEG technology will be completed that would entirely eliminate scalp site preparation with solvents, abrasive compounds and needles, etc. Setup time for clinical and experimental protocols would be reduced to the time required to make physical contact. In addition to time savings, it will eliminate the need for shielded enclosures, simplify recordings in noisy environment such as intensive care units, and end patient irritation and the risk of infection from scalp puncture during abrasion. Two low-cost implementations of the technology will be developed: an EEG transduction module (ETM) to serve as a compact, in-line, modular retrofit to existing EEG/Evoked potential systems and an EEG System Module (ESM) that would serve as a complete amplifier system capable of connecting to notebook and desktop PC's equipped with a \"Firewire\" (IEEE 1394) serial bus port. The ETM will upgrade any EEG/EP system to \"preparation-free\" functionality and for most, substantially improve overall signal-to-noise performance. The ESM software package will feature object-oriented programmability, conferring unprecedented user control and flexibility. Both devices will enable the uncomplicated use of electrode caps. Production versions of both devices will be field tested at established clinical and research sites, providing realistic opportunities to identify and correct weaknesses or \"bugs.\"",

In Phase-I, a region of chemical property space enriched in GPCR ligands was identified. This was used to design and synthesize a 'test' library of 2025 single, pure compounds to sample portions of this property space associated with GPCR-PA+ ligands. This library was evaluated by high-throughput screening against three different receptors and found to be highly enriched in ligands (4.5 to 61-fold) compared to a control set of 2024 randomly selected compounds. In Phase II we propose to expand the size of this library to at least 6749 compounds to complete the sampling of this GPCR-PA+ ligand-rich region and to better define it's borders. This completed library will be screened against an expanded array of receptor targets and hits so identified used as a starting point for lead optimization against a selected target.

The system can quantitatively approximate the state of the motor system in terms of efficiency and precision, as force is the fundamental building block of movement. Our system is the first to simultaneously measure and provide a comprehensive assessment of grasping forces during bimanual object manipulation. The market for this system is growing as the quantification of movement is of interest to a wide range of professionals including bioengineers, biomechanists, clinicians, educators, ergonomists/human factor engineers, geriatricians, neuroscientists, psychologists, and rehabilitation specialists. The Phase II objectives are: 1. To expand the reliability, accuracy and generalizability of the system. 2. Continue to improve the hardware of the system. 3. Performing an extended analysis of the force and torque data produced by each limb and identifying how these variables may relate to other measures. 4. Create optional protocols to improve the flexibility of the system. 5. Streamline the user interface so it complies with recent PC interaction standards. 6. Imp5ove methods of visualizing the data. Our system combines portability, flexibility and innovative analyses to effectively assess the state of the motor system in bimanual force control. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The assessment of movement impairments can be more objective through the evaluation of forces exerted by the hands during an object manipulation task that resembles daily activities. Quantifying force patterns between hands provides an opportunity to assess how individuals control and coordinate forces. No similar movement analysis system is available.

This technology isbased upon a previous microbial mine detection program, where microbes would excite and fluoresce in the presence of TNT vapors from UXO and landmine hazards in the soil.  However, plants provide a much greater surface area in their leaves and stems for abrighter fluorescent signal generation, and their root systems accumulate the explosives from subsurface soils where they occur in much higher concentration.  These added advantages will significantly increase the probability of detecting UXO, landminesand explosvie waste hazards from an airborne platform.  The focus of the research effort is to generate and evaluate fluorescent signatures of genetically modified plants and tailor the plant(s) fluorescence to optimize the use of existing passive oractive imaging technology from an airborne platform for the wide area detection of these hazards and concentrations in the field. With respect to UXO recovery programs and international humanitarian demining initiatives, the technology could assist in thediscrimination of UXO areas and minefields through the identification of both patterns and random dispersals around specific structures that were targeted during previous conflicts or at test facilities and impact areas.  Since landmines and UXO hazardsare deployed randomly over long distances, and encircle small villages, bridges, RR lines and infrastructure sites (hydro-electric stations, power lines, oil & gas reserves and utilities), this technology expedites the detection and recovery of thesehazards for humanitarian benefits and land reclamation/reutilization programs.

BE itself is not malignant, but it is the primary risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma, and a significant number of patients with BE will have adenocarcinoma at the time of first endoscopy. Currently, examination for dysplasia requires numerous random biopsy samples. This work will complete the development and clinically test an optical instrument for detecting and grading Barrett's dysplasia. Light scattering spectroscopy (LSS) has already been shown to differentiate between normal and diseased tissue conditions in BE patients, but the analysis is complex so the data is analyzed after the procedure is over. The instrument developed by this work will be based on white light LSS, but it will use a special probe design and data reduction algorithm, developed by NLI, enabling real-time results. The probe design makes use of the properties of light scattering by cell nuclei and other tissue components to enable the separation and subtraction of interfering effects, and the characterization of the nuclei, based on using spectral, angular, and polarization characteristics of the scattering processes. The tissue characterization follows from the instrument's quantitative determination of the nuclear size and number density for the surface mucosal cells - two properties commonly used by pathologists. Specifically, NLI will (i) produce the probe, (ii) calculate the data base for the real-time algorithm, (iii) produce the instrument with light source, spectrometer, and embedded computer (suitable for interface with a standard clinical video endoscope), (iv) verify the instrument operation in the laboratory using standard scattering materials, (v) verify the background subtraction properties by using normal and diseased resected colon tissue, and (vi) conduct clinical studies on patients with Barrett's Esophagus.",

        "abstract": "Nitrate is one of the most widely determined anions in all spheres of agriculture. Economical and environmentally responsible crop production now requires that farmers know the concentration of nitrate in soil-and increasingly, in the sap of developing plants-to determine the amount and timing of fertilizer application to their fields. Nitrate is classified as a primary contaminant under the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Acts, and it has been identified as a major water quality problem in many agricultural regions where runoff and drainage from croplands contaminate surface water and groundwater. The demand for nitrate analysis in these regions to support monitoring and remediation activities is therefore likely to increase substantially. Nutrient management programs now under development in many parts of the country to regulate the discharge of wastes from confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) will further increase the demand for nitrate analysis. This burgeoning demand for agriculturally related nitrate analysis provides the economic incentives to develop faster, cheaper, more environmentally benign reagents and analytical systems for laboratory and on-site nitrate analysis despite the ready availability of time honored and effective nitrate determination methods. Automated methods for nitrate determination, U.S. EPA method 353.2 for example, are widely used in the United States and throughout the world. In such methods, nitrate is reduced to nitrite by small, packed-bed, cadmium reactors. Nitrite is subsequently reacted with Griess reagents-sulfanilamide and N-(1-Naphthyl)ethylenediamine-to form a stable and highly colored product that is ideal for determination by photometry. Cadmium required by these methods, however, is a highly toxic heavy metal. Its use exposes analysts to a potent health hazard, and generates a cadmium contaminated waste stream, which must be collected for proper disposal. Enzymatic nitrate reduction is an attractive alternative to the cadmium-based chemistry. Enzymatic reactions are rapid, extremely selective, and nontoxic. They are safer for the user and for the environment, and can improve lab economy by reducing costs of hazardous waste disposal. NECi has developed reliable nitrate analysis tools based on its proprietary NADH:nitrate reductase (NaR) enzyme, which is isolated from corn seedlings. Our company is also developing new and potentially less expensive NaR reagent tools using genetic engineering and protein expression technologies, under funding from the SBIR program of NIH (Phase II award #R44 GM56598). The goal of this project is to develop manufacturable and cost-competitive reagent systems using NADH:Nitrate Reductase (NaR) as a direct replacement for the cadmium now widely used for nitrate determinations in standard CF (air-segmented continuous flow) and FI (flow injection) methods. Reagent packages using enzyme in solution will be compared to immobilized enzyme reactors. Technical feasibility was demonstrated in Phase I.",

Many plant species accumulate nitrate, especially in times of stress such as drought. Nitrate levels can be high enough to pose a toxicity risk to livestock: consumption of excess nitrate can suppress rate of growth, low birth weight or stillbirths, reduced milk production, and even death especially in ruminants. Silage from high-nitrate crops can give off dangerous amounts of highly toxic NOx gases as they ferment. Farmers and crop consultants need a reliable and easy way to determine whether and when to harvest hays, grasses, and maize for feed. The Phase I project was designed to determine whether our nitrate test method and kits can become useful tools for agricultural extension personnel, food and feed chemists, crop consultants, researchers, farmers, and others. The proof-of-concept stage demonstrated that nitrate determinations based on enzymatic nitrate reduction by corn seedling nitrate reductase (NaR) can yield reliable data on nitrate content for feed and crop plants. Our results, and those of our collaboration partners, have demonstrated the feasibility of the method. The major objectives of the entire Phase I/Phase II project are: 1. To show that NaR-based nitrate analysis provides quantitative, reliable data in the lab using standard extraction techniques. 2. To develop a simplified test kit, similar in format to our Consumer NTK, that farmers and others can use on site. 3. To develop and validate quick and facile sample preparation techniques that provide extracts ready for analysis in the simplified test kits. 4. To validate that the method can provide data of sufficient reliability for making harvest and safety decisions on-site, in the field. An additional objective in Phase II will be the evaluation of recombinant NaR forms under development at NECi for use in these test kits. The advantage of recombinant NaR is the potential for lowering enzyme cost. Less expensive enzyme means we can use more NaR per assay, making the assay faster. Time is always a concern, for farmers, consultants and researchers alike. There is real need for improved methods for nitrate determination in the field. A dominant field nitrate assay used today is based on a color reaction of a diphenylamine/sulfuric acid mixture placed in a cavity bored into the corn stalk. This method lacks accuracy, and exposes the user to concentrated sulfuric acid. We believe the test kits under development in this project will provide data of stronger reliability, with dramatically reduced usage of hazardous materials for improved worker safety. A Field nitrate test kit capable of providing reliable nitrate information on-site will save time and money for farmers and consultants at harvest. A fast, safe and reliable nitrate test kit can help improve feed safety for livestock. As a collateral benefit, fast and simple test kits may be used for on-site soil testing, as an aid in avoiding application of excess nitrogenous fertilizers. Such kits may become useful tools for development of nutrient management plans.",

        "abstract": "This Phase II SBIR project is a continuation of the research in which we proved the feasibility of an approach to the wide area standoff detection of explosives.  The approach consists of two main components:  a fluorescing sensor mechanism and aphoto-interrogation subsystem.  Two types of sensor mechanisms are being evaluated.  To this point in the project, we have concentrated on the use of beads coated with a remarkably sensitive amplifying fluorescent polymer (AFP) that has previously beendemonstrated to provide superior detection capabilities for explosives.  A second sensor mechanism involving microbes will be further explored during the completion of Phase I.  However, the results of the use of AFP-coated beads clearly indicates thatthis approach offers a promising mechanism for standoff detection.  We have been able to spread beads over soil, interrogate them from a distance, and readily identify areas of TNT contamination.  The response is strong, sensitive, and shows a highresistance to interference likely to be present in field environments.  During Phase II, we will improve the bead-polymer construct for improved dispersal and response and will test delivery and interrogation systems under realistic field conditions.Similar research will be conducted using microbes. This approach to standoff detection will be valuable in locating areas of UXO and mine fields.  Through functionalization of the polymer, analytes such as chemical agents, biological agents, and toxicindustrials chemicals can be detected.  This would permit the detection of harmful military, terrorist, and environmental contaminants at a distance, keeping personnel out of harm's way and allowing fast reconnaissance of large areas.",

The potential applications in digital imaging and storage offered by PSL phosphors, including X-ray imaging could be significant. PSL phosphors currently in use present several drawbacks including greater expense and poorer resolution as compared to conventional screen-film methods. The quantum confinement of nanoparticles offers solutions to many of the shortcomings of existing PSL phosphors. The project will characterize nanoparticles with a goal of optimizing these materials for use as phosphors in thin films. The project will also fabricate the required thin films and compare them to commercially available PSL phosphors for performance, longevity, and other factors of interest.\nThe commercial applications will be widely applicable to digital imaging, offering high resolution, low cost, easy storage, low complexity, easy portability, and other desirable features.

Selection of a cell for writing is accomplished through a select transistor, with asingle write current passing through only one magnetic film sandwich in an array.   The memory cell can be configured from a single element for high speed, or from two elements for higher density.  Low write currents of 2.5 mA have been achieved with 3 nsswitching.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  During phase I the feasibility of a test kit for the fluorometric measurement of HIV protease inhibitors (PI) in human serum has been demonstrated. The overall objective of this phase II investigation is the development of a robust fluorometric diagnostic test kit, trade name Levoprin-ZG, for clinical laboratories, to be used for therapeutic dose monitoring (TDM). The test results should be similar in accuracy with those obtained by HPLC/mass spectrometry (LCMS) and have demonstrated clinical applications (for FDA approval). Principle of the method: in the well of a microtiter plate the HIV protease degrades a specific substrate attached to a solid phase, which releases a fluorescent signal. In the presence of diluted patient serum containing PI the activity of the enzyme is inhibited in proportion to the concentration of PI. Dosing of PI is based on the level of drug necessary to inhibit HIV. However, achievement of therapeutic levels is influenced by multiple factors, including 1) individual variability in levels; from sub-therapeutic trough to toxic peak levels, which reduces adherence. 2) Poor adherence leading to development of resistant mutants. 3) Resistant mutants require genotypic or phenotypic characterization in order to identify the drug level required to suppress the virus in individual patients; under these circumstances (rescue) the PI levels need to be substantially increased, monitored closely and adjusted. For these reasons, clinicians have expressed the need for a rapid, sensitive and inexpensive TDM test to be performed close to the point of care and able to determine accurately the plasma and/or intracellular level of PI. However, the only available test is based on LCMS available at a relatively high cost at unique specialized reference laboratories. Here we will perform the research and development necessary to complete the stable and robust kit for clinical laboratories. We will perform clinical studies to demonstrate utility for monitoring adherence and making dose adjustment and to obtain FDA pre-market approval. Moreover, we will investigate the compartment to be measured for best clinical utility: total drug (current state of the art), free drug (there is significant protein binding) or intracellular (there is large individual variability in this compartment). The test kit will then be manufactured for sale to clinical laboratories.",

(OPT) successfully demonstrated inPhase I that the efficiency of existing Wave Energy Converter(WEC) systems can be improved at least 5 times by making changesin the areas of hydrodynamic design, hydraulic system design andelectric power conversion system design. These changes, coupledwith a modest increase in WEC size are expected to yield a systemthat generates 100 kW  alone or in groups for higher powerlevels. The Phase I study also showed that a 25 times improvementin efficiency can be achieved if more radical design changes areimplemented. This more aggressive design approach, whileattractive from a system efficiency and cost standpoint, hasseveral implementation and survivability issues that need to beaddressed.The Phase II Base program proposed by OPT further develops twoalternative WEC designs through computer simulation and wave tanktesting of 1/40th scale models. Upon completion of the sub-scalewave tank tests, one of the two WEC designs will be selected forfurther wave tank testing at a 1/6th scale level. Upon successfulcompletion of the Phase II program, a full-scale system can beocean tested as part of a Phase III program.BENEFITS: The development of a 100 kW ocean wave power generator is of significant importance in both the commercial and military sectors.

These microbunches can be used to generate intense accelerating fields in dielectric microstructures, and possibly allow the future design of a high energy electron-positron collider that would be much smaller and less expensive than present technology permits. In Phase I, calculations were conducted to allow optimum chopping of a ~1 ps accelerated bunch into a train of about 30 ~4 fs, ~1-pC electron bunches spaced by 35 fs.  A configuration of quadrupole magnets was devised to manipulate transverse profiles of the micro-bunches into sheet-like form.  Theory and computations were carried out for wake fields and bunch stability when such bunches transverse planar dielectric accelerator structures.  Phase II will install (1) a beam stop for chopping a ~1 ps bunch into a train of about 30 ~4 fs, ~1pC bunches spaced by 35 fs;  (2) coherent synchrotron radiation diagnostics to infer the bunch lengths; and (3) quadrupole magnets to manipulate the bunches into sheet-like form for injection into a planar dielectric-lined wake field accelerator structure.

Yet few corresponding high-power components have been developed to provide rf power manipulation and transmission between the magnicon and the accelerator.  This project will develop a variety of high-power Ka-band rf components to remedy this situation.  These include waveguide tapers, right-angle miter bends, windows, mode converters, power combiners, mode launchers, phase shifters, dual directional couplers, and loads.  In Phase I, designs for all the components were developed; cold test versions of a taper, miter bend, mode converter, and power combiner were built and tested; and high-power versions of the dual directional coupler and load were built and installed on the magnicon output waveguides.  In Phase II, high-power, high-vacuum prototypes of all the components will be built and tested up to 45 MW.  Peak power limits for the components will be determined using a quasi-optical rf pulse compressor that is expected to produce levels up to 300 MW.

This project will develop a novel test device for subjecting RF structures at 34.272 GHz to high thermo-mechanical stress with pulsed temperature rises as high as 500\u00c2\u00bfC.  The device would allow structure lifetime tests to be conducted in a relatively short time, thereby evaluating the suitability of various materials and fabrication processes for future long-life high-gradient accelerators.  In Phase I, detailed analytical and numerical studies to optimize design of the 34.272 GHz demountable rf cavity for pulse surface heating tests were carried out, and a cold-test version of the cavity was built and tested.  Design features were incorporated that suppress RF breakdown, to allow for a clear evaluation of the effects on cavity surface degradation from thermo-mechanical surface stress.

Although assays that reliably detect HPV are available, their\nprognostic value for predicting progression to cervical cancer remains\ncontroversial, underscoring the need for assays with improved prognostic\nvalue. This Phase II SBIR will develop a novel method for detecting integrated\nHPV DNA in cervical cells. Oncogenic HPV DNA integration into the host genome\nis a common occurrence in cervical cancers and dysplasias, and assays\ntargeting this event may have high clinical value. Detection of integrated HPV\nDNA, however, is complicated by the frequent co-existence of episomal viral\nDNA. Using model cell lines which contain both episomal and integrated HPV\nDNA, and analytical methods such as in situ hybridization and PCR, Phase I\nresearch successfully detected integrated HPV DNA. Phase II research will\noptimize this approach for use with clinical samples and current liquid-based\ncytology methods. In contrast to conventional HPV tests, which identify viral\ntypes, this assay detects viral integration and targets a wider range of viral\ntypes, increasing assay sensitivity.\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:\nThis screening method for integrated HPV DNA in cervical cells will facilitate diagnosis of cervical cancer and early treatment, reducing mortality rates.",

Currently, these parameters are measured using numerous sensors that cannot perform adequately for high-performance/high-speed aircraft. Recent research into OADS has focused on coherent Mie (aerosol) lidar, which fail in many flight regimes due to insufficient aerosol scattering. Moreover, Mie lidar cannot measure temperature or pressure. Rayleigh (molecular) lidar overcomes these shortcomings by scattering from the air itself to provide velocity, temperature and pressure. Rayleigh/Mie lidar has the additional benefit of providing improved velocity measurements when sufficient aerosols exist. Thus, OPHIR's Rayleigh/Mie OADS offers performance, weight and cost savings advantages not provided by any other commercially available or developing technology.The Phase I research effort has been very successful. All objectives were met and all tasks successfully completed. This research has proven the feasibility of a Rayleigh/Mie lidar OADS. Phase II will include the development of a flyable prototype.

Forexample, certain polarization states of light have been shown to be impervious to the effects of scattering by aerosols (smoke, fog, etc.).

Because of the greater dispersion in the visible, specifically in towards the blue spectrum, chromatic aberrationbecomes more difficult to control. In addition, packaging to meet a specific helmet layout configuration also becomes a challenge.  Packaging can be very simple with no folds, but this configuration results in a large shift in the helmet center of gravityaway from the user causing significant fatigue for the user.  Configurations with multiple folds allow the CG closer to be closer to the user at the cost of added complexity.",

        "abstract": "The Phase I research and analyses have confirmed the potential of wavefront sensing in providing the necessary information to accurately control interferometers. The concept involves data processing on the interferometer output signals to determine the adjustments required to achieve the desired interferometer performance. It is particularly valuable in advanced space interferometry missions where conventional metrology instrumentation may not be adequate in providing the necessary alignment data. The resulting information is useful in controlling the optical elements, and, in cases where the optical components are carried on separate spacecraft flying in formation, useful in controlling the spacecraft.The signal-processing and image-processing techniques developed in Phase I are relatively generic in nature. For Phase II research, the selection of a specific space interferometer mission concept is proposed to provide the basis for more-detailed development of the wavefront-sensing concept. A comprehensive control structure for the optical components and their host spacecraft will be designed to address the real-world control issues. New data-processing techniques will be developed to handle the realistic interferometer signals expected from operational deployment. High-fidelity test beds are considered for evaluation of the technologies.",

Traditionally, the monitoring of human physiological data requires attaching electrodes to the skin with adhesive collars, tape, or collodion after the skin has been vigorously cleaned to reduce electrical contact impedance. This approach is both time-consuming and troublesome. Therefore, a need exists for physiological recording electrodes that do not require exorbitant technician set-up time and vigorous skin preparation of the patient to be monitored. The proposed dry physiological recording electrodes have an innovative micro-machined surface that enables fast application times without causing patient discomfort. Recent tests showed the feasibility of producing micro-topographical features on the dry electrode surface that penetrate through the high impedance dead skin cells making excellent electrical contact with the patient even on hairy parts of the test subject. The recorded physiological signals (EEG and EMG) were comparable to adjacently mounted conventional electrodes.

Avoiding severe thermal cycling of the chamber will extend chamber lifetime and allow for simple, lightweight, low-cost chamber designs. The vortex acts as an effective flame holder and may prevent combustion instability. The spinning vortices also provide an extended flow path much longer than the geometric length of the chamber. The chamber length may thus be reduced for a significant weight savings. The enhanced shear mixing should produce high combustion efficiencies.

Lighter, higher-performing vehicles will result. Project objectives include development of a subscale rocket engine with which to test LH2/UFAL/LOX over a range of operating conditions, analysis and correlation of experimental data, and preliminary design of larger rocket and ramjet engines for Phase II. In Phase I, a prototype rocket will be test fired. In Phase II, a larger rocket engine will be developed and tested and a prototype ramjet engine will be tested to validate the performance of LH2/UFAL with air for combined-cycle vehicles. It is anticipated that the test results will show high specific impulse, high combustion efficiency, and improved propellant density.

Phase I demonstrated new concepts for nutrient flow and control interval to each root module. Phase II will fully characterize a root module system capable of controlling oxygen and CO2 concentrations, and temperature of the root zone. Particulate based nutrient delivery systems have been commonly used in current space based plant growth systems and have been demonstrated to maintain healthy plants in microgravity, but have not controlled oxygen. The primary effort of this proposed project will be oriented toward building a system that can effectively control water and oxygen distribution in a root zone through manipulation of liquid source, flow, and aeration. This system will focus on aeration maintenance with and without root mass, measure and compare the impact of different water delivery sources and flows protocols, combined with various mechanisms of aeration, on the root zone environment. This research will allow the development of a root zone nutrient delivery system that will support plants in microgravity, without limiting oxygen.",

This project will develop an interactive multimedia program to teach bicycle safety skills. This project will develop an interactive multimedia program to teach bicycle safety skills to children in grades K-3, for use in both school and home settings. The Phase I prototype successfully used animated and live-video presentation to teach children one of the most important bicycle safety skills crossing the roadway. The critical features of this Project are the utilization of interactive media for the instructional presentation to the individual user, the incorporation of instructional design features that have been shown to achieve maximum learning, and the application of safety skills in video-based examples of real-life traffic situations. The program will incorporate computer-based assessment with remediation to ensure content mastery. Phase II development will expand the interactive bicycle safety program to include a comprehensive set of bicycle safety skills (e.g., playing safely near streets, crossing with no intersections, walking in a neighborhood, crossing parking lots) across urban, suburban, and rural environments. The program will be evaluated in a randomized control trial. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Multimedia educational software is a growing field, with both schools and home users comprising a large customer base. The individualization afforded by multimedia, combined with superior instructional design and remediation as needed, make this CD-ROM and Internet product a simple cost-effective way for schools to teach bicycle safety.

However, the logistics of getting fresh, viable cartilage from donor to recipient requires the development of tissue banking methods. Conventional cryopreserved osteochondral grafts perform poorly in vivo and it is well established, in other tissue systems, that conventional cryopreservation often results in potentially damaging ice formation, both in the cells and in the surrounding extracellular matrix. In Phase I, we performed feasibility testing of an alternative ice-free cryopreservation method known as vitrification in a rabbit model. Fresh, conventionally cryopreserved, and vitrified specimens were compared. The results demonstrated 80-85 percent cell viability in vitrified specimens and similar performance of fresh and vitrified cartilage in vivo. In contrast, frozen cryopreserved specimens had low cell viability, correlating with the distribution of ice, and poor performance in vivo. In this Phase II proposal, testing of vitrification as a storage method for articular cartilage transplants is extended to a longer duration large animal study. In addition, several new methods of vitrification with better ice control will be screened in vitro and the two most effective methods will be tested in a large animal model in year 2.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the applicant's abstract): Origen Therapeutics is committed to developing pharmaceutical products in transgenic chickens.  In particular, Ongen's mission is to develop high affinity human antibodies. by creating chickens in which the endogenous heavy and light chain immunoglobulin (Ig) genes are 'knocked-out' and reconstituted with the human heavy and light chain Ig genes.  In evolutionary terms, birds have diverged from mammals and, therefore, the chicken produces high affinity antibodies against conserved mammalian antigens.  In addition, chickens produce a wide repertoire of high titer antibodies that possess high affinity and avidity.  By knocking out the endogenous lg loci and inserting the human loci in germline configuration, human polyclonal antibodies can be isolated from the chicken's egg.  By conventional techniques, human monoclonal antibodies can be produced from B-cells derived from chickens carrying inactivated endogenous Ig loci and human Ig loci in germline configuration.  These chickens will provide unique access to human polyclonal antibodies as therapeutic agents.  Human poylclonal antibodies are desirable because they bind to several epitopes on the target antigen, making them highly effective against complex antigens such as bacteria, fungi, viruses and toxins.  Currently, human polyclonal antibodies are used as anti-infectious agents against a variety of diseases but commercially available immunoglobulin preparations from human donors vary in their titer and effectiveness for pathogens, severely limiting their utilization. In spite of their attractiveness as therapeutics, high titer human antibodies from immunized sources are not available.Origen's technology for producing chickens carrying the human Ig repertoire is based on the use of chicken embryonic stem cells.  This application proposes to develop methods to specifically delete the chicken IgH and lgL chain genes.  The first aim is to develop robust methods for transfecting and selecting cES cells and to show germline transmission of a transgene.  The second aim is to target the J-segments of the heavy and light chain loci to prevent translation of the endogenous genes. Correctly targeted ES cells will be injected into recipient embryos to produce germline chimeras.  Heterozygous lgHKO and lgLKO birds will be produced and will be bred in phase Ill to birds carrying the human IgH and lgL genes.  At the completion of phase Ill, chickens producing human Ig in response to antigen will yield a novel class of therapeutic proteins providing highly effective passive immunity to patients suffering from acute diseases for which therapy is not currently available and chronic diseases that require specific, high titer polvclonal antibodies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this Phase II application\nis to develop a sensitive quantitative biomarker of drug-induced neuronal\ndegeneration, particularly associated with drugs of abuse. We have shown that\nduring neuronal degeneration the neuronally localized protein MAP-tau is\nproteolytically cleaved (C-tau) in patients with head trauma and stroke. We\nhave developed antibodies that specifically recognize C-tau. Employing C-tau\nELISA and immunohistochemistry (IHC) Phase 1 studies demonstrate that after a\nneurotoxic dose of methamphetamine brain C-tau levels increase in a time\ndependent manner in the rat. Additional studies demonstrate for the first time,\nthat MDMA ('ecstasy') is a neurotoxin utilizing our C-tau ELISA. Our\nquantitative C-tau studies indicate that MDMA neurotoxicity is only 3 percent\nof that seen after methamphetamine accounting for the inability of previous\nstudies to demosnstrate MDMA neurotoxicity. The proposed studies will validate\nour C-tau neurotoxin biomarker by assessing the time course of neurotoxicity of\nthree street drugs (MDMA, PMA and PCP dust']), an environmental neurotoxin\n(TMT) and a neurotoxicity 'Gold Standard'-kainic acid.\nSpecific Aim 1-Product Development: Perform quality control studies and\nquality-controlled manufacturing of C-tau ELISA and IHC kits.\nSpecific Aim 2-Product Utilization: Determine if C-tau reliably quantifies\nneurotoxicity caused by drugs of abuse and environmental neurotoxins.\nNeurotoxic doses of drugs of abuse (MDMA, PMA, PCP), an environmental\nneurotoxin (TMT) and kainic acid ('Gold Standard') will be administered and the\ntime course of neurotoxicity quantified by ELISA and anatomically localized by\nC-tau IHC.\n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Our objective is to develop a sensitive biomarker for quantifying drug-induced neuronal degeneration.  The National Institute on Drug Abuse has indicated that \"improved methods are needed for identifying, assessing and quantifying the nature and extent of neurotoxicity\" of abused drugs. Currently, the primary method of identifying drug-induced neurotoxicity in animals is the selective silver stain method.  This method is histochemical and non-quantitative.  Our product will be both quantitative (ELISA) and more sensitive than available silver stain techniques for detecting drug-induced neurotoxicity employing immunohistochemistry.  There are several markets for our product (C-tau ELISA and C-tau immunohistochemistry).  Animal studies of neurotoxins, neurodegenerative diseases, head injury or stroke would be users of our C-tau technology.  In the year 2000 Medline indicates there were 4,254 studies published in these areas for an estimated annual market size of $4.2 million dollars.",

Visual displays which transform the time-domain signals into the frequency domain and which average over time are currentlyused for target detection and tracking.

Further, sonar operators do not listen to VLF signals because current hardware and signal processing techniquesare not effective in this frequency range.Creare proposes to complete the development of a system to optimize VLF audio signals for human operator hearing.  The system will enable frequency translation and compensation so that the signal can be calibrated to the hearing response of a specificsonar operator and will enhance transients.

Recent advances in sensor technology at NASA laboratories have led to the development of very small mass spectrometer detectors as well as other instruments such as scanning electronic microscopes. However, the vacuum systems to support these sensors remain large, heavy, and power hungry. To meet this need, Creare proposes to build an extremely miniaturized vacuum system based on a very small turbomolecular pump. While smaller than a D-cell battery, the turbomolecular pump has performance that is well matched to the needs of miniature analytical instruments. Such a pump represents an order-of-magnitude reduction in mass and volume over the current state-of-the-art, as represented by another Creare designed and built turbomolecular pump.

The system can provide 250 W of cooling for four hours with a mass about six kilograms (roughly half the weight of the current thermal control module), and will also reduce the size of the suit's radiator by increasing the heat rejection temperature. After an EVA mission, the heat absorber is regenerated thermally and prepared for the next mission using waste heat from the spacecraft or habitat. In Phase I we will prove the feasibility of the heat absorber by (1) performing proof-of-concept tests that will demonstrate the viability of the approach and provide key design data, and (2) producing a conceptual design of an EVA suit cooler that shows the potential benefits of our approach.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Implantable micro machined electrode arrays, in the short term, are highly valuable research tools, and in the long run will have great impact on rehabilitation of patients with various disabilities. In a chronic system, an interconnect forms the critical link between the microelectrode to the external world through a percutaneous connector. University of Michigan has integrated their probes with miniature; flexible, multilead silicon ribbon interconnects. The critical issue is that the ribbons are inherently fragile being made from thinned down silicon, and are prone to breakage as a result of the mechanical stresses created by tissue contraction during the healing process. To overcome these limitations, a polyimide flex cable and a discrete connector are being investigated. Preliminary testing of polyimide cables has indicated that it is unsuitable for chronic implants. The proposed effort will focus on replacing polyimide ribbon cables and discrete connectors with an integrated rigid flex circuit made out of a class of biocompatible materials known as liquid crystal polymers (LCP) with a unique combination of properties. Compared to polyimides, LCPs absorb virtually no moisture and are not susceptible to hydrolysis. The ribbon cable and the connector are fabricated as one piece. Integrating the connector with the flex cable represents a major advancement compared to current hybrid approach. This eliminates one level of interconnections, and results in a much smaller percutaneous connector compared to current discrete connectors. Ultimately, the cable will be bonded to the neural probe with a planar flip-chip bond, eliminating the need for wire bonds. Elimination of wire bonds will reduce the profile height and eliminate a major reliability concern.",

Under this proposed project, these components will be custom-made, qualified and integrated into a system, which will be used to demonstrate its performance targeted by the LITE project.  This study will provide usefulinformation regarding to power damage, output beam quality, and system packaging issues.  Results will provide the guideline for establishing a reliable power scaling law for future high energy laser systems.  This prototype will be packaged andfunctionally tested and delivered to the Air Force at the end of the project, along with testing results for characterizing the performance of this laser.",

        "abstract": "Objectives To determine the most effective mash recipe and optimal physical parameters for producing consistence, quality mulch pellets. In Phase I, we determined the general properties of a pellet that will make good mulch. The most critical operation is the actual milling of the mash into a pellet. It is a process involving pressure, heat and material consistency. The raw material that is pelletized is called a mash. The goal is to reduce straw volume by a factor of six to enable us to bagged, transported and spread the straw easily. Our challenge is producing densitized straw pellet that once hydrated contain long fibers to form a mulch matrix on the soil surface. To determine the most effective recipes for pellet ingredients of a dry applied mulch, a dry supplemented mulch and a hydro mulch. Each application shares one key objective, producing a mulch matrix on the soil surface with the maximum straw fiber content. However, each application has shuttle but significant differences that must be meet for the potential products to produce success. Dry applied mulch is limited by the equipment to spread the mulch. Our primary concerns are to produce a product that is flow able to prevent bridging in the spreader hoper. The dry supplemented mulch focus is a combination lawn repair mulch that will contain seed and fertilizer. Keeping the seed and fertilizer from segregating out of mulch prior to application will be a primary objective. The hydro mulch application must have pellets that hydrate quickly to prevent clogging or damage to the hydro-seeder pump and contain straw durable enough to be pump through the machine. To determine how to effectively use the mulch products for seed establishment and for soil erosion and sediment control. Seed establishment and erosion control are interrelated but yet very different. Our primary focus for seed establishment is to learn how well the straw mulch products will compensate for poor seed to soil contact and how well the mulch can aid in seed establishment under low moisture conditions. The erosion control work will evaluate the various mash combination for increase water infiltration and reduced soil runoff.",

The Dietary Research Monitoring System (DRMS) will utilize a Palm OS program for food intake recording which is then synced to the web and made available to the dietary professional for review or download. The DRMS also will allow the dietary professional to set dietary parameters to follow using a web interface. These dietary parameters will then be made available to the palm user to follow a recommended diet and receive feedback about compliance to that diet. In Phase I, a prototype of the DRMS program was developed. Feedback was obtained from dietary researchers and clinical nutritionists. The DRMS was evaluated in a small concurrent validity trial using a counterbalanced, crossover design. The results of Phase I showed that the DRMS produced correlations with food frequency questionnaires and 24 hr. dietary recall which were comparable to those found for food diary recording. For Phase II, the DRMS will be revamped and further developed based on the feedback obtained in Phase I. The resulting product will be evaluated by a pilot of potential end users for three days, and by a group of dietary professionals using the web interface. The product will then be evaluated in a randomly controlled trial comparing the DRMS to food diaries on: a) correlations and agreements with other dietary assessment measures (e.g. 24 hr. recall, food frequency questionnaire) and on the degree of compliance to a prescribed diet. One hundred and fifty subjects will be recruited and will monitor food intake for one week, then follow a prescribed diet for three weeks. The results of this Phase II project will be used to develop a commercial grade dietary assessment tool for use by various dietary professionals.",

        "abstract": "Environmental regulations for air emission and waste disposal have created a need for paint removal methods that are both economically and environmentally acceptable. Furthermore, architectural surfaces painted prior to 1978 have lead paint that should be removed to meet U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) lead concentration standards. Improved paint removal techniques are needed because \"acceptable\" techniques are inadequate. Media blasting and abrasive techniques, for example, generate a large volume of debris and can damage architectural materials. Chemical strippers are labor intensive, messy, and may be toxic. Also, many stripped surfaces require additional preparation before repainting. However, pulses of light, a technology being developed by Phoenix Science & Technology, Inc. (PS&T), removes paint without generating secondary waste and without damaging the surface. The technology also leaves behind a surface ready for repainting. Paint strippers using flashlamps and lasers are commercially available, but they are too expensive and impractical for removing paint from architectural surfaces. Phase I and subsequent internal research and development (R&D) work at PS&T demonstrated the feasibility of using this pulsed light source to meet lead concentration standards for architectural surfaces at high removal rates needed for commercialization.The proposed Phase II research project will continue the development of this photolytic paint removal process using PS&T's new lamp, with the potential to become a practical, low-cost paint stripper of architectural surfaces. The Phase II objectives are to: (1) determine optimum light pulse parameters for removing paints from architectural materials, (2) demonstrate an effluent capture system that meets air quality standards, (3) develop a robotic scanner to control the paint removal process, (4) develop a prototype depainter that meets HUD cleanliness standards for lead concentration, and (5) conduct a field test demonstration. The Phase II research project will be a sister program both to a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) program to develop the lamp technology needed for commercialization and a HUD Office of Healthy Homes program to develop a hand-held paint stripper to complement the large area paint stripper of this proposed Phase II research project. Together, the NIST, HUD, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency programs provide a comprehensive R&D program for lead paint removal in homes. A manufacturer of detectors for measuring lead concentration in paint will support Phase II and is a potential partner for the commercialization of a paint stripper using PS&T's lamp.",

Zebra mussels clog intake pipes, screens, cooling systems, and so on, and are a serious problem. The Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act and Amendments mandate control of zebra mussel infestations. Chlorine effectively controls zebra mussels but produces disinfectant by-products, some of which are carcinogenic. Many alternative technologies have been attempted, but a viable means of effectively managing zebra mussels has not been demonstrated.Sparker technology is a potential nontoxic control method. Sparkers emit pressure pulses that can prevent the growth of new zebra mussels and clear away adult zebra mussels. However, the only commercial sparker is not widely used because of effectiveness questions, the need to replace electrodes frequently, and a high capital cost. Phoenix Science & Technology, Inc., has developed innovative sparker sources with high efficiency, proprietary electrodes, and acoustic reflectors. The objective of this Phase II project is to develop a new low-cost, long-lifetime sparker system with proven zebra mussel control capabilities. The feasibility of sparker control was demonstrated in Phase II. Field tests at two water intake pipes determined the pressure levels needed to control zebra mussels, and for the first time determined the control range of a sparker. In laboratory experiments, Phoenix Science & Technology, Inc., demonstrated how to increase electrode lifetime by a factor of four and designed a conceptual low-cost sparker.",

Cytokines and chemokines are mediators (or surrogate markers) of these disease processes. In this program, a novel immunoglobulin-like scaffold has been developed as an antibody mimic. From a large random library consisting of 10313-10e14 distinct members, binding proteins were rapidly selected in vitro against key mediators by inflammatory or allergic processes. Antibody mimics to a minimum of 5 cytokine or chemokine targets were selected and will be further evaluated for performance characteristics such as affinity, specificity, epitope mapping, and ability to function on a solid phase surface. If needed, binding proteins can be improved by affinity maturation, and PCR mutagenesis.

The proposed approach multiplies the resolution (to 4k x 4k pixels) from a relatively low resolutionminiature-LCD, taking advantage of its high refresh speed.  The technology is made commercially attractive by its unique integration of available commercial components and low cost fabrication techniques.  The Phase I effort developed a compactLaser-Illuminated Sub-Image Scanning (LASIS) light engine demonstration unit in which COTS components such as laser diodes and CMOS-LCD microdisplays are integrated with POC's liquid crystal digital scanners to generate color sequential full resolutionimages for U.S. Air Force simulator HMDs.

        "abstract": "In this Phase II proposal Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) describes a program to develop and demonstrate a novel class of chemical oxygen iodine lasers (COIL) that would eliminate the need for consuming the singlet oxygen energy source to produce atomiciodine.  Our concept would also allow the iodine \"fuel\" to be premixed with the singlet oxygen.  This may eliminate the present requirement for fine scale, molecular iodine mixing nozzles and injectors.  It also offers the opportunity for pulsed COILoperation since the atomic iodine can be produced on demand.  Using several analytical tools and experimental results developed in the Phase I program, we propose to design, build, test and install key modules on an existing Air Force Research LaboratoryCOIL device.  Our overall Phase II objective is to demonstrate and characterize our premixed concept on a realistic COIL being used to develop advanced devices for military applications.",

The AIRIS will be an automated system that will allowdetailed, spectrally and spatially resolved images of HF laser beam profiles.  In addition, the AIRIS will provide a valuable tool for developing new chemical laser nozzles since it will provide images of mixing of the H2 and F flow steams and formation ofro-vibrationally excited HF within the laser cavity.  The HF AIRIS will provide a valuable tool for high power HF laser developers to provide improved system performance.   We propose a comprehensive development and testing program with field tests atrecognized national centers of excellence for HF lasers.  The HF AIRIS will have the ability to tune to user selected HF lines and rapidly switch between lines.

However, current procedures for testing the flame/thermal protective performance of military clothing fabric samples areunsatisfactory for routine automated evaluations.  These test methods are either highly simplified without evaluation of skin burn injuries or too complicated to use by the textile industry.  Physical Sciences Inc.

PSI's design includes an IR radiant heat source (matching battlefield levels), a thermal response sensor system, an adjustable fabric sample holder, data acquisitionhardware, and relevant burn injury calculations.  The system components will be integrated into an automated system that is capable of running multiple selected test scenarios and analyzing the data directly from the user interface.  PSI's design hasinnovative features providing state of the art capabilities to the Army and its contractors.

PSI identified commercial off the shelf components for low cost picosatconstruction.  Atomic oxygen induced transmission losses of candidate inflatable optical materials were tested to ensure the thin film polymer will not limit mission lifetime.  PSI performed calculations to assure achievement of design goals for opticalperformance and mission lifetime.  These design goals were applied to the allocation of the available space on the picosatellite.  In Phase II PSI proposes to use a masked inflatable optic to image a well characterized light source onto a CCD array.Analysis of these images enables the measurement of surface accuracy to within 20 microns, enabling us to verify static and dynamic models of the systems thermal and inflation properties.

The degradation of the polymer will be enhanced through blending with a chemically biodegradable polymer.  The Phase I results demonstrate that weare able top form such blends, achieving a thin film extinction cross section of up to 6 m2/g in thin film form using this approach.

The PSI process has been used to make highly reflective membranes with an areal density of 0.125 g/m2. The Gossamer design for very lightweight solar sails that utilize photons for propulsion requires very large areas (>10,000 m2) and with low mass. The current solar sail concepts involve terrestrial fabrication of ultra-thin polymer films, seaming the films together, launching the sail into orbit, and deploying the sail without damaging these ultra-thin films. The present state-of-the-art polymer materials, and polymer thin film processing technologies are unlikely to permit tear and defect free solar sail launch and deployment without a true materials or processing breakthrough. The PSI process will rapidly produce large area polymeric membranes in space that meet the mechanical, areal density, space durability, cost, and propulsion requirements of the NASA solar sailing missions.

Evaluation of the video imagery is currently limited to subjective visual judgments that can result in diminished reliability. A method enabling dimensional calibration of the images, and thus quantification of important vocal parameters, would greatly enhance the clinical and research capabilities of videoendoscopy with stroboscopy. Thus, the main goal of the proposed Phase II effort is to develop a laser-based projection system for dimensional calibration of laryngeal videoendoscopic images. The Phase I study just completed has clearly shown the feasibility of achieving this goal. \n\nThe focus will be to develop an optically based object sizing system for flexible transnasal as well as rigid transoral laryngoscopes. The Phase II effort will entail: (1) construction of clinical prototypes of the calibrated endoscopic instruments, and (2) extensive clinical testing of the instruments at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI). \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The market potential for a user-friendly calibration system customized for laryngeal videostroboscopy is estimated to be several hundred units in the U.S.  Similar systems for more general use endoscopy  of the upper airway (including larynx) have a potential worldwide market of up to several thousand units.

The proposed source is based on proprietary MID-JET technology. This technology employs an electrode-less discharge contained by vortex flow, rather than a dielectric tube commonly used in traditional sources. MIDJET technology utilizing a temperature of 5000 C to produce1021 nitrogen atoms has been demonstrated. This is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that generated by currently available sources. It is particularly applicable to Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) systems, where it will allow both high growth rate and the elimination of the use of ammonia. The MIDJET will be adapted for use in a MOCVD reactor and a demonstration made of the system's ability to grow gallium nitride at a rate of at least 10 microns per hour. This project will develop a charge-free, high flux/fluence nitrogen atom beam for the growth of III-V nitride materials which can replace existing plasma-based tools. With higher growth rates of high quality material over larger areas, systems based on the MIDJET will have with application to the fabrication of high power/high temperature semiconductor devices and blue illumination sources (including those for flat panel displays).",

        "abstract": "The Methane to Aromatics on Mars (METAMARS) project will design and build a machine for converting methane produced by the Sabatier reaction into a low hydrogen content, low vapor pressure, high density, aromatic fuel. Its primary advantage is a factor of four reduction of hydrogen feedstock importation requirements for production of rocket fuel compared to the standard S/E process for an equivalent mass of fuel. In addition, since all oxygen produced by the Sabatier system comes from the carbon dioxide feed, by reducing the hydrogen in the fuel the METAMARS process will simultaneously improve the stoichiometry of the fuel/oxidizer combination and will reduce the power required by the process. The benzene fuel is also considerably denser than methane fuel. A final advantage of the METAMARS process is that it operates at low pressure, in contrast to synthesis reactions for other higher hydrocarbons. These advantages make the METAMARS process a prime technology to improve the applicability of the Sabatier process for small scale unmanned Mars missions, such as the Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission, as well as a key technology for manned Mars missions.",

To meetthese challenges, we will show the feasibility of (Phase I) and demonstrate (Phase II) an adaptive attitude control design approach that works during flight to autonomously identify the system dynamics affecting the control bandwidth, then design feedbackcontrol laws to achieve predefined performance and stability criteria.  Our technical approach is based on our Frequency Domain Expert (FDE) control algorithm, which has been demonstrated on the Space Station Freedom as part of the Middeck Active ControlExperiment (MACE-II).",

Rhenium isbeing used for nozzles and hot gas valve components because ofits high melting temperature and chemicalstability. However, the difficulty of forming rhenium and otherrefractory metals into complexshapes has limited their application in the past. PlasmaProcesses, Inc.has demonstrated rapid, low cost fabrication of refractory metalcomponents using Vacuum Plasma Spray processes. The techniqueinvolvesdepositing material onto a mandrel of the desired shape andsubsequentlyremoving the mandrel. A primary advantage over othertechniques is that net-shape forming of components significantlysimplifiesand reduces the cost of fabrication due to the high materialutilization andreduction of machining.  Analysis shows that a non-erodingnozzle will improve AMRAAM's ISP by 6 seconds.  In Phase I, arhenium nozzle was fabricated, composite wrapped, andsuccessfully hot fire tested in less than onemonth. The hot fire testing demonstrated the ability of net shapecomponents to meet stringent thermal and mechanical requirementswith zero erosion.Exploitation of these rapid processing techniques decreases thecost andmanufacturing time of rocket engine nozzle and hot gascomponents while boosting performance.BENEFITS: The results of the Phase I effort clearly demonstrate the ability to mateinnovative rapid manufacturing technologies with ref",

Tungsten and molybdenum have high melting temperatures and in general possess the required chemical inertness. To improve the mechanical properties of these materials, alloy additions such as rhenium are necessary. Recently, thin-walled, closed-end cartridges have been fabricated from elemental blends of molybdenum-rhenium powders. However high temperature heat treatments are necessary to alloy elemental blended powders. Problems with distortion, intermetallic formation and incomplete alloying have occurred. To overcome these problems, an innovative Plasma Alloying and Spheroidization (PAS) process is being developed to produce pre-alloyed molybdenum-rhenium and tungsten-rhenium powders. Benefits of the PAS process such as a two-order magnitude reduction in oxygen contamination, enhanced flow characteristics, ability to produce pre-alloyed refractory metal powders and the ability to reduce heat treatment processing time were demonstrated during Phase I. During Phase II, the PAS process will be optimized. The optimized PAS Mo-Re and W-Re powders will be used for the production of robust, high temperature QMI and GEDS cartridges for microgravity processing experiments.",

PlasmaSol has developed a means to maintain stable non-thermal plasma at atmospheric pressure and direct the plasma at a surface for decontamination purposes. Non-Thermal Plasmas (NTP) are ionized gases which are far from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and are characterized by having electron mean energies much higher than those of the ambient gas molecules. In these plasmas, it is possible to preferentially direct the electrical energy in order to produce highly energetic electrons without heating the ambient gas. This energy is utilized directly to excite, dissociate and ionize the gas via electron impact. PlasmaSol LLC has demonstrated in a laboratory setting the ability to break down a variety of organic compounds associated with hazardous waste using non-thermal plasma. In theory, at the microbial level, similar destruction should be expected for a variety of cellular organisms. These include but are not limited to bacteria, spores, etc. It is the intention of this project to determine the viability of non thermal plasma for use in the control of terrestrial microbial contamination associated with robotic space vehicles.",

In the Phase I study, surface-phosphonylated and microtextured rods composed of solid-state oriented PEEK and CRF-PEEK were implanted transcortically in edentulous mandibles in goats and were assessed at 12 weeks for osseointegration. The results indicated (1) solid-state orientation of PEEK increased modulus; (2) phosphonylation of PEEK promoted osseointegration; and (3) osseointegration was further enhanced by surface microtexturing and immobilizing calcium to the phosphonylated PEEK surface. These results and additional studies at Poly-Med on PEEK clearly indicate several polymer engineering options can produce an optimum endosteal dental implant (EDI). Therefore, the options for the Phase II study will include solid-state orientation, fiber-ultradrawing, surface phosphonylation, fiber reinforcement, and self-reinforcement of PEEK.

This prototype will be tested in industrial crystallizers.To accomplish the above, a team of engineers with appropriate skills in digital electronics, opto-mechanics and software has been brought together. They will collaborate with the university researchers, pharmaceutical engineers and the computational experts.

        "abstract": "Nanosat technology will require commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) integrated circuits (ICs) to meet the performance requirements. Single event latchup (SEL) triggered by energetic ions in the space environment is a reliability concern. Thinning the Si substrate material below the active region in the CMOS structure raises the threshold linear energy transfer (LET) threshold for energetic ions to trigger SEL because the thinner substrate region produces less charge when the ion penetrates. With a higher LET threshold, there are fewer ions capable of triggering SEL, rendering the IC more radiation-tolerant with respect to SEL. The innovation of this approach is that substrate thinning will be applied to unhardened ICs which are purchased from commercial vendors and post-processed (thinned and possibly ion implanted) and packaged as a radiation-tolerant product. This will enable use of a large class of high-performance ICs that would not otherwise be acceptable for use in the space radiation environment. The significance of this innovation is that it will reduce susceptibility of COTS microelectronics to SEL and enable their use in future NASA missions.

The U.S. segment uses an expendable, activated charcoal bed (22.7 kg charcoal), a high temperature catalytic oxidizer assembly and a postsorbent LiOh bed. The Russian system uses an expendable activated carbon canister (1.3 kg) followed by two regenerative activated charcoal beds (16 kg apiece, 7.4 kg charcoal in each) and a room temperature CO oxidizer. PCI is proposing to develop a novel, regenerable adsorber using zeolites/adsorbents coated on Microlith? substrates to replace the activated charcoal beds. Phase I results indicate the potential to reduce 15 kg charcoal weight to less than 2 kg of adsorbent with a proportionate reduction in size and a reduction in housing weight. The Phase II proposes to develop and optimize a resistively heated, thermo-vacuum Microlith? adsorber to be used as a simple, lightweight and cost effective system that aims to demonstrate safe and reliable operation with minimal maintenance, electrical power and crew-time requirements. A prototype will be delivered to NASA upon Phase II conclusion.",

The development of effective treatment for hypertension is critical to controlling costs of this disease which has the largest negative impact on the U.S. economy in loss of productive years. Anti-hypertensive drugs have a large window of therapeutic options, including significant variation in dosages, medications, and combinations of therapies used. The objective of the Phase II project is to continue development of the software platform, GeneRx, which incorporates pharmacogenetics and nonlinear adaptive algorithms toward optimizing anti-hypertension therapy on a patient specific basis. Genetic data for each patient will be acquired by genotyping DNA from the blood samples, and scored as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present or absent in key hypertension-related genes. GeneRx will take a patient's individual genetic, demographic, and environmental variables and predict lickely efficacy of a hypertension medication. In Phase I, the basic feasibility of a predictive algorithm for predicting patient response for the ACE inhibitor class of hypertension drugs was established. The Phase II project will use patient information and blood samples from both archival and ongoing hypertension studies to predict the effectiveness of other classes of hypertension medications, including calcium channel blockers, dieuretics, and beta blockers.

Solid-state power amplifiers provide the substantial benefits of elimination of high voltage supplies,reduction in size and weight, and generally improved reliability, especially for airborne microwave systems.  However, the demand for high power at millimeter-wave frequencies are steadily increasing for today's military and commercial systems such asMILSTAR, SATCOM, GBS and LMDS. The limitation of output power of present MMICs can be partially overcome by combining several of them offers low loss, good amplitude and phase balance, and high power handling capability.  Combining approaches can beseparated into two groups: those, which can combine two devices at a time and those that can combine the output of N devices in one step.  On one hand, the losses of binary structure degrade the combining efficiency and on the other hand, the n-waycombining structures are designed to combine the output of N-devices in one step.  This scheme has the potential of higher combining efficiency.  We are proposing the development of SATCOM amplifiers using Gysel Combiner and MILSTAR amplifier using Radialcombiner.

These combined domains are not assessed adequately by existing measures of reading readiness, and intervention activities that facilitate their development are absent from preschool curricula. This Phase I application has two specific aims. The first is to evaluate the feasibility of a test that will assess the three critical domains. Test development will feature state-of-the-art procedures for item selection and evaluation, with particular sensitivity to children at risk for reading failure due to poverty, limited English proficiency, and parental history of reading failure. An initial evaluation of the psychometric properties of the test will be completed by administering it to 300 3- to 5-year-old children. The second aim is to produce and complete an initial evaluation of prototypic intervention activities for each domain. The initial evaluation will be accomplished in a pilot study of 30 3- to 5-year-old children at-risk for reading failure.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A major goal of HIV-1 research is the development of nontoxic agents that target novel stages of the viral replicative cycle, such as viral entry. New agents are needed both to combat the growing incidence of HIV-1 strains that are broadly resistant to existing antiretroviral medications and to lessen the considerable toxicities associated with current therapies. In addition, adequate control of HIV-1 replication generally requires uninterrupted, combination use of three or more drugs, mandating that new antiviral agents be produced as cost-effectively as possible in order to maximize patient access. CD4-IgG2 is a novel, tetravalent antibody-like molecule that incorporates four copies of the virus binding domains of human CD4, which is the primary receptor for HIV-1. CD4-IgG2 binds to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 with nanomoIar affinity, thereby preventing attachment of HIV-1 to target cells and viral entry. CD4-IgG2 has demonstrated potent activity against primary HIV-1 isolates in extensive preclinical testing and more recently in Phase I/II human clinical trials. CD4-IgG2 is the only HIV-1 attachment inhibitor in advanced clinical development and thus represents a new class of antiviral agent. CD4-IgG2 is potently synergistic when used in combination with agents that block other stages of viral entry, such as the gp41 fusion inhibitor T-20 and coreceptor-targeting agents. This result suggests that combinations of entry inhibitors could emerge as an important new treatment paradigm. CD4-IgG2 is currently produced via conventional cell culture methods. However, transgenic technology provides an unsurpassed method for low-cost, high-volume manufacture of complex biopharmaceuticals. The Phase I study demonstrated that biologically active CD4-IgG2 can be expressed at high levels in the milk of transgenic animals, using mice as a model system. The overall goal of the Phase II project is to produce CD4-IgG2 in the milk of transgenic dairy animals, and to determine the therapeutic potential of transgenic CD4-IgG2 in both the best available preclinical models of HIV-1 infection and in human clinical testing. Success in the project would represent an important milestone for the development both of a new class of anti-HIV-1 therapy and of transgenic technology.",

The  main thrust of the project is to develop a prototyping simulator that will permit estimation of the performance of the system in a variety of clutterand target scenarios. The resultant techniques are expected to have a wide range of applications, for example in airborne ground surveillance radars, in maritime surveillance, and in space-based radars.  A commercialization plan is proposed that willassess the relevance of the system to existing and emerging radar systems in consultation with the potential customer base and with radar system suppliers.

This project will develop a rugged, low-cost thermal neutron detection technology using a large array of straw detector elements, each with a very thin converter coating, that can be produced and assembled efficiently and economically.  The small diameter of individual straws will permit good spatial resolution and adaptable size and configuration.  Assembling the straws into modules, and using modern integrated circuit technology, will allow the straws to be read out individually in parallel, thereby permitting extremely high count rates.  In Phase I, single straw neutron detectors of 10 cm and   1 m length, as well as a 50-straw module, were successfully constructed and shown to demonstrate stable operation.  Experimental testing of gamma ray discrimination, neutron efficiency, aging effects, and spatial resolution was performed with excellent results, including longitudinal resolution approaching 5 mm in a 1 m detector and sensitivity exceeding that of commonly used He3 detectors.  In Phase II, cost effective methods for base materials production will be developed.  A rugged module housing and two electronics readout systems will be designed, constructed, and evaluated.  Testing at neutron facilities will be performed to demonstrate the functionality of the detector for various applications, and the results of this testing will be used to refine and produce a fully functional detector with accompanying electronics.              Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The proposed neutron detector should have application in neutron scattering facilities at government and university nuclear research laboratories in the U.S. and abroad.  Enhanced neutron scattering capabilities should enable progress in materials characterization and structural biology, resulting in advancements in biotechnology, the aviation and automobile industries, and superconductivity research, among other fields.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):All clinical nuclear medicine imaging is done exclusively with crystal detector systems, which impose many limitations in both cost and technical performance. In 140 keV imaging, the Nal/PMT camera, the workhorse of nuclear medicine, is extremely bulky, costly, and limited in both count rate and spatial resolution. In 511 keV PET imaging, the need for exotic high Z crystals results in high cost and limited solid angle. Xenon at a density of 0.55 g/cm3 can produce a 10-fold energy resolution improvement over Nal and LSO and a time resolution comparable to LSO. Based on previous work, we propose a high pressure xenon cylindrical pulse ionization detector (20-50 mm diameter) having a pressure containing shell composed of a very low density high strength fiber composite. Through use of this composite, interaction losses with the walls of the vessel are lowered to negligible levels. Also, a highly innovative readout technique has been proposed and evaluated in which the tube interior is read out through effectively transparent walls. Pilot analytical and experimental studies have proven that a general purpose detector element can be achieved capable of both 140 keV and 511 keV imaging and having excellent 3D spatial resolution on the order of 1 mm. Experimental studies have also shown that, through use of light signals produced by both the primary interaction process and stimulated emission near the electron collection point at the anode, energy resolution approaching amplifier noise limits is possible. \n\nThus energy resolution can be markedly improved relative to any room temperature crystal. The density of xenon employed is about 6-fold less than Nal but still affords efficient detection of 140 keV in a suitably thin detector. For 511 keV detection, the multiple interaction vertices that occur in xenon are adequately spread out among distinct tubes in an absorbing array and primary scintillation light provides coincidence time resolution of 1 ns. Thus, the proposed detector element configured in appropriate arrays can offer greatly improved performance in both of the major nuclear medicine imaging arenas. In Phase II, arrays of full sized detector elements will be developed, constructed and evaluated to predict imaging characteristics that can be achieved in very important SPECT and PET techniques.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the last few years an extraordinary emphasis has been placed on the design and use of PET cameras for small animal studies, for example, to aid in the development of human gene therapies by imaging transgenic animals such as mice. Although, such techniques have an extraordinary potential for both clinical and basic biomedical science applications, its full realization is severely hampered by the expense, complexity and physical limitation of crystal detectors widely used in today's cameras. In particular, crystals are costly and very difficult to segment to the desired 1 mm level. Furthermore, depth of interaction error in the 1 cm or greater crystal depth required causes severe degradation of off-axis resolution. This project seeks to develop enhanced high resolution PET through the highly novelapproach of the lead walled straw (LWS). In Phase I, feasibility of application of this high energy physics spin off technology has been proven, and in fact it has been demonstrated that considerably enhanced imaging characteristics can be achieved. A 2 mm LWS modular unit has been developed which has produced 1.0 mm FWHM axial spatial resolution. When utilized in ring arrays, such a module will produce a reconstructed volumetric spatial resolution of less than 2 ul, which is a factor of 8 improvements compared to the best commercial camera. Furthermore axial sensitive field of view can be readily extended to as large as 20-40 cm, and very high sensitivity can be achieved at modest cost. In Phase II, a promising modular detector design will be fully implemented and a custom electronics readout system will be developed, facilitating low-cost construction. A small animal PET camera will then be developed with performance that substantially exceeds that of current commercial systems for murine and other small animal imaging. In Phase III, this camera will be developed into a commercial product, which is expected to substantially aid in this important research field.",

The single-bit, delta-sigma architecture offers high purity (-150 dBc/Hz), low in-band spurious content (100 dB SFDR) signals on one integrated circuit realized in IBM's SiGe BiCMOS process.  In addition,this sophisticated DDS will support beamforming operations (i.e., time delay, phase shift, amplitude weighting).  Its small size, low power dissipation, and low cost make the Delta-Sigma DDS attractive for integration into advanced T/R modules.  Under theproposed Phase II Base effort, Q-DOT will develop a monolithic Delta-Sigma DAC IC realized with SiGe BiCMOS technology.  In the Phase II Option, the Delta-Sigma DAC integrated IC will be integrated with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components to form astored-waveform, Delta-Sigma DDS Module.  Q-DOT will work with the Navy to insert the Delta-Sigma DDS into advanced DAR during Phase III.",

QEI Technologies, Inc. proposes to develop a next-generation ultraviolet absorption photometer for mounting on small aerial platforms. The compact, single-beam photometer will be based on earlier designs developed by the Principal Investigator for use on tethered and sounding balloons. The new design, in keeping with the philosophy of the earlier single-beam designs, will offer performance matching heavier, more expensive double-beam instruments while greatly reducing size and power consumption. In contrast with electrochemical sondes, the ultraviolet technique offers far greater precision as well as immunity to interferences from virtually all other atmospheric species at typical concentrations.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will produce a set of completed and commercially viable intelligent tutoring systems for chemistry education, building upon a rule-based, model-tracing, cognitive modeling tutor prototype for chemical equation balancing. Teachers, students, parents and administrators state that existing chemistry education software does not satisfy their need for truly interactive and on-demand computer instruction. Current approaches are rigid and linear, offering only a limited number of fixed and statically scripted problems. They do not deal with the individual student's own work in any meaningful or intelligent way. By simulating reasoning using chemical principles rather than compiling a database of problems and answers, artificial intelligence methods can provide a route to overcoming these serious fundamental limitations. Although the technology proffered by Quantum Simulations, Inc. is technology that will assist all students, those students of average or marginal performance will benefit the most.\nCreating tutoring systems that can function as guides and not just as graders of student work is an important step in realizing the full value of computers in education. The proposed work takes a significant step in this direction. Moreover, the technology has been designed in a general way such that it can be applied to other educational topics beyond chemistry and can work together in a synergistic, value-added fashion with other tools and curricula in a multi-resource learning environment.

Existing tactical radars, such as the TPQ-37 and MPQ-64, are highly sensitive search and track radarswhose basic operational parameters are ideally suited for weather surveillance applications. During Phase I, we plan to work with engineers from the radar manufacturer to design one or more weather surveillance modes for the TPQ-37 and MPQ-64. A customradar signal processor will be designed to extract reflectivity and Doppler data from the analog output of the radars. This data will be merged with antenna scanning, time stamp and geo-location information to accurately display the output data in worldcoordinates. Recurring and non-recurring costs to modify the radars for weather surveillance applications will be determined. The pulse-to-pulse scanning agility of these radars makes them especially powerful tools for the study of rapidly developingconvective weather systems that are poorly characterized by conventional PPI-scanning weather radars.BENEFITS: Commercial applications include modification of existing and new TPQ-37 and MPQ-64 radars for tactical and civilian weather surveillanceapplications.

The primary thrust of our research will be the development of designs for low-cost millimeter-wave radars suitable for detection of backscatter from liquid water clouds at ranges in excess of 10 km. Existing radars that have been used for these studies are expensive one-of-a-kind research instruments with designs that are unsuitable for general aviation, where cost will be a primary consideration. By working cooperatively with manufacturers of microwave and millimeter-wave subsystems, we plan to develop a suite of radars for airborne and icing detection that will reduce the cost by a factor of five or more for prototype systems, and by a factor of up to 100 for production units. Practical airborne icing potential detection cannot be achieved without a major cost reduction of millimeter-wave radar systems. By using solid-state transmitters, integrated or monolithic low-noise receivers and IF circuits, and novel antenna concepts, and advanced signal processing techniques, we are confident that low cost systems can be developed for both airborne and ground-based applications.",

        "abstract": "During the Phase I effort of the Vibration Assisted Clam Harvesting effort, it was shown that the employment of vibrations for mechanical clam harvesting is environmental sound, economically feasible, less stressing on workers, and addresses pressing industry needs. The overall goal of the Phase II effort is to advance the development of the vibratory approach by developing the necessary supporting technologies to have a completely integrated system capable of harvesting clams on a commercial scale. The availability of such a system may have far reaching industry impacts and may cause changes in farming techniques to capitalize on this revolutionary capability. With these goals in mind, the technical objectives focus both on hardware development and farming procedures. Technical objectives include the development of a variable vibratory control system to account for varying substrate conditions, means for tracking the harvester through the clam bed when the system is out of visual sight (underwater) and an overall control scheme to synchronize the action of the harvesting head with the mobility platform (watercraft or walk-behind unit). This program will develop a vibratory system that is adaptable to different soil conditions by providing feedback and controlling both the amplitude and frequency of the vibrations. The overall control scheme must incorporate, not only these vibratory factors, but also the adaptability in forward motion of the harvester and control of the `ground pressure' of the harvester. The objective is to optimize the interaction of these physical parameters of the harvester over a wide variety of conditions to increase the system functionality, utility and appeal. The ultimate objective of this effort is the commercialization of capability. Our commercialization strategy is designed to allow for the development of a modular system to accommodate a variety of harvesting conditions with appeal to different-sized clam farming operations. An initial design developed in Phase I consisting of vibrating tines will serve as the baseline for further development. This design meets our requirements for a generalized harvesting head design that is scalable to different sized farming operations and can be incorporated into different mobility platforms. In addition to determining the physical requirements of the harvester, research will explore changes in planting techniques. Clams are currently planted in a manner to support manual harvesting. With the availability of an acceptable automated harvester, planting techniques and clam-bed configurations may be changed to optimize harvesting operations. This Phase II effort will explore changes to farming techniques that support automated harvesting. During the Phase II program, economic and environmental aspects of the vibratory harvester will be explored. This will include collection of operating and life-cycle-cost and productivity data. This information will be collected during an extended operational demonstration to assess the impact of the approach on both the industry and environment.",

        "abstract": "The Good Natured Family Farms community-based poultry alliance will be used as a test case to develop safe, repeatable, and efficient methods for providing bulk and prepackaged whole and cut-up free-range chicken that is judged by consumers to be superior to commodity chicken in appearance and taste. These methods will be incorporated into an ISO-9000-based quality system suitable for use by small poultry marketing alliances in producing, processing, and marketing free-range and pastured poultry in a retail supermarket environment. The quality system can establish a structure for process quality within alliances, providing a means for standardizing key practices and increasing the capacity of the participants to contribute consistent quality products. Alliances of small units can offer the feel of a larger organization, opening up higher volume market opportunities, as they are better able to compete. The objectives of the project, including technical questions it will address, are as follows: 1. Refine the whole and cut-up free-range/pastured poultry product formats in bulk and pre-packaged form. What is an economical method of cutting up chickens on a small-volume basis? What is the best weight of bird to maximize the cut up yield (bone-in and boneless)? What processing practices are required to ensure consistent appearance of cut parts (conformance to standard cutting of parts) for conventional marketing? What is the impact of cutting and pre-packaging on product shelf life? Food safety protection? What packaging method(s) strike the best balance between affordability and consumer appeal? 2. Identify best practices for small free-range/pastured poultry production and processing. What production factors seem to have the greatest influence on the final appearance and eating experience of the finished product (e.g. breed, feed, forage materials, size and age at slaughter)? What are the production standards to be established for these factors? 3. Develop a Good Natured Family Farms Quality System for free-range/pastured poultry production, processing, and retailing patterned after its QSVP system for beef. Which elements of the existing QSVP system must be customized for poultry (e.g. livestock production records, product identification and traceability during processing and retailing, etc)? What systems will be implemented? What process may be used to achieve certification recognition by the USDA? By alternate third parties?",

        "abstract": "Conical scanning LIDAR systems and laser ranging systems that measure atmospheric backscatter, clouds, aerosols, winds, trace species, and sub-surface ocean layers require ruggedized construction and easy alignment. We are proposing to reduce the complexity and alignment chores by building five telescope objectives into one large shared aperture using holographic volume multiplexing techniques similar to those used in some holographic data storage systems. The holographic objectives will then be stationary with five simultaneous look angles that may be turned on and off with a smaller coaxial out going beam scanner or a separate laser in each channel. This simple scheme can eliminate all moving parts which simplifies alignment while providing a more rugged and transportable system. The addition of a holographic aberration correction plate is now possible in a static position near the detector. This small HOE gets illuminated by incoming LIDAR signals and outputs a collimated wave which is easily focused by a simple doublet to a near diffraction limited spot. The benefit is that the field of view can be greatly reduced, thereby reducing background noise levels. The additional diffractive surface squares the wavelength dependant filtering function provided by diffractive optics, thereby further reducing out of band noise.",

While there are many ongoing programs to improve situational awareness, the majority of the research is aimed at commercial aviation and high end users, and will require expensive technological solutions. General aviation has the same needs -- to improve situational awareness and therefore improve safety, but most general aviation aircraft owners cannot afford the types of solutions that are being evaluated for commercial aviation. There is a need to provide GA pilots with traffic information, cost-effectively, at the nation's 5,134 public use airports. In this proposal we present a low-cost solution that can provide the vast majority of GA users with the ability to identify and locate other traffic in the terminal area. Depending on whether the aircraft is equipped with a moving map display or only a VHF radio, the service will either show the location of proximate transponder equipped aircraft on the map display or will provide aural alerting only. This proposal combines Rannoch's pioneering work in aircraft tracking technology with Potomac Airfield's pioneering work with VHF pilot alerting to provide a complete solution with two levels of service.",

Working with Eagle-Picher Technologies, RBC succeeded in its Phase I program in solving the two major causes of early failure in silver/zinc batteries, by incorporating innovative electrode and separator components. Capacity fade on cycling was appreciably reduced translating to higher average working energy density and specific energy. Polyolefin based microporous separators were stable in KOH electrolyte giving wet-life superior to a cellophane containing laminate. Cells could be assembled in the charged state, not requiring a formation step, which is an advantage in terms of mission preparation. The proposed Phase II program will build upon the successful results of the Phase I demonstration to complete development to the point where RBC would design, assemble and deliver to NASA a higher performance silver/zinc battery for a specific NASA application. In Phase II RBC will work with Eagle-Picher Technologies and Advanced Membrane Systems, Inc. in order to complete optimization of separator and electrolyte for maximum service life.

Materials currently in use by DOD are effective barriers to chemical and biological weapons but they are not permeable to water vapor andproduce dangerous heat stress.

Perhaps the most reliable long-life cooling systems finding applications in space are passive; namely, heat pipes. Unfortunately, the balance between capillary pressure and viscous resistance limits the performance of these devices. Overall fluxes of 100W/cm^2 may be achievable with such systems, but local fluxes will never exceed pool boiling critical heat flux values that peak at approximately 100W/cm^2, but are normally much less. The novel thermal cycle proposed here circumvents this limitation. The cycle is passive yet generates pressure gradients substantially larger (up to 100-fold) than capillary systems. Such pressure differentials may be exploited to achieve very high forced-convection phase-change cooling rates (i.e. flow boiling/spray cooling) in coupled evaporators by direct contact with MCMs, or by more traditional flow-through designs. Heat fluxes obtained in this manner exceed those of capillary systems and are O(500W/cm^2). In Phase I we will demonstrate the high heat flux capability of the cycle exceeding 100W/cm^2 from simulated 2-D surfaces or 3-D MCM stacks.

The goal is to reduce the cost from the current $10,000 per pound of payload to $100 per pound.

In the third stage of a RBCC launch, an air breathing vehicle will travel at speeds from Mach 5 to Mach 10 prior to exiting the atmosphere. Under these conditions, the vehicle requires cooling in excess of that available through sensible heating of the fuel. Although this heating can be supplied by endothermic cracking of the fuel prior to combustion, the temperatures required to achieve necessary rates are very high. High temperatures reduce the allowable stress in the heat exchanger, increasing its weight and reducing its efficiency. In this Phase I SBIR, TDA Research, Inc.

        "abstract": "65141        In the production of chlorinated hydrocarbons and titanium dioxide pigments, elemental chlorine (Cl2) is used as a reactant and hydrochloric acid (HCl) is produced as an unavoidable byproduct. Stringent environmental regulations limit the shipment of hazardous wastes like HCl, and the disposal of HCl by neutralization is costly.  Although processes exist for converting waste HCl back to Cl2, they become too expensive when the concentration of the waste HCl is low.  This project will develop improvements to a new process that uses a regenerable sorbent to recover HCl from waste streams.  Previous work showed that the new process has the potential to reduce the cost of Cl2 to less than half of the cost of fresh chlorine.  In Phase I, improved sorbents were produced and tested under process conditions.  Multiple cycle tests showed that the improved sorbent has the potential to convert waste HCl to chlorine over a long lifetime at approximately half the cost of buying fresh chlorine.  In Phase II, sorbents will be made by techniques representative of commercial production, and then screened to identify the best composition.  Key design features will be evaluated.             Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  HCl waste streams (from vinyl chlorine monomer, other chlorinated organics, and titanium dioxide manufacturing) could be reclaimed to produce approximately 850,000 tons of Cl2 per year.  The new conversion process should consume only 13% of the electrical energy required for electrolytic production of fresh chlorine (an 87% reduction) and also reduce fuel/steam consumption by 65%.",

        "abstract": "65654      In hydroformylation, an alkene reacts with synthesis gas to form an aldehyde (current worldwide production of aldehydes exceeds 7 million tons/year).  Homogeneous rhodium catalysts are used in the production of lower aldehydes because they are the most active and selective catalysts for this reaction.  Distillation is used to separate the catalyst from the lower aldehydes.  However, for the higher aldehydes, their higher boiling points make distillation impossible; therefore, the rhodium catalysts cannot be separated and inefficient cobalt catalysts must be used.  To eliminate the need to separate the rhodium catalyst by distallation, this project will develop solvent mixtures to separate the rhodium catalysts from the aldehyde product.  The thermomorphic solution will allow for easy catalyst recycle, resulting in dramatic energy and cost reductions for higher aldehyde production.  In Phase I, the thermomorphic solvent mixtures were tested, resulting in high selectivity and low catalyst losses.  An economic analysis, comparing the new rhodium-based process to the current cobalt-based system showed more than 30% saving in feedstock and energy costs.  Phase II will optimize conditions for the thermomorphic catalyst system, and a continuous bench scale reactor will be designed, built, and tested for long-term performance.                  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Biphasic hydroformylation of higher olefins with redox-switchable surfactants would lead to an environmentally clean and much less costly replacement of the current cobalt catalyst system.",

Consequently, systems that have been designed for low Earth orbit may not be suitable for a mission to Mars. One example of this is the system to recycle waste water. A system that utilizes vacuum distillation and catalytic oxidation (VPCAR) is being developed for Mars missions. A key step in the VPCAR process is the gas phase oxidation of ammonia to nitrogen and water without forming NOX. In Phase I TDA Research Inc. developed catalysts for this reaction. Our approach to the problem was centered on the development of a bifunctional catalyst, which could separate adsorbed oxygen and nitrogen atoms, thereby reducing NOX formation. In Phase I we identified a catalyst formulation, which converted 100% of the ammonia feed at temperatures where very low concentrations of NOX were produced. In Phase II, we will refine the catalyst composition, test both ammonia and hydrocarbon oxidation reactions in a pilot scale reactor, and then, in work carried out at Hamilton Sundstrand, we will test the reactor on a full-scale unit.",

TDA proposes to address this problem by using welding equipment to join C/SiC and SiC/SiC composites. In Phase I, we demonstrated the ability to join these composites by producing a reaction-bonded silicon carbide in joints with commercial Gas Transferred Arc Welders at rates of 5 seconds/inch with strengths greater than the parts to be joined. In Phase II, we will optimize this welding/brazing process to produce prototypes including a 10 inch x 10 inch C/SiC joined composite.

However, they could generate very high weight penalties when the number and duration of missions (and/or emergencies) are high (as in lunar or Martian explorations). TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes a light-weight emergency unit using a novel regenerable sorbent. In the unit, the sorbent releases oxygen while removing CO2 and H2O. The unit also rejects the heat of absorption to space and maintains the desired degree of cooling. Following the EVA, the sorbent is thermally regenerated with oxygen. A simple oven is the only regeneration equipment required, greatly reducing the weight of the regeneration equipment. In addition, the same unit can also be used for O2 supply and CO2/H2O removal in normal EVAs (i.e., non-emergency cases). The innovation addresses the needs for future long-term microgravity and planetary exploration requirements. Decreased weight reduces the launch costs, easy maintenance increases crew time available for research activities, and an efficient design reduces the logistic train support for replaceable units and spares. In Phase I, TDA will measure the oxygen storage capacity and CO2/H2O loading of the sorbent under simulated PLSS conditions, and carry out 20 full cycles. We will then design the components of the emergency unit and the regeneration system. We will estimate the weight and power requirements.",

Thespecific types of vehicles addressed were Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) that require Over the Horizon (OTH) communication technology to support Flight Safety.Out of 60 potential technology candidates that included both terrestrial and space-based solutions and a subsequent examination of a small subset of selected candidate technologies, IRIDIUM was the recommended choice for the RAFT System.This project's objectives are:1.  Confirm that IRIDIUM will satisfy RAFT requirements by performing risk reduction activities.  Performance to be verified include data throughput, data quality, and latency.2.  Select an optimum RAFT interface technique for accessing service networks.  Multiple techniques exist for accessing the IRIDIUM network, and these alternate techniques will be evaluated, with an emphasis on latency.  These techniques include a\"seamless\" interface via use of the ARINC AviNet/GlobalLink networks.3.  Verify the feasibility of the RAFT approach and architecture by performing an end-to-end demonstration using a UAV, or other available test vehicle.",

        "abstract": "The goal is to develop an automated and rapid system for human testing using dimorphic Alu repeats as genetic markers. Dimorphic Alu repeats are novel bi-allelic genetic markers that are identical by descent and stable. During the Phase I, we have demonstrated that the Alu markers can be caused for human identification. We have demonstrated that the Alu markers can be multiplexed and detected by hybridization based micro array assay. In Phase II, we will identify fifty Alu markers useful for identity testing. The PCR multiplex reactions will be optimized, so that the fifty markers can be amplified in three multiplex reactions. A micro-array format will be developed for genotyping. An integrated automated platform will be evolved for performing the complete testing. The end product will be an \"ALUtyping\" system that will be commercialized in partnership with a major cooperation. The commercial product will comprise of oligonucleotide micro-arrays, reagent kits for multiplexed PCR amplifications, hybridization buffers and consumables, and software for automated genotyping and data analysis. The major applications of this genotyping system will be in the fields of paternity, others areas of human identity and human evolution studies. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Current techniques used in the DNA identity testing business rely upon methods such as RFLP, which is laborious and time consuming or multiplex STR analysis this requires expensive kits and instrumentation. The dimorphic Alu markers coupled with a multi-plexed genotype analysis on a DNA array will provide a rapid, sensitive and highly cost- effective methodological alternative for DNA identity testing for the numerous private testing laboratories and low enforcement agencies.",

        "abstract": "Accurate analysis of electromagnetic anechoic chambers is a challenging problem.  The geometry is complicated and includes multiple antenna radiators, systems under test (SUT), supporting structures, and absorber.  Furthermore the frequency range isextensive, traversing a broad range from 50 MHz to 18 GHz.  For the large chamber (264 x 250 x 70 feet) of the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF) this means the chamber size in wavelengths varies over a very large range over which different calculationmethods must be applied for good accuracy.  Our approach is that for the lower range of frequencies the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method will be used to analyze the entire anechoic chamber. At the higher frequencies shooting ray methods can beused.   Both methods will be integrated under a single graphical user interface which will allow user control of the excitation antennas, system under test geometry, and calculation parameters.  The graphical user interface will also provide display offields over a variety of surfaces inside the chamber and straightforward comparison with measured fields for validation.  The ability to assess the effects of absorber reflection on the illumination of the system under test will be an important capabilityof the proposed software tool.",

The significance is that this algorithm separates the geometric entities from the optimization process allowing an independent linkage with many CAD packages and at much lower cost. All objectives have been met for the Phase I project. A computer software package, termed SAMdesign, now has the capability to solve the three-dimensional Euler equations, solve the adjoint of the Euler equations, and change the vehicle shape subject to constraints. All of these solutions are performed on unstructured tetrahedral meshes using a Finite Element based numerical algorithm. Four test cases have been successfully computed including a generic aerospace vehicle. Phase II will include multi-disciplinary effects, coupled physics for aerodynamics / propulsion / structures, fast finite element meshing methods, and will develop the software into a production package. Extensive verification and validation will be done on NASA configurations. The product will be documented, delivered and installed at NASA with a user-training course given. This will provide NASA with a powerful software tool to perform very efficient and rapid design assessment of evolving next generation space vehicles.",

The micro-machined energy-massspectrograph (M2-EMS) is envisioned as a micro-miniaturized replacement for conventional particle energy and mass detection systems employed as space environment sensors. The M2-EMS would employ parallel electric and magnetic fields to separate particlesby their energy:charge and mass:charge ratios. The spectrograph apertures would be micro-machined from Si wafers by anisotropic etching. Charged particle optic electrodes would be grown on the surface by thick photoresist lithographic electroformingtechniques. By using electroless deposition of Ni (a ferromagnet) into thick resist molds, magnetic field provided by external NdFeB permanent magnets can be channeled to provide high field regions for mass separation. By applying opposite potentialpolarities to the straight-wall Ni features, a region of high electric field can be produced to simultaneously separate particles by energy. Detection of spatially separated ions could be achieved by existing multichannel area detectors. Using multipleapertures with varying magnetic and electric separation fields atop the same multichannel detector, parallel detection of different energy and mass ranges can be achieved.",

It deals with a situation that has been intractable for ANVC  - the cancellation of transientdisturbances in modally rich and highly resonant structures and acoustical spaces. CSEA solves this problem by in effect modifying the structural transfer function so that small changes in structural stress or geometry that occur naturally do not cause thelarge changes in magnitude and phase of the transfer function to affect the estimation of the disturbing force that is necessary for feed-back ANVC. The proposal describes how we propose to continue the development of this procedure and how we will preparefor commercialization beyond Phase II. That development is carried out by a combination of experimental studies of a truss structure similar to that of a space telescope excited by various positioning and connect/disconnect devices in the system. The finalstep in the Phase II effort is the preliminary design of an embedded processor system that will serve as a prototype for the CSEA-ANVC product.",

In 1999, the pharmaceutical industry and NIH spent more than $23 billion on clinical trials. Developments in clinical trial design theory, and in optimization algorithms have opened possibilities for more cost- effective designs that can be executed for lower total cost, over shorter periods of time and / or requiring fewer patients. The proposed System for Cost Effective Trials (SCET) will be a software package to guide the trial designer through comparisons of the power, sample size requirements, and cost of alternate trial designs. These methods are under-used throughout medical research, but are particularly applicable to trials with relatively short treatment regimens and rapid ascertainment of endpoints, such as many cancer treatment trials. The aims of SCET Phase II are to build the system, validate it in compliance with FDA regulations for software validation, perform Beta testing at a range of target client organizations, and use the Beta test findings to produce a marketable release. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The potential market for this software system includes virtually every pharmaceutical company in the world (multiple licenses to each), every biotech company involved in clinical trials, every contract research organization involved in the design or conduct of clinical trials, coordinating centers of NIH-sponsored multi-center clinical trials, individual university-based investigators who conduct clinical trials, individual biostatistical consultants who design clinical trials, and agricultural businesses and researchers that conduct animal research.",

The perceptual situation of an astronaut exposed to unusual gravitational-inertial forces has been compared to that found in experiments involving perceptual rearrangement, such as optically induced displacement, curvature, tilt, or right-left reversal. In both instances, the observer is confronted with a variety of inter- and intra-sensory conflicts that initially disrupt perception and behavior and may cause nausea. However, people are able to adapt to these imposed conflicts, as manifested in a reduction or elimination of the initial disruptive responses. Overcoming motion sickness and regaining normal perception may involve many of the same processes as adaptation to perceptual rearrangement in general. Our Phase I research demonstrated that adaptation training is beneficial as it reduces dizziness and motion sickness symptoms experienced in both VR and OKN environments. In Phase II research, we propose to run studies to test further the effects of adaptation training on sickness by inducing motion sickness in a VR device with an added ?reafference? component.

        "abstract": "Ambient particulate matter (PM) mass exposure is determined by collecting the PM on a sample filter over a period of 24 hours. Because the composition of ambient PM is constantly changing, the PM mass measured using the reference method may not be representative of the PM levels in the atmosphere, primarily due to the loss of collected semi-volatile material that is present in the atmosphere during the collection period. In addition, by obtaining a single value over a 24-hour period, the method may not properly recognize the true exposure risks that occur during short term spikes in the ambient PM levels. Rupprecht & Patashnick Co., Inc. (R&P) proposes to resolve these issues through the use of an innovative advance to their popular TEOM\u00c2\u00bf Ambient Particulate Monitor. The TEOM\u00c2\u00bf mass monitor is a filter-based, inertial micro-balance that provides direct mass measurements of the collected material in near real time. The innovation, the Differential TEOM\u00c2\u00bf System, is a self-referencing system that utilizes an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) to periodically remove the ambient PM from the sample stream to allow the system to measure sampling artifacts caused by the presence of semi-volatile compounds such as ammonium nitrate or semi-volatile organics. The Phase I research project compared the results obtained using the initial prototype Differential TEOM\u00c2\u00bf monitor operating at ambient temperature with results from an early test Differential TEOM\u00c2\u00bf monitor operating at a fixed control temperature and with reference method results, with all samples collected at R&P's facilities in Albany, NY.

DeSAT will be developed as a design decision support system providing the capability to (1) analyze the situation awareness requirements associated with operational requirements (which could include ground based or flight based crew members), (2) compare situation awareness information requirements to system design features to identify potential situation awareness problems and deficiencies early in the design process, and (3) evaluate the degree to which design concepts support SA via the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT). DeSAT will be developed for analysis of SA for both individual crew stations and for distributed teams operating across flight and time.

        "abstract": "Current methods of separation of starch and protein that have been successful in producing corn and other types of starches do not work well with rice. Rice granules are very small (usually about 3 to 6 microns in size) and are difficult to separate from rice protein, which are of similar size. Yields of starch are low, recovery of quality protein is rarely achievable, and so the resulting rice starch is too expensive to compete in the market. The unique small size of rice creates market opportunities for rice starch if cost could be reduced. We hope to commercialize a physical process to separate rice starch from rice protein. We hope to improve the yields of starch, produce a high quality rice protein that can be sold into the human market, and reduce costs of wastewater treatment. If successful, our process would use clean untreated water. The starch and protein produced from such a process would be \"all natural\" and potentially more valuable to the market than chemically treated starches. We will continue to work with and develop a concept that was initially developed by the USDA research lab in New Orleans through a CRADA with Sage V Foods, and then further developed in a phase 1 SBIR Grant. Under certain conditions a microfluidizer machine has been shown to physically separate starch and protein by causing the particles to collide against each other while in a liquid slurry at very high pressures. The overall objective is to develop a method of rice starch extraction that will make the manufacture and marketing of rice starch an economic success by increasing the yields of pure starch extracted from rice to over 70% (preferably over 75%) and to produce and recover a marketable protein that has not been treated with chemicals. The target yield for protein is greater than 6% at 80% purity. The specific objectives of the project will be: 1. Test various chamber and pressure conditions in the \"microfluidizer\" to determine the best shear conditions for protein that produces a functionality that facilitates separation of starch and protein. 2. Test two different types of nozzle disc centrifuges (Westfalia separator and Alpha Laval) in combination with additional centrifugation and/or hydrocyclones and various processing techniques to obtain starch purity of 99.5%, while at the same time achieving protein purity of over 80%. Also test a basket centrifuge and peeler centrifuge for the same purpose. 3. Utilizing centrifuges and hydrocyclones, develop an economical method to recover rice protein from the wash water and then dry the protein. Achieve yields of greater than 6% at 80 percent purity. 4. Test spray drying and basket centrifuge/oven drying to develop an economical method to dry rice starch, while producing a product of less than 10 micros size and without developing rancidity.",

We have\nbeen developing a self-contained system, the Children?s Attention and\nPerformance Evaluation System (CAPESYS) to address this need. Our prior\nresearch suggests that sensitive and specific indices of sustained attention\nand working memory, functions disrupted in ADHD, can be derived from\nmultivariate combinations of EEG and behavioral performance measures. During\nPhase I, analysis of data from children with ADHD being treated with stimulant\nmedication suggested that our approach could efficiently identify those who\nresponded positively to such treatment. Progress was also made in identifying\naspects of EEG signal processing algorithms requiring adaptation for use with\nchildren?s data, and on the ongoing design and implementation of an automated\nclinical testing system that will provide the infrastructure for the CAPESYS.\nIn Phase II we propose to extend and further validate our procedures, implement\na prototype system and evaluate it in collaborative studies with ADHD\nspecialists.\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:\nADHD is a common childhood neurological disorder. It is frequently treated pharmacologically with stimulants, yet there is no neurological instrument for measuring treatment-related improvements in child's attention functions. The proposed device would provide a critical technology for evaluation of neurophysiological and behavioral aspects of sustained focused attention. It would facilitate research and permit more effective and economical management of individual patients.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many medical treatments produce subtle changes in working and intermediate term memory and executive functioning in the elderly.  Some medical treatments may have negative cognitive side effects, whereas other treatments improve cognitive function.  Prior work demonstrates that combinations of EEG, event related potential and cognitive task performance data are sensitive and specific indicators of level of alertness and ability to sustain attention and hold information in working and intermediate term memory.  We propose to develop a specialized automated device utilizing multivariate combinations of these measures to detect treatment related changes in neurocognitive function in the elderly.  In Phase I feasibility was evaluated by analyzing task performance and EEG data from elderly subjects after they ingested a common OTC drug, the antihistamine diphenhydramine.  We computed multivariate indices from these data, and determined that they could discriminate post-drug conditions from placebo.  Additionally, we identified improvements required for use of our automated task presentation and signal processing algorithms with elderly subjects, and designed modifications to a system for administering, analyzing and tracking tests and results.  In Phase II, the system will be fully implemented and independently tested in collaboration with scientists and clinicians at four university medical centers.  \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The proposed system will enable researchers to better evaluate how medical treatments affect neurocognitive function in the elderly.  The market for such a device is sufficient to sustain the product.  The system may also prove clinically useful as a means for titrating drug dosages and for tracking neurocognitive changes in the treatment of individual patients.  Thus, a second-generation device may serve as a more general clinical tool for monitoring changes in cognitive status in the elderly.

        "abstract": "The existing plasma codes are ill suited for modeling of mixed resolution problems, such as the plasma sail, where the system under study comprises subsystems with diverse modeling paradigms (e.g., fluid, kinetic) at differing levels of temporal and spatial resolution. Such complex systems are not unique to propulsion studies, but are commonly encountered in wide variety of fields. In Phase I, we were able to develop and successfully test the core technology for multi-resolution modeling within two distinct computational paradigms. By introducing a temporal mesh, we successfully overcame a major obstacle in the use of time-stepped simulations for multi-resolution problems. However, even more significant is our finding that discrete event simulation methodology works quite well for many-body systems such as plasmas with several orders of magnitude performance advantage over equivalent time-stepped simulations. The importance of this result cannot be overstated as it will have immediate repercussions in all fields where time-stepped modeling are currently used. Using these early versions of our code, we were able to address a number of outstanding issues in regards to the feasibility of plasma sails. Our objectives for Phase II are (i) to fully develop the codes, (ii) address the issues regarding the feasibility of plasma sails such as expansion of the magnetic bubble by the plasma source and the resulting drop-off of the magnetic field strength with radial distance, and (iii) prepare plans for marketing our technology in Phase III.",

The key component of this lidar is a compact all-solid-state laser developed by us, which is rapidly tunable in the mid-IR (2.7-4\u00c2\u00bfm). Phase I simulations have shown that 150ppb range resolved and 30ppb path integrated (for1.5km) measurements of benzene are obtained for a few seconds of averaging with a lidar equipped with a 8\"diameter telescope,  100Hz, 1mJ/pulse laser tunable in 3-4\u00c2\u00bfm region. Atmospheric lidar absorption measurements of methane were also performed in PhaseI with a tunable mid-IR DIAL system and showed good agreement with directly measured methane concentrations. A prototype mid-IR chemical DIAL will be built in Phase II and tested using non-toxic simulants. As option tasks the self-powered lidar system willbe made robust for field operation by using a modular transmitter/receiver unit that is fiber coupled to laser/power supply unit.

This UAV based lidar provides a powerful low cost capability for measurement of ozone distributions in the lower stratosphere and troposphere with good spatial resolution over large regions. The UAV places severe constraints on the size, weight, power and operational environment for the laser. A compact Ce:LiCAF laser pumped by a diode-pumped Nd:YAG frequency quadrupled laser, to provide 1mJ energy at 1kHz, tunable over 290-315nm will be built to satisfy these requirements. Ozone measurements from 20km altitude with good horizontal resolution (5km) and accuracy (5-10%) will be obtained using this laser. The laser will be packaged into a replaceable modular transmitter which allows for easy reconfiguration of the UAV for other measurements. This transmitter, together with the water vapor DIAL transmitter recently fabricated by us, will constitute the core of a versatile NASA remote sensing facility. In Phase I we will carry out the wavelength tuning and operational characterization of a bread-board tunable Ce:LiCAF laser, and also design an optimized transmitter.

        "abstract": "The main purpose of this proposal is to develop a novel interface for on- line coupling of liquid separation techniques to a mass spectrometer (MS) using an atmospheric pressure (AP) infrared (IR) matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) method. In contrast to conventional MALDI where ions are formed inside a vacuum system. In AP MALDI they are produced at normal atmospheric pressure. AP MALDI was first demonstrated and later commercialized using an ultraviolet (UV) laser. It showed sensitivity comparable to that of conventional MALDI, a large tolerance to the laser energy, and minimal fragmentation of analyte ions. AP MALDI interfaced with an ion trap mas spectrometer brings unique capability off tandem MS (or MS/MS) to MALDI analysis. Since AP UV-MALDI uses mostly solid organic matrices it like conventional UV- MALDI usually allows off-line analysis only. The use of an IR laser will allow one to use significantly larger number of matrices for MS analysis including liquid ones. Given excellent absorption or organic compounds in the IR spectral range the AP IR-MALDI makes possible direct coupling of liquid separation techniques =to MS, thus, the perspective of having both MALDI and electrospray ion sources for liquid analysis on the same mass analyzer becomes very feasible. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Atmospheric Pressure IR-MALDI for interfacing mass spectrometers to liquid separation techniques as well as for off-line analysis. This method has many biological and biomedical applications in research labs, hospitals, industry, and defense where analysis of proteins, peptides, DNA & RNA is utilized. Commercialization of the method by SESI is straightforward.",

Proposed is a simple instrument using multiple hot wire elements to measure cloud droplet size (median volume diameter) and liquid water content.The unit utilizes three hot wire sensor elements each of a different geometry, all exposed to the same airflow. By virtue of their different sizes/shapes, the elements have different measurment efficiencies with respect to droplet diameter.Liquid water content is determined by the total amount of water measured by all three elements. Droplet median volume diameter is determined by the response differences between the three elements. The range of droplet measurement includes super large droplets SLD).The proposed instrument has no moving parts, no optics and emits no electromagnetic radiation. It is a first principles device capable of complete calibration. Its response time is under one second.Total frontal area of the instrument is less than four square inches. Less than 500 watts of power are required for operation in continuous icing conditions.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a passive, nonintrusive species-specific velocimeter (SSV) that simultaneously measures spatially resolved velocities of multiple species in a flame, sorting the information by species and spatial scale size. The SSV will be geared to spatially resolve the mixing and chemical dynamics occurring within flames, and to track these effects in real time. No instruments are available that can make such measurements passively and non-invasively in a com-pact geometry. The SSV will play a critical role in a novel deposition process, combustion chemical vapor deposition (CCVD). CCVD is a continuous open-air deposition process that is targeting a wide spectrum of thin-film-coating markets, including electronics, glass, anti-corrosives, superconductors, catalytics, polymers, and nanopowders. Phase 1 demonstrated feasibility by measuring spatially resolved, species-specific CCVD flame velocities on different spatial scales. Phase 2 will be a proof-of-principal program to (1) construct an engineering prototype, (2) demonstrate the correlation between SSV data and bottom-line CCVD film properties, and (3) design an SSV-based CCVD controller that can be fabricated economically and commercialized in a privately funded This technology will facilitate smart deposition that streamlines the reliability of CCVD. Incorporated into a CCVD system, the SSV will become the central element of a feedback control module that maintains the consistency of the flame and maximizes deposition efficiency. The commercial market for this technology generates about $50 million annually. This project addresses the interest in advanced control techniques for manufacturing. It supports the development of improved and more reliable coatings that will enhance technology and lower the cost of many common products, e.g. electronic memory devices in computers, appliances, and automobiles.",

The significant challenges arise from the present approach of dissociating I2 by the use of a substantial fraction ofgenerated O2(a1D). The successful Phase I showed that RF plasma discharges rapidly dissociated an Iodine bearing com-pound, CH3I, thus providing a new source of iodine atoms for COILs. The plasma production of iodine atoms potentially frees up allmetastable excitation energy stored in the O2(a1D) population to exclusively pump the lasing cycle, increasing O2(a1D) utilization and laser system chemical efficiency by ~15%. The result is potentially increased laser power, reduced system weight and atechnology with the promise of high repetition rate (~5 to 25 kHz) pulsed COILs for target illumination and other COIL applications.  On Phase II, SARA will optimize the RF transmission line, special trace gases additives and other plasma characteristics(applied to supersonic flow chemical laser systems) to increase the RF plasma dissociation efficiency.

Diode-pumped solid-state lasers are the primary candidates for this application. Operation in the ultraviolet is typically achieved through two or three frequency conversion steps using nonlinear optical materials. This reduces the efficiency of the laser systems placing very stringent demands on the laser design and the gain media.

Its verification is currently a time consuming and costly enterprise based on extensive simulation and experimentation.  Formal verification requires no simulation or experimentation.  Automated model extractor diminishes theneed for FCS software developer to be conversant with formal methods.  These features of the project will reduce verification costs significantly.  As properties of realistic FCS software are intractable, we introduce concepts such as ProbablyApproximately Correct (PAC) verifier, and computational tools for solving problems approximately.

The method and prototype product developed as part of this Phase I proposal can replace louvers and provide improved performance with significantly reduced complexity and weight.The approach, which only works in a space environment and with a cold background, is based on the fact that the radiation from a high emissivity samples will be maximum when that surface is in intimate (good thermal) contact with a higher temperature surface, and is near or at that temperature. Alternately, when this thermal contact is missing, the radiation to a cold environment will lower its temperature and the radiation from this cover (which can be viewed as the total system emissivity) system will approach that of the lower emissivity, high temperature surface. Calculations indicate that an effective emissivity change from .05 to 1 can be obtained when an electrostatic attraction is used to insure this intimate contact. Preliminary results of this system, using a thermal imager, indicate that the basic concept is viable, with measured changes in the apparent emissivity, from .38 to .95.

Recognizing this threat, public health agencies throughout the world have emphasized the importance of expeditious detection of drug resistance and the implementation of appropriate therapy. \n\nConventional laboratory methods used to confirm the diagnosis of TB by isolating M. tuberculosis and performing antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) can take weeks due to the growth rate of mycobacteria. Using the latest detection methods, which are routinely available in developed countries, can provide culture results in as few as 4-7 days with subsequent antibiotic susceptibility profiles in another 4-5 days in some cases. These sophisticated tests are very expensive and must be performed by trained technologists; this makes them technically and financially infeasible for use in developing countries where MDR-TB is the greatest threat. \n\nDr. Bill Jacobs addressed the need for a new diagnostic by modifying a mycobacteriophage (a virus that infects mycobacteria) to incorporate the firefly luciferase gene (FFlux); mycobacteria infected with phage produce light upon addition of the substrate luciferin. The light can be detected and quantitated by using a device called the Bronx Box; a camera connected to a computer. The test is performed in less than forty hours in a six-welled chamber/manifold which contains antibiotics. The Bronx Box device and accompanying test manifold will provide an easy-to-use, inexpensive, clinical diagnostic test with a faster turnaround time than current methods. \n\nThe long-term goal of this proposal is to continue the commercial development of the Bronx Box and make this test available in clinics throughout the world.",

        "abstract": "The DegP (HtrA) protease is essential for virulence in several Gram-negative pathogens: S. typhimurium, B. melitensis, Y. enterocolitica and P. aeruginosa. The phenotype of a degP knockout in Escherichia coli, temperature and oxidative sensitivity, suggests a role in virulence. The DegP protease is a multifunctional protein essential for the removal of misfolded and aggregated proteins in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria. We have identified the major pilin subunit of the Pap pilus, PapA, as a native DegP substrate and demonstrate vigorous proteolysis of this substrate in vitro. The DegP cleavage site in PapA was mapped and an in vitro cleavage assay suitable for HTS was developed. Hits that arise from the HTS will be passed through a series of secondary screening assays and in vivo models to identify bioavailable inhibitors of DegP that display good selectivity. We recently identified DegP homologues in S. pyogenes and S. aureus and demonstrated that a degP knockout in S. pyogenes has reduced virulence. We propose to validate S. aureus DegP as a virulence factor and develop this target for screening. There is ample precedent for the efficacy of protease inhibitors as therapeutic agents. Moreover, nonessential virulence targets may be less prone to resistance development.",

The wide FOV, high resolution, and compact size are achieved by overlapping fields-of-view onto a single high-resolution detector using holographic technology. Overlapping the fields of small angular sectors in the field of view of a fine sensor permits sharing a single high-resolution focal plane array of a moderate size among sectors. For a given array size it allows to spread the signal in the elevation direction over N times the number of pixels that a sensor with a single sector and the same system field of view would have used. thus creating a system that overcomes the inherent problems of wide field of view systems, namely, low resolution.",

We found a superior method of selecting parameters for times when we are limited in the amount of informationthat can be sent to a central processing location.  We developed a software simulation program to be used for quantitative assessment in typical scenarios.  The method was also shown to be capable of improved location accuracy in the presence of multipathdispersion on each receive path by utilizing the synchronized diversity effect of multiple sensors.  The method can be implemented with small portable location sensors with distributed control.Based on the method validated in Phase I, a complete fieldable prototype system is proposed.  The system uses an ad hoc wireless network for inter-sensor communications and the design is compatible with a transition to a JTRS-type radio. The location ofemitters can be calculated by the user requesting the location and can be distributed for digital map display over the network.

It has been demonstrated that this new techniques can be bonded for improved activation of the surfaces of silicon wafers. The innovation also serves to suppress layer transfer faults. The improvement in yield and the reduction in cost in the SOI production process have also been achieved. The process is expected to scale down to the formation of SOI surface films of thickness well below 0.1 micron. During Phase I, an RF plasma treatment was developed which optimizes the amount of adsorbed activating species on surfaces resulting in an improved layer transfer yield over previous wet chemical activation techniques. The process optimization was based on molecular dynamics simulation of the sub-monolayer hydroxylized surface. In Phase II the simulation-based process design continues with experimental characterization of the resulting probability of the layer transfer faults. The Phase II work plan includes more detailed process design and optimization leading to a characterization of best effort SOI wafers by the venture partners.\nThe impact of the proposed commercialization activity on the existing $10B worldwide silicon starting-wafer industry is potentially huge. The increasing usage of SOI by the leading semiconductor manufacturers is optimistically projected to grow from 1% to 10% of the worldwide silicon market. If successful, a ramp up to commercialization SOI pilot production will begin immediately upon the completion of this Phase II contract",

Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) in sports is a significant public health concern.  The biomechanics of head impacts that result in a concussion or other MTBI are not well understood but are widely believed to correlate with head accelerations.  The lack of a system that allows researchers to measure head acceleration during actual play in a large number of individuals is a major obstacle in furthering our understanding of the mechanism of MTBI and its prevention.  A novel algorithm for calculating linear and rotational acceleration of the head was developed and will be incorporated in a miniature accelerometer-based telemetry data acquisition system.  Clinical trials will be performed at two major colleges over the course of a season in men's football and men's and women's hockey.  The trial will be performed in conjunction with ongoing head injury studies that include neuropsychological testing of athletes, and neuropsychological test scores will be analyzed.  The long-term goal of the project is to develop a cost-effective commercially available system for measuring head acceleration for widespread use in sports.",

However, the complex process of problem setup, job management, and post-processing of results requires the use of a variety of disjoint, difficult-to-use tools that severely limit the utility of Tau3P to the broader accelerator and microwave design communities.  This project will interface Tau3P to an existing analysis package, known as Analyst, that provides comprehensive support for finite-element numerical software, including embedded computer-aided design software, automated meshing, sophisticated visual and numerical post-processing, and optimization capabilities.  In Phase I, a prototype extension to Analyst was created that could write input files for Tau3P and translate output files into an Analyst project database.  The Analyst post-processor was configured to display mesh and field data generated by Tau3P.  A web-based client-server application was also created that could run Tau3P on a remote machine, with support for upload and download of solver-files, and return/display of solver console messages.  In Phase II, further enhancements will allow the model preparation process to be vastly simplified, and its integration into the Analyst system will be improved.

The\nobjective of this Phase II proposal is to synthesize and screen compounds with the most potent effects on SWS. The specific aims are: 1. To test about 50 GHB agonists, identified by binding assays to have affinity for the GHB receptor, for their ability to induce changes in locomotor activity and body temperature, and to later test about 10 of the lead compounds for their effects on EEG sleep-wake states. 2. To test important hypotheses concerning the mechanisms of\naction of GHB by examining the effects of various GABAergic or dopaminergic antagonists on GHB-induced alterations in behavioral or physiological state. 3. To determine the effect of chronic treatment with GHB on sleep, and to determine if withdrawal from chronic drug exposure leads to sleep disturbances.

Solidica, Inc. has patented an innovative ultrasonic approach for rapid prototyping of net shape metallic parts using a ribbon feedstock. By combining the use of ultrasonics for layer-by-layer material build up of metallic ribbons with a simple machining head Solidica achieves net shape fully dense metallic components in a fraction of the time and at a lower cost than traditional machining or casting. Extending this proprietary technology to use filament based feedstock rather than ribbon, will enable a complexity of geometry that is currently only achievable for fully dense metal components through investment casting. This innovation has enormous cost saving advantages for production of both complex metallic and bimetallic functional gradient test hardware. There is currently no technology that is readily capable of forming functionally gradient structures for complex geometric shapes.",

The end product will be a series of interactive, multi-media training modules that will effectively marry the best of traditional professional development methods with new and emerging information technologies.  \n\n In Phase I, we identified and divided into logical sequential modules, research-based knowledge of reading development and language structure as well as sound instructional practices; we identified the strongest technologies and media for delivering the literacy intervention content and methods; we synthesized the information to design LETRS and produced a prototype training module in phonemic awareness; lastly, we proved that teachers' learning of instructional methods for phonological awareness was as good with CD-based instruction as it was with in-person instruction, but that the best combination of experiences for teachers included CD-based instruction and a facilitator. \n\nIn Phase II, the LETRS design blueprint will be revised and refined reflective of the data gathered in Phase I. Using the development processes and software templates created in Phase I, seven of the learning modules for the LETRS course, to include the interactive, multimedia CD-ROMs, Internet communication technologies, facilitated sessions, and other training materials including study guides and case study materials, will be produced.

The REGAE method is based on the combination of imaging and electrophysiological (EEG or MEG) data, using advanced statistical analysis tools. Both spatial resolution and RO1 signal detectability are quantifiable within the REGAE framework, within which an estimator's sensitivity to modeling and measurement errors can be characterized. The overall aim of Phase II is to push forward with theoretical advancement, sensitivity studies, and real-world evaluations of REGAE in order to develop a commercially successful software component that integrates with existing EMSE Suite software. \n\nThe intended market areas for REGAE are: (i) basic research in human brain mapping and cognitive neuroscience, (ii) preclinical research in neuropsychiatry and neurology, and, most specifically, (iii) clinical application in presurgical evaluations for intractable epilepsy.",

Among functional imaging methods, only magneto- and electro-encephalography (MEG, EEG, or jointly M/EEG) can noninvasively resolve events with a millisecond time scale. The aim of this work is the development, validation, and commercialization of a detailed, realistic model of electrical current flow in the head, the currents originating from sources within the brain, and measured electrically and/or magnetically on or near the surface of the scalp. 3D finite element models of individual heads will be constructed with the aid of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The finite element method provides the needed flexibility for modeling an asymmetric, anisotropic, and inhomogeneous medium like the head. These subject-specific models may be used as the basis for high-resolution methods for estimating neural activity source location and time course. \n\nThe algorithms will be incorporated into prototype software, and the software validated with both simulated and experimental data. The software will comprise a realistic modeling module of our EMSE suite, our PC/Windows-based program suite for analysis and display. The algorithms and resulting software may be used to study both normal brain function, such as measurements in cognitive neuroscience which may be studied with evoked response/event related potentials or spontaneous EEG, and in diseases of the brain, such as the epilepsies, where precise spatial and temporal resolution may be of value for diagnosis and presurgical evaluation.",

HCN, a highly toxic gas generated by burning or smoldering plastics, can provide early warning of spacecraft fires. NASA has established a Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentration (SMAC) of 1 ppm for manned missions exceeding one week. Useful space-borne instruments must satisfy stringent requirements unique to manned missions in space: low power draw, low weight, fully automated operation, self-calibrating, self-checking, and long term, maintenance free operation. The sensors also require an exceptional combination of sensitivity and selectivity: a 1 ppm alarm point requires a detection sensitivity of 100 parts per billion, yet the system must be free of false alarms despite by large concentrations of other species. Southwest Sciences proposes the development of a sensor for hydrogen cyanide based on optical absorption spectroscopy using diode lasers. This approach will meet all of the requirements identified above for space-borne sensors. Two types of diode lasers could be used.

        "abstract": "The largest error source in validation of NASA's EOS satellite cloud products is the mismatch in sampling volumes between the remote sensors and the in situ cloud probes. The sampling error from the extrapolation of the in situ cloud probe measurement of a few cm3 to the remote sensing measurement of millions of m3 is very large because of the extreme variability of cloud density. The new in situ lidar built in Phase I and tested in cloud on a mountaintop measures the volumetric extinction coefficient in cloud volumes ranging from millions to billions of m3. The in situ lidar differs from a regular lidar in that inside an optically thick cloud the laser pulse is multiply scattered by cloud droplets and the signal measured by the detector is the number of photons returned as a function of time. The amplitude and shape of the returned pulse contain information about the cloud volumetric extinction coefficient at different spatial scales around the instrument and the distance to the cloud boundaries. Phase I proof-of-concept tests conducted in cloud on a mountaintop demonstrated that the time-varying signal measured by the in situ lidar fit exactly the shape of the signal predicted by a physical model. The volumetric extinction coefficients measured over a period of several hours by the in situ lidar agreed in magnitude with local measurements using a cloud droplet probe, although as expected, there was considerable variability in the measurements. In Phase II we will build an airborne in situ lidar and install it on a Learjet research aircraft. The in situ lidar will be compared with microphysical measurements of cloud properties and cloud boundaries collected by the Learjet in various types of clouds.",

To address this need, Spectral Sciences, Inc. proposes to develop a hyperspectral/multispectral scene simulator for the UV/visible through thermal infrared (TIR) (~0.4-13mm)regions that accurately treats atmospheric effects and incorporates realistic spectral and spatial variability (clutter) in the surface materials.  In Phase I we successfully demonstrated a novel method to building synthetic imagery with data-based spatialand spectral surface properties, and formulated an efficient Monte Carlo radiation transport method for high-fidelity image simulations covering the full wavelength range of interest.

Flow cytometers provide the underpinnings for diagnostics in many fields ? hematology, genetics screening, tissue engineering, drug screening, genomic and proteonomic research, cancer, AIDs, etc. The vast majority of the diagnostics tests using flow cytometry are not routinely available to the general public because of their cost and complexity. This technology takes the cost, skill, and complexity out of flow cytometry, and for the first time allows point-of-care testing. Underserved communities, rural locations, and third world countries could have direct access to many more diagnostic tests. Clinical and basic research will benefit from inexpensive and continuous access to a powerful analytical tool.

        "abstract": "Future NASA missions cover a diverse set of requirements from Earth Observing constellations Flying in Formation to Scientific Observations using multiple tethers. Each spacecraft will have unique design specifications on actuators, sensors, dynamics, control and flight software. Traditionally, these spacecraft simulations have been divided into files, modules or classes which are compiled and linked to form a monolithic simulation application. This static approach requires re-compilation or re-linking for each different spacecraft. Star Technologies along with our Team Member Microsoft Corporation proposes to develop a COM+, Component Object Model, spacecraft simulation architecture that will enable the User to build COM components that can be assembled into a spacecraft simulation without the need for re-compiling or re-linking. The advantages of using COM components result directly from their ability to dynamically plug-into and unplug-from a spacecraft simulation. The COM simulation architecture will provide for rapid assembly via COM components that represent the environment, sensors, actuators, dynamics, and control which may function as distributed processes across networks. And since COM is language independent, the COM+ architecture will enable re-use of previously developed FORTRAN and C programs or routines. The resulting COM+ simulation architecture will be demonstrated on a Tether and a Formation Flying configuration.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project will provide people diagnosed with cardiovascular disease with a package of two documentary-style videotapes, two booklets, and an interactive web module, that stresses the importance of self-management and to motivate them to do so. The Phase I results showed that people with CVD felt that these materials would be useful and would use the materials themselves. Equally significant were the results from the evaluation with health professionals, who were very enthusiastic about the materials and felt that the content was clear and accurate. As a result of Phase I research, one video/booklet set will target women and the other will target men. The videos will show the lives of people who are successfully self-managing their CVD and will target the viewer's expectancies of self-management and their self-efficacy of performing it. The booklet will outline self-management information and resources. The interactive web module, which will be licensed to existing web sites, fills a gap left by most web resources for people with CVD - management of stress and awareness of depression. It will allow the user to track these conditions that can have a profound effect on their CVD. It will also deliver information about latest CVD research specific to the needs and interests of the user, based on their profile, and allow the formation of an on-line community via bulletin boards and chats. \n\nIn Phase II, the videotapes, booklets, and web module will be produced from the final creative plans developed from Phase I research. The rough-cuts of the videos, rough drafts of the booklet, and beta version of the web module will be reviewed by our Board of Advisors. After feedback from the advisors is incorporated, the materials will be tested through a number of focus groups. After the final editing and identity production are complete, the materials will be tested using a quasi-experimental control group pretest/posttest design. In Phase III, we will approach service organizations and clinics to distribute the package. Using contacts established in Phase I, and other projects serving the needs of persons with CVD, we have working relationships with many organizations, health care facilities, and pharmaceutical companies who would join in this promotional distribution effort.",

        "abstract": "65549      Conventional duct systems in houses have serious deficiencies.  Usually, they are located in very hot or very cold attics with little insulation to protect them, and often they have excessive leaks and construction-caused defects.  These problems result in energy losses, widely fluctuating indoor comfort conditions, and the transport of air-borne contaminants from unconditioned to conditioned spaces.  This project will address these problems by developing a prefabricated whole-house array of thermoformed plastic ductwork for integration within roof trusses and under insulation layers.  Pre-fabricated plastic ductwork can be used in conventional attic configurations as well as basements and crawlspaces.   Phase I investigated the ductwork layout and materials, then designed, built, and tested a full-scale prototype thermoformed duct system.  It was demonstrated that large parts using thermoforming can be fabricated easily and duct air leakage can be virtually eliminated.  Phase II will develop modular ductwork and mold designs; customize the thermoforming technology; build whole-house duct systems; and install and test entire ductwork systems in the field.                Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The proposed innovation could revolutionize how home heating/cooling distribution systems are configured and installed, and could dramatically improve their performance and cost-effectiveness.

To support the future high power COIL programs, technology improvements must be realized to increase performance, efficiency, andchemical operating range, and thus more easily meet the overall system requirements, such as for the ABL EDM phase.  In particular the SOG performance with mixed base BHP must be augmented to allow operation through a wider molarity range and at higher BHPtemperature to reduce magazine size and weight.  Innovative methods for improving the COIL efficiency by increasing singlet oxygen output, reducing singlet oxygen losses, removing water vapor, reducing internal fluid losses and degradation, and reducingwater carryover from the SOG will further improve high power COIL performance.The proposed program will develop several innovative concepts and design an optimized SOG with a water vapor trap and other innovative features that will increase singlet oxygen and reduce water vapor at the laser cavity.  Using the SOG flow/chemistry codedeveloped by STI, the innovative configurations and cold trap fluids will be developed into a first generation design and test device.

Scintillation, the turbulence-induced fluctuation of image intensities, is widely regarded as a major problem for adaptive optics systems. The methods we propose herein providethe potential to mitigate significantly the effects of scintillation, thus enhancing adaptive optics performance. We also propose innovative control concepts for deformable mirror actuation. Collaborating with scientists and engineers at UCLA, MZA, andAFRL, we will use wave propagation simulations data and data collected in tests at Lincoln Laboratory's ACL facility to score the performance of these algorithms.

Committee-based methods arbitrate these multiple classification viewpoints.  Category models are constructed semi-automatically under user guidance to capturestereotypically co-occurring activities within broad categories of topics.  These models are used to generate predictions about the future content of news stories and assist in customizing the system to a particular task domain.  Scalability is ensuredthrough a combination of techniques, including temporal feature compression and granularity control.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION: (provided by the applicant) Scintillator-based CCD-based digital\nintraoral radiography systems are beginning to replace x-ray film and\nassociated processing equipment in dentists? offices. Foremost on the list of\nadvantages are large reductions in patient x-ray exposure, the ability to\nperform direct image manipulation, and remote information transmission.\nHowever, these systems suffer from a significant reduction in image due to the\nx-ray light converter that limits the clinician?s ability to diagnose such\ndiseases as periodontitis, caries, and certain oral tumors. This fact is\nseverely limiting acceptance of digital x-ray imaging in dental practices at\nthis time.\n\nThe Phase I program demonstrated the feasibility of a new concept of producing\nintraoral digital x-ray sensors. A variety of novel digital imaging arrays were\ndesigned, fabricated and tested which exhibited double the dose efficiency and\nmore than double the spatial resolution compared to standard digital x-ray\nintraoral systems. The results indicated that it will be possible to produce\nintraoral x-ray sensors with over 80 percent detective quantum efficiency for\n70 kVp x-rays, and limiting spatial resolution greater than 22 lp/mm.\n\nDuring the Phase II, we shall complete the development of the new intraoral\nimaging sensor based on a new direct x-ray imaging technology and use it with\nactual pre-clinical samples to quantitatively compare results to existing\nsystems. This work will involve CMOS sensor design and x-ray screen converter\nfabrication to produce the novel sensors required for intraoral imaging\nprocedures.\n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The market for digital intraoral imaging systems is estimated to be in excess of $10 billion worldwide. A low-cost, compact intraoral X-ray system with significantly higher image quality than current systems provide will find widespread acceptance in dental operatories.",

Currently, Nb3Sn is the only commercially available superconductor capable of operating at such high fields.  Powder-In-Tube (PIT) Nb3Sn conductor has shown attractive performance and good strain resistance.  However, cost is a major drawback, particularly powder costs.  This program seeks to reduce the cost of the PIT process.  This project will investigate alternative powder fabrication routes for NbSn2 powder for eventual application in PIT Nb3Sn conductor development.  These alternative processing routes have the promise of producing high quality powder in a single step and at greatly reduced cost.  In Phase I, alternative processing routes to produce NbSn2 powder were explored through changes in reaction heat treatment parameters and choice of raw material.  Samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy to determine degree of NbSn2 formation.  The indirect melt diffusion and chopped niobium wire processes were found to be practical, scaleable, and cost efficient processes by which to manufacture phase-pure NbSn2.  In Phase II, these processes will be scaled up to handle production size lots.  Ultimately PIT Nb3Sn conductor will be fabricated, and its superconducting properties will be tested and optimized.

The superconductors must also be cost effective so that the magnets, and hence the accelerators, will be economically viable.  This project will develop a process for improving the current carrying capacity of the superconducting filaments within the Nb3Sn superconducting material by introducing a strong oxide-former and oxygen to form sites that will pin the grain boundaries and hence the fluxoids.  The Nb filaments will be replaced by Nb1at.%Zr and the properties of this material, with and without additional oxygen, will be compared with each other and with the conventional          Nb-based material.  Phase I demonstrated that casting the alloy with a significant amount of oxygen led to a material that was difficult to fabricate.  Fabricability was improved when commercially available Nb1at.%Zr was used to remove most of the oxygen from the Zr containing alloy.  It was determined that the ideal stage for the introduction of oxygen is late in the process to maintain maximum fabricability.  Phase II will explore various methods of introducing oxygen to maintain maximum fabricability.  Oxygen will be introduced into the copper and then used to internally oxidize the Nb1at.%Zr before the Sn reacts to form Nb3Sn.  The properties of material containing commercial Nb1at.%Zr with various levels of oxygen will be compared with those of material made from pure Nb.

For the next Linear Collider (NLC), the polarized electron beam intensity must be at least 20 times greater than that produced by strained GaAs, used in the current generation of photocathodes.  Additionally, the degree of electron polarization needs to be increased beyond the 75% currently attainable, and intrinsic materials properties must be tailored to improving the surface charge limit. This project will develop a new generation of photocathodes capable of yielding intense, highly polarized electron beams for use in advanced electron colliders.  A strained-superlattice, formed from altering layers of GaAs and GaAsP approximately ten monolayers thick, will be utilized.  In Phase I, the development of a new superlattice structure using GaAs and GaAsP was begun.  Record breaking 86% polarization with 1% quantum efficiency was achieved and theoretical considerations indicated that >90% polarization should be achievable.    Phase II will further explore the superlattice parameter space, optimize the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth condition, and develop the superlattice characterization techniques to predict charge and polarization performance.

The recent development of high-density, rad-hard COTS FPGAs means that RC now has thepotential to be used in spaceborne applications.  SFC is currently developing an RC tool suite, called DERC (Development Environment for Reconfigurable Computing), which includes both hardware and software to support development of  RC applications.RIFTSS will extend the capabilities of the DERC tools to include extensive support for fault tolerance.  The DERC API and logic libraries will be extended to include fault tolerant functions, including configuration scrubbing, redundancy, voting, etc.  TheDERC Debug Tool will be modified to allow deliberate fault insertion into a design under test.  The RIFTSS tools will be tested by using them to implement a real-world, fault tolerant application.",

        "abstract": "In current Air Force operations, mission planning data is generated using a ground-based system, and is then hand carried to the aircraft shortly before takeoff.  To allow more time for the mission planning operations, the Air Force would like to be ableto use wireless data transmission to transfer this data.  SFC proposes to develop a Remote Consolidated Data Loader (RCDL) to meet this need.  The RCDL will use a COTS wireless technology to transfer data from the Mission Planning System (MPS) to theaircraft.  During Phase I, SFC has developed a system concept heavily based on COTS components.  One key component is the Harris SecNet-11 secure wireless LAN device.  This device, soon to receive NSA approval, combines a Type I encryption processor withwireless LAN functionality.  RCDL uses RF amplifiers to extend the range of this device to the required 2-5 miles.  SFC will deliver a  working prototype RCDL at the end of Phase II.  Also during Phase II the RCDL will be integrated with the WIRED ATDbeing developed by AFRL/IFSC.  The RCDL system will be flight-tested during Phase II as an adjunct to the WIRED ATD, aboard a Combat Talon I aircraft.",

This system uses a Stirling or pulse tube cryocooler operating at 70 K as a precooler and an expansion-engine-based cold stage. Operating temperatures below 6 K can easily be achieved with Carnot efficiencies greater than 5%. The extraordinary high efficiency is due to the incorporation of a unique expansion engine design that is enabled through application of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology. The development of the MEMS expander assembly and its integrated electronics will revolutionize low-temperature cooling. It greatly increases Carnot efficiency, reducing input power, lowering cost, and providing consistency of performance. Using MEMS fabrication techniques, the LTCC can be made in large quantities with low production costs resulting from the economy-of-scale seen in the integrated circuit industry. Development of this technology will provide an extraordinarily high payoff for future NASA Space and Earth Science Enterprises. The Phase I study will demonstrate feasibility of the LTCC through detailed analyses and identification of the MEMS fabrication processes.

However, current systems do not permit measurements in hard-to-access locations.TEC has successfully reduced the measurement head to fit inside a 6-inch diameter hole and obtain the correct stresses in aluminum. TEC proposes to reduce the measurement head to approximately 4 inches and measure stresses in aluminum, ferritic/martensiticsteels, and titanium alloys. Elements are in place for successfully measuring austenitic steels and nickel, provided a miniature manganese x-ray tube is obtainable.The ultimate goal is to produce a hand-carried, rugged, low-power consumption instrument that can correctly measure stresses in difficult-to-access locations.

This method is subject to errors of misunderstanding or incorrect implementation.  Becausecomputers cannot understand English, automation support for meta-data has been limited to information such as type constraints or cardinality of lists.  We can do better.JBI has the potential to revolutionize information processing and dissemination for the Air Force as well as serving as a model for other services and organizations.  Expanding the richness of meta-data, and providing JBI users and consumers with aframework for reasoning with meta-data can be a key component of that revolution.  Our approach is to use formal logic, along with a suite of tools that make it easy for systems analysts to manipulate logic statements, to specify meta-data.",

CyberSafe will operate in the Windows NT environment and will employ a set of behavior-modifying wrappers to provide broad protection against malicious code contained ine-mail attachments, downloaded by a web browser, or distributed in software releases.  The system will detect both simple and complex attacks before they succeed and autonomically respond in a way that minimizes disruption of ongoing processing whilecontinuing to protect the user's and the system's resources.  It's chief strategy for doing so will be to employ a set of responses that gradually transform the execution of the malicious code from operating on the actual resources to operating in asynthetic space that hides the actual resources and substitutes virtualized ones while additional information is gathered to determine whether or not the process is malicious and the nature of the attack being perpetrated.

The prototype device will be tested to assure that all specified requirements are satisfied, and the commercialization potential of the device will be evaluated for different (fusion as well as non-fusion) applications.                       Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In fusion research, the technique should have application to the non-intrusive precision measurement of plasma facing surfaces (liquid as well as solid).  The ability to simultaneously measure position as well as velocity of targets, remotely and precisely, also should find application in such areas as material processing, production lines, as well as in situations with harsh environments.",

        "abstract": "Machining is a major cost element in aerospace. High-speed machining (HSM) enables cost savings for aluminum components, but has not yet done so for titanium. Our Phase I results demonstrate feasibility of HSM and high-frequency tooth pass (HFTP)technology to overcome inherent titanium barriers and double metal removal rates (MRR) while maintaining tool life.To accomplish this dramatic improvement of titanium machining, we must apply HSM/HFTP techniques to titanium. Barriers include: (1) lack of validated analytical tools to reduce dependency on testing, and (2) high cost and inefficient methods for testingnew machining concepts. Our Phase II project approach develops advanced technology to achieve this, based on technology used in Phase I to identify regimes of titanium machining that promise MRR doubling.We will use the advanced modeling technology to demonstrate how process improvement barriers can be cost effectively reduced. Our demonstration consists of the following: (1) application of validated modeling technology specifically developed for metalcutting, (2) use of modeling techniques to significantly reduce need for testing while enabling implementation of new concepts, and (3) application of identified HSM/HFTP titanium machining regimes to military aerospace components provided by Boeing andSikorsky Aircraft to demonstrate MRR potential.",

In these high pressure environments, the integrity of the sample may be compromised by degassing of volatile components if brought to the surface. Our proposed high pressure micro-sampling inlet system addresses this by collecting a micro-sample in the high pressure environment, then transfers it into a protected low pressure environment within the instrument housing for processing and analysis. The proposed enabling technology will allow in situ analysis in deep subsurface environments by the new generation of miniaturized, low power instruments being developed by NASA, including GC/MS, isotope spectrometers, and other techniques that inherently require low pressures for operation.

Supercontinuum (white-light) continuum generation in the atmosphereusing terawatt femtosecond laser pulses have already been suggested for novel LIDAR applications in the spectral range from the UV to IR, to perform range resolved multitrace analysis simultaneously. In addition, the generation of a high-intensity (>1013W/cm2) light channel over long distances offers the possibility to probe nonlinear effects such as Raman processes, harmonic generation, nonlinear frequency mixing, and plasma generation at a remote location. The program will demonstrate applicability tosensor countermeasures and remote sensing by detailed experimentation, using a femtosecond laser system. Long-range propagation experiments using a 500-meter laser range will analyze the effects of initial pulse energy, beam radius, frequency chirp, andwavefront divergence on the propagation distance. Laser pulse propagation dynamics under multiple filamentation conditions will be characterized. Additional experiments will quantify EMP generation from the induced plasma column and laser pulse materialinteractions including surface damage assessment /secondary radiations effects. Simulations will include the usual plasma generation, dispersion and nonlinear effects, as well as vector waves and harmonic generation. This effort will result in a modelthat, when verified by experimentation, will serve as the basis for development of novel, long range LIDAR systems.  These systems will be used to detect chemical/biological agents at long ranges, as well as provide a means for remote detection ofatmospheric chemicals and aerosols for monitoring of pollution.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an entirely new form of machine vision technology for process control of metallic components. The technology is based on an array of giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensors that produce high-resolution images of hidden defects, missing parts, and other features. Minute GMR sensors detect magnetic fields associated with eddy currents induced in the component being imaged. High spatial resolution images are achieved through the high density and small size of the sensors in the array, coupled with the high sensitivity, low noise, and fast response of the sensors. A GMR sensor array, combined with a magnetic field generator, can produce high resolution, three-dimensional images of parts as they are produced, using a rugged, non-contacting sensor system. The images provide on-line feedback for process control, quality assurance, and safety protocols. The Phase I project developed functional GMR sensor arrays, and successfully imaged defects in metallic parts clearly demonstrating that the technology is feasible. The commercial potential of the proposed technology will be in manufacturing, quality assurance (QA), and process control. It will be used for rapid imaging and inspection of parts used in electronics, aerospace, automotive, transportation, construction, biomedical and other industries.",

        "abstract": "Hyperexcitability of spinal sensory neurons contributes significantly to pain syndromes, e.g. after nerve injury and inflammation. A method for dampening hyperexcitability of these neurons is expected to ameliorate neuropathic pain, and the targeting of sensory neuron-specific molecules may yield pain relief with minimal side effects. Sodium channels generate the inward currents that underlie action potentials. Several sodium channels have now been identified in spinal sensory neurons (e.g. dorsal root ganglia, DRG neurons). Small diameter DRG neurons, the majority of which are nociceptive, express sodium currents that are sensitive to the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX-S) and others that are resistant (TTX-R). TTX-R currents are increased in experimental models of inflammation. Recently, a novel rat TTX-R Na+ channel that is preferentially expressed in high threshold nociceptive neurons of DRG and trigeminal ganglia was identified. Work supported by our Phase I SBIR permitted creation of several rat NaN/SNS2 clones which will be useful tools for developing cell-based assays. We also obtained the human NaN/SNS2 sequence. We propose to characterize rat and human NaN expression and current in transfected mammalian cells. This represents a critical step toward developing molecular targets in cell-based assays for high throughput screening for agents that modulate the activity of this sensory neuron-specific channel.",

Radiologist now derive interventional efficacy from pressure and vessel diameter measurements. Direct measurement of volume flow (ml/min) would give immediate feedback on procedural success. \n\nTransonic Systems proposes to resolve this need by further developing and commercializing an inexpensive catheter-based AngioFlowmeter for measuring blood flow during angioplasty of PTFE grafts and native fistulae. Our Phase-I clinical studies demonstrated that access flow may be measured accurately and repeatably using thermodilution catheters introduced through the angioplasty antegrade sheath and room temperature saline injections. \n\nOur Phase-ll plans are to: Attain FDA clearance. Refine and validate the catheter designs and measurement algorithms for catheter placement through antegrade and retrograde introducer sheaths; Refine and validate algorithms to identify whether the flow-limiting stenosis is on the graft arterial or venous side; Demonstrate the system's efficacy in controlled clinical trials; Publish results of the study in preparation for market introduction.\n\nAt the end of Phase II, Transonic Systems aims to market the AngioFlowmeter as a new quality assurance tool for interventional radiology procedures.  \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: An access flow measurement catheter would have routine use during radiological and surgical interventions to restore flow.  It would allow quantitative assessment of the efficacy of percutaneous angioplasty and thus support improved outcomes.  This may in turn reduce the need for repeat interventions, improve the quality of life for ESRD patients, and reduce healthcare costs in the US by $18 million/year.

This effort will employ the technology developments from our Phase I efforts by incorporating a multi-layer (conductive/dielectric and/or magnetic/conductive) InstaShieldS laminate into the structural design. These technologies includeTriton\u00c2\u00bfs InstaShieldS paste and film adhesives funded by DTRA and lightweight electromagnetic (EM) shielding carbon/epoxy laminates funded by NASA. Incorporation of these technologies will enable development of a lightweight tactical shelter system with60dB EM shielding performance on the Proposed Phase II program.

        "abstract": "On future extended-flight, exploration-class missions to the Moon or to Mars, astronaut crews will need a minimum 3-year food supply. Triton addresses this challenge by developing new polymer nanocomposite-based materials solutions for food packaging. Nanocomposite materials, based in high-barrier resins, such as PET, EVOH, and polyethylene, can outperform unfilled materials in ways crucial to the needs of NASA and the extended-flight missions. Triton Nanocomposites increase the barrier capabilities of such materials by over 2-3 times. Nanocomposites remain lightweight, flexible, moldable and fully recyclable. With such dramatic increases in barrier properties, nanocomposites can allow the necessary weight and volume of food packaging to be reduced by at least half with decreased packaging wall-thickness. These unique advantages result from the nano-dispersion of very high aspect ratio (>100:1), organically-modified layered alumino-silicates (ORMLASTM). The successful nanocomposite contains well-dispersed and highly orientated nano-platelets, which form an inorganic barrier to diffusing species. This remarkable nano-structure also increases strength and tensile modulus without loss of flexibility and the low-loading levels (2-8%) do not result in any weight-increase or loss of processibility. Reduced resistance to heat and moisture makes these materials fully retortable as well as microwaveable and compatible for use with convection ovens, or hot-water-injection.",

The CALHP then does not require liquid cooled shielding which is required for the cryogenic CPL, where the liquid line is looped around the condenser several times to cool the shield.

Primary among these are increased specific impulse and reduced launch weight. Previously, the use of gaseous O2/H2 was limited by the lack of a combustion chamber material capable of withstanding the temperatures of stoichiometric O2/H2 combustion. Ultramet recently solved this problem by demonstrating a material system capable of operating for several hours under stoichiometric conditions utilizing only radiation cooling. Because the chambers reached temperatures of nearly 2600?C during testing, a water-cooled injector was used. That will not be an option in space, so an injector must be developed that will be able to withstand these extreme temperatures and minimize thermal soakback to the valves. In Phase I, an uncooled combustion chamber/injector system for use with stoichiometric O2/H2 propellants was designed, fabricated, and hot-fire tested. Phase II will focus on improving the life of the combustion chamber by taking a critical look at the designs of both the chamber and the injector.

Application of such CMCs can enhance the efficiency and performance, reduce the weight, improve the durability, and lower the cost of aerospace propulsion systems, particularly those used in high temperature, high-stress environments. Achieving these benefits requires development of matrix infiltration techniques capable of efficiently producing thick parts. The quality of such parts will also depend on implementation of improved fiber/matrix interfaces and interface deposition techniques. Carbon fibers are of particular interest as CMC reinforcements because they are relatively inexpensive, have higher strength and stiffness and lower density than oxide or non-oxide ceramic fibers, and retain their mechanical properties at very high temperatures. The main drawback of carbon fibers is their low oxidation resistance, which has prevented their extensive use in high temperature oxidizing environments. Oxide interfaces can potentially impart sufficient protection, as well as provide other essential interface functions related to load transfer between fibers. In Phase I, Ultramet demonstrated a unique and innovative process for depositing oxide interfaces, specifically ultraviolet-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (UVCVD), throughout thick fiber preforms. Ultramet also successfully achieved rapid infiltration of carbide matrices into thick-section (1) fiber preforms, up to 98% dense, using an innovative melt infiltration process and obtained initial mechanical properties and oxidation performance of the resultant composites. In Phase II, Ultramet will optimize material selection and processing parameters to produce low-porosity carbon/silicon carbide (C/SiC) thick-section CMCs having optimal strength, stiffness, and oxidation performance, and scale up the processing to fabricate components up to 14 diameter x 2.5 thick.",

        "abstract": "The removal of sub-micron sized particles from an aqueous stream based on electrostatic attraction is proposed. The system will remove suspended particles from a gas-water-solid mixture with minimal flow restrictions. This is particularly important for the removal of fine alumina particles in the outlet stream from the Volatile Removal Assembly (VRA), since high pressures are required to force the gas-water mixture through a small pore collection filter. Electrophoretic particle removal will result in direct capture on the oppositely charged surface of removal media or an electrode, or by collection of larger aggregates formed at such surfaces on a large pore filter. Zeta potential is a measure of the effective surface charge on suspended particles. For oxides, the zeta potential varies strongly with pH, reaching zero at the isoelectric pH. The zeta potential is negative at pHs above this value, and positive at pHs below it. Particle collection by removal media requires an opposite polarity zeta potential, or alternatively, an electrode with the proper surface potential at the pH of interest. The Phase I effort will demonstrate feasibility. The Phase II project will result in the delivery of a prototype scaled to handle the nominal VRA flow rates.",

United Applied Technologies has demonstrated the feasibility and scaleability of the basic manufacturing processes for producing preformed deployable thin polyimide film mirrors using low-cost tooling for process refinement. Spherical polyimide film mirrors, 0.5- meter diameter with thicknesses ranging to less than 20 \u00c2\u00bfm, have been produced that are self-supporting in one-G. These membrane mirrors passively maintain their preformed shape after deployment. The manufacture of large aperture preformed membrane mirrors with shape and smoothness control to within nanometers using the above approach requires both high-precision tooling with highly polished surfaces, and precise preforming process parameter control. The innovation to be evaluated in this effort is development and refinement of new membrane mirror preforming processes that produce highly accurate mirrors with tooling that is much lower in cost and is scaleable to large diameters. Alternate polyimide materials that produce membranes with higher surface smoothness and lower coefficients of thermal expansion will be evaluated using these new processes.",

        "abstract": "United Biomedical, Inc, (UBI) has developed an alternative approach to injectable LHRH agonists and other androgen-ablation therapies for the treatment of prostate cancer through development of an anti-LHRH immune response.  The LHRH synthetic peptide vaccine comprises the LHRH decapeptide covalently linked to helper T cell epitopes and to an additional peptide that provides specific immune adjuvanting activities. This molecular conformation produces a potent B cell response and anti- LHRH antibodies in sufficiently high titer to neutralize circulating LHRH and thereby suppress androgen production. Studies in rodents have demonstrated that the LHRH peptide vaccine can rouse a specific immune response that inhibits and androgen-dependent tumor growth in the host by blocking synthesis of testosterone. The goal is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the LHRH peptide vaccine prepared in several adjuvant formulations to induce antibody adult male baboons. If successful, these preclinical studies will provide supporting data for an IND application and the testing of the LHRH peptide vaccine formulation as an alternative hormonal ablative therapy for prostate cancer. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The LHRH synthetic peptide vaccine is an immunotherapy for the treatment of androgen-responsive, advanced prostate cancer. This vaccine is predicted to be effective because its mode of action is analogous to the LHRH agonist-androgen-ablation therapies currently used to treat prostate cancer as well as other hormone-responsive benign conditions and tumors (e.g., endometriosis, leiomyoma). Commercial advantages of the LHRH vaccine therapy over agonists include improved patient compliance and less costly treatment option.",

These costs are driven by the need to use inefficient conventional chemical reactors and the need to separate the organic phase in a separate unit operation.  This project will combine a novel reactor design with cost effective phase transfer catalysis (PTC) technology so that reaction and separation can be performed in one step. This approach will save capital and energy costs because of thermodynamically efficient phase contacting and inherently easier phase separation.  Phase I built and demonstrated a new Taylor-Vortex countercurrent reactor in which phase transfer catalysis was combined with the enhanced fluid mechanics from counter-current Taylor Vortex flow, leading to enhanced processing capability.

Surveys will be conducted of the infection control personnel before and after a one year trial of an early prototype real-time monitoring system to determine the impact such a system has on their ability to prevent the spread of infectious disease. Success will be measured by the survey results as well as by the number of outbreaks detected in a timely manner. This research will extend the scientific understanding of GAs, infectious disease surveillance, and cluster detection.",

        "abstract": "Anti-cancer immunization is limited by the poor immunogenicity of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) normally used for vaccination. This problem may be overcome by direct adenovirus-mediated delivery of TAAs to dendritic cells (DCs), which play a centralrole in the generation of the immune response. The specificity and efficiency of this vaccination strategy may be improved by specifically targeting the vectors to DCs. Therefore, we propose to develop an Ad vector targeted to CD40 molecules expressed onthe surface of DCs. In one approach, CD40-specific ligands, the natural CD40 ligand (CD40L) and an anti-CD40 single chain antibody, will be cross-linked to TAA-expressing Ad vectors by peptide zippers genetically incorporated into both the Ad capsid andthe ligand.  In an alternative approach, the human immunoglobulin Fc domain and the Z domain of S. aureus protein A will be incorporated into the ligand and the Ad fiber protein, respectively.  In both cases, the entire targeting complex is designed toself-assemble during the propagation of the Ad vector.  We hypothesize that this vector design will result in more efficient antigen presentation by DCs, thereby leading to significant improvements in anti-cancer immunization-based treatment strategies.The prostate-specific membrane antigen will be employed as a model TAA.",

The passive system, without electronics or moving parts, is based on a commercially availablehydrogen/air, proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell that converts hydrogen directly to electricity. Hydrogen is generated by a chemical reaction of seawater with a hydroreactive material at the seawater temperature. The energy capacity of the system canbe tailored to produce from a few to several hundred kWh. The power generation system is designed for long-term operation without maintenance and produces power continuously on-demand. About 1.4 kWh of electrical energy is produced by SWAPS per kg of therechargeable reagent, at approximately $3/kWh. Byproducts of SWAPS are environmentally benign. This power system can also be used in various other low-power marine applications. The Phase I efforts include a low-risk design of an integrated prototype ofthe buoy power source to supply six (6) months of continuous electrical power at an average load of ~ 35 W. The range of possible power production is from zero to the maximum power output of the fuel cell.   It is anticipated that the NAVY will gain fromthis R&D effort a new type of seawater \u00c2\u00bfactivated, low electrical power source with an energy density of ~ 1.2 kWh/kg of the system weight.

Our approach takes advantage of telltale delayed response in the SAR dataproduced by radar energy that enters damage holes in recently fired-upon objects.  Our phase I work has provided us a theoretical understanding of these responses and demonstrated that they are present in real data at detectable levels.  For Phase II wewill develop algorithms that improve the contrast of the delayed responses with respect to the background clutter and improve detection performance.  Furthermore, we intend to develop a concept of operations (CONOPS) for using such techniques in currentlyfielded aircraft and radar systems.  Delayed responses may prove to be one of the most important BDA features because they can only be produced by an actual entry or exit hole in the target.  This contrast with other more indirect features that might yieldambiguous results in the event of near-hit explosions.

The information could be used to determine the event source location and depth, as well as its magnitude, and pertains to nuclear test ban treaty verification, seismology, and other scientific and national security applications.  This project will use a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to image, in real time, the surface Rayleigh wave from a seismic event as it propagates outward from the event hypocenter.  By interferometrically comparing this image to a later image of the same scene, a high-resolution picture of the structure of the seismic wave will be produced.  In Phase I, two independent approaches were used to explore the parameter space of seismic waves relative to the operational characteristic of SAR imaging systems.  The two approaches agreed well with one another and support the feasibility of real-time seismic imaging.  Phase II has three related components:  (1) a continuation of the theoretical analysis pursued in Phase I, (2) a physical experiment in which a large conventional explosion is imaged using airborne and spaceborne SAR systems, and (3) the development and delivery of a software package capable of analyzing and inverting real-time InSAR seismic data to source event characteristics such as bomb yield and event epicenter.  In combination these components will support, demonstrate, and deliver the capability to image and analyze seismic events in progress with unprecendented precision.

The recent development of superconductive hot electron bolometers (HEBs) has made it possible for NASA to cover this frequency band with high-resolution heterodyne receivers with exceptional sensitivity. As a critical additional benefit, the HEB mixers require extremely low levels of local oscillator (LO) power. In fact system requirements of as little as one to ten microwatts make it feasible for the mixers to be pumped with solid-state sources based on a fundamental oscillator and a cascaded chain of frequency multipliers. However, multipliers for above 1 THz, even at these power levels, remain a formidable challenge. In fact, a frequency multiplier for Band 6 of the Heterodyne Radiometer for Herschel, spanning from 1,410 - 1,910 GHz, has not yet been demonstrated.

We have focused through Phase I and Phase II grant award periods on one specific product - a topical ophthalmic drug delivery device (TODDD ) delivering timolol, to treat glaucoma. Timolol is one of the most commonly used glaucoma drugs and is not patent protected. It has a long history of successfully lowering intraocular pressure (IOP), but has some significant ocular and systemic side effects when delivered in drop form. When delivered by TODDD, it should eliminate the incidence and severity of those side effects by continuously delivering a very low, preservative-free dose to the patient and virtually eliminating systemic absorption, as shown in the Phase II animal study. Of great importance to the mission of NEI of preventing vision loss from glaucoma, is that the product will address the 24-59% non-compliance rate among glaucoma patients using drops. This major clinical disadvantage is due mainly to difficult instillation, forgetfulness and undesirable side effects. In this proposed Phase II Renewal project, the goal is to show that the product can be safely and comfortably worn for 90+ days and deliver drug in humans, while addressing issues related to Federal regulatory approval processes. The specific aims of the project encompass the scientific and clinical regulatory requirements attendant to this goal, as well as executive management of the commercialization process. Work will continue on TODDD with timolol, along several scientifically driven regulatory fronts. These aims include design and mold optimization; manufacturing process scale-up, semi- automation and validation; analytical assay testing; sterilization process and testing; clinical product build; and design and conduct of a human design validation study, with one or two drug treatment arms. Our commercialization plan indicates a high degree of commercial potential, as it reflects specific input generated by the interest to date of potential investors and large ophthalmic companies. For example, our focus on a small human feasibility study, with at least one drug arm, is a direct result of this input. Our collaboration with the Massachusetts Medical Device Development (M2D2) Center at U. Mass. and its mission and coordination of resources also offer high potential of success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Glaucoma is a major ocular disease that severely impacts millions of people. Most are over fifty-five years of age and many have difficulty with instilling drops and suffer from poor compliance with a drops-based therapy. The TODDD product provides a more efficient, convenient and consistent means of drug delivery to the surface of the eye, and reduces the incidence and severity of side effects by delivering a lower, preservative-free dose to the patient and virtually eliminating systemic absorption. It will also reduce the current 24-59% level of non-compliance by remaining in the eye between physician visits (1).",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Development of new and improved drugs to treat human illness is a costly and inefficient process. It costs over half a billion dollars to develop a compound into a medicine and more than 90% of compounds that enter human clinical trials fail usually due to unexpected toxicity. The attrition rate is even higher at the preclinical level where less than 1 in 10,000 drug \"hits\" successfully makes it to FDA approval. VistaGen, Inc. is developing a simple and reproducible screening technology for in vitro toxicity assessment, the Genesis ScreenTM. The system employs stem cells capable of differentiating into most tissues in the body. Once the cells are exposed to test compounds, toxicity is evaluated as changes in genomic and proteomic expression patterns as measured using cDNA microarrays and a protein SELDI-TOF microchip technology. This assay can rapidly prioritize drug \"hits\" based on a straightforward in vitro safety assessment. The objective of our previously funded phase I SBIR was to provide proof of principle of the Genesis Screen TM technology. We have successfully completed the goals of our phase I grant and in particular made major progress in developing proteomic fingerprints of toxic drugs. Furthermore, we have started to develop the biomathematics that will allow us to statistically compare the profiles of our library of molecular fingerprints of reference toxic drugs to test compounds to predict whether those test compounds are likely to be toxic or not. The objective of our Phase II application is to refine our assay to the point of bringing the Genesis ScreenTM system to the full-scale commercialization stage. We propose studies to increase the resolving power of our proteomic and genomic surrogate markers for selective classes of compounds with known toxicity. We will further develop the biomathematics component of the Genesis ScreenTM system These development studies will allow us to commercialize to the pharmaceutical industry a rapid and reliable high throughput Genesis ScreenTM system assay for prioritizing drug lead candidates based on toxicity assessment. \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: There is a very pressing need in the pharmaceutical industry for technology that increases the efficiency of drug development via more effective clinically predictive assays.   Because drug development is so costly, working on a drug that will ultimately fail is enormously expensive.  Our screening system will allow predictive tox assessment early during drug development and will increase the efficiency of clinical trials.  The commercial version of this assay will be provided to the pharmaceutical industry as screening service.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop a portable, noninvasive, personal blood glucose monitor. VivaScan has developed and successfully tested a laboratory prototype instrument based on the Optical Bridge TM (OB) method. The OB uniquely nulls out the background absorption of the sample, overcoming the major problem of optical blood glucose measurements. Our successful Phase I diabetic patient study produced 96% of the measurement data in the clinically acceptable A and B zones of the Clarke error grid. The aims for Phase II include: 1) enhance electronics with microcontroller; 2) redesign and miniaturize the optics and device mechanics; 3) investigate the use of optical interference filters for acousto-optical tunable filters (AOTF) substitutes; 4) replace expensive AOTF, used for wavelength generation, with less expensive devices; 5) further enhance the glucose measurement algorithms; and 6) build four portable devices and test their performance with patients. Overall, the goal of the proposed work is to extend our laboratory prototype system to a patient oriented device, with improved accuracy, portability, ease of operation and affordability. Subsequent FDA approval of a practical portable in-home blood glucose monitor will be sought, allowing diabetic patients to noninvasively and painlessly monitor their glucose levels throughout the day. \nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:\nOur market analysis suggests that from 500,000 to 4.4 million diabetic individuals could use a non-invasive glucose monitor. The global market would increase these projections by a factor of 2 or more.",

This capability is realized in Voss Scientific's BAC-SIM (Benefield Anechoic Chamber Simulation Software), but the ultimate goalof perfect simulation has proved challenging.  The biggest obstacle to accurate simulation is the lack of adequate information about the chamber configuration.  We propose a new paradigm: instead of attempting to compute the anechoic chamber's field solelyby deterministic means, we propose a combination of deterministic and statistical techniques to characterize a chamber's electromagnetic properties.  In Phase I, we have worked out a methodology for statistically describing the electromagnetic fielddistribution of an anechoic chamber, and in Phase II we will implement a suite of tools that result in statistical-based figures of merit to quantify chamber performance.  The Phase II program will also include the additions of: the capability to model theelectromagnetic scattering from multiple objects in a chamber, advanced data visualization capabilities, integrated analysis methods for simulation and measured chamber data, and the addition of electromagnetic models for common chamber equipment.Finally, the Phase II effort will include extensive validation of the chamber simulation software consisting of analytical and measured elements.",

This could be called a 5-D vascular imaging system (x y z v t), operating at 30 FPS. In addition, the threedimensional blood vessel centerline was instantaneously acquired, tracked and displayed as needed for true 3-D vector velocity and for non-invasive measurement and monitoring of blood volume flow. The 3D image can be fully rotated andlor viewed as a fixed or moving slice in any axis. The Phase I Engineering Model used a small transducer array, with a limited angular field of view, to produce 200,000 voxels/sec with a fantastic 4x improvement in velocity (color) resolution over 2D systems. In Phase II, VueSonix will fully reduce its invention (patent pending, submitted 6/99 81 7/99) to practice by building and testing a prototype system with a full-size probe producing images with 12 times the number of voxels as the engineering model. The prototype will be optimized for the peripheral vascular market and will be clinically tested at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. Cardiac imaging will also be evaluated.  \nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:\nVuesonix is developing commercial ultrasound devices that image blood vessels in real time 3D. The objective is to provide superior blood flow imaging with volume blood-flow measurements resulting in improved diagnosis requiring less operator skill.

The major innovation is the monolithic integration of printed fractal-like antennas, pyroelectric capacitors, and MEMS switches in a single wafer. Pyroelectric sensors have low sensitivity in the MMW range of the spectrum. The proposed integration of pyroelectric capacitors with printed broad-band antennas will dramatically improve sensitivity. The preliminary design and calculations performed in the course of the Phase I Project have shown that the minimum detectable temperature contrast is less than 1 K. A MEMS switch incorporated in the antenna/capacitor circuit will act as a chopper, eliminating the need for that cumbersome device. The goal of Phase II of the Project is to build a working prototype of the proposed imager (with support of Raytheon?s foundry for the manufacturing process). The final result of Phase II will be the creation of a very efficient low-cost MMW imager whose sensitivity is comparable to that of the best IR sensors. The combination of WaveBand?s MMW circuitry and a pyroelectric thermal sensor makes it possible to overcome the main problem of MMW thermal sensors, their low sensitivity caused by the small power of thermal radiation in the MMW frequency range.",

Between 20 and 33 percent of HIV-seropositive patients will miss at least one of their medication doses over a 1 to 3 day period. To improve patient adherence, we must accurately assess non-adherence and intervene to enhance adherence. Patient self-report is the most practical method for assessing   adherence, but may produce unreliable and invalid results unless optimally  performed. A computer-assisted, self-administered adherence program could  improve HIV-seropositive patients' adherence behaviors by accurately and  efficiently assessing their medication adherence, delivering an adherence   intervention to patients, and producing adherence reports for providers.  Patients could routinely complete the program with minimal use of valuable and  costly medical staff time.

These sampling systems require the development of innovative deployment strategies, multi-sensor sampling packages with integrated acquisition, and software networks designed for automated and integrated processing.In response, we propose to develop a self-contained, compact, in-situ optical measurement system, the DOLPHIN (Diving OpticaL Profiler and High-speed Integration Network). The sampling package will be a towed profiler to maximize spatial coverage. Data acquisition and processing will be automated. A water sampling system will additionally pump water to the vessel for laboratory analyses.The towed sampling package will provide a continuous set of calibration points for validation, instead of a single point (station) as typically obtained from a ship. Equally important, substantial time and money will be saved by the research community by purchasing a sampling system already equipped with complete sensor integration and automated processing.At the end of Phase-I we expect to have design work for the system completed. We will construct and test all DOLPHIN components in Phase-II. Phase-II will culminate in a completely operational system transitioned to a commercial product.",

        "abstract": "The technical, scientific, and commercial feasibility of developing a novel aquatic in-situ biogeochemical sensor, termed the XMF, is evaluated. Using excitation-emission matrix fluorometry, the sensor will enable in-situ simultaneous detection and effective analytical separation of individual biogeochemical components present in seawater, including humic substances, hydrocarbons, proteins, wastewater/sewage, and other natural and anthropogenic substances. Excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) will be measured at sampling rates on the order of a second. No scanning of the monochromators, in fact no moving parts whatsoever, will be required. The technological innovation making this possible is termed Double Dispersion Imaging (DDI). The sensor software will incorporate real-time, automated quantum corrections and 2-D mixing analysis techniques. Design goals emphasize portability, compactness, ruggedness, and enabling flexible deployment through features such as variable sampling rates and memory storage capabilities. No current sensor for oceanographic deployment has these characteristics. If feasibility is demonstrated, the XMF is expected to be a powerful analytical tool for investigating biogeochemical processes that we feel will realistically mark a turning point in the analytical oceanic measurement capabilities.",

The acute bleeding is a medical emergency that needs to be evaluated and treated immediately. Occult bleeding may be a sign of colon cancer and demands a careful evaluation to avoid missing a cancer in a curable stage. An initial and important determination in the medical management of either type of gastrointestinal bleeding is the localization of the bleeding site to either the upper or the lower gastrointestinal tract. During the Phase I portion of this project we developed a simple in vitro test for the analysis of blood in stool samples. This test was designed to determine, from a stool sample, whether bleeding was from an upper or lower gastrointestinal site.

        "abstract": "65164     The detection and discrimination of seismic events while monitoring for small nuclear explosions is complicated by a significant amount of commercial mining explosions.  Although mining explosion databases have been constructed to help with this problem in various regions of the world, very little is known about the contribution of mining activity in southern Asia to the regional seismicity.  This project will develop an extensive ground truth database for southern Asia that includes mining explosions and rock burst data, using data currently being collected in the region along with previously developed location algorithms and velocity models.  In Phase I, a mining database for southern Asia was developed that includes over 230 mines and mineral deposits for the region.  Seismic waveform data from stations in India were collected, and waveform correlation techniques were used to identify mining explosions.  These explosions were located using single-station location methods combined with maps and overhead satellite imagery.  The resulting waveform and mining resources were combined into a preliminary mining database for the study region.  Phase II will finish the development of the mining resources component of the database, and analyze new sources of data, including stations in northwestern India and Pakistan, in order to examine the mining seismicity near the nuclear test sites.

        "abstract": "Large corporations are increasingly looking to purchase behavioral interventions for employee wellness programs; however, although many interventions have been demonstrated to cost-effectively improve health outcomes, few commercially viable products are available. Hostility and anger expression style have been demonstrated as risk factors for hypertension, itself a risk factor for CHD. Recent research suggests that anger management training reduces blood pressure, and leads to improvement in psychosocial risk factors, e.g., depression. The Williams LifeSkills workshop, based on the book \"Anger Kills\", and its successor, \"Lifeskills\", has shown in pilot studies to improve psychosocial risk factors, and is currently marketed in a limited manner to corporations and government agencies. The marketability of this product, however, would be far greater if supported by extended research demonstrating its effects on blood pressure reduction, as well as showing, in a corporate setting, decreased hostility and depressive symptoms, as well as strong cost-effectiveness, compared with standard care procedures recommended by JNC-VI guidelines. We propose a randomized controlled trial test of the Williams LifeSkills workshop in a hospital setting. We hypothesize that employees who undertake the LifeSkills workshop will show improved blood pressure, psychosocial risk factors, and decreased costs associated with treatment. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Psychosocial risk factors have been strongly related to many health problems, notably CVD. Research has shown that behavioral interventions have great promise to ameliorate the distress, the health- damaging effects and the costs associated with these risk factors; but few such programs have been implemented in a large-scale way. Corporations are increasingly interested in providing such services, but they have had difficulties in knowing which programs are most effective. Until these programs are developed as commercially viable products, dissemination of these programs will be hindered. In sum; these findings make a strong case that the development of a protocol- driven behavioral intervention package that can be delivered in a wide range of corporate settings presents a remarkable commercial opportunity.",

Culture devices, such as stirred-tank and hollow fiber bioreactors, have utility in large-scale production, but are impractical and cost prohibitive at the research scale. Traditional roller bottles have been used successfully for small to mid-scale production of recombinant proteins, viral vectors, and therapeutic cell doses, but are labor intensive, typically requiring more than ten devices for each desired product. The Enhanced Roller Bottle (ERB) is a practical, cost effective cell culture device designed to improve culture productivity. The ERB increased cell production 4- to 9-fold over the traditional roller bottle by increased surface area for cell attachment and increased availability of culture medium due to its gas permeable walls. In the proposed Phase II studies, the ERB will be optimized for the production of anchorage-dependent cells and cell-secreted products. ERB parameters requiring investigation include gas transfer, scaffold configuration and material, inoculation methods, operating conditions, and product recovery. At the completion of Phase II, the ERB will be targeted to manufacturers of small and mid-scale culture devices for the production of cells or cell products for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.",

Some of the components currently in use like shelters or space stations use double-walled thick films with high internal pressure. All these hollow components are often vulnerable in space because debris and meteorites can strike them. They will lose their functions if hit and damaged by foreign objects. We propose to fill the cavities of these hollow components with an ultra-lightweight cold hibernated elastic memory (CHEM) or a shape memory polymer (SMP) foam that can rigidize the space structure in space so that it can maintain its functions even when struck by debris. In our phase I research, we have successfully processed ultra-lightweight microcellular CHEM foams using an environmentally friendly technique. These microcellular CHEM foams have much higher mechanical properties than those processed by the conventional techniques. We have also performed tests and proved that the microcellular CHEM foams did recover their original shapes after compaction and stowage. This capability allowed them to be packed into a very small volume, recover their shapes and be rigidized in space, thereby considerably reducing the launching cost yet providing high rigidity for space structures. The objectives proposed in the Phase I work plan have been accomplished. In this Phase II research we will scale-up the processing of the microcellular CHEM foams, further reduce their density, and optimize their mechanical properties as well as processing conditions.",

Also, security personnel would have a better tool to identify suspicious materials in the field, or determine whether prohibited materials were handled within suspicious terrorist facilities.  This project addresses this problem by developing a portable instrument that uses coincidence spectroscopy with two gamma detectors and one beta detector.  In Phase I, a compact PCI/PXI 4-channel spectrometer card for coincidence spectroscopy was designed.  Prototypes showed excellent temperature stability and the capability to operate with any kind of radiation detector.  Phase II will produce a compact PCI/PXI-based developer kit for multichannel coincidence spectroscopy.

Xinetics has developed the multiplexer system to take advantage of the properties of the PMN actuators. The high dielectric constant of PMN actuatorsmeans that any charge placed on an actuator remains there essentially forever until it finds a discharge path. This implies that fabricating a suitable switching system allows a single amplifier channel to address thousands of actuators. The trade-off has to do with the overall system speed, but for spaced-based imaging applications speed is not critical.The current SBIR took the results from previous programs one-step further by reducing the system noise and increasing the digital resolution. Xinetics has successfully demonstrated the low-noise concepts under this program. The major issues raised in Phase I are: charge injection in solid state switches, and optimizing analog and digital algorithms for robust charge transfer control. Results show a 1-lsb differentiation between adjacent channels within the test system.

Wafer contamination control is critical for Ultra Large Scale Integrated (ULSI) technology and there is a strong demand for a non-destructive analytical tool with improved sensitivity and spatial resolution over the conventional total x-ray fluorescence (TXRF) method. A new technique, focused beam TXRF, can meet this important market need. Based on point-focusing toroidal crystal optics, focused beam TXRF will improve the spatial resolution by a factor of more than 100 and provide 30 times better detection sensitivity for local contaminants on Si as compared to the conventional TXRF method. This technique also has potential for low-level Al, Na and other low Z elements analysis on Si that cannot be addressed effectively by the conventional TXRF and other techniques. In this project, preliminary focused beam TXRF data will be collected using WL1 excitation provided by a toroidal Si (220) crystal to demonstrate the improvement of sensitivity and resolution for transition metal detection. Theoretical calculation will be also carried out to determine the feasibility for Al and Na detection for wafer contamination control at 10^ 9 to 10^10 atoms/cm^2 level.\nFocused beam TXRF analysis has commercial applications in the microelectronics industry for wafer contamination control including localized and homogeneous contaminants with high resolution. These contaminants include many important elements such as transition metals, Al, Na and other low Z elements. By being able to identify these contaminants, the quality of silicon wafers can be improved. This will be a tremendous cost savings to a multi-billion dollar industry",

Oxidation state determination of intracellular Cr will provide important information relevant to exposure and risk assessment, and for understanding the mechanism of Cr carcinogenesis. We propose measuring the intracellular oxidation state of Cr using x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Until now, the XANES technique was not very practical, relying on costly synchrotrons. This valuable technique could be implemented using a lower power cost-effective system incorporating a revolutionary toroidal crystal optic. XOS has successfully carried out the Phase I research and demonstrated the feasibility of Cr oxidation determination using a table-top XANES system operated with samples in air. In this Phase II project, a fully optimized system will be designed. Human cells will be prepared in culture mediums and treated with Cr exposure. The reduction of Cr(Vl) to Cr(lll) will be monitored using the XANES system. The practical application of this XANES technique for clinical research and its commercialization will be evaluated.

        "abstract": "In May 1999, a Licensing Agreement between Zonagen, Inc. and the NICHD was finalized to develop new 19-substituted-norprogestins. If the new antiprogestins behave as tissue-specific modulators in the manner of selective estrogen response modulators (SERMs), they may be recognized as an analogous class of drugs, i.e., as SPRMs. Such SPRMs discovered by NICHD and realized as drugs through this SBIR, would bring the results of government-sponsored science into the public domain. We expect that the new generation of compounds will be used for a number of indications where the etiology is dominated by progesterone. Tissues of the reproductive system such as pituitary, breast, myometrium, cervix, and endometrium remain obvious target organs for treatment. Their potential for use in labor and delivery and in breast cancer remains high. The following document outlines experiments to be performed under Phase II of an SBIR that would clarify the properties of these new SPRMs and enhance their utility for the treatment of endometriosis. It was the intention of Phase I of this SBIR program to determine effects on the eutopic endometrium of cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) following short-term administration, of our lead compound, CDB-4124. We did not believe SPRMs could affect ectopic lesions (endometriosis) if there was no effect on eutopic endometrium. We found that our lead compound had effects on the endometrium similar to RU 486 but without evidence of effects on ovulation and without raising cortisol. We established methods and the baseline levels of markers of inflammation in the peritoneal cavity of the monkey. We intend to expand this program in Phase II to determine whether the same compound will reduce the size of endometriosis-like lesions in the same species. This animal model has been shown to respond to both GnRH agonists and to RU 486 with a decrease in lesion size. The use of GnRH agonists in women for the amelioration of endometriosis, although far from ideal, is one of the few medical therapies currently available. The primary outcome parameters will be alterations in the growth of ectopic endometrium and effects on hormones with our lead antiprogestin compound, CDB-4124. The secondary outcome parameter will be the effects on markers of endometriosis in peritoneal fluid and bone mineral density. The tertiary outcome parameters will be the assessment of the impact of our compound on inflammation markers, on cycling and on liver function.",

The therapies include the controversial ribavirin for treatment or humanized RSV monoclonal antibodies (Synagis) for prevention. The cost per season for Synagis prophylaxis is about US$ 5,000. In the absence of an effective vaccine, RSV remains a serious health threat and effort must be mounted to find effective and more economical therapies. An innovative approach of treating RSV infection with ethnobotanical (EB) preparations was identified in Phase I of this project and this concept has the potential of reducing the current treatment cost. In Phase I, the feasibility of the concept was proved by the significant in vitro and in vivo anti-RSV activity, which was better or comparable to ribavirin. This approach of using EB preparations with historical use as a treatment to target diseases was developed in enough detail to provide a basis for further development of active ingredients as anti-RSV agents. In Phase II, the active compounds in these EB fractions will be chemically purified, characterized and developed to the level of readiness required to launch clinical evaluation of these compounds as therapeutic agents against RSV infections.",

Incorporation of tungsten and weaker/ductile metals into the FM macrostructure will allowtungsten to be an effect replacement for depleted uranium.  There is a strong move to replace depleted uranium with tungsten alloys for environmental reasons.  However, tungsten alloys penetration performance does not compare to the adiabatic shearmechanisms that lead to self-sharpening of depleted uranium.  Tungsten itself is inherently resistant to adiabatic shearing therefore exhibiting mushrooming effects upon impact.  Newly developed tungsten FM composites exhibit localized, unstable shearfailure and self-sharpening properties during penetration.  The FM laminate structure allows shearing mechanisms to be built into the tungsten-based composite by combining tungsten alloy materials with weaker but structurally sound interface materials suchas tungsten carbide, tungsten carbide cobalt, tungsten nickel iron alloy and high strength steel.  Similar to traditional composites, FM composites may vary in orientation further allowing ACM to promote composites deformation mechanisms for enhanced depthpenetration.  The development of metal-based composites lends itself to commercial applications within the mining and drilling industry.",

Improving insulation values from conventional R-4 per inch to R-10 to R-12 per inch performance can eliminate more than 50% of the thermal losses.  However, past approaches have focused on sealing leaks and improving mechanicals (fan/blower and damper design) because very high R-value insulation (R-12/inch) has not been commercially available.  In Phase I, flexible aerogel blanket super-insulation materials (R-12/inch) were developed that exhibit R values of 10-14 per inch based on infrared radiation (IR) opacified silica aerogel matrices.  The most promising candidate insulation materials from a cost/thermal performance viewpoint were advanced from laboratory scale (6\u00c2\u00bfx 6\u00c2\u00bf x 1/4\u00c2\u00bf coupons) to small pilot scale (90 square feet per 6 hours) utilizing formulation chemistry, mechanical gel handling methods, gel strengthening and aging methods, low-cost water repellency treatments, and rapid supercritical fluid extraction techniques.  Thermal imaging of a prototype duct-wrap insulation product showed excellent performance for both conventional cooling and heating temperature environments.  In Phase II, low-cost aerogel formulations based on sodium silicate will be improved for density, thermal performance, and mechanical properties and scaled-up to large pilot scale (1000 square feet per 6 hours).  Encapsulation methods and strategies for integrating the new aerogel blanket super-insulation into existing duct manufacturing will be tested.              Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Aerogel materials are the best solid thermal insulators known.

Our vision for this work is based on our understanding of high-speed machinery and our background in similarly sized flywheel systems. Based on this experience, we have focused this SBIR program on two areas: the main bearing system and the motor-generator (M-G). A reliable main bearing system is key to the success of any flywheel system. The magnetic-bearing-based system we propose is simple yet robust with high reliability. Its unique combination of passive and actively controlled elements will become the standard against which future designs are judged. The M-G directly impacts the function and capability of the magnetic bearings. We propose a device that features a rotor with very low losses and very high efficiency. Work in Phase I will prove several key aspects of the main bearing system, followed by full development of the bearings and M-G in Phase II. Because we have invested considerable effort in the preliminary design and analysis of these two elements, we are confident that the proposed technology developments will solve the most challenging aspects of flywheel energy storage systems for spacecraft.",

Traditional techniques to correct these problems rely primarily on transverse pins or wires, which are subject to pain, scars, contractions, and risk of infection. The Phase I research demonstrated the feasibility of a new method for bone lengthening/transport, based on distraction osteogenesis, and using intramedullary rod fixation and a single, longitudinal traction cable actuator. The specific aim of the work is develop a completely implantable actuator to drive cable motion, thus eliminating all percutaneous penetration of wires, minimizing patient intervention, and making the need for rod exchange unlikely. In Phase I, six engineering prototype actuators were designed, built and successfully bench-tested with varying distraction forces to 1,200 N. In Phase II, the final-form distraction actuator -high-powered, self-contained and remotely controlled - will be developed, tested and combined with a largely existing suite of intramedullary nails and associated implant hardware. The successful Phase II development of a capable, cost-effective actuator, occupying a volume of 160 cc or less and weighing 200 g or less, will set the stage for the Phase III commercial development of a fully implantable bone lengthening and transport system.",

This pump utilizes the advanced three-dimensional magnetic\nsuspension for the rotor demonstrated during Phase I. This bearing system\nrequires neither position sensors nor active feedback electronics, resulting in\nthe simplest 3-0 magnetic bearing available for blood pumps. The bearing coils\nform part of a tuned inductance-capacitance-resistance (LCR) circuit. A sine\nwave generator powers the coil. Motion of the rotor varies the inductance and\ntherefore tuning of the circuit such that changes in electrical current flow\nalways occur to oppose the direction of motion. Control of the rotor position\nis inherent in the bearing construction and Eamshaw?s Law is satisfied. Phase I\ndemonstrated that this bearing construct can be dynamically stable, low in\npower consumption, and adequately stiff to handle externally applied shock and\nvibration loads. During Phase II, the program will advance to design and\ndevelop a prototype implantable rotary VAD and electronics package and perform\nin-vivo tests and in-vitro endurance tests. Successful completion will lead\ndirectly to a Phase Ill effort and ultimately FDA approval for clinical trials.\n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Heart disease remains the leading cause of death and disability in the United States.  Of the 600,000 Americans who die each year due to heart-related problems, about 30,000 to 60,000 could probably be saved with heart transplants.

        "abstract": "This Phase II SBIR involves the testing of a minimally invasive glucose sensor in vivo. Diabetes is an increasingly common  lifelong disease and is associated with many complications. It is responsible for an estimated 10-15 percent of all health care expenditures. Effective treatment has been shown to prevent or delay many of the associated complications. The most common current treatments include diet, exercise, and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). An improvement to the current method would enable and encourage patients to monitor their glucose levels more closely and thus improve the general health and quality of life of the diabetic population.                                                                        \n                                                                                    \n The technology is based on a small optical sensor implant that is fluorescent      \n and detectable through the skin.

While the need for sophisticated craniofacial imaging in the dentomaxillofacial field has existed for many years, due to cost and space restraints, practitioners have chiefly had to rely on 2D X-ray Systems or outsourcing their patients to facilities with conventional CT scanners. DentoCAT(TM) will offer practitioners an affordable and compact product that will generate CT scans featuring high contrast- and spatial resolution at a relatively low radiation dose. \n\nInitially, DentoCAT(TM) will be targeted for dental implantology: preoperative implant planning and postoperative assessment of failed implants. It is anticipated that DentoCAT(TM) will also prove valuable in the detection of TMJ disorders, facial fractures, lesions and diseases of soft tissue in the head and neck, including tumors, and in reconstructive facial surgery. \n\nWe have demonstrated the feasibility of the design by meeting performance Milestones set in Phase I. In Phase II we will develop Alpha and Beta clinical prototypes of the device and test the Alpha prototype in a clinical setting. In Phase Ill, DentoCAT(TM)will be commercialized.  \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: DentoCAT(TM) will be marketed to small, midsize and large dentomaxillofacial facilities as well as by specialized oral radiology facilities, which are expected to grow in number after their recent approval as a dental specialty. Once DentoCAT(TM) is established as an imaging tool in the dentomaxillofacial marker, Xoran plans to introduce its compact CT scanner \"MiniCAT(TM)\" to the medical market for use in emergency medicine, ICUs, neurology practices, plastic surgery, and other medical specialties.",

A direct result of designing more compact compressors with higher pressure ratios is a more adverse pressure gradient which causes flow separation on the endwalls of both the rotor and stator passageways. Consequently, the performance potential of the compressor is not reached. Technology in Blacksburg is proposing the use of engine casing and hub flow control in the stator blade rows to increase stator performance and efficiency while simultaneously reducing the length and thus overall weight of the engine. Flow control is achieved with miniature ejector pumps, integrally machined into the hub and casing. Ejector pumps provide a simple and efficient way of simultaneously producing suction and a high momentum jet for flow control. Low momentum fluid in boundary layer of the endwalls is removed with suction. The fluid is then re-energized by the ejector pump and injected into the flow as a high momentum jet flowing tangent to the endwall. In this way, the boundary layer along the wall is provided with the energy necessary to remain attached in an adverse pressure gradient.",

In the Phase I SBIR Techsburg demonstrated the capability of an innovative flow control technique designed to improve the LP turbine performance leading to a reduction in costs. Flow control was achieved with ejector pumps machined into the blade surface to provide a simple and efficient way of producing blowing and suction. High-pressure supply air from the compressor is injected into the flow as a high momentum jet providing a boundary layer that is resistant to separation, while low momentum fluid in the boundary layer is removed with suction upstream and combined with the supply air to enhance the jet.

This effort will apply new findings from insect neurobiology, including work accomplished in Phase I, to the correlationalmodel of the elementary motion detector (EMD), which appears to be the basis for all higher-level visual motion processing in the insect visual system. These new findings show that adaptation of contrast sensitivity plays a crucial role in extending thedynamic range of motion estimation and conferring `velocity constancy,' a response invariance with respect to non-motion-related parameters. New models have been proposed which incorporate adaptation in the EMD, and analog circuit approaches have beendeveloped for the required functions.

Specifically, we propose the following aims: 1)    \n express several other HIV binding proteins in L. jensenii and from efficacy        \n data, select the optimal protein to carry forward; 2) integrate the ligand         \n expression constructs into the chromosome of L. jensenii, using either selected    \n inducible (e.g. alkaline shock) or strong, constitutive promoters (e.g. PcbsA)     \n to drive expression from a single copy; and 3) develop pilot scale                 \n manufacturing process, including formulation, of these engineered lactobacilli.    \n The successful completion of these proposed Phase II studies will position us for entry into clinical trials, where this novel ViroShield approach will meet     \n its most rigorous evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Aircraft icing is a severe aviation weather hazard as formation of ice on aircraft surfaces leads to degradation in aerodynamic performance. Today, there are limited ice detection systems available that warn pilots of icing, used primarily by the military and airlines due to their high acquisition and certification costs. Innovative Dynamics Inc. will address these issues by developing a low cost windshield infrared (IR) ice detector for the GA fleet. Existing windshield ice detectors consist of a dash mounted red light that is only visible to the flight crew at night when light is reflected from ice accretion on the pilots windshield. The proposed ice detector will operate day and night providing icing conditions information, Outside Air Temperature as well as direct measurement of accumulated ice on the windshield. During Phase I, we will develop a prototype IR ice detector and demonstrate performance in an icing tunnel. During Phase II, we will team with a leading GA manufacturer to develop a flight worthy ice detector for application to windshields of popular commercial Business Jet.",

        "abstract": "We propose a new broadband electromagnetic (EM) sensor, called GEM-5 (Figure 1), to measure the electrical conductivity of the first 5-10 m of Martian in-situ geology. The depth of exploration may increase with a higher transmitter power. While the sensor can be used for exploring other planets and moons, this proposal is directed specifically to a small rover such as the 1997 Sojourner to Mars. The proposed sensor will weigh less than 500 g, and its overall power consumption would be insignificant owing to its low duty cycle, assuming a slow rover speed. The GEM-5 sensing element is new and will be designed to be operated on a small rover. The proposed GEM-5 is designed to be a vertical EM gradiometer. The innovative antenna design calls for a very compact packaging and high spatial resolution for conductivity mapping. To lower the development cost and engineering risk, however, the data processing console will be largely based on its predecessors, GEM-2 and GEM-3, which have been highly successful for commercial geophysical surveys.Referring to desired technologies listed under this NASA SBIR topic: Instruments for Conducting In Situ Scientific Measurements, the proposed sensor can contribute to:+ In situ characterization of planetary subsurface regions+ Subsurface mineralogical compositions of soils, ices, sedimentary rocks, and minerals;+ Geological and environmental understanding, and;+ Electromagnetic and magnetic properties of shallow subsurface.The sensor will have the following specifications suitable for a rover deployment:+ Light (",
