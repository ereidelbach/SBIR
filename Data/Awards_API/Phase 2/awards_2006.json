        "abstract": "As the Army\u2019s current fielded ground combat and combat support systems continue to age, there are increasing performance and reliability issues being encountered by our troops. Vehicles and equipment once designed using the best practices available at the time, can now be better engineered through state-of-the-art computational processing through coupling of engineering, business and maintenance systems. The proposed solution is the development of Enterprise Computational Reliability Software (ERCS) as a revolutionary new business process within the Army and its industrial base that will enable improved readiness forecasting, accelerated product development, and enable a new acquisition mindset for considering reliability forecasts as well as cost bids in vendor selection. Within the conventional engineering environment, the product designer selects the individual components that make up the product system. ERCS accesses component variability information from connected databases and performs many virtual representations of product functioning even considering sales schedules, maintenance strategies and varying usage scenarios. The results are viewed at the design level so that engineering and cost trade studies can be performed before final design while prime contractor and Army leadership monitor design progress to ensure that all objectives are met.",

        "abstract": "The volume and complexity of information available to decision makers by modern information technology presents both unprecedented challenges and great opportunities. Unfortunately, many information technologies intended to assist military decision-makers acquire, filter, manage, and integrate information do not alleviate their information burden; they add to it. To be effective, modern military C2 requires coordinated communication, collaboration, and information exchange among various forces, services, and coalition partners involved. Unfortunately, many information technologies deployed to assist decision makers are unable to understand users' information and knowledge requirements. Consequently, much of the information they provide does not meet the requirements of the tasks being performed. The resulting is delayed delivery and lack of information assimilation, understanding, and decision-making. This project proposes an innovative, intelligent approach to information processing that holds much promise for meeting these challenges, thereby affording new opportunities for improved knowledge management, situation awareness, and decision-making. The final products of this work will be, a functioning prototype iaC tool at C6F running on the secure networks of that facility, and a technical report describing the work conducted, the model, algorithms, system architecture, and displays developed, and appropriate metrics for measuring information flow, speed of command, and anticipated impact of proposed technologies.",

        "abstract": "During Phase I, we experimented with several transition approaches and ran into three hurdles:  1) No matter how good the method for transitioning technology, if the development process has not been well-managed, there will be no technology to transition; 2) Transition does not happen without an incredible amount of expertise and data; 3) Good technology does not matter if no one is aware of its existence; the corollary is that people developing technology need to know requirements. We see the transition of technology in a three-phased process: Macro, Evaluative and Micro.  The Macro phase is determining the overall need, the Evaluative phase is the analysis of technology vis-\u00e0-vis need and the micro phase is the collection of information necessary for decision-making.  We will create a tool that can be used to manage the day-to-day activities of technology development and in doing so capture the necessary data and knowledge upon which transition can be based. Our approach will be to understand the \u201cpatterns of need\u201d of various and potential users of the system.  We will then use this knowledge to evolve management techniques and tools Beacon has been developing for the past 12 years for an integrated and collaborative solution.",

Regardless of the lower cost of commodity COTS hardware components, the program cannot expect to see a decrease in deployment costs if the plan for technology insertion is not carefully considered.  Updating the hardware suite whenever the next generation of COTS hardware becomes available will likely cause integrator thrashing as they try to keep pace with the inflow in products while trying to certify each new system iteration.  A plan must be formed that takes into account the capabilities available in the commercial marketplace, the needs of the system, and the impacts of performing a technology insertion or refresh to each component.

This effort will combine our unique expertise in instrumented-Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) with new approaches in intermetallic design to develop a new generation of cost-efficient, high strength and reactive composites.  The proposed material system will have a blend of three elemental powders, consisting of two highly reactive materials interspersed with a reactive \u201cbinder\u201d material.  The existence of three different powders will allow for tailoring of the mechanical and reactive properties of the composite by varying the volume fraction of each element, and its particle size.

The fully dense compact was reactive and had good mechanical properties.

The main principle of detection, as distinct from other luminescent chemical sensors, is based on the emission quenching of sensory polymers entrapped into mesoporous photonic crystal (or microcavity).  The unique nanodevice structure will provide a large interfacial surface between the sensory material and the analytes leading to the highest sensitivity, which is critical for rapid detection (dwell time is on the order of seconds) of low vapor pressure chemicals, like explosives.  In Phase I we performed a feasibility study and proved the proposed concept by demonstrating that emission quenching is accompanied by a spectral shift when sensory polymers entrapped in the unique microcavities. This novel effect is critical to the development of sensor arrays possessing high selectivity and sensitivity to explosive vapors.    In Phase II the demonstrated new technology will be further developed and optimized to fabricate a prototype sensor array for Army missions and commercial applications. A sensor array will be placed on the tip of the lightweight telescopic probe/console (length up to 20 m and longer) which can be mounted to a HMMWV or other armor vehicles.

        "abstract": "Face-to-face communication between crew members launching and recovering aircraft on a carrier deck is impaired by the high-noise environment.  High-noise levels also mask the various audio cues that provide situational awareness.  Effective communication and good situational awareness are keys to safe and efficient operations.  Creare proposes a Talk Through Noise (TTN) system that will improve face-to-face communications while maintaining the audio cues necessary for situational awareness without degrading crew members\u2019 hearing protection.  The system also includes a module for speech enhancement that enables communication in very high noise (greater than 110 dBA), and an integrated dosimetry capability that will allow crew chiefs to effectively manage the exposure of their crews.  In Phase I, we proved the feasibility of our concept through evaluations of potential system components, integration of selected components into prototype systems, and tests to demonstrate the performance of these systems.  In Phase II, we will further develop the system before integrating it with the Navy Deck Crew Advanced Helmet System being developed on another Navy project. We will then test the system in our laboratory and in the field.  At the conclusion of the project, we will have transitioned the technology into a production-ready system.",

The proposed work will utilize mission requirements, component health states, and available models to develop a plug-and-play software module that can be used to assess system mission readiness in real-time. The development will include algorithms to account for subsystem and system-level interactions and relate independent subsystem health indicators to overall system readiness. Prognostics will also be included to predict future readiness levels for specific missions. This information will ultimately be utilized for decision support of Navy ship systems. Specifically, the core innovations of the proposed project include: 1) the use of gray-scale health to assess mission readiness; 2) fusion of multiple independent health state indicators to determine overall system health; 3) development of a prognostics approach that accounts for the effects of fault propagation between interconnected subsystems by defining propagation paths and adjusting failure rates accordingly; and 4) application of reinforcement learning techniques to provide automated improvement in future health state and system readiness predictions.",

The current 450VAC VSD technologies employed by these various projects require the use of large and heavy input transformers to reduce the harmonic noise generated by the VSD.  In most cases it is the input transformer requirement, which prohibits the use of the VSD, due to shipboard space and weight restrictions.  The Advanced Variable Speed Drive (AVSD) project will develop a multi-level PWM inverter system for use on 450 Volt applications to eliminate input harmonics and reduce EMI noise generation to within the limitations of Mil-Std- 461.

Current high resolution spectrometers require operating temperatures at liquid nitrogen levels and are highly expensive to maintain, and other spectrometers which operate at room temperatures do not afford the resolution required to distinguish and identify many radioisotopes of interest. Further, many devices are subject to acoustic interferences which significantly degrade their performance in field operations. Thus, there is a need for a rugged, self-contained, high resolution gamma ray spectrometer which is both portable and field-deployable. High pressure Xenon gas will be used as a spectroscopic medium for building a portable, room temperature, high resolution gamma ray spectrometer. An innovative method of incorporating a reflective coating inside the detector will be developed so VUV scintillation light emission from the Xenon gas can be used to correct for geometric signal dispersion in the detector, producing a spectroscopic resolution approaching 0.45% at 662 keV in a device with high immunity to acoustic effects. At the end of the project, a full-scale, rugged, portable, self-contained, high pressure, and high resolution Xenon spectrometer will be available for testing in field operations.",

System design incorporates low-loss power conversion and management that maximizes power delivery efficiency and improves specific energy density. Solid-state components perform transformer operations during charge to deliver a constant voltage to the airship systems while delivering excess photovoltaic power to charge the system. A low-loss mechanical transfer switch allows the unitized fuel cell (UFC) to provide power to the airship systems at near-100% efficiency during discharge. Passive water separation components manage water content within the UFC and the gas streams to and from light-weight H2 and O2 storage tanks. A thermal management subsystem uses high-efficiency heat exchange components to remove water vapor from gas streams, heat and humidify incoming UFC gases, and minimize RES thermal emissions to internal airship volume.

This will create the path forward to production.  This logic will result in a strong business case down stream.  The hybrid enclosure uses a hybrid of high thermal conductivity graphite fibers/foams, metallic materials, and novel EMI shielding coatings.   Phase 2 will carry forward the Phase 1 innovations and advancements of low cost, high thermal performance, lightweight composite components that demonstrate very high levels of EMI shielding effectiveness over a broad range of frequency spectra. Weight and cost reduction is a driving parameter and is fundamental for promoting composite materials for this application.  To complete the package and satisfy the near term \u201csystem-needs\u201d, the coating will be low cost, low risk, and have very high EMI shielding performance.  EMI shielding and ESD grounding performance is expected to meet or exceed the current baseline aluminum enclosure performance.  MII will deliver qualification hardware in Phase 2 which will create the technical foundation and business strategy to enable commercialization in Phase 3.",

During Phase I METSS demonstrated that existing materials can be combined in a multi-layer structure to produce a fuel tank that is stable to the JP-8 fuel and will self-seal upon impact from a 0.50 caliber projectile. Under the Phase II program, METSS will demonstrate the effectiveness of this design by constructing a prototype tank of lightweight polymeric materials that provides chemical stability, dimensional stability, low weight, impact toughness, and the ability to seal itself when punctured. The key feature of this design will be the use of a self-sealing plastic exterior layer that reduces he performance demands on a self-sealing rubber layer which will be contained in the core of the tank construction. Additional ballistic resistance will be added to the tank via fibrous reinforcing layers. The self-sealing capability will be enhanced to seal against a 14.5 mm projectile by increasing the expansion capability of the rubber that expands on contact with JP-8. Moreover, placement of that self-sealing layer within the walls of the fuel tank will further improve its sealing capability by directing the swell of the rubber into the puncture site. METSS will show that all of this can be accomplished at a reasonable cost, using existing process technology.",

Its before- and at-mission time reconfigurability (software defined frequency and modulation up to 10GHz) allows the system to adapt to a dynamic environment, and find sufficient application to make the development of an ASIC economically feasible.

The main objective of the innovative research proposed by Thaerocomp Technical Corporation (TTC) is to develop predictive computational models and a software tool for large-scale turbulence noise in high-speed jets, with fidelity and computational expense suited for engineering applications. This supports a broader objective to develop new concepts for jet noise suppression based on modification and control of large-scale turbulence. The capability of relatively coarse unsteady simulations will be assessed with a focus on the ability to capture, with sufficient accuracy, the relevant features of the large-scale turbulence noise sources controlling the spectral peak at aft angles. The effect of nozzle design modifications on those sources and, hence, noise reduction could then be screened for highly three-dimensional designs such as lobed nozzles. These assessments will be based on comparisons with far field sound, as well as near-field pressure signatures of large-scale turbulence structures, constituting the source sound. Achieving this objective will establish TTC LES methodology as a practical engineering tool addressing peak-frequency, aft-angle noise radiation from large-scale turbulence. This complements the TTC RANS-based methodology for fine-scale turbulence noise developed under Phase I.",

        "abstract": "The goal of the Acuity Wing and Bomb Bay Launched UAV Phase II program is demonstration of the feasibility and utility of an air vehicle organic to the P3 through development and flight testing of a prototype aircraft. Minimum objectives are runway takeoff, autonomous flight directed by a ground or air based control station through multiple waypoints over a radius of 10 miles or more, live video and buffered still image transmission to the control station, and vector to a landing site with autonomous landing via TCDL compatible datalinks. Nominal objectives are demonstration of the same capabilities when carried aloft externally and launched from a P3 or other aircraft in flight, and control and data communication at ranges up to 150 miles. Additional objectives are integration of UAV control and data presentation functions with a STANAG 4586-compliant MURC-based control station, in conjunction with Defense Technologies Inc, and performance of a representative mission task such as autonomous deployment of one or more sonobuoys.    Acuity Technologies will design, build and demonstrate through flight testing a prototype WBBL UAV, designated AT-3.. To the extent practicable, the AT-3 will be designed to facilitate rapid transition to an operational system in the future. The technology development focus for this program is aircraft development and creation of an air system including the execution of a representative mission which demonstrates the feasibility and potential of the organic UAV. New airframe and propulsion technology and interoperability with the P3 and STANAG-compliant control stations are the development foci of this program. Currently available subsystems for the engine, avionics, communications, and control station will be incorporated.",

        "abstract": "Internal Combustion engines (IC) are bound in their ability to create power primarily by the volume of air an engine is able to deliver to the combustion chamber.  This formula has particular import at high altitude, where air pressure decreases, resulting in a correlative power loss.  Traditional solutions for generating higher compensating air pressure are limited to external add-on devices such as turbochargers and superchargers. These external devices carry penalties with regard to complexity, fuel inefficiency, weight, reliability, and cost. We propose a means of generating pre-compression and continuously constant boost to maintain engine power at high altitude.  Our proposal utilizes an internal engine chamber which would automatically calibrate and compensate for lapse rate at all altitudes, without added weight, complexity, size or cost. It can be expected that this approach to altitude compensation would significantly increase the payload and range of UAVs over traditional turbo and supercharged solutions.  In Phase II, we expect to employ 3D CFD/FEA and construction of an optimized test engine to validate the internal altitude compensation/ pre-compression chamber.  These two interrelated components will produce the ability to supply a constantly optimal and massive boost to any aircraft without penalty as regards weight, size, cost or complexity.",

In Phase I POC proved the feasibility of the POLYGLAS concept by theoretical and experimental demonstrations.  The direct modulation of light and use of a flexible polymer waveguide display has unique advantages over current flexible displays in terms of size, power, resolution, color, grayscale, dynamic range, and refresh rate.  The Phase I prototype has an active area of 2 in. square, with up to 10,000 100-micron pixels.  In Phase II POC will optimize the design and fabricate POLYGLAS display prototypes in two configurations--one 3 in. square for individual use (on soldiers\u2019 uniforms) and the other 12 in. square (scalable to 24 in. square or larger) for attachment to shelter fabric.",

Preliminary lab tests have demonstrated significant reduction of track-induced noise and vibration, which will lead to improved ride quality for troops and crew, improved reliability of on-board equipment, and reduced maintenance costs. In addition, the new hybrid track concept eliminates traditional track backing pads, and incorporates a replaceable track backing surface. This innovative feature allows the ground pads and backing surface to be refurbished multiple times through the life of the vehicle, thus greatly increasing the durability life of the track. This ability to refurbish the track will allow significant O&S cost savings over the life of the vehicle, as opposed to the current situation where premature wear of certain components requires that the entire track is scrapped. Besides the direct cost savings from a longer life track, an improved track system will afford additional intangible cost savings. Reduced noise and vibration levels will lead to improved equipment reliability, reduced vehicle maintenance, reduced logistics, and reduced maintenance manpower burden.",

        "abstract": "Missiles of today are electronic intensive: control systems, navigation systems, and targeting systems all have components on-board the missile.  These systems require a power source that is capable of delivering large amounts of power throughout flight of the missile.  The power source must be capable of being stored for decades without loss of power or performance while being reliably activated within milliseconds. Currently, thermal batteries are widely used to achieve these objectives. Thermal batteries are stored with the electrolyte in a solid state; preventing chemical reactivity and leakage as is common with wet electrolytic batteries.  To activate the thermal batteries, igniters are electrically charged causing hot embers to shoot out into the core of the battery.  These embers ignite flammable material causing the electrolyte to activate the battery. The reliability of the igniters determines whether or not the battery is activated to power the missile targeting, navigation, and control systems.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of relatively simple thin film igniters that are fabricated using low cost PVD processing.  During phase II, the thin film design and process will be optimized, a FEA Predictive Model will be completed, and a Prototype Production System will be developed and demonstrated.",

Silicon carbide (SiC) fibers provide a potentially attractive reinforcement for HT PMCs for applications ranging from propulsion systems to structures for the orbiting space plane.  The sizings routinely added to commercial SiC fibers are not compatible with the new HT matrix resins.  The result is that the thermo-oxidative stability (TOS) and mechanical properties of composites made with such fibers are compromised.  A need exists for a SiC fiber adhesion promoting finish that is compatible with high-temperature bismaleimide (BMI) and polyimide (PI) chemistries.  Previous work at Adherent Technologies, Inc. has revealed chemistries that chemically bond to fiber surfaces and high-temperature curing matrix resins.  Composites fabricated with finishes based on reactive coupling agent chemistries show substantially higher interface-dependent properties, TOS, and moisture resistance.  Those chemistries will be modified to function with the SiC fiber surface and BMI and AFR-PE-4 PI moieties during cure.

        "abstract": "The Modular Mission Planning Toolkit (MMPT) will support multiple autonomous undersea vehicles (AUVs), multiple environmental databases, and multiple warfare scenarios. The toolkit provides a plug-in modular framework to facilitate the creation of planning mission scenarios and will be able to support environmental condition display, asset availability and condition tracking, route planning, multiple vehicle cooperation, marine mammal operation support, undersea communications system planning, or mission de-conflicting between heterogeneous vehicles.  Using a shared database for information, mission plans, and vehicle parameters, multiple plug-ins can access the same data.  The time slider component of the GUI allows the user to adjust time into the past or the future.  This allows one to view historical mission data and preview future mission plans.  The capabilities created during the Phase I project have greatly improved the process of planning an AUV mission.  By seeing the effect of the forecasted environmental data on the mission plan, a user can visually see the predicted AUV track.  This has greatly reduced the time, effort, error, and improved the reliability of common AUV planning.  The results of this project will have applications not only in the Department of Defense mission planning, but in the research and commercial world as well.   BENEFITS: The Modular Mission Planning Toolkit will have broad applications across all users of Autonomous Undersea Vehicles (AUVs).  As AUVs become prevalent, it will be imperative that missions be planned with the best environmental data available.  Additional concerns are the coordination of multiple AUVs, and the retrieval of environmental data from deployed AUVs back into environmental models.  Finally, the AUV user community is growing to include NOAA, NSF, and NASA.  The flexible nature of the MMPT design addresses all these concerns.

This nosecone assembly will be designed to operate in the launch, fly-out and deployment environments representative of the KEI flight trajectory and deployment conditions consisting of dynamic pressure and aerodynamic heating.  The Phase II design development effort will address design analyses and component performance considerations for the purpose of developing a successful nosecone design.  This follow-on program provides a sequential development approach to achieve both near-term KEI booster flight demonstration needs as well as the need for advanced capability component systems that increase mission assuredness.   For the Phase I program, appropriate component technologies were addressed to conceptualize an interceptor nosecone that will operate at high velocity and feature a non-ablating thermal protection system that complies with thermal performance requirements.  The Phase II effort will complete the detailed design, specification and component verification of the interceptor nosecone assembly.  During the Phase II effort, final assembly design activities, detailed thermal and structural analyses, material/component development activities, and assembly performance verification will be conducted.",

        "abstract": "SeaLandAire recognizes the importance of deploying a gateway buoy for long term communications relay in areas where mooring is not desirable.  Such a system must overcome the dual difficulties of station keeping and energy harvesting to successfully achieve military utility.  This system must also be tactically viable in that it must be deployable from a variety of platforms. Extended system life introduces the problem of buoy drift and necessitates an autonomous, mobile system to station keep, which requires significantly more power than can be stored in the buoy.  To supplement the stored power, our system extracts energy from the surrounding environment.  Global variations between deployment environments, combined with the extended mission life, require our system to efficiently harvest or harness energy from as many sources as possible. Phase I demonstrated that our concept has the potential of meeting all technical objectives. Our concept will harvest energy from solar radiation and vertical wave motion and will harness energy from both the vertical and horizontal components of wave motion.  A navigational and power management system, coordinated by an innovative Learning Adaptive Control algorithm, enables our system to efficiently use the harvested and harnessed energy to station keep against the local drift-causing forces.    BENEFITS: The technologies being investigated in this SBIR program are significant in that they are marketable on two levels.  On the system level, the station keeping, energy scavenging, and gatekeeper communication functions are all applicable to many applications. The technology is also marketable on the product level as well. Both the thruster and actuator technologies are key to the successful proliferation of ASV and AUV\u2019s.  We are at the beginning of transforming existing technology to meet the needs of all the potential customers that use ASV\u2019s and AUV\u2019s.  We are at the leading edge of what could be a significant market.  Potential customers for the systems being developed are the PMA-264 ASW group, SPAWAR, NAVAIR, the department of homeland security, NOAA and others.  Customers for the products include anyone that uses AUV\u2019s or ASV\u2019s. Either would benefit from our innovative and efficient thrusters, actuators, marine solar panels, and other energy harvesting technology.  Over the next few years we will create product data sheets and distribute the data at all the conventions and workshops we attend every year.  As we gain insight into the full market potential we will develop plans for production based on projected build quantities.",

        "abstract": "There is a need to increase load capacity of joints in Navy ships using fiber reinforced composite sandwich construction.  The strength of most joints currently used is limited by the relatively low interlaminar properties of the composite materials being joined.  The innovative T-Joints being developed and demonstrated by Materials Sciences Corporation under this SBIR program have the potential to increase the load capacity of the joints without increasing weight or cost.  The concept, demonstrated via testing under the Phase I program, leads to a more direct conversion of panel axial and bending loads into core shear and also facilitates joining of panels constructed from dissimilar composite materials. The primary objective of the Phase II program is to reduce the risk (technical and cost) of inserting innovative, low-cost, structurally efficient composite sandwich T Joints into U.S. Navy ships such as DD(X).  Technical risk will be reduced by conducting a significant number of laboratory tests and large-scale demonstration tests on T-Joints assembled in a shipyard environment.  Programmatic risk will be reduced by incorporating feedback from the full-scale assembly exercise into T-Joint design details and by compiling manufacturing cost and schedule data accumulated under the Phase II award.",

Engine hardware will be coated with tribological and thermal barrier coatings to reduce the friction and wear between the rotating and sliding engine parts, and to reduce the heat rejection to the coolant.  Engine tests will be run to assess engine performance, and engine endurance.   From recent R&D work, mathematical based virtual computer models developed between Adiabatics the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the National Transport University will be used in this program to determine optimum design parameters.

Results of this work and future engineering will be the development of dual use HPD, LSHR diesel technologies to a state readily adaptable to multi-cylinder engines of 50 to 600 hp; delivery of two developed AMDE demonstrators suitable for Phase III production prototyping as competitive alternatives to conventional diesels, specifically targeting selected FCS applications; and the companion hybrid electric drive propulsion concept engineering.",

Mesoscopic Devices has developed a continuous, self-regenerating desulfurization system called the Rapid Cycle Desulfurizer\u2122.  This system processes military logistics fuel, producing an ultra-low-sulfur liquid product for fuel cell applications.  With a liquid fuel product, this system can support any fuel cell or reformer technology, providing the broadest insertion of fuel cells into military systems.  The desulfurizer can operate autonomously, which enables stand alone operation to support multiple distributed fuel cell generators and also greatly simplifies integration with all types of fuel cell generators as an on-board desulfurizer.  This system independence also provides capacitance to support rapid start up and load following.   Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of this system, which can treat high sulfur military fuels to fuel cell standards while utilizing the sulfur sorbents more efficiently than conventional fixed bed approaches.  The Rapid Cycle Desulfurizer exploits three key innovations: 1) regenerable sulfur sorbents for liquid fuels, 2) a highly optimized bed arrangement, and 3) a simple and reliable device for switching the beds from desulfurization to regeneration modes.  In the proposed Phase II program, Mesoscopic Devices will optimize components of the Rapid Cycle Desulfurizer with improved thermal integration and incorporating recent advances in sorbent materials.

        "abstract": "Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) has fabricated two electrochromic (EC) devices during a Phase I SBIR program. Several EC infrared reflectors were fabricated using electroactive polymers and a series of EC infrared beam combiners were constructed using tungsten oxide (WO3) thin films. These devices switched between states in as little as 1 second with contrasts of up to 60% reflection. A proposed Phase II program will extend the Phase I results to develop a fully functional EC beam combiner system for integration with a 20 K Space Simulation Test chamber at Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC). The beam combiner is planned to operate with bandpass of from 5 to 15 microns and contrast from 50/50 to 90/10 transmission. Total switching time between states, including any device heating and cooling required, will take less than 24 hours. System demonstrations at the 50% and 85% build level will be performed for the AEDC staff. The complete system, including PC interface, control software and EC device hardware, will be delivered at the end of the Phase II program. Phase III opportunities will be promoted through the use of scientific publications and presentations to the appropriate audience.",

        "abstract": "The Phase I research has established the feasibility of achieving substantial reductions in the dynamic response of wind tunnel sting mounts using passive damping techniques.  Of the three principal passive damping concepts evaluated, the Hub Damper Unit (HDU) concept was determined to be the most suitable, and further development of this is planned in the Phase II research program.  The primary selection factors were the need for general application to a variety of existing stings at AEDC and the avoidance of flow disturbance near the model.  Extended theoretical modeling will be carried out to ensure that optimum levels of damping are achieved, targeting a 40 dB reduction in amplitude of the fundamental vibration mode.  A test unit will be designed, constructed and tested for static and dynamic characteristics, ultimately in an AEDC wind tunnel environment.  The second preferred concept is cocured visco-elastic material (VEM) in a new-build composite sting design, for which extended theoretical evaluation will be conducted to determine optimum performance, but no practical tests are planned within Phase II.  The Phase II program will continue development of the product specification and will provide detailed documentation of the design process for general application to future HDU and VEM stings.",

In Phase I, we demonstrated successful inactivation of 6 log10 of both G. stearothermophilus spores and B. atrophaeus spores using a bench-scale prototype sterilization canister.  Commercially available sterilization validation indicator strips were identified and used and preliminary engineering drawings of the Phase II deliverable were prepared. In Phase II, we will assemble and deliver a deployable prototype sterilization system optimized for performance, size, weight, and ruggedness in accordance with feedback from the COTR.  The workplan was developed in accordance with the FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements to facilitate the transition of an FDA-approved technology to the DOD.  The Phase II team consists of experts in heat transfer and thermodynamics, virtual manufacturing and simulation, and FDA regulatory submission requirements.

        "abstract": "A key component of the Navy fuel cell system is the reformer, which converts diesel fuel into methane for consumption by the fuel cell. Reaction temperatures are critical to proper function of the reformer. Reaction temperatures are currently regulated by valves in the process gas streams. These valves require power, consume space, increase pressure drop, and are hindering tight integration and packaging of the reformer. In addition, these valves are prone to failure at elevated temperatures. Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) has proposed a variable conductance heat pipe (VCHP) heat exchanger to provide a passive, valve-less means of regulating process gas temperatures in reformers for fuel cells. The VCHP-based system has the potential to provide nearly constant reformer temperatures despite wide changes in gas flow rate while needing no additional components or control systems and without limiting packaging options for the reformer. In Phase I, ACT successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed technology through analysis and subscale hardware testing. In Phase II, the goal is to fully characterize and evaluate the use of VCHPs in heat exchangers to control gas temperatures, culminating in building a 4kW VCHP heat exchanger for use in a 50kW fuel cell system.",

        "abstract": "Power generation at remote locations is increasingly important in providing support for logistic and combat operations. The traditional genset driven by a diesel engine, however, is bulky, not highly efficient, and requires non-trivial maintenance. In addition, the power quality that these traditional gensets supply is not sufficient for many field applications. Thus, a compact, yet high efficiency auxiliary power generation system (APGS) integral to the tracked or wheeled military vehicle, at the 4 kW power level, is an essential new component to aid the warfighter. This advanced generator and power control unit makes use of direct-cooled lamination permanent magnet motor technology and a proprietary interphase transformer technique using sub-phases controlled by a digital signal processor. The flexibility of power output of 24VDC, 270VDC, and 120VAC, makes this device especially valuable for a number of field applications. The proposed Phase II effort will develop an advanced on-board (APGS) that will have a higher efficiency, lower harmonic distortion, lower electromagnetic interference, in addition to the greatly lower volume and weight advantages when compared to current generators. AeroVironment will build on our Phase I work, which demonstrated feasibility, and tackle these challenges using our extensive generator, inverter, and digital control experience.",

        "abstract": "Oberon proposes to use the results of the Phase I investigation to develop the methodology and technology to achieve EMCON emissions capability, substantially using current and emerging standards compliant wireless LAN devices. The method proposed is called the asymmetric power plan or APP. The APP presumes the largest contributor to EMCON emissions will be the multiplicity of client devices, which add logarithmically to the spatial power density at 1 nautical mile. To use the APP, an Active Access Point Diversity Antenna (AADA) needs to be developed. The AADA is envisioned as a device which can be added to any commercial, standards compliant access point. The desirable result of the APP and the AADA (reduced transmit power required) can be enhanced by using a multi-beam, multi-channel AADA, and a Multi-Input, Multi-output (MIMO) AADA. Additionally, software drivers and suitable client antennas must be developed to engage the low power level at the client device required by the APP. Finally, a software module is proposed to work within the emerging 802.11h standard for adaptive power control. This module is expected to be able to actively monitor and control emissions for EMCON compliance. In the Phase II option, Oberon proposes to test these technologies for EMCON compliance in a facility which would be representative of the end-use facility, using a multiplicity of APs and wireless client devices",

        "abstract": "A low-cost, high performance thin-film oxygen and moisture permeation barrier remains a critical issue to be solved for the successful development and commercialization of flexible OLED displays. In this proposal our project team at Universal Display Corporation (UDC) and Princeton University plan to develop a novel technology by which alternating layers of polymerized hexamethyl disiloxane (PHMDSO) and silicon oxide SiOx or silicon oxycarbide (SiO\u00acxCy) films are deposited in a single chamber plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system. This multilayer barrier film will demonstrate excellent optical transmission and barrier performance comparable to the state-of-the-art conventional OLED encapsulation technology such as desiccant loaded glass/metal epoxy seal. Our goal is to apply this multilayer encapsulation technology to our low power consumption phosphorescent OLED (PHOLED) technology to enable the low cost manufacture of flexible AMOLED displays on either plastic or metal foil substrates. Improved flexibility will be achieved by minimizing the overall built-in stress by controlling the growth conditions for the alternating polymer and inorganic layers such that the compressive and tensile stress in the adjacent layers can be compensated.  The compatibility of the barrier film with thin-film transistor (TFT) back plane processes will also be investigated.",

Development of a vaccine is critical to reducing mortality and morbidity.  BioTraces, Inc. applied its proprietary detection method called Multi-Photon Detection (MPD) to measuring protein levels and developed two types of super-sensitive immunoassays, IA/MPD and Super-ELISA. These assays have about one hundred-fold higher sensitivity than prior art protein quantitation methods.  In Phase I, we developed assays for several cytokines and measured the levels of several cytokines in serum from children with Serve Malarial Anemia or Cerebral Malaria.  We applied proprietary methods of analysis to these measurements and could distinguish the two forms by their associated immunoprofiles. Using seven biomarkers, mostly cytokines, a perfect separability of these two conditions was achieved.  In Phase II, P-chips/MPD will be developed to perform a complete immunoprofile from a single blood sample thus increasing the throughput and reliability of the diagnosis.  Further studies of immune profiles in severe malaria anemia and cerebral malaria will be performed and the effects of malaria vaccines on the Immune system will be studied.",

The MEADoWS system builds on Mayflower\u2019s proven technology in MIMO antenna signal processing. The soldier\u2019s requirements in future wireless mobile communication systems are very demanding on Size, Weight, and Power (SWAP); the power (energy) is the most critical of the three, as it often determines the size and weight. The proposed MEADoWS system innovations directly address this critical need for power reduction in soldiers\u2019 radio by means of an energy-efficient MIMO physical layer, a cognitive MAC layer, and a collaborative network layer. The energy-efficient physical, MAC, and network layers of the MEADoWS system target different sources of energy consumption, leading to significant gains in energy-efficiency. The Phase I feasibility study demonstrated that MEADoWS meets the Army objectives of energy efficiency and applicability to JTRS Cluster 5. In the Phase II program, we will build a prototype MEADoWS and demonstrate its functionality in a test bed, with multiple MEADoWS units participating in the demonstration. In Phase III, we plan to insert the MEADoWS technology in the JTRS Cluster 5 soldier radio working together with General Dynamics- the Army prime contractor for JTRS Cluster 5.",

Attributes include real-time measurement response, no sample preparation, high sensitivity, and the ability to detect signatures from chem/bio agents, explosives, toxic compounds and other hazardous materials. The Phase I SBIR proposal tested a new paradigm for LIBS, by using high repetition-rate, low energy laser pulses to enhance the LIBS plasma intensity. The effort theoretically and experimentally demonstrated this enhancement concept, with new supporting research showing significant intensity and plasma lifetime enhancements. Importantly, this enhancement approach was all optical (no additional power supplies to support secondary plasmas).  Intensified gated detection was not required. The new approach allows new opportunities for LIBS applications including enhanced sensitivity, enhanced standoff capabilities, and continuous emission monitoring. The Phase II effort will thoroughly investigate and develop this new approach for LIBS, and produce design requirements for a new LIBS instrument to be commercialized in Phase III. The Phase II effort will emphasize analysis of several sample materials of military interest. Such a system will be of immediate use to the Army for applications in force protection and homeland security.",

At the Emergency Departments of the Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals of Cleveland, ER patients who are deemed as needing emergency neurological/EEG examination will be tested by this portable device, in addition to a conventional EEG recording.

Filters will be tested for leakage (structural integrity) and air-flow restriction when vehicles are serviced.  Serviceable filters will be kept in service, saving money and landfill space.  At any time (including when brand new), filters may start leaking dust and dirt, causing excessive engine wear.  Those defective filters will be detected.  Our machine will test each filter up to its maximum rated air flow.  We will feed calibrated test dust upstream and count leaked particles downstream with a laser particle counter.  A manometer will measure pressure drop.  Sensors will transmit data to a computer where fractional filter efficiencies (dust leakage) and pressure drops (restriction) are calculated to reveal defective filters.  Anyone using cleaned filters will have increased confidence in the tested filter\u2019s quality.  Accumulated data will answer questions like \"how many times can a filter be cleaned\" and \"how many hours of pulse-jet cleaning can an M1 Vee-Pac filter take before media separation begins?\"  This testing can be easily and inexpensively performed in a shop setting.  There will be substantial savings on filter replacement costs.  Acquired data will aid filter management and allow comparison of brands.",

The casing can be metal, plastic, or wood. These characteristics make landmine detection challenging. In Phase I, we have developed new methods that improve the performance of both surface and buried mine detection. Extensive tests using actual MWIR images have shown extremely promising results. In Phase II, we will conduct further tests using additional ASTAMIDS data sets. Algorithms developed in Phase I will be further improved, which include an innovative image enhancement algorithm, new buried mine classifiers, better contour extraction method, and LMI based soft fusion. The improved system will be further adapted for IED detection through discriminating buried command wires using IR images collected at the field. We will also develop a commercial product for natural gas pipeline leak detection. Our Phase II prototype system is a combination of both software and hardware with various I/O interfaces to imaging sensors and existing ASTAMIDS systems. All algorithms will be implemented in C/C++ and a sophisticated graphical user interface will be developed in Microsoft VB.NET.

This technology consists of battery powered data rich (128k) RFID tags operating at unlicensed short-range commercial frequencies and a supporting infrastructure of interrogating antennas and handheld readers at hundreds of logistic nodes worldwide. The Assistant Secretary of Defense, Networks and Information Integration (ASD NII) has stated the intent to require encryption between RFID tags and reader/interrogators. In addition, requirements may be imposed for \u201cdata at rest\u201d (data stored on the RFID tags) to be encrypted.  In the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Contract W9QUZ-6-002, Eigent conducted a technology feasibility study and considered alternative strategies for the actual encryption and decryption of data as stored on RFID tags, transmitted at all write stations and at all reading transportation nodes. This research demonstrated that a combination of hardware and software techniques in a \u201cdefense in depth\u201d architecture can be implemented to secure data both when stored on the RFID tags and when transmitted between the tags and readers. The Eigent Phase II proposal builds on this successful Phase I research. The Phase II goal is to demonstrate the Phase I functionality of this architecture in prototype RFID transponder(s) and reader infrastructure equipment as well as in possible add-on modules to existing industry reader infrastructure equipment, chosen and supplied by the US Army. Both stand alone prototypes and possible add-on modules will be tested in the laboratory, at Eigent facilities and in requested local DoD facilities. Field tests in DoD facilities will assist Eigent in building more easily implemented and integrated Phase III product for the DoD through PM J-AIT.",

The more electric aircraft philosophy has put a strain on electrical systems, and has exhausted their growth potential. Replacing the generator on an existing engine/gearbox poses a challenge because of weight, overhung moment, and space limits. Therefore, most likely the only solution to these issues is to provide a generator with more power that meets the original requirements. In simpler terms a generator with higher Power Density is desirable. Improved stress, thermal and rotor dynamic software packages allow the designer to optimize the mechanical design and minimize weight with no sacrifice in component integrity. Furthermore, improvements in production equipment make thin walled housings affordable which are significantly lighter than castings with thicker walls due the inherent porosity of the cast material.

The objective of this Phase II development is to build a prototype infrared camera for use in Army applications such as rocket propelled grenade and sniper detection. The camera will have selectable wavelength band detection capability and provide resolution of 320 x 240 or more pixels with a pixel pitch size less than 50 \u00b5m providing 12.4 \u00b0 x 9.3 \u00b0 field of view.  The camera NETD will be less than 150 mK in the 3-5 \u00b5m band using f/1 optics and 60 Hz camera frame rates.  Multiple camera operating modes will provide pixel binning, electronic zoom, 30-120 Hz frame rates, and image windowing resulting in a high performance camera with excellent flexibility to support a wide range of applications. The camera will provide non-uniformity corrected and histogram compressed digital outputs.",

        "abstract": "There are a number of potential commercial and military applications for the development of a compact, multispectral imager in the LWIR. Several nerve agents and other aerosols of commercial interest show strong absorption features in the infrared. Additional applications include aerosol characterization, target detection, and counter-measure rejection for military and commercial customers. However, multispectral sensors in the infrared, and in particular in the long wave infrared (8 \u2013 12 microns) are typically research instruments that are very expensieve. This proposal describes the development of a sensor that will address this need for a relatively low-cost and yet robust multi-spectral sensor for the infrared. The proposed effort extends work performed under the Phase I SBIR that developed an architecture suitable for infrared multispectral imaging. The basic instrument architecture was matured in a separate, prior SBIR effort for infrared polarimetric imaging. In this effort, we will use the same, mature architecture to develop a multi-spectral imaging capability. Furthermore, the multispectral sensor will operate over a different part of the infrared spectrum.",

This project will benefit from past and concurrent projects that have already solved many of the most challenging aspects of building the proposed hardware, and have produced products that our company already sells to perform functions 2, 3, and 4 above. Thus the proposed program is of unusually low risk and benefits from tremendous synergy with past and ongoing projects.

        "abstract": "ORBITEC proposes to develop a unique Advanced Vortex Hybrid Rocket Engine (AVHRE) to achieve a safe, highly-reliable, low-cost and uniquely versatile propulsion system.  The benefits of AVHRE result from the combination of four innovations: (1) the patented vortex injection technique which generates a coaxial vortex pair, driving high solid-fuel regression rates and improved combustion efficiency; (2) high-regression rate paraffin solid fuels; (3) patented regression sensor technology, and (4) a new fuel formulation innovation to control the solid fuel regression characteristics and provide improved structural integrity of the grain. These innovations simplify hybrid rocket design, development, and manufacture both inherently and by providing many practical design degrees of freedom that can be harnessed for a given application.  Specific benefits of the AVHRE technology include: (1) increased propellant mass fractions; (2) the ability to tailor and optimize a hybrid propulsion system for a given application; (3) increased ISP efficiency; (4) a reduction or elimination of residual fuel; (5) improved grain structural integrity and increased thermal properties; and (6) reduced need for thermal insulation.  The Phase II effort will focus on developing and testing a tactical-scale AVHRE chamber, developing a suite of practical AVHRE engineering design tools, and designing a larger-size, strategic-scale AVHRE propulsion system for Phase III development and testing.",

This requires development and protection design and validation concepts against the presently known aspects of the atmospheric electrical environments for PV arrays, the hull, and associated HAA systems while in climb/descend as well as station-keeping modes. This SBIR will also Identify tools for forecasting and nowcasting of weather conditions known to be conducive to lightning and electric charge formation at altitudes from ground to the cloud tops (i.e. 0-45,000 ft.) that may be applicable to HAAs seeking to avoid encounters with severe cloud-to-earth lightning strikes and other atmospheric electrical environments during climb and descend phases.

However, the major technical challenge in the implementation of PEM fuel cells is a suitable hydrogen source.  Fuel processors based on hydrolysis of chemical hydrides provide a safe hydrogen source when low noise, low thermal signature and rapid start-up under low footprint conditions is required.   Sodium Borohydride based Hydrogen on Demand\u00ae (HOD\u2122) fuel processors offer special logistics advantages when operated with impure field water.  Based on the feasibility results established in Phase I, we will develop a water management module that will facilitate operation of the HOD system with impure field water.

If slingloads could be picked up without the need for a ground crew, lives could be saved.  In addition, a sensor that can detect the location of a load would help in low visibility conditions.  We propose to develop such a system.  It will include the mechanical structures necessary for unscrewed operation and automatic electrical grounding of the helicopter, the sensors for locating the loads, and integration in both the helicopter technical systems and operational procedures for acquiring external loads.  In this approach, the ground crew will only set the load in place, and ensure the latching mechanism is properly deployed.  Our baseline approach is to accommodate existing helicopter hook and sling/clevis technologies, by adding non-load bearing hardware to guide the clevis into the hook.  For sensors, use an RF based technology for rough load location through whiteout/brownout conditions, and an optical system for terminal guidance.",

Soldiers often object to this display because it reduces depth perception by blocking one eye and requires that soldiers mentally integrate overhead map positions to their first-person view of the battlefield. To maintain the soldier's depth perception, Land Warrior will soon transition to a transparent HMD. However, removing the task of mentally integrating overhead map positions remains a large undertaking. Primordial and ITT propose jointly solving this problem by developing Primordial Soldier, a wearable augmented reality system that three-dimensionally embeds visual cues derived from a geographic information system (GIS) upon the soldier's field of view. Within a transparent HMD, soldiers will view tactical geospatial-intelligence, friendly force locations, and battlefield routing directions overlaid directly upon the real world. Additional features of Primordial Soldier will include: multiple modes of operation based upon hardware availability; automated route generation; sophisticated labeling techniques preventing visual overload of the soldier with excessive HMD information; and networking services to expedite sharing geospatial intelligence.

These lasers will be based on a broadened waveguide structure employing an AlInAs blocking layer.   Using these emitters, we will provide 1-cm arrays with power conversion efficiency of 45 - 50% and a maximum power of 130 W, as well as 10-array stacks with power exceeding 1 kW.  In addition, we will apply spectral narrowing to these stacks using volume Bragg grating (VBG) technology to provide at least 500 W in a 1.5 nm spectral window.  To achieve these goals, we will use our existing InP-based diode laser platform with which we have already demonstrated 54 W CW operation at 1530 nm from 1-cm arrays during Phase I of this program.  These arrays had 30% conversion efficiency at maximum power, and we demonstrated 230 W output power for VBG-stabilized stacks.  Arrays developed for Phase II of this program will provide unprecedented performance for eye-safe diode-pumped solid state lasers as well as for direct diode use.  Moreover, the achievement of these Phase II goals will constitute a leap in 14xx nm pump laser performance that is proportionally comparable to the performance improvement for short-wavelength (GaAs) pump lasers achieved in DARPA\u2019s SHEDS program.",

Many currently fielded UGVs perform admirably on the narrow set of tasks for which they were designed, but are generally unsuitable for tasks that vary too widely from the core competencies.  Our Small Robot Infrastructure Tookit (SRIT) design, validated in Phase I through feasibility simulations and prototypes, features a low degree-of-freedom manipulator arm, plug-n-play end-effectors, an adaptive OCU with a disposable game controller, and a dual communications system.  The SRIT increases the capabilities of currently fielded robotic UGVs by increasing the number of tools available to them.

The interferometer that is proposed is insensitive to alignment yet provides to measure the entire aperture in double-pass without stitching and is configured in a manner that is relatively insensitive to alignment of the dome to the instrument.  The measurement data provided by this instrument is essential to providing feedback to a deterministic final figuring process, most likely a magnetorheological based technology.  The effort is divided into two major phases: a breadboard and a prototype instrument.  The breadboard will be based almost entirely on catalog components to allow for rapid implementation so that software can be developed and tested quickly.

        "abstract": "Accurate performance prediction is essential to the development of Army rotorcraft as well as the support of flight operations.  While current numerical analysis tools can, in principle, model complete rotorcraft, in practice these implementations are severely hampered by accuracy limitations broadly attributed to modeling assumptions (e.g., vortex core models in Lagrangian methods) or numerical deficiencies (e.g. excessive numerical diffusion for Eulerian CFD).  Thus, commonly used analysis tools fail to predict adequately the unsteady wakes and load distributions of rotor and fuselage designs.  An approach that combines the first-principles physical modeling capability of Eulerian schemes with the vortex preservation capabilities of Lagrangian vortex techniques has long been needed.  Enabled by recently-developed breakthrough technologies in Eulerian wake modeling that specifically address the critical numerical diffusion issue, this effort will develop a first-principles Eulerian vorticity transport wake module that will provide an unprecedented ability to capture the true temporal and spatial structure of the rotor wake when coupled to a wide range of CFD tools.  In Phase I, a prototype wake module was developed and demonstrated through coupling to several representative CFD models.  Phase II will see key enhancements, validation and packaging of a module with significantly expanded functionality tailored to Army needs.",

        "abstract": "Chemical weapons such as organophosphate (OP) nerve agents pose a deadly risk to military and civilian personnel since they are easily dispersed, they persist in the environment, and are extremely toxic.

Consequently, there is an urgent need for natural biological systems that can detect and biodegrade these toxic compounds. This proposal will generate a Saccharomyces cerevisiae biocatalyst/biosensor that can detect and biodegrade OP agents such as VX, which is the most lethal and persistent OP. S. cerevisiae, which is a robust non-pathogenic microorganism that is resistant to environmental extremes, will be used as a self-contained biocatalyst/biosensor. Importantly, the yeast biosensor will also be able to detect the subsequent VX biodegraded products and will thereby provide a means for monitoring the decontamination process. The goal is to generate a biocatalyst/biosensor which: (i) will require minimal consumables; (ii) will be cheap to produce in bulk quantities; (iii) will emit distinct spectral properties following VX detection and biodegradation, and (iv) will be visually assessed using a simple hand held illumination device.

The ultimate goal is to enable the optimization and synthesis, as well as automated re-targeting, of radiation hardened circuits. The basic idea is to extend and develop radiation technology-CAD capacities developed and validated at Vanderbilt University and the coupled device (physics) and circuit simulation capacity developed at Oregon State University into Orora\u2019s behavioral modeling and simulation framework, where radiation effects are modeled and simulated at the device-physics level, circuits at the transistor level, and surrounding circuits at the analog behavioral level, all coupled seamlessly in one simulator with designers\u2019 standard description language (VHDL-AMS/Verilog-AMS).  The key innovation is a statistics-based layout-induced behavioral modeling methodology that resolves the difficulty associated with traditional radiation effect modeling. Specifically it would: (1) Significantly lower development costs and cycle time by automating the design process, avoiding expensive redesign and characterization cycles (potentially cut costs by 1.5-3 times).   (2) Enable designers to quickly explore the effects of new process, circuit, and architecture techniques for the rad-hard purpose. (3) Support synthesis of mixed-signal circuits and process migration/retargeting of circuits. This includes automated migration of an existing design in old rad-hard process to the state-of-art commercial (non-rad hard) process so that they are still rad-hard, or automated redesign or migration of a non-rad hard design or intellectual properties (IPs) in the state-of-art process so that it becomes rad-harden.  (4) Support simulation not just of blocks, but also complete systems and their sensitivities to radiation-induced noise. (5) Such a mixed-mode simulation capacity would eventually enable \u201cvirtual radiation lab\u201d characterization, where traditional 3D TCAD failed to address due to both the computational complexity and statistical nature of the problem.",

The most suitable smart material concept for accurate motion control is piezoelectric actuation, because of its precise controllability, force and bandwidth capability.  Phase I research has determined that ultrasonic motors using piezoelectrics in conjunction with magnetorheological (MR) dampers offer the best approach for a new generation of active inceptors.  Ultrasonic motors provide large displacement by exploiting the very high piezoelectric bandwidth.  A series of very small steps taking place at high frequency provides a large, smooth output motion with high force (or torque) and bandwidth.  Current ultrasonic motors have relatively low force/torque capability, so it is essential to develop higher force/torque units, with direct drive of the stick eliminating the need for gearing as a key objective.  MR dampers are also of interest for high force functions such as detents and hard stops.  Research into the control of MR dampers is proposed in Phase II, which will demonstrate a fully functional dual axis inceptor prototype, with a smart material motion system in two axes, including consideration of flightworthy qualification.",

The current composite shelters being deployed have several drawbacks including high cost, inefficient fabrication processes and lack of built-in EMI-shielding capability.  WebCore Technologies, Inc., proposes a Phase II SBIR Program with two objectives:  1) Design, develop, manufacture and fully qualify an EMI-shielded FSCS design and 2) Establish technology and business partnerships to bring EMI-shielded TYCOR panel technology to market.  WebCore will incorporate the most cost-effective EMI-shielding solutions identified in our Phase I effort for use in the FSCS class of shelters and develop the manufacturing and assembly processes to support their affordable construction.  WebCore has already constructed a non-EMI-shielded version of the FSCS and that experience will be critical to the proposed Phase II effort.  WebCore will demonstrate that the EMI-shielded FSCS developed under this program meets all the qualification standards for EMI-shielding, structural, transportation and environmental performance.  WebCore will work closely with shelter-manufacturing firms, leveraging their manufacturing expertise and produce an EMI-shielded FSCS with improved commercialization potential.",

        "abstract": "This proposal outlines a solution for the knowledge-based creation of 3D solid model CAD designs. The foundation work for this solution, which was done during Phase I of this SBIR, demonstrated that the part design process can be significantly streamlined by automatically generating 3D CAD models from rules written by designers and engineers with little or no CAD or software programming experience. The proposed solution uses a knowledge-based tool to capture and organize rules and data about parts into XML knowledge bases. The solution makes extensive use of STEP application protocols to translate parametric data from an XML design file into the appropriate STEP AP format, which automatically generates 3D CAD neutral output. The output can then be imported into a target CAD system. The solution will also support semi-automatically generating knowledge bases from existing 3D CAD models.",

Phase I results indicated that the potential of the combined capability of these two sensor modalities would be beneficial to the prediction and detection of ALOC and GLOC as well as potential dual-use commercial applications.  Consequently, Archinoetics and Athena have formed a team to continue work for the Phase II effort.  The contractor team will develop a combined EEG and NIRS sensor capable of being integrated into a flight helmet.  Additionally, hardware will be designed and built that will be capable of conditioning the sensor outputs and processing them to produce a prediction and detection of ALOC and GLOC.

We also provide an efficient method of generating truth data for registration, detection and identification, and provide an evaluation plan for assessing the accuracy of the developed algorithms.

Current plans call for unmanned systems to perform a wide variety of roles, including robotic mule applications, unarmed/armed reconnaissance, and EOD/IED (improvised explosive device) inspection and disposal, and limited-scale deployments in Bosnia, Ground Zero, Afghanistan and Iraq have demonstrated their potential. Control of UGVs is accomplished remotely, through a command system that allows an operator(s) to receive sensor data from the UGV and send motion commands to the vehicle.  While the technologies of today are not sufficiently robust for full autonomy under most real-world UGV applications, fully teleoperated devices require mastery of highly complex controls and are thus manpower and attention intensive. Quantum Signal LLC, with consultation from MIT researchers, proposes to develop and experimentally demonstrate a unique, next-generation command and control system for UGVs named PointCom (Point-and-Go Command).  PointCom is a semi-autonomous command system for one or multiple UGVs.  The system will enable significant reduction in operator workload by leveraging intuitive human-computer interface methods and a fused vision/odometric based navigation system to automate low-level navigation and control tasks.

This goes hand-in-hand with the opposite situation, that of detecting a problem with the engine which would lead to emissions noncompliance. To support deployment in a shipyard, additional infrastructure beyond the S2NAP\u00ae is needed before a monitoring system would be practical.

        "abstract": "The current method for producing dome blanks for multimode optics is to spray dry powders, followed by isopressing around metal mandrels.  Yield losses during spray drying, and excess material requirements in the pressing step represent a significant portion of the final part cost.  Unfortunately, few opportunities are available to minimize these losses. Slurry casting processes represent an alternative to isopressing, and in the case of hemispherical domes, are particularly well suited.  Both slip casting and gel casting provide the opportunity to prepare domes at near-net shape with minimal yield loss.  To date, spinel has been particularly difficult to cast, however, due to its fine particle size.  Identification of a suitable dispersion system for spinel that supports casting, despite the particular issues related to the material, is the key to developing this new, more efficient processing route. We propose herein to continue to develop a casting method suitable for producing hemispherical domes of suitable optical quality from spinel powders.  Our efforts build on current capabilities for dispersing spinel in preparation for dry processing of lenses, domes and windows.  The Phase II effort will demonstrate a casting capability to produce 7\u201d nominal hemispherical domes.",

        "abstract": "Our method of enabling cross-domain collaboration allows documents whose contents have a mixture of sensitivity levels to be viewed and edited by users with differing clearance levels, while maintaining the requisite security constraints. In particular, we've identified the following key technical requirements: *Multi-level documents: single documents may contain multiple sections of varying classification and compartmentalization. *Secrecy: users may view sections of documents only if they have clearance. *Editing: users may load, edit, and save a document without knowledge of, or disturbing sections of the document for which they lack sufficient clearance or approval. *High assurance: the solution must be built with high assurance, with a target evaluation of EAL6. To accomplish these goals, we propose to develop a trusted document server (DocServer) to mediate the connection between a user's workstation and files to which he has access. As far as the user is concerned, his workstation connects to a single \"virtual\" combined file and web server from which he may browse, open, edit and save documents. The DocServer will allow documents stored on the web/file server to contain regions of varying sensitivity levels. For example, a document may begin and end with low sensitivity text, but contain an inset of high sensitivity.   BENEFITS: The need for secure information sharing of multi-level documents is quite extensive throughout government.  Currently the U.S. Government has several million individual security clearances outstanding, and is producing tens of millions of new classified documents each year.  Further, we are in the midst of a major transformation from strongly hierarchical organizations with vertical command, control and communications structures, to one where missions are executed by largely autonomous coalitions of nations/agencies/departments.  This shift is happening not only in how we fight traditional wars, but how we coordinate Homeland defenses and wage the war on global terrorism.  Potential users therefore, include the DoD, DHS, intelligence agencies, State and Treasury Departments, plus local governments.  We also anticipate demand for this technology outside of the government in industry and private applications.   Here we see a gradual strengthening of \u201cinfosec\u201d practices to deal with privacy and security concerns which will mandate use of higher assurance technologies as they are shown practical and effective, especially in areas of health care and financial data.",

        "abstract": "Although there are some analytical tools available in the literature, they are not necessary aiming at blast survivability designs. Although there are some composite structures and armors available in the market, they are not necessary of optimal designs. There is still a room to improve the analytical tools and a way to achieve optimal composite designs. This proposed project is to develop a multi-functional blast model and to formulate a numerically accurate and computationally efficient finite element code. With the incorporation of the blast model into the finite element code, the analytical tool will be used to design composite structures based on micro-macro topology controls. As all analytical tools require verification and all simulation results require validation, an innovative experimental technique will be required to complete the optimization process of the composite designs. The innovative technique is based on a shock tube. With slight modification, the shock tube has been converted into a laboratory blast testing facility in Phase I project. It will be extended to applications including debris impact and crash impact associated with the blast attacks in Phase II project. Once an optimal composite structure is completed, it will be subjected to field blast test for final verification.",

        "abstract": "Within the next three years, the Joint Common Missile will be transitioned to full-scale production.  Total U.S. procurements are anticipated to be in excess of 60,000 units over several years, requiring production of the specialized optical/RF seeker dome components at rates of 200 per week.  Currently, the cost of finished seeker domes in quantity is projected to be over $15,000 each, which is a substantial part of the cost of the overall seeker system cost. Near net-shape AlON dome blanks of optical quality are needed to reduce the cost of the seeker domes in time for JCM production. The primary aim of this proposed work is to develop and demonstrate a cost-effective, near net shape process for manufacturing high quality aluminum oxynitride (AlON) domes for JCM and other high performance optical window applications.  Phase I has successfully demonstrated two near-net shape molding processes capable of producing AlON domes. Phase II will scale up the Phase I process to produce full size domes with the required optical properties; demonstrate reduced cost for finished domes and prepare a production plan for Joint Common Missile dome manufacturing under Phase III.",

        "abstract": "The design of Army vehicles to resist blast from mines or from explosive devices is of great interest in order to provide protection to the vehicle and its occupants.  Full size mine blast tests are expensive and time consuming.  Using a numerical simulation for predicting the interaction of the mine blast with the vehicle can minimize the testing, and identify design changes for increased occupant safety.  In the proposed Phase II project the overall objective is to create a system level integration software product (Blast Event Simulation sysTem, BEST) which will seamlessly integrate Eulerian and Lagrangian solvers along with an occupant safety code through a user friendly interface.  Wizard menus will guide a user in setting up the analyses and \u201cknow-how\u201d will be built into the BEST.  The modeling capabilities will be expanded to generate the Eulerian mesh, incorporate effects of uncertainty in the simulations, enhance the capabilities for soil modeling, and include some representative vehicle models for baseline simulations.  A new optimization capability for vehicle design based on occupant safety metrics will also be developed.  Further validation will be performed through comparison to test data for complex configurations.  Comprehensive new testing will be performed under this project.  A commercially viable package will be created for the engineering community of blast simulations and human safety.  The integration approach established in the Phase I effort was validated through comparison to test data from two different configurations.  The proposed approach is in-line with existing modeling efforts in the Army, and the Phase II work will provide an opportunity to create commercial software compatible to the current simulation practices in the US Army.",

In essence what is needed is a device that can incorporate GPS data, map data and meteorological data along with parachute/free fall performance specifications to provide the user with an immediate update of possible (reachable) DZ\u2019s under current conditions. To this end Nanohmics has teamed with EADS Deutschland GmbH, MicroOptical and Inter-4 to develop a parachutist tactical guidance system based on the Inter-4 PDA system, coupled with the EADS Parafinder tactical guidance software and the MicroOptical wireless head mounted display. This combination promises to deliver a system that incorporates the optimum capabilities in both hardware and software. All of these efforts will be coordinated by Nanohmics integration personnel. This teaming arrangement effectively leverages the full capabilities of each company to focus on a specific part of the system.  By segmenting this development into PDA, software and display components, changes in a single component are easier to manage and will have less of an effect on the other components and the overall program timeline.  This should allow a relatively smoother transition of the system to more advanced hardware and software as they become available.",

Additionally, the use of an organic bonding agent introduces a potential weak point in the design, because of concerns over optical, thermal cycling and/or aging issues. We propose herein to continue developing a method by which a composite dome can be produced by ceramic bonding.

        "abstract": "Emerging military, space and commercial communications systems, are placing a high premium on low-cost, small size, weight and power consumption (SwaP) RF components, while at the same time increasing demands for higher functionality. This trend necessitates the utilization of low SWaP phased array antennas that operate well at that frequency band. The future-generation of wafer-scale antenna arrays will require 3D multi-layer modules for improved performance, reduced cost and minimized packaging complexity through 3D interconnects. This arrangement, however, will reduce the space for the active and passive components of the array including the power amplifiers, low noise amplifiers, matching networks, and interconnects. As a result, the heat flux per unit area (W/cm2) will be increased and conventional air cooling may be insufficient to effectively cool the antenna array since major heat generators (e.g. PAs) may be enclosed by wafers and will not have access to cold air from the outside environment. In order to address these issues, EMAG Technologies proposes to develop a 30 GHz wafer-scale array with an integrated microscale cooling system. Moreover, since it is very important that the micro-cooling system does not interact with the RF fields of the antenna array, electrothermal co-design of the system will be attempted.",

The research team includes Prof. Bao from Old Dominion University and Raytheon Missile Systems. The core of MPCES consists of the following components (i) Integrated cost modeling library (ii) A flexible XML-based interface for integration with legacy performance optimization tools (iii) Plug and playable cost modeling framework (iv) Web-service enabled and Fast-time distributed computation. The feasibility of our approach has been demonstrated in our phase I efforts to date, including a comprehensive survey of existing cost models and their applicability to missile systems, the design of overall system architecture, and an initial prototyping of the software. The phase II effort will expand on our Phase I effort. Specific tasks will include development of the ontology for missile applications with a flexible interface to external systems, further enhancements of the cost libraries, implementation of a web services-based service oriented architecture to interface with vendor systems, and development and deployment of MPCES tailored to meet the requirements of ARMDEC for missile development and manufacturing.",

        "abstract": "Providing a fast and accurate way to deliver target images to a small caliber autonomous projectile, using only a single camera, remains a major challenge, particularly for applications demanding rapid responses (e.g., in combat environments). Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS), in collaboration with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists, proposes to develop a breakthrough improved target tracking tool, using the \"3-D reconstruction from shape\" effect.  This technique will use advanced mathematical techniques to construct dynamically changing scene representations that create pseudo 3-D models of 2-D scenes and objects, using only 2-D images as input.  This approach can greatly enhance the identification of moving targets in static and cluttered backgrounds.  In Phase I, IOS developed proof of concept software for targeting and processing 3-D models from images, and produced a working demonstration of the system using realistic images and video.  In Phase II, IOS will extend and improve this system, and will transmit a resized and enhanced image to a breadboard memory prototype representative of a potential projectile targeting system.",

        "abstract": "Current methods for conducting non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of U.S. Navy structures require significant time and manpower.  Inspections are typically carried out via point-by-point measurement techniques that sometimes require erection of significant scaffolding to access the structure and which, by their very design, are susceptible to missing possibly important information if the sampling grid-work is too coarse.  Furthermore, current methods for storing and manipulating inspection data gathered on composite structures are cumbersome and rarely linked to analysis tools needed to quantify the damage severity and assess the impact on overall structural integrity.  The goal of this SBIR program is to develop and demonstrate a structural damage assessment system (SDAS) designed to quickly provide data on the health of a composite structure.  The concept proposed by MSC integrates traditional and emerging wide-area inspection techniques with wireless device(s) that transfers data to specialty analysis software using an 802.15 protocol that processes the information and returns the health assessment.  The benefits of validated and verified SDAS include lower cost (due to reduced time and manpower required) and more reliable (increased confidence that a critical flaw has not gone undetected) inspections of U.S. Navy and commercial sector composite structures.",

The approach is based on an octree data structure used by PercepTek on its 3D from Video project.  The representation serves as an efficient access mechanism for an extensible set of model primitives ranging in complexity from the input 3D points to planar patches or to more complex structures such as buildings or trees. Because this representation is 3D, it will support 3D planners as well as the 2D and 2.5D planners in common use today.  This octree data structure easily handles hierarchical descriptions of the model as well as simplified representations of objects (e.g., bounding boxes) useful for rapid intersection testing. In the ORD Phase I effort PercepTek studied existing planning algorithms to determine their requirements, and developed a prototype obstacle representation database and query capability. In the proposed Phase II effort, PercepTek will incorporate new object representations to improve performance and generality, will deliver the software to AFDD and support its incorporation into their flight software, and will investigate methods of accelerating processing using COTS hardware.",

A recent Combat Readiness Center report revealed that a main cause of rollover is the driver\u2019s inability to assess rollover threat (e.g., cliff, soft ground, water) on the passenger side of the vehicle.  Physical Sciences Inc. and the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute propose to develop an automated driver assistant system for road edge detection and rollover prevention. The system consists of a camera unit, a laser scanner, and a processing and display unit. The cameras provide visible and LWIR images of the roadside and the laser scanner measures terrain steepness. The processor parses the images and terrain steepness information to detect road edges, identify road boundary, detect rollover threat, and issue audio-video warnings to the driver. An LCD display also serves as interface with the driver.  During this program, we will: (1) develop a sensor module by integrating the cameras and the laser scanner into a unit that meets MIL-STD-810, (2) develop a processing and display module by integrating a digital signal processor with the Driver Vision Enhancer, (3) test and characterize the system, and (4) analyze human factors and user variability issues.",

Since this also puts the antenna in harm\u2019s way, it needs to be low-cost and logistically-compact enough to be disposable and field-replaceable.  A high average power (multi-kW), broadband VHF/UHF (200-800 MHz) antenna with a well-defined forward beam (G~6-8 dB), that stows compactly, is inexpensive, and easy/fast to deploy, is required.  In Phase I, we showed the suitability of a novel inflatable laminate-based conical log-spiral antenna (producing a circularly-polarized beam) for this application.  Our analyses and experiments showed that even if constructed with thin, lightweight, flexible, and low-cost laminates, multi-kW RF average powers (and higher peak powers) should be supportable.  In Phase II, we will improve on our draft antenna and balun designs and will build and deliver one or more functioning prototypes. We will continue the multi-pronged R&D attack begun under Phase I, employing: (1) established antenna design principles; (2) expert selection and assessment of materials; (3) detailed 3D numerical models used iteratively to characterize and optimize RF and structural behavior; and (4) experiments to validate and quantify all the key performance characteristics.",

The algorithm uses the costs and benefits to construct a matrix of possible decisions, including the assignment of multiple UMS to the same target. The matrix is solved using an assignment algorithm with acceptable computational cost to obtain the UMS allocation.

Key to this methodology is that the immune system creates a huge amplification of signal through the development of antibodies to cancer-associated antigens present in serum with a 10e7-9 increase in measurable signal caused by the production of antibodies by B cells.  In Phase I we identified a panel of candidate autoantibodies present at high frequency in prostate cancer patient sera. In Phase II, we will narrow this panel to prostate-cancer specific autoantibody-reactive antigens and format them into an ELISA and test against a large number of patients at all stages of prostate cancer to develop a test with better sensitivity (at least 95%) and specificity (false positives less than 5%) than the standard PSA test.

We propose to develop a multi-level and multi-scenario blast simulation and design system, which integrates three new major technologies originally developed at MKP Inc., namely an advanced mine-soil-composite interaction model, which is developed in our Phase I program, an award-winning design methodology, called Function-Oriented Material Design (FOMD), and a novel patent-pending composite material concept, called Biomimetic Tendon-Reinforced (BTR) material. The developed system will enable the prediction, designing, and prototyping of composite structures for a wide range of damage scenarios in various blast events, ranging from vehicle rollover, localized structural failure, blast fragment penetration, to crew injuries.  The different levels of simulation and design capabilities will be implemented in an integrated software system called FOMD-Blast with well-defined graphic user interfaces as detailed in the proposal.  A novel blast-protective composite concept, BTR-Bl, is also proposed in this program as a proof of concept for the technologies developed, which features six functional modules.  The major design goal is to meet the blast protection requirements with other essential features, such as light-weight, flexibility, maintainability, and reduced life-cycle cost.  This BTR-Bl concept will be optimized using the simulation and design capabilities developed in this program, and will be fabricated for further performance evaluation.",

MSSI upgraded existing UWB radar and tested to detect potential UAV targets including power lines and small moving airborne targets at long ranges.  MSSI also examined the obstacle detection range requirements for small UAVs to include detection ranges, size, and weight and power limitations.  MSSI found the radar provides sufficient detection ranges to potential airborne targets in a small low cost package.  In addition, MSSI examined its UWB radar technology to provide situational awareness sensing for rotorcraft in brownout conditions.  MSSI\u2019s unique implementation of UWB provides a robust sensing approach for brownout.   In Phase II, MSSI proposes to improve its radar in a spiral development process.  In the first spiral, MSSI will develop a radar altimeter.  This spiral will support integration of a radar on a UAV with independent wireless downlink.  In the second spiral, MSSI will develop an obstacle detection radar with multiple fields of view for long range detection and obstacle azimuth localization.  MSSI will demonstrate with flight testing the operation of this radar mounted on a hovering UAV.",

Those challenges are the effects of weather (clouds and fog specifically), atmospheric distortion (which limits the range of the signal), pointing and tacking (to allow client mobility) and networking (to interface with industry standard networks and allow for path diversity).  The feasibility and challenges of these technologies were described in Phase I.

The study separates the sensor problems into two separate groups:  1) launch-phase target acquisition in a wide field-of-view (FOV) typically 500km x 500 km.     2) post-launch target tracking in a cued narrow FOV, typically 50km x 50 km.

The feasibility of the circuit to operate as a broadband high-power amplifying component when used in conjunction with the eighteen-beam gun (41.6 A at 42 kV) has been conclusively establish under the Phase-I program. Under the Phase-II program, the major objectives are to fabricate and integrate, in collaboration with our industrial partner, the circuit with the gun and collector into a high-average-power compatible MBK and to characterize and demonstrate the full capability and functionality of the MBK as a potential RF sources for advanced radar applications. The program structure and approach to be undertaken in this proposed effort are designed to parallel the same development path for the successful eight-beam MBK, which is the first fundamental-mode MBK developed in the United States and is presently under operation at the Naval Research Laboratory. In addition, we propose to perform a study to investigate the feasibility of utilizing multi-stage depressed collectors in future broadband high-power MBKs. If feasible, such a collector can greatly improve the overall amplifier efficiency and substantial reduce cooling requirement of future multiple-beam amplifiers.",

        "abstract": "The Navy is seeking a high thrust, linear electric actuator capable of replacing the hydraulic actuators currently used for the weapons elevator flight deck hatch (FDH) control.  In the Phase I effort, a design concept was investigated which coupled a novel high torque, PM motor using notched-ribbon windings inline with a commercial high thrust roller screw.  The results of this investigation found that this design, although roughly of acceptable diameter and weight, was too long to enable a direct, drop-in replacement of the current FDH hydraulic actuators.  Furthermore, the packaging requirements of the roller screw mechanism and main bearing (and not the motor) were found to be the main cause.  Therefore, a two stage effort is proposed for the Phase II project.  The first will refine the current mechanical design to meet the FDH length requirement.  Three approaches have been identified that either singly, or in combination, should result in a design that meets the length requirement.  These approaches are to (1) optimize the key mechanical components (i.e. main bearing, end caps, and attachments), (2) replace the roller-screw with an NFC coated lead screw, or (3) package a high thrust, mechanical spring in parallel with the actuator.  In the second stage of the Phase II project, a prototype system will be designed, constructed and tested to validate performance and manufacturability.",

One area where these improvements may be realized is in the main combustor for supersonic missiles, Mach 8-10 strike/reconnaissance aircraft, and hypersonic vehicles operating with a Turbine Based Combined Cycle (TBCC).  High temperature materials will be necessary to enable high-speed supersonic flight (Mach 3.5 to 5).  For low-speed flight, low-temperature air is commonly used as a coolant for hot parts in the propulsion system.  For high-speed supersonic vehicles, however, there is no source of low temperature cooling air since the total temperature of even the ambient air may exceed material limits for conventional materials, which is a significant problem.  SPIRITECH Advanced Products, Inc. is proposing to utilize components that can be manufactured by novel integral weaving methods using Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC\u2019s).  CMC components provide high strength capabilities at temperatures of 2200\u00b0F to 2400\u00b0F, which is much higher than those for conventional nickel alloys that have limited strength at 1600\u00b0F to 1800\u00b0F.

Such instructional environments enable the targeting of critical skills in realistic situations that force students to practice necessary and challenging skills.  In LEED the trainee interacts with the characters in a realistic, narrative-driven, story-based setting.   The characters are created with an intelligent agent-based infrastructure; each character is an autonomous agent with motivations, attitudes, and emotions that can independently \u2018enact\u2019 its part in the story. The plot changes as the trainee\u2019s actions affect the current state of the story. This inherent flexibility in LEED provides (a) adaptability of the training environment, as well as (b) believability, through the use of an intelligent agent-based infrastructure to model characters.  LEED aims to be highly accessible: we are using a SCORM-compliant web-based distance learning infrastructure to universally deliver the training content. LEED will provide focused leadership training by presenting scenarios from a carefully constructed taxonomy of stories that facilitate development and practice of leadership competencies.",

LIBS researchers have seen sensitivity enhancements of up to a factor of 50X when using a double pulse approach, although to date the way to achieve a double pulse is to use two separate lasers. The objective of this research project is to continue development of single cavity double pulse lasers for LIBS applications that were successfully demonstrated in Phase I.  In this research project the development effort will concentrate on two specific laser implementations, one for short range (5m) man-portable LIBS and the other for medium (30-50m) range vehicle-portable LIBS.  The main issues to be addressed besides fundamental double pulse operation are: pulse energy, size, weight, power, cooling, and vibration and shock insensitivity.",

        "abstract": "A review of past research suggests that attempts to develop personnel selection tests for vigilance performance have not fully succeeded, partly because they are typically based solely on personality (trait) variables.  Current research indicates, however, that vigilance predictor variables can be derived not only from personality variables, but also from vigilance task performance, and individuals\u2019 cognitive responses to the task.  In Phase I, JXT conceptualized a multidimensional approach for a vigilance selection battery, named \u201cVigilant Warrior.\u201d Included in it are assessments of (a) personality traits, (b) performance on a difficult, short-duration, vigilance task, and (c) individual responses to the task (which include assessments of workload, stress, and coping strategies).  In addition to military applications, comments from an emergency first-response organization that is highly interested in selecting vigilant personnel for critical task assignments indicate that Vigilant Warrior will be a useful adjunct to existing personnel selection tests, and will have considerable commercial potential.  In Phase II, JXT will explore this potential, write, test, and fine-tune the battery software, and execute a large-scale validation study employing 400 subjects. Finally, the battery\u2019s suitability and usefulness will be assessed by Army personnel selection specialists.",

        "abstract": "There is an urgent need for a stable and high energy density hydrogen source for portable military applications.  With 19.6 wt% hydrogen in its composition, borazane (NH3BH3), a water soluble, non-cryogenic solid, is one of the most hydrogen rich solids around, and a promising source of hydrogen for use in fuel cells.  The hydrogen can be liberated via hydrolysis with a throttleable hydrolysis reactor producing a quantitative hydrogen yield from a given mass of borazane with no need for a pressure vessel and no high temperature heat signature.  In this system, hydrogen is generated at near ambient temperature with a practical 10.05 wt% hydrogen release (combined reactants basis). Lynntech proposes developing a self-sustained 20 Watt power supply system comprised of a hydrogen generator and 20W PEM fuel cell stack.  This means that a soldier requiring 20W of continuous power will only require about 280 g of fuel (when the hydrogen is consumed at a typical fuel cell efficiency) and produce a net system energy density of =1.5 kWh/kg (including water that can be collected locally) for a 72 hr mission.  To match a variable power demand, the rate of hydrogen generation can be varied to maximize the utilization of borazane.",

        "abstract": "Microwave Technologies proposes the development of a revolutionary miniature submillimeter-wave magnetron oscillator (SMO) that will provide tens of milliwatts of terahertz radiation for applications requiring greater imaging resolution and higher communication bandwidth.  The proposed SMO concept uses a cross-field arrangement wherein a rotating electron beam interacts with the fields of a multi-vane cylindrical cavity.  The electron beam, produced by a micron-sized cold-cathode, is used to generate a high-power submillimeter wave inside the cavity.  The SMO will be fabricated using state-of-the-art MEMS microfabrication technology, and will be a pioneering step towards combining vacuum tube technology with solid-state microfabrication technology.  Some of the applications for these new exciting devices include standoff detection of concealed weapons and biological hazards, tabletop accelerators, terahertz high-resolution radar, THz chemical and biological sensing, commercial THz line-of-sight networking and ultrahigh-speed computers.  Based on the successful Phase I results we are now ready to perform the prototype development of a submillimeter wave magnetron in Phase II.  Once successfully developed, the SMO will be the basis for a new generation of high power submillimeter-wave sources capable of producing ultrahigh frequency radiation with high efficiency in an amazingly compact and lightweight package.",

This will require a dual-mode operation: a noise radar mode and a retrodirective mode.  The target will be initially detected and located in noise-radar mode with modest range and spatial resolution.  Then as the target approaches close enough to cross the retrodirective \"fence\", it will be detected much more quickly and located in angle and range with enough accuracy to cue a counter-system.  A secondary objective of the Phase II effort is to augment the fast detection and locating attributes of the radar with a three-dimensional, X-band imaging capability.  Images will be constructed from the multitude of cross-correlations available from the radar, and the imagery will complement the fast-projective detection with valuable information about the local environment, sources of  clutter, the identity of the shooter, etc.  The imaging capability could also be valuable for all-condition vehicular navigation through sandstorms, smoke, fog, etc.",

In the Phase I program, CLX compared several approaches to MCM-HIP based around its advanced digital signal processor technology.  New packaging technologies, including 3-D interconnection and chip stacking allow future expansion of processor and memory capacity.

The finish is composed of a reactive coupling agent, a low viscosity vinyl ester resin, a free radical inhibitor, and a surfactant.  The reactive finishes substantially improved the carbon/vinyl ester interface compared to unsized or FOE sized materials.  Failure mode analysis shows that interfacial failure dominates the unsized and FOE sized materials, whereas resin cohesive failure dominates the reactive finished materials.

Once optimized, finish compatibility with weaving and resin infusion processes will be determined, additional durability tests will be conducted, and a material property database will be constructed.  A final objective is to license the finish technology to interested carbon fiber manufacturers and to conduct a life cycle cost analysis.  An optimized vinyl ester compatible finish on carbon fibers will allow the Navy to fabricate cost effective lighter, stronger, stiffer, and more durable composite ships.

        "abstract": "Based on our recent progress in a proprietary Dual Source Enemy Identification and Negation Lidar (DSEINL) technology and successful Phase I feasibility demonstration, Agiltron Inc. proposes to develop a revolutionary approach to  DSEINL for providing wide field of view and high detection rate to find and identify enemy combatants and sniper rifles by receiving the back or retro-reflected light from the sighting riflescope or the enemy combatant\u00a1\u00a6s eyes. Sighting scopes mounted on weapons, such as sniper rifles, has a reticle plate fixed in the image plane of the objective lens. The reflection off the reticle plate forms a back-propagating light beam featuring very small divergence angle and very weak depolarization. Similarly the human eye also causes a strong retro-reflection.  Based on these features, Agiltron Inc. proposes to build a low cost and reliable DSEINL system using an imaging sensor to detect, identify, locate and deny enemy combatants. The proposed system uses two switching light sources that are separated a short distance from each other.  The separation distance is adjustable, and the received images differ under the illumination by the two light sources. By subtracting the images, single or multiple riflescopes, as well as enemy combatants looking at the system can be detected while background signals can be virtually eliminated. This system holds the promise of high sensitivity, large surveillance area, low cost, high reliability and the capability of differentiating sniper rifles and human eyes from other possible strong scattering objects. This technology can be used for both pre-searching of enemy combatants and for hand off to other lethal and non-lethal systems. The Phase I effort has already provided a proof-of-principle demonstration of this advanced detection technology and in Phase II Agiltron will produce a full specification compliant working prototype.",

        "abstract": "The proposal addresses a new class of large field of view two color MWIR uncooled sensing module with an RF sensor system that is based on a revolutionary concept in sensing optics, potentially providing all weather, all aspect, multi spectral threat warning system.  The new design is a practical solution to incorporate uncooled IR detection with existing RF warning sensors to significantly enhance situation awareness of aircrafts.   Our approach offers all the desirable performance attributes in sensitivity, resolution, detection range, coverage area, accuracy, cost, and weight.  The new approach is simple yet highly effective. The proposed system can instantaneously survey the full surrounding space using quadrant staring optics in each of four separate stations on the aircraft without the use of any scanning mechanism, covering the area with the field of view 90\u00a2X x 360\u00a2X FOV. In addition to the large angle of field view, the angle resolution of our system is adequate for detecting all types of launch threats and trajectory tracking.  The Phase I work demonstrated the feasibility of the concept and Phase II will produce the full specification-working prototype.",

        "abstract": "Effective evaluation of human-machine systems requires accurate representations of human behavior. Human response to suppression is particularly important because it typically interrupts a mission task which, if continued or completed, would impact the outcome of the engagement. Currently, simulations only take into account a fraction of the perceptual cues to which humans respond under suppressive fire, and a small number of behavioral responses.  This is due in part to a lack of empirical data, and to limited knowledge of physical and cognitive factors that constrain responses to suppressive fire. We propose to address the need for realistic, flexible, easy-to-update models by designing and prototyping a framework for Representing Entity Actions and Cue Taxonomies (REACT).  Our human centric approach uses Cognitive Systems Engineering techniques to support the necessary knowledge elicitation and analysis efforts.  This process will identify and categorize suppression cues, associate them with behaviors, and identify REACT software system requirements. We will then develop and implement methods to populate areas lacking in data to provide an enhanced representation of the role of suppression in decision making and performance.  Finally, we will integrate the REACT framework into the Infantry Warrior Systems (IWARS).",

        "abstract": "Magnesium alloys have always been attractive to designers/Engineers due to their low density-only two thirds that of aluminum. However, existing magnesium alloy do not exhibit an adequate combination of castability, creep performance and corrosion resistance as compared to its competitive Al alloys. There is a strong need for Mg alloys with much improved mechanical properties and corrosion properties.. The strength of magnesium alloys can be increased by inserting ceramic phase to produce metal matrix composites. Considerable improvements of the mechanical properties as well as the thermal stability can  be achieved through the reinforcement by ceramic fibers or particles. These reinforcements increase the stiffness and strength as well as creep resistance of the composites. Magnesium matrix composites (MMC) show better wear resistance, enhanced strength and creep resistance and keeps low density and good machinability. Despite this advantage, the study  of  Mg based MMCs remains fairly limited because of  its poor corrosion resistance. Therefore, it is important to develop a new generation of Mg based composites that have good mechanical and corrosion properties. During Phase I, it has been demonstrated the feasibility of producing high strength, corrosion resistant magnesium alloy composite rod using our innovative coating design and special fabrication processing for consolidation. During Phase II, Aspen will design the required fabrication technique for larger diameter rod and complex shape larger components towards commercial applications of this magnesium composites. Aspen will evaluate the materials thoroughly and a create a data bank for this materials technology. Phase III will develop prototype manufacturing capacity and transfer the technology for manufacturing in mass scale.",

These novel actuator concepts will require minimal electrical power for their operation; they are very lightweight and occupy small volume, while being capable of providing high control authority to the guidance and control system of the guided munitions. As a result, the guidance and control system of a projectile equipped with the proposed actuation devices should be capable of achieving significantly enhanced precision for both stationary and moving targets, thereby achieving significantly greater probability of hit. These actuation devices are capable of being integrated into the structure of the projectile, mostly as load bearing structural components, thereby occupying minimal and even no projectile volume. In addition, the actuation devices and their related components are better protected against high firing acceleration loads, vibration, impact loading, repeated loading and acceleration and deceleration cycles that can be experienced during transportation and loading operations.

        "abstract": "The overall objective of the proposed Phase II effort is the development and evaluation of the CONNECT PLUS suite of protocols. CONNECT PLUS includes schemes to enable MANET routing on heterogeneous environments and schemes for multi-ply routing, a novel technology that makes use of spare capacity of wireless nodes. These protocols are expected to find wide applicability in providing IP connectivity between disparate technologies in airborne networking applications. Node heterogeneity is addressed by using Entity Capability Profiles (ECPs) for nodes. These ECPs are distributed across the network and used for routing decisions.  Multi-ply routing is used in two forms: multi-ply capacity, to support high bandwidth and bursty applications, and multi-ply diversity, which makes use of the spare bandwidth for robustness, by sending the same packet across multiple paths. Phase I has formulated the entire CONNECT PLUS protocol stack including routing and attending elements at the lower (MAC and PHY) and higher layers.  Phase I has also successfully demonstrated that multi-ply results in substantial gains in network utilization with respect to single path routing in airborne network environments. Further development and evaluation of CONNECT PLUS in Phase II includes: (1) the development of modules for capacity estimation and reservation; (2) the development of schemes for packet reordering control; (3) implementation and demonstration of the concept in a network of COTS PDAs.  BBN Technologies will provide unique expertise in MANET routing technology and support in the transition to the PDA environment.  BBN will also provide commercialization support.

In particular, there is serious concern that a misdirected beam or specular reflection might leave the test range and injure unprotected persons.  In response to this requirement, Sensing Strategies, Inc.

The LOHAZ system monitors for stray radiation hazards by detecting aerosol scatter from beams leaving the range.   The sensors do not need to be in the beam but will look up from the ground for this distributed signal source.  The LOHAZ system consists of a series of sensor stations deployed along the perimeter of the controlled area.  Each of these sensor stations detects and locates aerosol scatter from laser beams exiting the range.  Any detections are transmitted in real time to a LOHAZ base station, which fuses the results from the network of sensors and provides rapid warning to control personnel.",

The MNDV is a reusable UUV that is launched and recovered from a ship. One of the key attributes of the MNDV will be its ability to dock with a ship-deployed recovery mechanism.

Autonomous weapons platforms such as unmanned aerial reconnaissance vehicles and bomb/mine defusing robots are very effective at assisting the warfighter in countering asymmetric threats. This gives U.S. forces strategic and tactical advantages.  Increased autonomy increases the risk of capture and subsequent reverse-engineering. The use of COTS hardware components makes the software much more susceptible to reverse-engineering than customized hardware. Reverse engineering a weapons platform enables an adversary to compromise the platform\u2019s mission and cost soldiers\u2019 lives.  Anti-tamper (AT) and anti-reverse engineering (ARE) methods focus on sufficiently delaying or making it economically infeasible for the adversary; it is well understood that is impossible to entirely prevent re-engineering. The Dynamically Obfuscating Virtual Execution Environment (DOVE) will severely inhibit the adversary\u2019s ability to reverse engineer or tamper with weapons software in a timely manner by applying dynamic obfuscation.

The overall goal of the Phase II project is to determine how the improvements we measured in our laboratory scale experiments can be translated into improved performance in a scramjet engine cycle.  Our test plan includes preparing a catalyst that is soluble in liquid methane, measuring the important catalyst physical parameters, scaling up the catalyst synthesis to support larger-scale tests, conducting combustion tests to identify the optimum catalyst composition and concentration, measuring the effect the catalyst under scramjet conditions, extending the modeling studies to better characterize the individual reaction steps, and finally constructing a liquid methane fuel handling system.",

The new technology would meet virtually all the U.S. Navy needs in pipe flow monitoring, at a significantly reduced investment cost to the Navy.  Because these new devices will shrink the present dimensions needed for flow (differential pressure) measurement, it should be relatively straightforward to replace/upgrade most existing pressure measurement products supplied to the Navy, on a one-for-one replacement basis.  The new technology will also introduce more accurate sensor measurement capability than is presently available with the present thin film, foil or piezo resistive sensor techniques.  The manufacture is a low cost production process that can easily be geared from low custom production to mass output.  The devices exhibit no hysteresis or cyclic drift, is essentially EMI/RFI immune, and can endure unexpected short term (e.g. water-hammer shock) and long duration overpressures of many tens of thousand of psi without performance deterioration.  Due to its unique material construction, these new sensors can be easily modified as to measure anything from small pressure intervals to large pressure excursions of many hundreds of psi.

Payload weight may be lowered since high current, high voltage transformers will not be needed. In Phase I, we showed that high current densities in the range needed for TWT applications, can be obtained from carbon nanotube (CNT) cathodes in both pulsed and DC modes.

The RVFM3D model will feature innovative methodology that will couple the RV flowfield with surface ablations and in-depth conduction for thermal protection systems (TPS). RVFM3D will have key features that will expedite RV flow solutions (GUI, NS/PNS flow solvers, self-contained automated grid generation and mesh adaptation, generalized thermo-chemistry, Expert Interface, etc.). Key developments during the Phase II would be the refinement of body ablative routines, ablative heatshield thermo-chemistry data banks, upgrades to turbulence modeling geared towards ablative effects, as well as modification of the GUI, the Expert Interface and the self-contained grid/adaptive methodology to 3D RV shock layer flows. RVFM3D will also predict RV wake flowfields, including seamless interfacing with systems-oriented codes for prediction of Radar Cross Section (RCS) signature, as well as Radar Frequency (RF) attenuation at on-board antennae.

        "abstract": "High-fidelity flowfield simulations of US Army interest for tactical and hypersonic missile aeropropulsive applications require replacement of simplified modeling approximations with more accurate but complex formulations.  These improvements have incurred significant computational cost through use of higher-order numerics, dense computational meshes, and advanced turbulent and thermochemistry models with disparate time-scales that introduce additional non-linear transport equations and numerical stiffness issues.  Software-based optimizations are needed to improve simulation throughput for system design parametric studies and evaluation purposes.  Use of massively parallel computer clusters can extend simulation capability to 3D flowfields but alone cannot address the performance issue; innovative algorithm improvements are needed to complement available hardware resources.  The opportunity presented seeks to boost simulation output significantly, without compromising accuracy, using automated dynamic load balancing techniques for parallel systems that compensate for non-uniform computational work distributions from varying physical processes (chemistry, particulate interactions) across the domain.  Additionally, improved convergence algorithms are proposed to facilitate use of advanced thermochemistry and turbulence models in an efficient manner and to exploit differing time-stepping requirements through adaptive implicit algorithm selection.",

These include algorithms for system typing, tracking, and the development of critical sensor parameters such as noise equivalent target thresholds. However, current state-of-the-art predictive codes cannot accurately represent the evolution of plume signatures through the afterburning shutdown regime. This results from an inadequate understanding of the associated physics and absence of supportive laboratory flowfield data that correlate flowfield measurements with simultaneous measurements of plume infra-red (IR) emissions. The Phase II program will collect new data sets in the CUBRC LENS II tunnel, under equivalent flight conditions using a subscale engine that replicates flight observations of plume shutdown. State-of-the-art non-intrusive diagnostic measurements of afterburning plumes will be performed at simulated altitudes, and companion measurements of IR emissions will be obtained.

Estimating the failure under various loading conditions is mostly beyond the state-of-the-art, so we seek a method to give designers more confidence in studying failure limits. Modeling improvements will involve a multi-scale adaptive finite element system using advanced object oriented programming techniques.  This permits a consistent modeling approach that transitions from macroscopic multi-layer fabrics to fibril level model of yarns.  The adaptivity will be done dynamically based on changing conditions of impact from projectiles, blast or other sources. Testing and constitutive modeling of yarns will be a major part of this effort.  The properties of the yarn are critical to failure and the behavior of yarns is complex, given that they are composed of bundles of twisted fibrils that result in unusual properties.  Constitutive modeling at the yarn/fibril level is absent from the literature and is a major goal of this research. Using a series of published tests, we will show that the resulting tool is capable of analyzing failure over a wide range of conditions.

UWAPS has application for unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV), SEAL delivery vehicles (SDV), and diver-held Hydrographic Mapping Units (HMU) and Underwater Imaging Systems (UIS). UWAPS will consist of a field of autonomous acoustic transponder sensors transmitting periodic time-synchronized spread spectrum signals. Following deployment, the transponder array will automatically self-calibrate to establish precise transponder XYZ positions. Geodetic cross referencing will be accomplished using GPS/Acoustic Relay Units installed initially on the ocean bottom and released under acoustic control of the deployed transponder array, to provide a one-time unattended dual position fixing (acoustic and GPS) at the ocean surface.  Once automatic calibration has been completed, User equipment will passively monitor transponder transmissions, and convert time differences of arrival to XY positions in real time with an accuracy of better than 2 meters. User depth will be measured directly using pressure sensors.  Each transponder will transmit its own position data periodically, so users need no prior knowledge of array placement parameters. Once transponders are deployed, no further surface presence or equipment is needed for system calibration or operation. Phase I investigations included: a. Detailed definition and design of all acoustic signals required b. Determination of the optimum method of transferring transponder coordinates to user equipment via acoustic telemetry. c. Define optimum battery chemistry and electronics package size to support all performance requirements while minimizing physical size and handling requirements.

In fact, the convulsions resulting from OP intoxication present a significant problem for the medical treatment of military personnel and civilian populations exposed to nerve agents since they lead to profound brain damage and long-term psychiatric, motor and cardiovascular problems. This Phase II project aims to evaluate the ability of novel glutamate receptor antagonists to abrogate seizure-related behaviors in a rodent model of sarin intoxication.  We will compare the efficacy of these agents with that of a benzodiazepine, midazolam, which is now in development as an anticonvulsant for military use.  In parallel with our behavioral evaluations of these anticonvulsants we will perform biochemical experiments to test the hypothesis that effects of these compounds on glutamate receptor phosphorylation state in the brain represent a useful marker, and potential screening assay, for the anticonvulsant efficacy of novel anticonvulsant candidates.",

Current methodologies for delivering DNA vaccines are either inefficient, do not target the appropriate cell types, contain unnecessary genetic elements or fail to elicit a protective immune response in the absence of a protein antigen boost.  BG are non-living bacterial envelopes that deliver DNA constructs and/or protein antigens to a wide variety of cell types, including dendritic cells and macrophages and do not require the addition of adjuvant to induce an immune response.  DNA minicircles contain only the necessary promoter and gene elements for a vaccine candidate protein and can be attached to the interior of BG.  Both BG and DNA minicircles can be easily modified to include a mixture of different ORFs for use as a multi-agent or multi-life stage vaccine.  In this proposal, BG containing immobilized DNA minicircles with gene sequences for Bacillus anthracis and Yersinia pestis antigens will be used to vaccinate small animals.  Animals will undergo a scheduled vaccination scheme, the immune response will be assessed and the animals will be challenged to determine the efficacy of the vaccine.",

Next generation of X-band and Ka-band MILSATCOM receivers can be built using the proposed architecture, which combines superconductor ADC modulators with room temperature polyphase decimation filters through high-speed digital interface. This architecture allows us to avoid yield limitations of complex superconductor digital circuits, and take full advantage of extremely sensitive, ultra-linear superconductor quantizers, sampled by a low-jitter, ultra-fast clock at rates up to 40 GHz. Much more complex digital processing resources are available at room temperature, but operate at significantly lower speed. To bridge the gap in speed and signal levels, we need fast superconductor deserializer and output drivers respectively.

        "abstract": "The cost incurred in developing and producing a product or process is one of the most important considerations. Surprisingly enough, cost planning is done only at the top-level. At the design-level of the parts and sub-systems, cost consideration happen in a very limited manner. Decisions at the design level are solely based on performance criteria. This tends to make the system either over costly or it does not utilize the given resources for the fear of overrunning it. Furthermore, it relies heavily on the experience of the involved people. This paradigm needs to be changed by incorporating cost knowledge at the early design stage. This can be done by developing a software tool that can easily and accurately estimate the cost of producing a system made of wide variety of parts either obtained from a third-party vendor or made in-house using different manufacturing processes. This will let a user treat cost as an independent parameter along with other performance parameters for a cost-based design optimization. A survey of existing software tool shows that there is no commercially available tool in today\u2019s market with this functionality.  This proposed work will essentially try to fill this important technological gap. It will 1) give cost estimate for each part (manufacturing and COTS) and of the system as a whole, 2) provide design alternatives based on cost and performance criteria, and 3) present the trade-offs of production scenarios (process, material, labor hours, tooling, etc).",

Vehicle-mounted terrestrial LIDAR systems have the capability to capture very-accurate 3D measurements of the urban environment with spatial resolutions on the order of 5 centimeters or less.  The 3D imaging capability of these collection systems is negated, however, by a lack of commercial software tools capable of exploiting terrestrial LIDAR datasets with a high degree of automation.  Current approaches for creating high-resolution 3D urban models are expensive, requiring thousands of man-hours to digitize feature geometries, assign textures to features, and then attribute features. Visual Learning Systems, Inc. has developed a unique capability to automatically extract 3D urban features from terrestrial LIDAR data including building facades, doors, windows, poles, trees, vehicles and other urban features of interest.

        "abstract": "Effective Naval warfare depends on accurate estimates of sensor performance in complex environments, which provides a force multiplier by allowing friendly forces to optimize their tactics while avoiding counterdetection.  The shift in emphasis from open ocean to littoral operations has increased the demands on models of sonar performance because data must be sampled at an order-of-magnitude finer resolution to obtain the same accuracy, which makes many models impractical in time-sensitive operations.  A traditional response to this problem has been to replace detailed physical simulations with simpler, sensor specific, heuristics, but this approach is inflexible and generally provides inferior predictions. The solution to the problem of obtaining accurate sonar performance estimates in time to meet operational constraints is to run detailed physical models at a carefully selected set of grid points, and then to extrapolate from this small dataset to any other location/depth/frequency of interest.  In this Phase II project we will enhance our Phase I Adaptive Gridding algorithm to select a minimal number of such grid points which will allow the Adaptive Gridding algorithm to make accurate predictions of sonar effectiveness throughout an operational area, and also further optimize its performance.",

The concept of improving fatigue resistance without enlarging the design envelope or imposing changes that would require new part qualifications is attractive from both cost and time savings standpoints. Data and results from Phase I have provided new information concerning laser shock peening application and residual stress response in carburized Pyrowear 53 steel. Laser peening can improve fatigue life by achieving high levels of residual compression to significant depths in a given part. Promising modeling work associated with the Phase I physical testing has laid the foundation for a computer design tool, enabling laser peening residual stress prediction in  combination with other manufacturing processes, such as prior heat treating. Phase II will characterize fatigue life improvement in carburized and hardened Pyrowear 53 steel by laser shock peening.  Experimental results will be used to aid the development, validation and commercialization of a process modeling design tool for predicting the residual stresses which drive the fatigue life improvement.",

Lambda Science\u2019s approach to discriminate small targets from high-altitude sea clutter is to utilize improved multi-scan processing algorithms that incorporate feature-aided multiple hypothesis tracking and real-time clutter modeling.  A sophisticated multi-target track picture, using interacting multiple-model filtering, is augmented with extracted target features and sea-clutter predictions.  In this way, candidate tracks are discriminated based on consistency with extracted features and predicted clutter in addition to track consistency.  Probabilistic data association and/or dynamic programming are used to reduce complexity for near real-time operation. The Tracking and Discrimination processes are conveniently combined by incorporating an appropriate feature related component into the track score to provide a kinematics \u2013 based discriminant function for multi-look detection.

        "abstract": "Controlling stray light in ballistic missile defense (BMD) sensors is essential to target detection, discrimination and acquisition.  The most effective way to control stray light is to move or block the offending stray light source, in the hostile environment of missile defense this is not an option.  The enemy dictates the stray light environment.  Defense sensors must contend with the sun, the moon, the earth limb, and countermeasures, at virtually any angle relative to the sensor boresight.  If a sensor is blinded by the sun or lured away by a countermeasure the result is no different than a failed launch.  Therefore, mission assurance depends on defining realistic stray light requirements, designing sensors to meet those requirements, and tests that verify sensor stray light performance.    While controlling stray light in missile defense sensors is critical, stray light testing is sporadic.  There is a need for a permanent stray light test station for missile defense sensors, staffed by personnel well versed in stray light, and allowed to grow over time with the support of multiple programs.  During Phase 2 we propose to build a stray light test station and measure stray light performance in a BMD sensor qualification unit.",

Once ionized, the gas column carries the current and eliminates particulate debris that is otherwise generated by the return rods. The gas shell also absorbs unwanted UV and hence eliminates the first Li foil filter of the baseline debris mitigation system. Estimates suggest that the UV induced blow-off from a gas jet imparts lower momentum to the subsequent Li foil decelerator, than does the present solid Li foil. This decelerator thus moves more slowly and allows the fast closure and hence the test object to move closer, resulting in a higher useful soft x-ray fluence. The gas anode provides a full field of view to the pinch from any azimuthal angle.  With return posts, alignment is critical so that lines-of-sight are not occulted by the posts.

While this set of applications will be used for a Biosurveillance scenario, the general approach can be extended or adapted for any domain.  These applications will be the linchpin of any future commercialization effort, either as a stand-alone product or as a suite of web-services that Public Health organizations can subscribe to. -- Integrate, demonstrate, and deploy an extensible Federated Information Management System which facilitates the efficient interaction of multiple, heterogeneous users and data sources. -- Provide a web-enabled Common Operational Picture that DCC members can utilize to visualize the current situation, epistatic relationships between nodes, emerging trends.   -- Prototype a web-enabled mobile communications infrastructure that can support standardized communications between DCC members operating on a variety of different devices (e.g., pagers, cell phones, PDAs).   -- Transform information based on role, context, and connectivity characteristics of the individual users. The emphasis here will be on the efficient delivery of high value, time sensitive information, tailored to the specific needs (role) of each user.   -- Demonstrate this system using a public health crisis scenario that requires a distributed DCC, with nodes at the local (county), state, and Federal level.",

Costly existing ground weapons detection and near-vehicle situational awareness technologies are limited in terms of sensor field of view, range, size, affordability and reliable target detection and location, especially while platforms are in motion. Our novel combination of video and radar sensors, offers a performance region of 30-200 meters for both situational awareness and detection of random lethal attacks.

To achieve high reliability in a mobile environment is not an easy task, as frequent node movement combined with volatile RF environment often results in fluctuation in link quality. The convergence time in a mobile ad hoc network is prohibitively long to ensure high reliability. To combat this, innovative seamless soft handoff approaches must be developed to achieve the required reliability requirements. To the best of our knowledge, there is no seamless soft handoff protocol for tactical mobile ad hoc networks.  To create a truly seamless soft handoff protocol, San Diego Research Center (SDRC) and Telcordia Technologies proposed in Phase I an innovative distributed, seamless multi-layer soft handoff protocol for mobile ad hoc networks.  Simulation and analysis were conducted to compare the performance of candidate protocol architectures qualitatively and quantitatively.  Based on these studies, we selected a multi-layer soft handoff protocol, MLSHO-2, as our candidate protocol. In Phase II, we will implement MLSHO-2 and demonstrate the real-world performance improvements in a laboratory environment on COTS and/or custom routers. Our demonstration will leverage the PILSNER environment as much as possible to ensure smooth transition to WIN-T.",

In response to this need, UES, Inc. conducted research on light-weight diffraction limited optics that is also amenable to rapid mirror fabrication.

The nano-laminate was bonded to a base low-expansion substrate using a negative CTE nano-powder reinforced geopolymer.  The underlying concept of using SiC and Si3N4 is to construct the mirror, attachment bonding material, and substructure in such a way that they all possess very close thermal expansion coefficients.  The ultimate objectives of this proposed Phase II program are: 1) to develop technology toward scaling-up the process to produce at least a 0.5-meter rigid mirror, based on SiC/Si3N4 nano-laminates and shaped to a parabolic form, without increasing the visible optics figure and finish errors, and 2) to develop cost and schedule estimates for a less than 2 month production time.

The design of GeoDoc is predicated on the fact that, within this task, the ultimate measure of system efficacy is the level of human-effort required to produce error-free documents.  GeoDoc will support a new cooperative model of editing wherein the system orders editing decisions so as to reduce overall uncertainty in its tagging and thereby reduce document validation time.  Documents produced with GeoDoc will support new modes of visualization (and other services), offering substantial value to the information consumer.

        "abstract": "We propose to improve the accuracy and capability of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and Atmospheric Transport and Dispersion (ATD) models by performing a tight, downscale/upscale coupling of a community NWP forecasting system, WRF, with a special purpose, urban-to-microscale Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model. This new capability addresses \u201cbridging the gap\u201d between the mesoscale and microscale, providing improved mesoscale-to-urban-scale wind, turbulence and contaminant transport and dispersion modeling fidelity and accuracy.  We will couple the models using the public-domain, Model Coupling Environmental Library (MCEL), whose client/server, dataflow model provides the framework that both the NWP and CFD need to implement and assess a range of upscale and downscale data transfer methods. To provide this state-of-the-science and readily-distributable microscale modeling capability, we will modify a special-purpose CFD solver that uses Adaptive Cartesian Mesh Refinement methods that has been developed under previous DTRA SBIR funding. This special-purpose, microscale CFD capability will solve meteorologically consistent governing equations, employ scale appropriate building and terrain treatments, and be designed to be effectively coupled within the environment. The software capability and framework may be readily extended to other community NWP and microscale models, and lays the framework to bridge the gap between mesoscale and urban/microscale models.",

        "abstract": "IAI will extend the work that we have doing in phase I and option period on Inductive Time Domain Reflectometry (ITDR), to detect and locate flaws in wiring systems. This approach merges two methods most commonly used for the inspection of conducting structures: TDR, and Eddy Current Testing (ECT). In many ways, TDR and ECT are orthogonal methods. By combining them, key advantages of both (testing at distance for TDR, and sensitivity for ECT) are retained while avoiding some of their limitations. The proposed TDR technology, which uses high speed digital signals for probing the wires, has the following improvements over state of the art: higher sensitivity to soft faults such as insulation chafing, and unambiguous localization of faults on branched wiring harnesses. The methodology of Inductive Time domain Reflectometry-ITDR (injecting signal in one wire and correlating it with reflections in the neighboring wire) has been very successful in detecting and locating faults (both hard and soft faults). Our Phase I experimental results demonstrate clearly that: (1) Induced measurements show far greater sensitivity to soft faults (insulation chafing). (2) Induced measurements can locate faults unequivocally in branched circuits by observing the reflections in adjacent wires.",

The purpose of this Phase-II effort is to develop a reactive binder for tungsten particles which effectively augment the lethality by incorporating reactive effects while still preserving the main kinetic energy attributes. The proposed material solution is based on the formulations of amorphous phase Liquidmetal\u00ae alloys, which provides extended range of material properties and as such extended flexibility in design. The unique amorphous structure of Liquidmetal\u00ae alloys also results in very high flow stress, tailorable density and failure modes, and robust processing and fabrication methods. Select formulations of Liquidmetal alloys in various composite architectures will be fabricated and tested for reactivity and other performance parameters relevant to the application domain. The resulting test results will be analyzed to achieve an optimized composite architecture specific to the application.

With an ever aging, and yet, ever more valuable inventory of older aircraft, the maintenance depots assigned their upkeep and readiness continually work to maximize flight time and minimize costs.  As a result, many are looking to technology-based solutions to improve their inspection and overhaul processes with tools for nondestructive testing and virtual parts modeling.  To address these process enhancements, Photon-X proposes a non-contact, 3-D measurement solution utilizing its passive, single-camera technology producing high-resolution surface map output of imaged objects.  This 3-D imagery is then used directly for inspection/measurement applications or output as CAD/CAM files for part-design modification and manufacturing.  This technology requires no special illumination, is fast in data collection/processing, is optics-independent (offering various fields of view), is small and easily transported, is very cost-effective and has been proven to be a low risk in Phase I, with potential high payoff for Air Force.  During Phase II, a complete prototype system will be designed, developed, tested, and delivered to the Air Force.  Extensive tests are planned for the instrument at appropriate AF facilities.",

Each array of 16 light fixtures will evenly illuminate 1400 square feet of shelter with 200 lux illumination.

        "abstract": "Today it is estimated that there are 110 million active Anti-Personnel (AP) mines in the world, and nearly 20 million of these are concentrated in Afghanistan and Iraq. These weapons remain active for decades after a military conflict and are responsible for killing or maiming up to 500 people a week. Most of the time, a deminer is aware of the landmine, and can take his own precautions, such as increasing the standoff distance to a point where his Personnel Protective Equipment (PPE) will be effective. However, the largest threat to a deminer is accidentally stepping on a mine of which he was unaware. This places his foot and his leg in almost direct contact with the explosion. At such a close proximity, the current blast protective footwear can only prevent the loss of his leg at minimal charge masses. Other options for protection are available, but they suffer from either extremely poor traction or greatly reduced mobility. Humanitarian deminers can afford to sacrifice their mobility for the significantly improved protection. However, military deminers operate at 20 feet per minute and combat troops must operate at a faster pace. In our Phase I project, we have developed a novel, lightweight blast attenuating material system to greatly improve the protection of both the current protective footwear as well as the combat boot without sacrificing any of the current traction or mobility.  Impact and blast test results show that our blast attenuator can reduce the peak impact force to less than 1/3 of that encountered in the conventional blast and combat boots.  With the proposed wave attenuator system the damage level of both the blast and combat boot was reduced by one level. At the end of this Phase II project our new blast attenuators will be ready for mass production and be adopted for use in the current footwear boot manufacturing and will be able to protect the entire foot from blast damage.  We expect to see near an order of magnitude of improvement over the current footwear at the end of this proposed Phase II research.",

The design of non-optimal, manual iteration engine-integrated inward turning scramjets with waverider vehicle shapes has already proven to be a powerful design technique.  Phase I of this SBIR initiated a program to develop new and integrate existing flow surface design tools so that a systems level optimization can be performed on an engine and vehicle simultaneously with the utilization of a commercial optimizer.  This tool is capable of designing integrated scramjet vehicles, creating the flow surfaces at cruise.  Phase II will extend the design and analysis of the integrated scramjet-vehicles off-design.  Analysis methods will be developed to analyze the flow surfaces over all points of a mission, including transonic performance and acceleration to cruise.  This will allow the optimization of an integrated engine-vehicle and trajectory over predetermined mission requirements.  Computational and experimental validation of an engine-integrated vehicle design is planned.

        "abstract": "As the demand for high performance propellants rises, so does the demand for assurance of overall safety of personnel and equipment in the vicinity of such materials.  Liquid propellants such as hypergolic fuels, although hazardous, have successfully been in use for decades.  The demand for such propellants aboard a naval ship or other enclosed spaces is an emerging requirement that cannot be met without proper safety precautions.  The number one priority in safety is detection.  This effort would develop an automated, continuous hypergolic leak detection network that does not require calibration or routine maintenance for at least four years.  The system must be able to detect to a few parts-per-billion (ppb) any of the common types of hypergolic fuels and oxidizers including monomethylhydrazine (MMH), unsymmetric dimethylhydrazine (UDMH), and nitrogen tetroxide (NTO).  It should be readily integrateable with existing components such as missiles, missile canisters, shipboard electronics, passageways, and alarm systems.  It should be easily modified or reconfigured for use in a wide range of environments such as manufacturing, storage, transport, shipboard, aircraft, etc.",

        "abstract": "Many of the areas designated for Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) and Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS) are contaminated with Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) that needs to be cleared of before being returned to civilian use. Despite the significant research and development efforts, there is still plenty of room for improving the UXO detection technologies. For EMI and GPR sensors, the predominantly metallic UXO poses less of a problem for detection. The limiting factor is the high false alarms caused by metallic clutter often prevalent at those survey sites that add considerably to the clean-up cost due to the excavation. To mitigate the false alarms, many signal processing methods have been proposed that adapt the sensor signal to local environment, and/or impose UXO specific features to better differentiate UXO from clutter objects. Although many of the methods show good potential in a controlled environment, their actual performances in more realistic field tests often degrade, sometimes significantly, from those achieved in the laboratory settings due to the variability and diversity of UXO and the uncertainty in the UXO locations. In this effort, we propose several approaches for object feature extraction, feature selection, and classification of the detected objects. The main theme of our proposed approaches is to ensure robustness of the resultant UXO classification results under conditions that are not exactly the same as those assumed by the simplified target models or those of the training data.",

        "abstract": "Welkin Sciences (WS) proposes to develop the Configurable Link Test Set (CoLTS), an affordable hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) channel simulator design specifically for MDA test programs. Like the Defense Threat Reduction Agency\u2019s test sets, CoLTS can distort real RF signals using the same disturbed propagation channel models found in COMLNK (a widely used software package for evaluating and testing modem designs hardened for HANE-disturbed channels). IFICS, being a missile communication link, must accommodate the rapid path length variability arising from the high acceleration of the missile-borne transceivers. CoLTS can also offset RF signals in delay and frequency to accurately emulate the IFICS-specific platform dynamics. New test functions can readily be integrated into the CoLTS system architecture to support custom test requirements.  The CoLTS design supports a wide range of signal bandwidths and channel conditions by allowing the user to choose from the following six baseband sample rates: 40 Msps, 20 Msps, 10 Msps, 5 Msps, 2.5 Msps and 1.25 Msps. The 48-tap convolver in each CoLTS channel respectively supports frequency-selective bandwidths down to 468 KHz, 234 KHz, 117 KHz, 59 KHz, 29 KHz, and 15 KHz.",

In Phase I, we derived a localization algorithm that correlates measured multipath arrival angle and travel time structures of target echoes with that predicted by an efficient numerical propagation model.  Target localization is accomplished by searching over a scan region to find the best match between measured and modeled data and exploits the IUWS-HF system\u2019s exceptional range and vertical angle of arrival resolution.  The approach lends itself well to use in a real-time system, and can be implemented with minimal impact to the existing processor\u2019s architecture.  Here we propose a Phase II follow-on effort to continue algorithm development and performance evaluations.  Our main task for Phase II will be to assess the performance of the algorithm using data collected during White Ship Trials of the IUWS-HS system.

Unsteady computational aeroelastic simulations of these problems require careful attention to the physical modules of fluid and structures, as well as, to the fluid-structure interfacing and fluid-grid movement. In the Phase I study, a novel solid-brick analogy (SBA) was developed to model deformation and motion of fluid mesh. The results showed that the novel SBA method prevents grid crossing, highly reduce grid distortion, and is computationally efficient with the use of modal superposition. Phase I study demonstrated the feasibility of the method for several aeroelastic problems.  In Phase II, the main focus will be on coupling validated high-fidelity CSD, CFD codes and interface modules along with the SBA technology through MDICE, which is selected as the multiphysics computational framework. MDICE will provide automatic fluid-structure exchange and temporal synchronization of all physical modules. Additionally, the SBA module will be enhanced by; a) development of an adaptive window technique, b) adding capabilities to support multi-grid technologies and c) adding support for control surface motions. The computational framework will be validated and demonstrated for several dynamic loads problems, such as tail buffeting of F/A-18 and X-35, and wing flutter of F16 and AGARD wing. The proposed Phase II effort will result in a unique multiphysics framework to analyze and control dynamic loads problems of modern aerospace vehicles.",

The current technology is capable of tracking only one object at a time, where the capability of handling as many as 61 objects simultaneously is desired.  In the Phase I topic statement, it was assumed that this could be accomplished by developing algorithms to be applied to data obtained by a conventional tracking radar.  During Phase I we showed that such a radar has no inherent capability for tracking multiple objects, regardless of the sophistication of the processing algorithms that are applied. The radar must have very high resolution for tracking bombs, and since no suitable (and affordable) radar exists, we are proposing to develop such a system in Phase II.  This prototype system will be fully functional, and capable of tracking practically any number of bombs and other objects.  The only compromise being made in the prototype system is that the radar data will be recorded in real time, but the processing of data will be done after a mission.  The system will be designed, however, with the aim of incorporating real-time processing in the future.",

The objective of this project is development, performance testing and delivery of a 3D image correlation system using digital high speed cameras that obtains full-field strain maps at data acquisition rates of up to 250,000 frames per second.  In Phase I, strain concentrations around a 0.0625\u201d diameter hole in a copper specimen were clearly visualized and quantified, and necking evolution was profiled at 10 microsecond increments on a dogbone specimen.

Variability of the oceanographic temperature field affects the sound speed structure and, therefore, acoustic propagation.  With the development of dynamic ocean models and long-life Autonomous Undersea Vehicles for ocean sampling, the Navy has a need for an adaptive Environmental Measurement Mission Planner (EMMP).  The Environmental Measurement Mission Planner (EMMP) system addresses all aspects of this problem.  The algorithm models the ocean, using state of the art physics models, estimates optimal sensor deployment strategies (and adaptively updates these while data is being taken) and assimilates the measured data into the oceanographic models.  The EMMP system architecture is based upon the following critical features which we believe are fundamental to the problem: (1) Accurate ocean model prediction requires data-assimilation; (2) Optimal data assimilation requires adaptive sampling; and (3) Cost effectiveness requires optimizing sensor deployment based upon users needs.  During Phase I, OASIS developed an optimal sensor planning algorithm based upon the Genetic Algorithm.  In Phase II, this system will be integrated with a numerical ocean model (including data-assimilation and forecasting) and tested at sea.",

        "abstract": "Tactical environments impose constraints on service-oriented architecture that are not present in the strategic and commercial worlds. These constraints include limited service lifetimes, changing access points, and limited bandwidth. Many of these can be overcome by mediating service requests through a service broker. Java Business Integration provides an open standard for creating such a broker, and also offers a framework for the insertion of value-added services, including third-party products. Value-added services can include automated bridges to peer-to-peer networks such as that of Future Combat Systems. The availability of such bridges, whose creation can be automated, will allow peer-to-peer networks to interact seamlessly with providers of web services. The introduction of service brokers, particularly multiple brokers acting in concert, can also provide correct bindings to identical service providers that differ only in current context properties, such as geographic location; the resolution of such providers is another significant problem in tactical environments.",

OCC\u2019s proprietary optoelectronic interconnect technology provides multiband optical communication by integrating multi-wavelength VCSEL and resonance cavity photodetector arrays with shared optical waveguides, while in-line semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA) are incorporated to provide either distributed optical gain within satellites or to provide output/input power amplification for intersatellite communication.  Together they enable a seamless inter-satellite and intra-satellite optical network architecture that provides low-latency, fault-tolerant and protocol-independent switching between network nodes under distributed routing control.  The new transmitter/receiver design will monolithically integrate high performance SOAs with OCC\u2019s OE modules to boost the WDM signals before transmission or to pre-amplify them before photodetection. Optical amplification increases the system margin and compensates optical losses, thereby extending the number of nodes that can be interconnected without intermediate optical-to-electrical-to-optical conversion. The SOA can also provide sufficient optical amplification to transmit WDM optical signals facross much larger intersatellite link distances.   Different SOA designs for both inter-satellite links and intra-satellite networks will be investigated.",

The benefits of AVHRE result from the combination of four innovations: (1) the patented vortex injection technique which generates a coaxial vortex pair, driving high solid-fuel regression rates and improved combustion efficiency; (2) high-regression rate paraffin solid fuels; (3) patented regression sensor technology, and (4) a new fuel formulation innovation to control the solid fuel regression characteristics and provide improved structural integrity of the grain. These innovations simplify hybrid rocket design, development, and manufacture both inherently and by providing many practical design degrees of freedom that can be harnessed for a given application.  Specific benefits of the AVHRE technology include: (1) increased propellant mass fractions; (2) the ability to tailor and optimize a hybrid propulsion system for a given application; (3) increased ISP efficiency; (4) a reduction or elimination of residual fuel; (5) improved grain structural integrity and increased thermal properties; and (6) reduced need for thermal insulation.

CWIS communicates in this environment via Extended Markup Language (XML).  In Phase II, CWIS will be expanded to include the SOAP, UDDI, and WSDL services needed for full web-based interaction in the USAFC2B environment, and serve as a translator between the USAFC2B environment and CDAS TCT.  CWIS will allow CDAS to communicate with other joint targeting systems such as AFATDS and TBMCS in order to provide advanced CDAS TCT capabilities.

This objective represents a significant opportunity to improve the quality and effectiveness of investment decisions for ship systems. Assessing affordability in the initial screening of alternatives \u2013 a process that has traditionally been made primarily based on system effectiveness, will greatly improve the decision process. Affordability is often not considered until a screened set of alternatives was established, even though experience shows that affordability needs to be considered from the beginning of the conceptual development process and then reevaluated throughout all project phases. Additionally, this effort will demonstrate how Navy ship-system data sources can be integrated together within a structured desktop computer-tool to provide both insight and traceability from requirements analysis\u2014to performance evaluation\u2014to Life Cycle Cost (LCC). This evaluation concept provides insight into the parameters affecting Navy system affordability, such as cost, performance, risk, and schedule.

Emphasis will be placed on the special requirements of the IP-AN, including diversity of devices and links, high speed of movement, very low resident time in the network and the vast distances between nodes. Phase I addressed defining wireless networking architectures and initial designs that provide high bandwidth, energy efficient, communication links between disparate wireless networks; specifically the IP-AN; identifying the best two routing algorithms and projected throughput enhancement from their use; and modeling and simulating the performance of the routing algorithms for the IP-AN. The new protocol will support improved power management, better throughput for unicast and multicast communication (by utilizing multiple routes simultaneously), and better reliability. This leads to a preliminary design of prototype systems that enable energy efficient ad-hoc networking amongst heterogeneous devices in the IP-AN including at least one JTRS compliant device. The design will be completed in Phase II, wherein the prototype systems will be developed, and demonstrated.",

While there are many successes in developing composite-based Thermal Planes for advanced avionics applications, limited effort has been spent on the enclosure and significantly less on the card guide. The objective of this program is to design, fabricate and qualify a functional and light-weight composite avionics enclosure equipped with liquid-cooled card guides for high-power electronic modules currently being used on many advanced military aircrafts. Our initial effort will be focused on the development of advanced card guides using high-conductivity carbon-based materials. A typical card guide consists of card rails and an integrated heat exchanger. There are three critical thermal resistances along the entire thermal path \u2013 module to rail, rail to heat exchanger and heat exchanger to ambient.  We propose to use high conductivity carbon material for the rail and to develop a high performance heat exchanger using advanced carbon-based materials for the core.

It is straightforward to measure the surface energy of a planar composite using, for example, contact angle measurements obtained from a range of probe liquids.  However, once a surface has been roughened on a microscopic scale by a process such as grit blasting, quantifying the surface energy becomes a much more difficult task.  In Phase I it was demonstrated that the wetting behavior of a single carefully chosen probe liquid is an excellent predictor of subsequent adhesive bond performance, even on a highly roughened surface.  It was further demonstrated that the probe liquid wetting behavior was well quantified by measuring the diameter of a small drop of known volume.    This technique provides fundamental information about the relationship between contamination, surface energy and performance for adhesively bonded composites.  Phase II will use this technique to evaluate a wide range of substrates, adhesives, and contaminants.  A practical prototype measuring tool for evaluating surface energy using this technique will be constructed and evaluated in a manufacturing environment.",

Initial simulations for both concepts show potential for orders of magnitude reduction in false exceedance rates for conditions pertinent to a surveillance system. One concept, called the Spatially Coincident Two-Color Sensor (SCOTS), employs standard spatial or temporal filtering for background suppression in two pass bands that are subject to different source phenomenologies: one band (SWIR) subject to solar scatter and the other band (MWIR or MLWIR) subject to thermal emissions. The key innovative step for this concept is a subsequent \u201cspatially coincident\u201d filtering that takes advantage of the fact that the clutter exceedances in the two bands are not, in general, co-located at geospatial positions on the earth\u2019s surface and therefore, not co-located in the sensor\u2019s angular space.

        "abstract": "A Scramjet/Ramjet Heat Exchanger Analysis Tool (SRHEAT(TM)) is proposed for rapid design and optimization of complex thermal cooling systems. The basic SRHEAT(TM) code was developed under the Phase I SBIR. The objective of this Phase II program is to enhance the current SRHEAT(TM) code functions by adding additional capabilities that will provide increased accuracy and ease of use to the existing tool, while maintaining the ability to quickly evaluate multiple scenarios and trade studies. This additional capability provides the user with not only a quick trade study tool, but also a tool for performing the detailed follow-on analysis, all with a single code.   In the emerging field of high-speed aerospace, it is necessary that rapid modeling of complex thermal systems be accomplished to enable the trade studies required to optimize the design for weight, cost, and performance. To meet this need, SPIRITECH proposes the development of a ramjet/scramjet heat exchanger design and optimization tool that performs a thermal analysis of the heat exchanger, assesses its structural strength, and optimizes its design for minimum cooling flow and weight. Options for selecting the coolant fuel and heat exchanger material will be made available so that their effects may be determined.",

Orora believes that automation provided through optimization,  innovative circuit techniques, and accurate behavioral modeling  hold the key to enabling low-cost rapid prototyping of critical  analog and mixed-signal functions.

        "abstract": "High noise environments increase the difficulty of face-to-face communications, with or without the use of hearing protection.   Further, understanding the acoustic cues that are available in the environment for maintaining situational awareness becomes increasingly difficult as background noise levels increase.  It is imperative to provide high-performing hearing protection devices for use in these high levels of noise.  Therefore, methods are needed such that face-to-face communications and situational awareness can be restored to the user without causing further increases in the sound power reaching the outer ear.  Combined autonomous level control for localization/talk-through and acoustic noise dosimetry provide the maximum amount of safe exposure coupled with situational awareness that can be offered.  This Phase II effort will provide each of the advanced technologies on a variety of protector platforms including single hearing protection and double hearing protection, circumaural earcups and custom earplugs.  These combined technologies will also provide the critical data for establishing a well structured hearing conservation program within the US Navy.  A number of complimentary programs currently underway at ATI will benefit and enhance the parallel efforts anticipated by this Phase II proposal, including flight deck hearing protector development and flight deck head protector design and development.",

Since the base-collector junction is all that is required for radiation detection, functionality is a 100% test.

These sensors have many advantages over conventional technologies, including low cost, flexible packaging, high accuracy, large bandwidth, and low profile.

The Phase II will build on the results of the Phase I through improvements to the performance of the sensors and the methods used to characterize their performance.  Through advancements to the fabrication process, the signal-to-noise ratio, sensitivity, and long-term stability will be improved.  Also, upgrades to the test methods will allow the sensors to be characterized over a wider range of shear, Reynolds number, and frequency.  This testing will include laminar tests with both constant and fluctuating shear as well as testing in turbulent boundary layers.  Benchmarking and validation of the sensors will be performed against known analytical solutions for shear as well as other shear measurement technologies.

The ultimate goal is to design a rotor that requires neither mechanical nor elastomeric dampers. However, in the near term, substantial improvements to lag damper technology are needed. Techno-Sciences, Inc. in collaboration with Bell Helicopter Textron, Lord Corporation and the University of Maryland, will develop novel magnetorheological fluid elastomeric (MRFE) lag dampers to meet this need, and to ultimately augment stability of the rotor hub of the Army\u2019s H1 helicopter and its variants (Huey, Huey II, Super Cobra), and with direct applicability to the Bell-430 civil helicopter, which has a similar rotor hub configuration. The implementation of adaptive lag damping using magnetorheological fluid elastomeric (MRFE) dampers may greatly enhance stability of the rotor hub over a wide range of temperature, amplitude of motion of blades in the rotor plane (lag mode), and flight conditions. Application of MRFE damper technology to future H-1 rotor upgrades may provide key benefits including high damping to enhance stability augmentation of the rotor in high speed flight conditions, and low damping in flight conditions where damping is not as critical so as to reduce rotor hub loads. The MRFE technology may provide significant savings in aircraft maintenance and operational costs. To enable retro-fit to existing rotor systems, the electrical power required to operate the actuator will be drawn from the DC power bus supplying the main rotor de-icing system. MRFE technology will also enable additional capability on the Bell-430 aircraft, a civil helicopter with a hub/dampers similar to those of the H-1.",

Once mounted on an aircraft, these tubes are difficult to access externally, making inspection of the tube from the inside the most practical method for NDI. The Navy has identified a specific need for the NDI of titanium tubing with diameters ranging from 0.25 to 0.75 inches. The defects are micro-cracks with depth dimensions of 0.5 to 1.0 mils in tubing with wall thickness that is typically 22.5 mils. These defects are exceedingly small and will require new technology for dependable detection. RMD proposes a new inspection technology based on high resolution, 3-D imaging of magnetic fields induced in titanium tubing to locate and characterize microscopic defects. The proposed NDI system will use a new sensor technology to produce an advanced sensor array with minute elements measuring only 3 microns (0.1 mils).

The sensors are fabricated on silicon that is compatible with high volume, low cost production with integrated amplifiers and signal processing circuitry on the same chip. The technology can analyze and image defects in true 3-D. RMD has assembled a strong research team with substantial experience in sensor and instrumentation design and fabrication.

This system will be based on the FarSounder 3D sonar technology and will utilize COTS components which will leverage FarSounder`s advanced processing techniques to increase the system`s performance when compared to currently available port security sonars. For this Phase I effort FarSounder will perform a feasibility study and develop a concept design for the 3D Underwater Threat system. Phase II will deliver a prototype low cost, low power, small size system for incorporation into a multifaceted Port Security System. The ultimate commercialized system will be easy to use, easy to deploy, have a low false alarm and fall within the goal of less than $100K per 1000 feet of protected asset. The system will have the ability to detect open circuit divers, closed circuit divers, divers with propulsion assistance and underwater vehicles that approach or enter the security zone and provide an alert to a central station or system operator. FarSounder`s solution will have a high probability of detection of real underwater threats and a low false alarm rate for these targets. Through simulation, field testing with existing hardware and acoustic modeling, FarSounder will validate the key elements of the design. Phase I objectives are to develop a solution concept with effective performance and end usability in mind; demonstrate that shallow water detection of targets in 3D is possible; demonstrate that detection of swimmer size targets is possible with FarSounder`s 3D approach; study feasibility of target classification and identification; and develop a hardware architecture that utilizes all COTS components to ensure affordable future product costs. Benefits include increased protection of ports, critical waterside infrastructures and other fixed shoreline sites and prevention of attacks affecting large areas of local populations such as those near LNG terminals. The system will provide the first underwater port security system practical for use in all US ports and along extensive areas of US coastlines and inland waterways. Spinoff commercial applications include a solution for the protection of endangered marine mammals, by enabling effective localization, identification and avoidance of these mammals; a cost efficient localization and identification sonar appropriate for the $3.2B annual US fisheries industry to reduce bycatch ; and a lowcost Onboard security sonar system for commercial cargo ships, oil tankers, passenger vessels and large recreational boats.",

In the proposed concept, the water recovery system and process are completely separate from the fuel cell exhaust stream by the membrane, and therefore, the process can be optimized independently and integration into the existing fuel cell system will be relatively simple.    In Phase I, we successfully demonstrated exceptionally high water recovery efficiency from the simulated fuel cell exhaust stream by employing a water permselective membrane technology.  The measured water recovery efficiency was as high as 94% and 82% for air sweep and vacuum pervaporation mode of operations, respectively.  We also successfully established and optimized system and process parameters to significantly improve efficiency, durability, versatility and reliability of the water recovery process.  In Phase II, we will further optimize the membrane materials and process schematics to produce a high temperature compatible and energy efficient water recovery system.  At the end of the Phase II, we will assemble and deliver a fully optimized water recovery system for field testing at Air Force.",

        "abstract": "There is a growing interest in the development of accurate and fast-running target vulnerability models that address the combined effect of fragment and blast on the damage of structures. Here by blast we refer to the dynamic pressure loading due to explosion in either air or water, or to the hydrodynamic ram as a fragment travels through a liquid. For the kill radii of interest, the fragments from the warhead typically arrive before the blast and perforate the structure.  When the blast arrives it is loading this weakened, perforated, cracked structure. This increases the degree of damage to the plate well beyond what it would have sustained without the fragment-induced damage.  Typically cracks propagate from the fragment-produced hole, petals are formed and the plate tears.  Existing survivability and vulnerability codes simply add the cross sectional area of the fragments impacting the plate to determine the total hole area, ignoring fragment-fragment interactions, fragment-blast interactions and the potential for overlap of these areas.   In this Phase II effort, we propose to develop an engineering model to predict the damage of a plate (metal or composite) subject to ballistic impact followed by blast pressure loading accounting for the interactions discussed above.  Our model development derives from controlled tests in a scaled Ram Gun system, Finite Element Analyses and simplified analytical models.  This three prong approach is critical since neither area of study alone can produce the desired results within a reasonable time frame or budget.  The model developed here can be interfaced with larger applications such as COVART, AJEM and Endgame Framework to expand their predictive capability.",

        "abstract": "IPITEK proposes polymer-based, integrated, optical bus interface module (OBIM). The OBIM is a critical element for the optical transmission bus and the access node in a military bi-directional broadcast bus topology, which is more reliable and rugged and also supporting Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), for the simultaneous transmission of multi-protocol digital and analog RF signals in the military very high-speed, optical data transformation networking systems. The polymer-based OBIM integrates passive and active components, transmitting and distributing a wide variety of sensors, control and communication signals with minimum latency. The OBIM is basically \u201clossless\u201d since the splitting losses in the node are fully compensated by the optical gain provided by its active components. In the Phase I work we modeled, designed and fabricated polymer-based passive components, including couplers and Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexed (DWDMs). We demonstrated a polymer-based waveguide bus, 50/50 and 30/70 couplers. The test results of the component specifications were satisfied as designed. One remarkable achievement was that we successfully fabricated a single mode, Er/Yb-doped polymer channel waveguide for optical amplifications. Under limited pumping power the gain ratio in the Er/Yb-doped polymer waveguide was 0.7 dB/cm, which was ~ thirty times higher than Er-fiber (typically, 0.025 dB/cm or 2.5 dB/m). In Phase II we will deliver prototyped, fully functional polymer IOBIMs to DARPA in system testing. The prototype IOBIM includes passive transmission bus, couplers and WDMs, and active optical amplifiers, which provide sufficient optical amplifications to compensate the losses in the optical add-drop multiplexing (OADM) nodes. Based on the success of the polymer-based optical amplifier in Phase II, in Phase III we would make new commercial products of optically- and electrically-pumped polymer-based optical amplifiers.",

The device is ideally suited to detection of airborne chemical agents and TICS, at 1 to 100 parts per trillion, well below permissible exposure limits. The MP-100 is modular, rugged, compact and inexpensive (~$1500 each).  A vapor preconcentrator is integrated with photoacoustic detection using high-sensitivity MEMS microphones. A novel field-widened interferometer provides high throughput of infrared energy. A computer-machined aluminum housing and COTS handheld computer complete the system.  Dr. McClelland will manage integration of the photoacoustic cell and MEMS microphone. Dr. Manning, the Principal Investigator, is an internationally recognized spectrometer design expert. Military applications include a variety of sensing activities for personnel protection.

The vast size of lands to be monitored, together with lack of reliable and cheap electricity, makes currently available wireless technologies inadequate and extremely inefficient and costly. During the Phase I study, SDRC has been designing and evaluating the SensorBone system architecture that addresses the fundamental challenges such as energy-efficient, long-range, and low-duty-cycle optimized radio design, scalable networking protocols, and cost-effective hardware platforms. Our novel design leverages the latest developments in the mobile ad hoc network (MANET), low-duty-cycle sensor network and extremely energy-efficient sensor radio technologies, and aims for the eventual hardware implementation and demonstration of the SensorBone system. The Phase II work will encompass the entire system design cycle of the SensorBone system, including design and evaluation of the system architecture, development of the hardware platform, development of the SensorBone radio, protocol stack implementation in both the network simulator and on the hardware platform, and development of the network deployment and management tools. The resulting SensorBone system prototype will be demonstrated using actual environmental sensors deployed in a field such as Ft. Benning.",

The proposed approach developed at Corvid is referred to as the Virtual Geometry Insertion (VGI) technique. This approach allows for the virtual insertion of arbitrary geometric components into a standard CFD analysis.  This geometry insertion is done without the traditional CFD solver requirement of a body fitted grid surrounding the geometry of interest, and hence, the virtual geometry is fully decoupled from the underlying computational domain.  The primary benefit of this decoupling is that the geometry is free to move through the underlying domain during the solution analysis. Thus, resulting in transient solid body geometric motion without the typical instabilities associated with body movement in CFD analyses.  Additional benefits of the approach include rapid parametric analysis, dynamic body motion, and increased numerical stability.",

This proposed DHS work will develop the sample extraction and purification methods needed to complement CMSS\u00bf ongoing two year $1M NIH Biodefense Phase I grant that will produce the hardware and driving systems needed for novel bacteria immuno-capture and transduction on an EWOD sensing cartridge. This hybridization of channel and droplet-based sample handling on a generic slide cartridge will enable elegant transfer of channel-based separation products to an array of electronic, optical, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), mass spectrometry (MS) instrumentation.

The overall goal of this research is to provide the radars of Aegis BMD with robust physics-based methods for discriminating the lethal reentry vehicle from among large numbers of clutter and threat-like objects associated with advanced countermeasures. TSC\u2019s Phase I approach will be refined and applied to specific Aegis BMD target models, scenarios and radar systems during Phase II. TSC\u2019s technique provides seamless simultaneous determination of target rotational state and static RCS patterns. This is an innovation over traditional radar discrimination features such as RCS statistics and apparent length, which are derived from time-dependent radar signatures and do not estimate genuine invariant properties of the target or its motion state. Precise estimation of the rotational motion of targets is key to successfully exploiting information from multiple sensors. This Phase II program focuses on practical implementation of a new algorithm for estimating target rotational motion state, as applied to the S- and X-band radars of Aegis BMD.",

Simply rewriting legacy code to achieve the transformation to OA is cost prohibitive.  New engineering tools are essential to identify, extract, and reuse legacy software to speed the transition to OA.  Products today typically analyze just one programming language, or convert one programming language into a second language, requiring separate transcoders for every source/target pair. ONE tool is needed that facilitates the conversion of multiple source languages into multiple target languages via a malleable intermediary format that works with many programming languages.  Harmonia proposes to prototype such a tool in this Phase II effort, called the Legacy Analysis Workbench (LAW). LAW will reverse-engineer multiple programming languages to an XML meta-model of programming languages and the platform on which the code executes. This one powerful meta-tool helps automate many steps in creating the model, analyzing it to identify code segments to reuse, surgically extracting those portions, and forward engineering to new programming languages.

        "abstract": "This proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of producing GaN-based semiconductor devices on a high thermal conductivity silicon-on-diamond (SOD) substrate where the substrate is a sandwich of silicon, diamond and silicon. Semiconductor power devices for radar applications are limited in performance and end-of-life (EOL) reliability due to high device operating temperatures. DoD electronic systems are being designed to accommodate higher power transmitters that generate larger thermal loads. The critical reliability issue is minimizing thermal energy near the transistor\u2019s junction or channel. AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures provide higher efficiency of electrical energy in switching, but maximum performance is still limited by the thermal management problem during device operation. To improve energy transport capability of GaN technology, thermal conductivity must be maximized as close as possible to the transistor\u2019s active region. Diamond provides the highest thermal conductivity possible and therefore diamond thin films would be the ideal substrate material for high power/high frequency semiconductor devices. It has already been demonstrated that GaN can be successfully grown on silicon substrates.   The objective of this proposal is therefore to combine GaN growth on silicon with a diamond heat spreader structure built into the silicon wafer using known SOI fabrication technology.",

ARG is a combination of new technology components of the Advanced MERG (Magnetohydrodynamic Effect Rate Gyro)for low frequency measurement (DC-1+Hz), and latest passive MHD sensors for high frequency (1-1000+ Hz). The ARG inherits all of the desirable features of ATA's passive MHD sensors, including low linear acceleration sensitivity, low cross axis angular sensitivity (cross coupling), ultra-low noise, combined with high stability, ruggedness and reliability, and low radiation susceptibility.  The resulting sensor technology combination yields the best overall noise PSD from constant rate (DC) to very high frequency (greater than 1kHz) with the added benefit of broadband response.

These FSMs must be capable of controlling large 12-inch mirrors while handling the HEL power levels. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that a FSM mechanism (substrate and mounting structure) can be designed and built to have structural frequencies high enough to provide a 2 KHz open-loop bandwidth using conventional control algorithms as this would require structural frequencies on the order of 6-10 KHz. Applied Technology Associates proposes to provide the Missile Defense Agency innovative, adaptive mirror control concepts for high bandwidth (2 KHz) fast steering mirrors that can accommodate lower mirror structural frequencies. A Model Reference Adaptive Filter approach is the leading candidate for accomplishing this. In this concept, an ideal plant response is designated the model. Then a real-time adaptive filter is included in the control loop of the plant such that its filtered response matches the model. This technique automatically identifies and compensates for structural resonances, and furthermore can adapt if those characteristics change over time.

Creare\u2019s Flight Test Assistant (FTA) takes full advantage of these new technologies to address issues of instrumentation cost, test productivity, and data quality.  Our FTA combines off-the-shelf sensors with dynamic calibration routines and innovative estimation algorithms to provide accurate test results.  Key enabling technologies include a robust speaker-adaptive speech recognition engine that remains reliable in challenging cockpit noise levels.  An object-oriented graphical programming environment facilitates pre-flight system configuration with a minimal learning curve.  In flight, an intuitive display interface provides feedback on test execution and test point quality.  In Phase I, we proved the feasibility of the FTA concept by demonstrating key technologies in a prototype system.  Accurate voice recognition in noise was confirmed in Creare\u2019s acoustic test facility.  Dynamic calibration and estimation was demonstrated in flight tests with a representative sensor suite, while prototype operation was evaluated in a flight simulator.  In Phase II, we will complete the system and validate its performance in a series of flight tests.",

The phonon scattering provided by the process as proven in the Phase I program manifests high ZT thermoelectric material, providing for future enhanced fuel economy via waste-heat to electrical energy conversion as well as provide quiet, efficient standalone power from dedicated intentional fuel sources or naturally occurring heat harvesting circumstances such as internal combustion engines.

        "abstract": "The implementation of hub motors in materials handling equipment such as bombloaders allows great benefits in terms of design flexibility and increased mobility.  By moving the prime mover off of the main chassis of the vehicle large amounts of space is gained for robotic equipment for materials handling, cargo, munitions, or other special requirements.  With the appropriate vehicle geometry, hub motors also allow the possibility of a zero turning radius or infinite variability through omni-directional wheels.  Adding to these benefits, gearing and drive shafting can be essentially eliminated.  Expensive and complex parts such as transmissions and differentials are not needed in a hub motor driven vehicle.  Hub motors are also applicable to both hybrid and pure electric vehicles that have better overall vehicle efficiency than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles.  Hub motors can also have other cost and logistic advantages in terms of interchangeability between many different pieces of equipment.  UQM has been in the business of producing high torque and high power density PM brushless motors for over 20 years.  UQM plans to implement new motor design topologies to meet the high torque density demands of direct drive and geared hub motors.",

The modulators employ a spatially continuous deformable mirror surface that does not produce the diffraction and scattering artifacts of discrete pixels.  They also offer continuous analog gray-scale light modulation that gives a more realistic rendition of the scene than the pulse-width-modulation scheme offered by others.  The Phase II program: (1) develops modifications to our existing high-voltage VLSI circuit substrates, (2) re-engineers the modified membrane-mirror-on-VLSI modulator for low-voltage (~ 40V) operation at visible and mid-infrared wavelengths, (3) develops the scene-generation software and hardware interfaces needed to project simultaneous dual-band scenes, (4) analyzes and optimizes the trade-space parameters for various scene projection needs, and (5) begins exploratory work on commercial product development based on the technology.

        "abstract": "The objective of this proposed SBIR Phase II project is to demonstrate (using Monte Carlo simulations) the practicality of new algorithms to substantially improve track consistency in network centric sensor data fusion.  Track consistency is the property that the computed error covariance matrix of a track realistically represents the uncertainty of the actual errors of the target track.   Tracker computed error covariance matrices are used in data (and track) association processing and in the track filter.  Consequently, degraded track consistency causes data misassociations (assignment of the wrong measurement or local track to a network track) that will substantially degrade fusion tracking performance.  Performance of subsequent processing functions, such as for discrimination, sensor resource management, and weapons resource management depend not only on the accuracy of each track but may use the covariance matrix to indicate how accurate each track is.  Hence, an inconsistent track covariance can mislead the subsequent processing and the warfighter about how good each track is. Our Phase I effort proved the feasibility for new processing methods to correct for the common causes of degraded track consistency in fusion tracks, such as, misassociations (miscorrelations), residual sensor biases, and tracker design model parameter errors.",

As interceptor technology continues to evolve, the requirement is for higher wire count, more complex electrical routing of power and signal conductors, interfaces and connectors.  The current state of the art for electrical harness design and fabrication methods, as applied to the Kinetic Energy Interceptor (KEI) vehicle, results in components which exceed the weight design objective by a significant margin.  The KEI missile represents a unique opportunity for technology integration because it is currently in the early design phase.  The proposed program addresses the KEI raceway fairing and wire harness design objective and development milestone, and is synchronized with the KEI program.  In a phased development approach, the program will provided the necessary design, analyses and component verification testing to support the Boost Flight-1 preliminary and critical design reviews currently scheduled for 3rd QTR CY 06 and 4th QTR CY 07 respectively.

The development of a multi-functional coating with advanced performance properties is critical to achieving a single step corrosion inhibiting topcoat to replace the current two-coat system.

In Phase I, SBIR Proposal Number F05-133-3538, feasibility of a multi-functional coating with advanced performance properties was demonstrated.  In general, the latest generation of products developed during Phase I show comparable performance results to the current two-coat system.  Phase II will pursue advanced development of a multi-functional coating.  Multi-functional coating formulations will be optimized, scaled-up, and tested for performance and application properties. A commercialized, multi-functional coating or self-priming topcoat could be utilized by both military and commercial aircraft entities on original equipment repaint operations and repairs in the field.  It could also be commercialized for use on Air Force ground support equipment and US. Army combat vehicles and equipment.

The recuperator will offer substantial system weight reduction, volume reduction, and performance increases for a cryocooler that can be used for Block 12 as well as any other space-based cryocooling needs.  Advanced micro-manufacturing technology is needed to fabricate the required micro channel features that make it possible to achieve the performance requirements for a RTB cryocooler in a light weight package.  In addition to design, fabrication, and demonstration of the recuperator, this program will also lead to substantial micro-manufacturing process improvements that can be used to form advanced regenerators, nano-sensors, micro-fluidic networks, and optical devices.   The primary reason a RTB cyocooler is not contemplated for use in future STSS blocks is its relatively high mass.  The present recuperators, although considered state-of-the-art, are the primary reason why the mass is high relative to Stirling cycle variants.  The proposed project would result in mass reduction of the recuperator over 75% with even higher thermal performance.

Luna Innovations has clearly demonstrated the feasibility of monitoring corrosion rate (corrosivity) in flowing water systems with an innovative sensor technology.  Luna\u2019s corrosivity sensors are highly sensitive, highly accurate (one to one relationship and excellent correlation (R2 > 0.99) between theoretical electrochemical measurements and sensor signal response), and repeatable.  The Phase I results also suggest that Luna\u2019s sensors have extended service lifetimes when compared to conventional electrochemical sensor techniques.  The focus of the Phase II program will be to achieve the proper balance of corrosion rate sensitivity, sensor service life, and durability by optimizing corrosivity sensor design, materials selection and construction.  The optoelectronic system hardware, software algorithms will also be optimized and tailored for monitoring corrosivity in piping systems.  At the end of the Phase II, Luna will demonstrate and deliver a prototype system for monitoring corrosivity and corrosion control.",

        "abstract": "Missile Defense Kinetic Kill Vehicle (MD-KKV) systems are required to operate in a fault tolerant manner even though exposed to the highly-stressing effects of nuclear-weapon detonations and the natural space radiation environments (which can be very harsh at northern latitudes during intense solar storms). Additionally, MD-KKV systems often are designed using commercial-grade/commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) parts in order to utilize the highest performance parts available. Satisfying all requirements simultaneously is a non-trivial challenge, since many COTS parts are susceptible to radiation-induced latchup. When a part suffers latchup, it may be permanently damaged, or it may be placed in a high dissipation, non-functional state from which it can only recover by by toggling power off, then on again. In either case, the system controller reacts to the radiation pulse by initiating the power-cycle routine. Since time is critical in terminal guidance, any such interruption could be mission-ending. Clearly, then, the use of latchup-susceptible parts types is high risk for a fault-tolerant system. Full Circle Research, Inc. and Raytheon Missile Systems are collaborating to develop the latchup-mitigation process proposed herein,which, once qualified, would potentially make a large number of otherwise unusable or high-risk latchup-susceptible COTS part types usable and low-risk in nuclear-hardened MDA assets, particularly missile-defense interceptors.",

Energy harvesting allows the realization of wireless monitoring systems that do not require battery maintenance.  During Phase I, our energy harvesting wireless sensors were optimized for helicopter pitch links.  A working laboratory demonstration, replicating level helicopter flight, was provided to the Navy for pitch link strain and load monitoring applications.   During Phase II, these systems will be miniaturized, shielded, environmentally hardened, environmentally tested, and flight tested on helicopters.  The rugged, miniaturized sensing systems that will result from the Phase II effort will be well suited to perform in military vehicles.  By combining energy harvesting & storage, micro-power sensing & data recording, wireless communications, and embedded load & damage tracking capabilities, this work will result in the realization of extremely powerful and versatile embedded sensing nodes. During the Phase II Option, the nodes shall be readied for transition by optimization, qualification, & production automation.

The Innovative Features of the project are:  \u2022 Detector Arrays on Type II SLS Material. High Performance Detector Arrays are designed on Type II SLS material. The Type II Detector has several advantages as compared to Type I HgCdTe and InSb Detectors. The advantages are: 1) higher performance due to longer minority carrier lifetime, 2) higher operating temperature due to low dark current, 3) wide range of spectral bands (SWIR, MWIR, LWIR, VLWIR), 4) very fast time response and 5) lower cost due to higher array uniformity and low cost large area substrate.   \u2022 Large Format MWIR FPA. 1024 x 10-24 element focal plane array with pixel size = 19.5 um x 19.5 um are designed for MWIR (3-5 um) waveband. The 1024 x 1024 element detector array is integrated with an existing ROIC with snapshot integration capability.   \u2022 High Reliability Passivation Scheme. The detector array is fabricated with high reliability radiation-hard passivation scheme.  \u2022 High Operating Temperature. The focal plane array can be operated at Uncooled (300K), thermo-electrically (T.E.) cooled (160K-250K) and cryogenic cooled (77K) temperature levels.   \u2022 Cost-Effective Product Development. The proposed product can be developed cost-effectively with reduced risk due to: 1) feasibility of fabricating of high performance, high temperature MWIR SLS detectors have already been demonstrated during Phase I of the contract, 2) snap-shot 1024 x 1024 element ROICs have already been developed and are available on the commercial market, 3) ADT is presently developing SLS products under an on-going Army/SMDC contract for a BAA solicitation.  Several of the tasks that are being conducted under this contact are directly applicable to the proposed project.     During Phase II, 1024 x 1024 Element Focal Plane Array will be fabricated on SLS material for MWIR (3-5 um) waveband. The Focal Plane Array will be integrated into a Dewar/Cooler Assembly and delivered to NAVAIR.  During Phase III, FPA/Dewar/Cooler Assembly will be integrated into Navy's LITENING Pod. An additional FPA/Dewar/Cooler Assembly will be fabricated for Navy's ATFLIR Pod, as an option. Also during Phase III, the following task will be completed: 1) Integration of 1024 x1024 element FPA/Dewar assembly into Navy Systems and  demonstration of improved targeting capability, 2) Development of Dual Band (MWIR/LWIR) FPAs and 3) Integration of Dual Band FPA/Dewar Assembly in Navy Systems.",

During the last two years, Numerica has partnered with the Missile Defense National Team-B (MDNTB) through the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, to support track processing needs within the Command, Control, Battle Management, and Communications (C2BMC) suite of the BMDS. In this time, Numerica has worked on a track-to-track correlation system called Multiple Hypothesis Correlation (MHC). In our Phase II effort, we propose to integrate the HMHC algorithm into the C2BMC suite of the BMD Benchmark by adding its hybrid fusion functionality to the MHC algorithm, which has been identified as the Spiral 6.2 C2BMC track correlator. We also propose to enhance the HMHC system by adding feature-aided track correlation and improving its ambiguity assessment, track initiation, and decorrelation algorithms. A key in this proposed HMHC Phase II program is that synergism is planned with the MHC developments for MDNTB.  The innovative, but higher complexity, concepts desired by MDNTB that require longer-term development will be pursued in the SBIR Phase II effort. Since Numerica has direct access to the MHC and can rapidly integrate any successful HMHC solutions, the SBIR program will provide a means for rapid transition of the technology into the C2BMC.",

        "abstract": "Since pure aluminum has only moderate strength, aluminum alloys are used for aerospace and other structural applications.  However, copper in these alloys significantly reduces the corrosion resistance of the aluminum.  The standard surface pretreatment used to prepare the aerospace aluminum alloys for painting and insure good adhesion actually makes the problem worse.   This aqueous surface cleaning pretreatment of causes dissolution, redistribution and enrichment of copper on the aluminum metal surfaces.  These copper enriched areas initiate the corrosion process because they support rapid oxygen reduction.  Therefore, the development of new aluminum cleaning methods and/or products that reduce copper dissolution and redeposition, is critical to reducing the corrosion of aerospace aluminum alloys and decreasing maintenance costs.  An ideal surface pretreatment would effectively degrease and deoxide the aluminum alloy surface while causing little or no copper enrichment.  TDA Research, Inc.

The antenna will have sufficient gain (~29 dBi) to make it a viable stand-alone product, or it can be used as a building block for a modular scaleable higher-gain antenna. 2-D beam steering will be demonstrated using a line array of MEMs phase shifters for H-plane scanning and frequency change for E-plane scanning.

Numerous design variants that employ a line array for H-plane scanning are possible, either with or without frequency steering. Frequency steering can be enhanced through the use of a high dielectric constant material in the CTS structure. Innovations that reduce device, feed, interconnect, and radiator losses, lead to an expected antenna efficiency of approximately 50%.

        "abstract": "There is widespread interest in reducing the toxicity and environmental hazards associated with conventional bipropellants.  Use of gelling agents has been shown to reduce the fuel\u2019s toxicity.  However the resultant gels often have significantly different rheological and combustion properties.  Use of these materials requires extensive modifications to fuel storage and transport systems as well as combustion engines and may require high temperature combustion initiation systems.  These modifications result in severe flight-weight and energy penalties.  Ogden Engineering & Associates, LLC was awarded a Phase I SBIR project to address these ongoing needs and to gain a fundamental understanding and preliminary characterization of novel hypergolic green fuels.  Through this Phase II proposal, the project team aims to further this understanding and intends to fully characterize a novel green fuel formulation as a potential replacement for existing, propellants that have undesirable toxic characteristics. Specific activities include optimizing chemical formulations and solvent additives to obtain reliable hypergolic combustion, and to identify conditions where the fuel can be used as a monopropellant and develop hardware for these applications.",

Building on the Phase I successes, indicators for optically sensing monomethylhydrazine (MMH) and nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) would be packaged as a thin film for deployment within the kill vehicle (KV). Battery replacement or servicing will not be needed once the sensor is installed inside the KV. A plurality of sensors would be networked for monitoring multiple required locations. During Phase II, the prototype would be engineered and its performances would be characterized to ensure compliance with KEI requirements with respect to parameters such as size, weight, sensitivity, response time, lack of false alarm, cross-sensitivity, temperature and humidity range, accuracy, reproducibility, measurement precision, operational life, and compatibility with the shipboard Command and Control System. At the end of Phase II, InnoSense LLC will deliver the prototype with a form factor compatible with the KEI Program for detecting the vapors of MMH and NTO at or below limits set by the regulatory agencies.

During the Phase I program, PSI demonstrated the ability to fabricate these composites into the complex shape components that are used in Solid Divert and Attitude Control Systems (SDACS). The low cost of the commercially available constituent materials, and the simplicity of the processing methods, should enable cost-effective production of SDACS for high performance missiles. This Phase II SBIR will further develop and demonstrate the PSI composites into structures that are one to one replacements for current SM-3 TDACS components, yet enable significant increases in performance. We will demonstrate that the PSI enhanced composites: 1) Exceed strengths of 30 KSI, 2) Retain strengths to temperatures of at least 4,000 deg F, and 3) Erode at less than 0.0001\u201d/sec during hot fire ground testing.

These new systems\u2019 advantages are augmentation of the conventional flight control envelope leading to increased maneuverability and survivability, decreased weight and a decrease in radar signature during controls actuation. The proposed integrated flow/flight control system (IFFC) based on hingeless flight control uses both leading-edge and trailing edge pneumatic actuation (SJA and/or continuous) coupled with a novel control system that employs multi-layered neural networks (MLNN) and radial basis functions (RBF) to give global and distributed control, with aggregate input from sensor measurements distributed over the platform. The challenge will be to properly model the aerodynamics and actuators on the proposed UAV flight platform,capturing the inherent physics of the system. Experience and current work with similar actuator and control systems will provide invaluable leverage to achieve the goal of full hingeless control on a small UAV platform.",

They show that the FPA possesses four innovative features ideal for EKV seekers: (1) it\u2019s dynamically tunable in two bands for an increase in the lock-on range and an enhancement in the decoy counter; (2) it\u2019s superior to state-of-the-art detectors (bolometric or photonic types) for dim missile hardbody detection; (3) it\u2019s operable in cooled and uncooled conditions for compactness; and (4)  it\u2019s  producible for low-cost production. We propose a phase II program to complete the development of this FPA consisting of 512x512 pixels by performing the following: (1) fabricating the FPA with two-color tuning; (2) incorporating on-chip circuits for readout and tuning control; (3) constructing supporting optics and electronics for tests; and (4) testing its two-color capability.

A conventional Cu MetGraf skin/encapsulant with high conductivity preforms oriented in the \u201cZ\u201d (through thickness) direction (TC= 672 W/mK) was used to rapidly remove heat from the device.

These materials are typically very hard and difficult or impossible to machine by conventional techniques, thus limiting their use and driving cost and lead time up.  Designs are being constrained by manufacturing limitations.  These issues will be addressed in the proposed program by further development of waterjet machining techniques that were successfully demonstrated in Phase I.  A particularly promising new material is chemical vapor composite silicon carbide (CVC SiC) for use as a seeker mirror and supporting structure.  This material requires finish machining after the blank is grown on a mandrel to cut it to shape and reduce unnecessary weight by milling an isogrid pattern on the back surface.  The waterjetting techniques to do this will be developed in this program and a test mirror made.  Required techniques will be precision zero-taper cutting, controlled-depth milling and piercing.  Other techniques which will applications to other supporting structure, such as grooving and turning will also be developed.

Technology has been rapidly progressing in the field of hydrocarbon reformers; however, no single reformer currently exists that can reform both liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon feed stocks into hydrogen gas.  During Phase I, Lynntech demonstrated the validity of a multi-fuel, plasma-based reformer that can consume any liquid or gaseous hydrocarbon feedstock.  The reformer has no catalysts to be poisoned, is completely scalable, and produces hydrogen gas and fine solid carbon particulate that can be sequestered, or oxidized to power the reforming process.  The process is environmentally friendly, and hydrogen clean up is easier than competing reforming technologies due to the high hydrogen content at the outlet of the plasma (< 15 vol% of CO, CO2, H2S, and other poisons).  During the Phase II effort Lynntech will optimize the plasma-based multi-fuel reformer, add the balance of plant, and demonstrate the prototype system to USAF personnel.

Zinc Sulfide (ZnS), uncoated and anti-reflective coated, has been under evaluation as a \u201cbolt-in\u201d replacement window for the THAAD seeker system to replace the current sapphire window. The resulting data from the Phase I development efforts has shown that Zinc sulfide presents a wideband capability, has the structural properties, demonstrates superior optical properties, and will result in a significant system cost reduction of 70%-80% for the seeker window.  The optical transmission capabilities of the current sapphire window exhibit a limited waveband. A seeker window which has the ability to transmit at a wider waveband will be beneficial for target acquisition and target discrimination.  The selection of ZnS as an alternate seeker window material commenced with a rigorous computational fluid dynamics effort to predict the worst case aerodynamic heating combined with finite element thermal and structural analysis used to construct a statistical analysis model. The thermophysical property testing and optical property testing conducted under two (2) independent MDA Phase I Sbir efforts has validated this analysis. It was shown that ZnS provides the thermostructural properties and optical properties for uncoated material and anti-reflective coated material.  To prepare ZnS for system consideration, flight test, and Block Upgrade, thermostructural evaluation under worst case flight conditions and high fidelity over-testing of the worst case thermal conditions will be conducted to validate the selection of zinc sulfide.  Commercially available multispectral zinc sulfide, which contains an anti-reflective coating, will be fabricated and tested in the AEDC/WO Hypersonic Wind Tunnel to validate its thermostructural capabilities. A total of 10 test runs will be conducted consisting of three (3) calibration runs followed by the testing of seven (7) ZnS windows in order to obtain statistical data. Fully instrumented, full-scale forecones and windows will be used for these tests. The resulting data will be used to conduct a 3D structural analysis and verify ZnS probability of survival.",

Event extraction must provide information about properties of the events themselves (times, locations, and participants) as well as information about connections and similarity between events.  The current state of the art in event extraction is the identification and keyword-based grouping of verb-anchored event mentions. The work proposed here goes beyond this to pursue the extension of event extraction to (1) detection and linking of nominal event mentions and (2) data-driven automatic clustering of events by type.  Detecting nominal event mentions can increase recall of event detection systems, in particular of the most important events in a document and time-stamped event mentions, and will allow the application of coreference resolution techniques developed for entity tracking to events.  Unsupervised and weakly supervised event clustering techniques will obviate the need for creating and maintaining a single, static ontology of event types.  It will also allow users to define event types by example and search for them on-the-fly.  The guiding principle in this effort is the desire for solutions that will add value to event visualization for the end analysts.",

        "abstract": "Warhead liner performance is greatly affected by three liner material properties, namely, strength, ductility and circumferential symmetry. Extensive work done in the area of on-axis upset forging of round bar stock to form liner plates has demonstrated symmetry of texture which is necessary for uniform geometry during explosive formation. Grain refinement of the material has been achieved through pre-processing of the blank with equal channel angular pressing (ECAP). Work done in Phase I has shown that cryogenic ECAP, performed at -195\u00b0C, followed by a controlled annealing process, can produce dramatic enhancements in both strength and ductility of copper. Increases in these material properties can provide performance increases in warhead liner penetration capability. Phase II work will scale up this technology to the production of 9-inch diameter plates for liner testing. In addition, shaped charges from cryogenically ECAP processed material will be test fired in direct comparison with production Javelin parts. Through this Phase II project, both the strength and ductility of copper warhead liners would be significantly increased, leading to greater performance in a number of warhead applications",

The algorithms will be optimized for massively parallel image processing overseen by relatively few processors of greater sophistication. A two pass workflow will be implemented where terrain appearing in the field of view will first be reconstructed with relatively low depth resolution, followed by successively more accurate reconstruction as a region traverses the field and available baseline and image count on subject increase. This also allows resolution to be variably dependent on processing power, groundspeed, and field of view.

CMCs possess high strength, and are being investigated for use in next-generation aircraft engines.  CMCs show great promise for this application, but are subject to degradation from hot corrosion, a process in which atmospheric salts combine with engine exhaust, and can react with CMC materials at high temperatures.  Hot corrosion may be a limiting factor in implementing CMCs in aircraft engines, and protection schemes are required.  A thermally stable amorphous aluminum phosphate material was investigated in Phase I as a coating on non-oxide CMCs to promote resistance to hot corrosion.  The coating material is a low cost, solution derived material which has a unique glass structure that is resistant to crystallization even at elevated temperatures, and has demonstrated resistance to sodium sulfate at elevated temperatures. In this Phase II project, ATFI will work with our industrial partners to build on Phase I results with the objective to develop a prototype part and explore preliminary considerations for technology transition.  Effectiveness at reducing damage from hot corrosion as well as impact on mechanical properties of the CMC will be studied.",

However, a coupled design and analysis too is needed to accurately model and evaluate thermal protection systems, airframes, and internal electronic components for the developmental TSVs. Furthermore, future missions require not just TPS sizing verification, but also rapid evaluation of candidate strategies for withstanding long term heating, which often involve vehicle-level trade-off studies. Phase I has demonstrated that an integrated design simulation capability can be readily achieved using existing technologies and in some cases even commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) CAD-integrated software packages, with the benefit of yielding self-sustaining tools.

Phase II PGMTI will extend the Phase I effort by incorporating a video data remote processing capability onboard a surrogate UAV.  Utilizing existing sensors onboard UAVs (like Predator), Phase II will add processors which detect/track/display ground moving targets to an appropriate operator.  Technical advantages are:   \u2022 Real-time Information, not raw data, is forwarded for human interpretation   \u2022 Every pixel of data in view of the sensor is scrutinized by the PGMTI system, not just what an observer could see on a monitor   \u2022 Minimal transmission bandwidth is required for PGMTI as raw data is processed onboard the UAV.  Only moving targets are down-linked to an operator   Operational advantages are: \u2022 Shorter engagement times/reduced exposure to hostile fire for AC-130 Gunships as the UAV detects/tracks moving targets/enemy fire, then passes this data to the Gunship for immediate targeting \u2022 PGMTI capabilities on UAVs can greatly assist with all operational missions",

        "abstract": "The physics-based scattering phenomena from general targets can be very complex and occur in many different forms such as: a) specular reflection, b) creeping waves, c) traveling waves, d) slow moving surface waves, e) edge diffraction, f) singular currents at surface discontinuities, g) resonating gaps and cavities, and h) general material response.  While in vacuum Maxwell\u2019s equations representing the coupling between electric and magnetic fields are linear, it is still a formidable challenge to be able to accurately simulate the various scattering phenomena.  Especially for waves traveling over long distances, the relationship between the phase and amplitude of various scattered waves and the incident illumination is very critical for accurate representation of the near fields and the resulting farfield.   While it is of great interest to solve physics-based scattering from electrically large problems very accurately, it may not be efficient to solve the whole problem using one single full-wave solver.  To obtain relatively fast turnaround, it is potentially efficient to combine the virtues of different approaches in a hybrid fashion to solve such large problems.  For example, to solve a full size aircraft (Figure 1) at X-band range, one could use high frequency approximation for the exterior surfaces and use a full-wave solver for the long engine interior ducts, while taking into account the interaction between the ducts and the exterior.  In this way, full target RCS accurate to a fraction of a dB can be obtained in a day turnaround using a 64-128 node PC cluster.",

        "abstract": "State-of-the-art radar combat ID (CID) must address target identification in complex environments, often with very limited measured training data.  Consequently, the algorithms frequently rely on data computed via numerical models, as a function of required sensor conditions (bandwidth, target-sensor orientation, polarization, etc.).  Such data are usually computed using approximate high-frequency numerical models, because targets of interest are often very large relative to wavelength.  As a consequence of the number of targets and poses that must be considered, even these approximate numerical models require substantial computational resources.  It is therefore essential that one develop techniques to prioritize where computational efforts should be directed, for improving the accuracy of numerically-generated data and overall CID system performance.  In addition, by identifying the key phenomenological primitives (features) driving CID performance, computations can be accelerated significantly by developing simpler models linked to the key scattering features. The Phase II goals are to extend the Phase I methodologies associated with identifying key features and phenomenology that drive CID performance to targets and databases of interest to AFRL, and the principal Phase II products are the tools required to assist in these efforts.  Commercial applications include medical imaging, land-use assessment, and DoD modeling and analysis software.",

Since future transformational communications and radio frequency based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) space systems will likely involve advanced, high dynamic range transmitter/receiver devices and large but light-weight apertures, our plasma FSS radome technology  is needed to address satellite system vulnerabilities that are associated with high dynamic range sensors and such large apertures. The type of  vulnerabilities  that our plasma FSS radome technology can address include Net-centric Warfare (penetrate satellite command uplink, insert false instruction and/or data, etc.) and direct radio frequency (RF) attack (spurious signal attack, spoofing attack, etc.).   Our plasma radomes in combination with our plasma antennas and plasma antenna arrays provide several layers of reducing susceptibility to potential vulnerabilities, shielding against (RF) weapons, and optimizing the effectiveness of defensive systems.  In addition we have begun to develop techniques for specific (radar and communications) emitter identification and engagement. We are also developing flexible digital signal and data processing techniques for new, programmable, adaptive systems to enable \u201csurgical\u201d responses to, and suppression of, targeted opponent systems, while minimizing effects on non-targeted emitters.",

        "abstract": "The Phase I of this effort encompassed extensive data review and preliminary analysis to define the instability in the subject class of thrusters, identify key factors contributing to the unstable behavior, and outline a plan for the resolution of instability.  These key factors were identified as: Mon level in the oxidizer, propellant temperature, and the thruster start conditions.  The Phase I effort concluded that the cavity, chamber, and combustion models must be improved to reliably predict stability; an accurate simulation of the thruster start conditions on the flight vehicle is required to have confidence in the stability predictions; both injector and cavity changes must be investigated to ensure problem resolution; and that hot fire testing is required for a high confidence solution.  This program will provide the stability model development and the simulation of the start transient conditions for altitude operation.  These models will be verified against existing test data.  In addition test article designs will be generated and test hardware will be built.  Detail test plans and procedures will be drafted and a trade study will be conducted to select the optimum test site. Actual testing is deferred to a future activity associated with this program.",

        "abstract": "SET Associates proposes to identify and implement novel, real-time 3D shape representations for measured point-cloud data maximizing exploitation while minimizing computational complexity and bandwidth. The Interest in the use of 3D sensors for munitions autonomous agent applications is continually increasing. Common data sources include Laser Radar (LADAR), calibrated stereo cameras, and video utilizing structure from motion (SFM) algorithms. For each source, the sensor output is a range image combined with information on the sensor pointing direction and location at each frame. To emphasize the 3D structure and shape information, range images are normally transformed into a XYZ point cloud referenced to world or local coordinates. While point cloud representations are easily extracted from range imagery, they have various shortcomings for both supervised and autonomous target acquisition and recognition applications. Foremost, individual points in the data have no explicit connectivity with other points to help define surfaces and objects which are building blocks of human perception and Automatic Target Acquisition/Automatic Target Recognition (ATA/ATR) algorithms. This motivates a change in shape representation in many applications - either to facilitate human reasoning over the 3D data or enable robust autonomous information extraction. For a selected set of applications, SET will investigate and develop representations optimally suited to munitions and autonomous agents such as micro air vehicles. In this context, SET\u2019s proposed candidate representations are compact, enabling transmission over low-bandwidth networks. Proposed representations are also computationally simple, enabling processing to be done on vehicle with limited available processing resources.  We propose to identify and implement candidate 3D shape representations using appropriate synthetic or measured 3D data. SET will assess each representation\u2019s computational complexity, bandwidth requirements, and accuracy compared to the point cloud data.",

Control flows were recovered with intelligent mutations made deterministically using an algorithmic process called Automated Flow Resolution.  The software prototype was successful. During Phase II HBGary will develop a decompiler that goes beyond existing reverse engineering tools, which rely heavily on static analysis and are ineffective against protected and self-modifying codes.  This next generation decompiler will evolve from the success of Phase I research to \u201ctruly observe\u201d a program at runtime, while collecting instructions and behavior dynamically, and operate in stealth-mode from self-protecting codes.  While collecting instructions, the decompiler will manipulate the program to observe new behaviors without detection and collect instruction flows for reverse engineering and program understanding. The primary goals of Phase II will be to extend, apply, and make robust Automated Flow Resolution against larger and more complex real world software.  Advanced debuggers will be developed to defeat and overcome more difficult obfuscated and self-modifying programs.  Phase II will focus heavily on data flow analysis.",

The Phase II of our SBIR will include: i) advancement of our high temperature (300oC) radio frequency (RF) temperature sensor and its reduction to MEMS scale, ii) continued development and advancement of our smart integrated monitoring systems for anti-corrosion coatings and iii) and collaboration with Air Force personnel and a gas turbine engine manufacturers to determine the realistic operating conditions (i.e. speed, etc.) for application and use of our technology.

To meet he mission requirements the craft is also required to be able to sprint at 30 knots or greater and to be able to conduct these operations in a Sea State of 4. The snorkel craft, would have a very small visible signature and acoustic signature would be small as a result of batteries used for main propulsion power and compound mounting other equipment. The primary sensors in the snorkel craft would be based on the AN/AQS-22 dipping sonar. The sensor would be extended when the craft was drifting or maintaining its position against a current.  The craft would also carry a MK 54 lightweight torpedo when the mission required an attack capability. The craft would be capable of communicating with either manned or unmanned assets in the mission area via satellite or line-of-sight communications.  During the Phase II effort MAPC will complete the preliminary design and conduct detailed design of the proof-of-concept air deliverable watercraft. Upon sponsor review and approval, MAPC will fabricate the craft, conduct basic vehicle capabilities, and deliver the proof-of-concept prototype. The design history will be summarized and the operational results presented in a Final Report. During the Phase II Option, MAPC will design, assemble, install, and demonstrate the vehicle operating under remote control. The operation of the craft under remote control will be documented and delivered as an Option Phase II Final Report. MAPC will also complete the basis for technology commercialization and transition of the craft during this period.",

Typical lasers deployed in missile defense applications require between 100mJ and 1 Joule of pulse energy and use diode pumped solid-state master oscillators typically based on a Neodymium doped crystal.  To meet the laser system performance requirements, typically many individual laser diodes are needed to provide the necessary pump energy.  Unfortunately, current laser diode packaging technology does not offer either the performance or reliability that is required for next generation missile defense applications; due to packaging limitations related to the availability of materials and assembly techniques. To meet the reliability requirements for these mission critical laser applications, we propose to utilize the best learning from the current state of the art in laser bar packaging and telecommunications laser package design.  We intend to design and demonstrate a \u201ccommon carrier\u201d laser sub-mount that is applicable to a wide range of CW and QCW laser bar applications.

Using unique waveforms interceptors compute a guidance solution to the target that has minimal impact on radar resources.  Additional advantages are that 3PS does not require the fire control radar to communicate with the interceptor and 3PS enables onboard computation of guidance solutions, thus permitting higher update rates without affecting radar duty cycle.",

Tomorrow\u2019s mission will be different depending upon the type of conflict and geographical location.  Current sensor systems meet a narrow range of objectives and compromise personnel safety in order to hand-emplace the sensors.  Other systems lack the sensor diversity necessary to reliably detect, locate, and classify possible threats in various deployment environments.  Development of a covert, air-deployable sensor system capable of operating in diverse environments and designed for standard and evolving, interchangeable modular sensor units would significantly increase battle space awareness, yielding early detection of threats and reduced casualties. Expendable sonobuoys have proven to be extremely reliable technology.  In times of conflict, e.g. Vietnam, sonobuoy technology has been successfully adapted to special land, river, and harbor surveillance operations. Furthermore, the Navy has laid the groundwork for the development of \u201cstand-off\u201d sonobuoy capability to provide safe deployment and monitoring of sensor fields.  The effectiveness of land sensors derived from sonobuoy technology was verified during recent demonstrations when multiple sensors were successfully volcano launched and deployed for operation.   The Threat Spectrum Direction Finding Unit program will continue to expand the sonobuoy philosophy of reliability in low-cost, expendable devices using families of modular sensor systems to mitigate the surveillance dilemma described above.  The Phase II portion of the program continues the Phase I research and design efforts into subsysem and system development and demonstration tests.",

        "abstract": "Imaging sensors designed to convert infrared light energy into tactical information, are at the core of nearly all advanced military systems.  Sensor materials and components are constantly evolving to respond with ever increasing sensitivity, in harsh environmental and space based conditions.  Today the performance of conventional anti-reflection (AR) technology of these systems has not kept pace with the requirements of these systems.  In particular, there is an urgent need for an AR technology that offers high suppression of light for CdZnTe substrates over the 8-12 micron LWIR range in the infrared, combined with a significantly improved lifetime when operating in harsh radiative environments such as that found in space. TelAztec proposes to demonstrate a new type of high performance AR technology for LWIR HgCdTe detectors grown on CdZnTe substrates, with broad-band operation and dramatically increased lifetime in high radiation environments.  Based on surface relief microstructures fabricated directly into the sensor substrate material, the proposed AR treatment completely eliminates the limitations due to stress, thermal mismatch, adhesion, radiation damage, complexity, and cost associated with conventional multi-layer thin-film AR coating techniques.  In addition, TelAztec proposes to develop a fabrication process that integrates seamlessly with state of the art HgCdTe fabrication processes.",

The key capability to be improved here is document-level coreference resolution with a focus on nominal and pronoun mentions of entities. We will pursue this improvement on three fronts. One is continued enhancement of the pairwise coreference resolution system through algorithmic changes to the statistical learning model.  Two, we will develop a fast, accurate globally-optimal solution for merging mentions into entity profiles, which makes use of uncertainty in entity type tagging and pairwise-linking between entity mentions. Finally, we will develop an efficient method to utilize corpus-level word cooccurrence and predicate-argument statistics during document-level coreference.

It is anticipated that the drive towards smaller electronic components and faster switching speeds will require a cooling technology that can dissipate in excess of 1,000 W/cm2 while maintaining junction temperatures below 125 C.   In Phase I, we demonstrated heat removal at 1038 W/cm2 with an approach temperature difference of only 30 C in a system using Mikros Normal Flow Microchannel cold plate (NCP).  The ability to use single-phase coolant eliminates the complications inherent in two-phase systems and allows the NCP to integrate readily with the hardware presently available for shipboard thermal management. Because of its very low thermal resistance, the NCP does not require a heat spreader.  Hence, it is now possible to develop power electronics packaging technology in which the cold plate is tightly integrated with the die.  During Phase II, we will develop the technology to attach the die to the NCP so as to minimize the thermal resistance and stresses on the die and interfaces.  This technology will be demonstrated by fabricating and testing a prototype power module in the 1-10 MW power range.",

All of this is packaged in a manner that takes advantage of modern technology to reduce weight and volume and a unique method of powering the low frequency portion of the sonar that limits power usage.

We have implemented several image measures, including: CFAR, Power Spectrum Signature, and others. We propose a two-phase approach: a learning phase, where image measures are computed for a set of test images, and the ATR performance is measured; and a performance prediction phase. The learning phase produces a mapping, valid accross various ATR algorithms, which is even applicable when no image truth is available (e.g., when evaluating denied area imagery). The testbed has plug-in capability to allow rapid evaluation of new ATR algorithms.  We present a performance predictor using a trained classifier ATR that was constructed using GENIE, a tool developed at Los Alamos. We have also formulated a measure that quantifies the fidelity of synthetically generated infrared imagery fidelity. This measure describes how well a set of real imagery is covered by synthetic imagery samples.",

The THAAD, Si:BIB  (Blocked-Impurity-Band) and super lattice focal plane arrays utilize COTS ROICs, and this, coupled with the cascade of interfaces, compromises performance.  The proposed approach is the most cost effective, lowest risk approach to improve seeker sensitivity and acquisition range.  Neural networks and complementary algorithms are specifically applied to extract data of interest in low SNR MDA data.  Operating in the SNR range of 2 may increase the seeker acquisition range by as much as 70%. The outcome supports new ROIC/SEA designs appropriate for flight hardware and this effort is tightly coordinated with ongoing MDA efforts.",

        "abstract": "New high-temperature sizings are needed to improve the properties and durability of carbon/polyimide composites.  Compatibility with weaving and braiding operations and improved wetting during prepregging or resin infusing polyimide resin is also needed.  Achieving these characteristics will result in reducing life cycle costs for jet engine composites through better property translation, reduced scrap, and reduced processing time.  The overall objective of the proposed Phase II program is to demonstrate the use of reactive finishes for bonding carbon fibers to polyimide resins that impart superior strength and environmental durability to composite parts for DOD applications.  Secondary objectives include development and characterization of aqueous-based finish systems with long term stability, development of a material property database, including aging effects, and determination of compatibility with weaving, prepregging, and resin infusion (RTM, VARTM, RFI) operations.  In addition, an aqueous based reactive finish will be developed that is compatible with application during carbon fiber manufacturing.  Development of an aqueous finish will greatly reduce costs while also improving health and safety.  These reactive finishes are expected to be compatible with weaving, braiding, prepregging, and resin infusion operations. They will also improve the strength, thermo-oxidative stability, and hygrothermal stability of the resulting carbon/AFR-PE4 composites.",

        "abstract": "ARGTEC is pioneering the use of a new and innovative technology based on the theory of Attributed Relational Graph (ARG) in several application domains for content-based indexing and retrieval in large multimedia databases. We have achieved several breakthroughs in the development of this technology. This technology has been very successful in Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS) and in web-based indexing and retrieval using the contents of free-text documents. The ARG is a powerful technique that can be used for the ontology representation of the multimedia information. It is capable of capturing the textual, imagery, graphical, statistical, geometrical, topological, contextual, and semantic information in a multi-dimensional hierarchical representation that enables the system to represent complex concepts in a very compact, yet robust, form. During Phase I of this program, we proved that our technology is extendable to metadata representation and automated ontology generation specific to the domain of Predictive Battlespace Awareness (PBA) and Intelligence Preparation of Battlespace (IPB). We also developed a proof-of-concept demonstration as applied to that application. Our demonstration delivers very promising results with very high selectivity and reliability in real-time identification of computer network exploit messages. Previously, we have been also successful in applying this technology to Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS). In tests on large fingerprint databases, it delivered > 99% identification accuracy (i.e., < 1% Type I error) and close to zero false alarm rate. ARGTEC proposes to develop and implement a generalized hierarchical ARG model as an ontology representation scheme tailored for multimedia intelligence documents. We will show that the hierarchical ARG representation technique, coupled with our suites of inexact matching algorithms are especially effective for storage, web-based retrieval and summarization tasks for the Intelligence and Homeland Defense user communities.  ARGTEC has worked with several industrial partners in both defense and commercial arenas. Our commercialization strategy lies in converting our algorithm development efforts into system innovations, then teaming with large system integrators to infuse our technology nuggets into fielded, operational systems. We will insure that our technology will be infused into the Collaboration Guard (CG) system as the first operational system that will utilize our product.",

Several other technical problems related to wave optics simulation are addressed as well.  These include 3D dynamic modeling of targets, thermal blooming, simulation of long time sequences, proper representation of turbulence statistics, advanced image processing techniques, and integration of physical and geometric optics propagation models.

These will be helpful in speeding up extended scene imaging simulations used in laser weapons' systems performance evaluations.  However, the computational efficiency advantage of these new algorithms over Fourier methods depends on the ability to optimize the new algorithms to the same level as has been done for FFTs.   The primary technical goal of the Phase II is to develop and test a robust optical propagator containing generic software optimizations that will make these new algorithms more efficient than an optimized Fourier propagator, both on single processors (nodes) and multi-node computational clusters.   Added to these efficiencies will be absorbing and impedance boundary conditions which both broaden the physical applications of optical simulations and further enhance their efficiency by allowing for removal of \u201cguard\u201d points in the computational grid included only to avoid wrap-around errors.  These boundary conditions complete the transition from periodic to general spatial domains which is required for more general propagation scenarios, particularly those close to the ground.  The combined efficiencies of new algorithms and boundary conditions is expected to decrease optical simulation times by at least a factor of 10 compared to current Fourier propagators.  The efficiency and boundary conditions enhancements produced in the Phase II will first be included and tested in WaveTrain, but will also be offered as a portable package suitable for inclusion in other optical simulation software.",

Current state-of-art technologies can not provide all features of high power and efficiency, compactness, narrow linewidth, super frequency and power stability, low noise, and high extinction ratio at the same time. PolarOnyx proposes, for the first time, a high power (>500 W) single frequency (< 5 KHz) fiber laser transmitter to meet with the requirement of solicitation. It is a specialty fiber based MOPA. The output power of the seed fiber laser can be scalable to several hundreds mW without any spatial hole burning issues and the frequency can be controlled at a stable and accurate operation. In the amplifier stage, PolarOnyx proposes a revolutionary approach to fundamentally resolve the issues of nonlinear effects by employing our patent pending proprietary technologies in fiber lasers. Our unique spectral shaping techniques enable us to reduce the SBS and ASE noise significantly in the amplifier for commercially available YDFs and to reuse the residual pump to further increase the efficiency. These will make the fiber laser transmitter system superior in terms of wall plug efficiency (over 20%), power (>500 W and > 100 kW peak power), noise, size, and cost.  A 100 W tabletop experiment has been demonstrated in Phase I time frame for proof of concept. A compact prototype will be delivered at the end of Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Agile access to the radio frequency spectrum provides a solution to the problems of deployable, interoperable, wireless communication networks. Interoperability for military forces or civilian first responders has been elusive since the advent of wireless communications. Fixed spectrum allocation regimes and varying operational requirements for diverse end-users have led to the deployment of wireless systems with incompatible, fixed technical parameters. Additionally, the inflexible assignment of spectrum causes inefficient use of this finite resource. The ever increasing demand for wireless services by commercial interests competes for spectrum with net-centric warfare concepts of operations. Further, relieving spectrum bottlenecks using dynamic allocation and agile access methods is a critically needed technology for both government and non-government spectrum users. In this proposal, we describe a JTRS-compatible communications technology that solves the problems of interoperability for military and civilian first responders, efficient use of the spectrum, urban operations, resilience to interference and jamming, and backward compatibility with legacy systems.

During phase-I, particle and CFD simulation codes were developed to calculate the density and position of the plasma around a hypersonic vehicle at high and low altitudes, and the ReComm technique was demonstrated analytically and in simulations. The goals of phase-II are to demonstrate the ReComm effect experimentally and to extend the plasma and ReComm effect simulations to cover lower altitude scenarios than covered in Phase-I.

Our approach offers a passive liner that will eliminate the need for a bulky and heavy carbon filter/blower system, reducing therefore the overall weight and volume of the current tent. Our passive layer/panel will be breathable (i.e. allow oxygen to enter the tent and allow water vapor, heat and carbon dioxide to exit it), and impermeable to chemical agents. Our proposed tent will not require any power source. During the Phase I Triton demonstrated the feasibility. During the  Phase II, Triton will continue material and product development work. Triton will test selected materials to determine their survivability and chemical protection efficiency. Based on the lab results, Triton\u2019s team will downselect the best candidate material for the passive tent, and deliver to the customer full scale prototype for further evaluation.",

In Phase I the IIDI system was tested on real MightySat data supplied by AFRL/MITRE.  The new IIDI grid-based neural network and evolutionary algorithm improved accuracy by 2 to 3 times, execution time by 15 to 25 times, training time by 6 to 20 times, and false alarm rate by 2 to 3 times compared to state-of-the-art neural network systems.  Phase II development involves optimization of: highly scalable modular and cooperative neural networks; a fuzzy evolutionary algorithm for reducing network traffic and improving training time; a fuzzy expert system for highly human-like situation analysis; and a knowledge database built with expert input for accurate analysis.  Integration of these four enhancements will produce a Phase II IIDI system prototype that will directly meet the Air Force requirements for global-scale C2 systems for cognitive distributed situation assessment.",

The goal of this program is to develop algorithms to detect, identify, and track combustion signatures using a wide field of view airborne sensor. The data for event detection and discrimination will be acquired utilizing a specialized wide field of view (a 12 degree field of view has been demonstrated) spectral-temporal sensor which simultaneously measures 180 colors in the VISNIR through MWIR bands from energetic point targets at the frame rate of the camera (30-1000Hz.). This sensor, based on a Cross Dispersion Prism (CDP), has previously demonstrated a discrimination capability among various rocket motors, battlefield explosions and muzzle flashes. The potential for technical transfer is high since the development of algorithms based on these signatures will also lead to an understanding of airborne discrimination techniques for tactical missile threat warning and kill assessment, general explosive identification and damage assessment, and automatic location and identification of artillery, mortar and other larger muzzle weapons. In addition, suitably adapted versions of the spectral-temporal algorithms developed under this program may provide an immediate capability using fused multi-spectral data from current airborne assets.",

Investigations of age-related performance degradation indicate that energetic components are sensitive to environmental factors and precise monitoring of the degradation products (specifically NO2) provides the capability to significantly and safely extend ordnance component service life.  Unfortunately, in addition to being cumbersome, traditional electrical/mechanical sensors require the exposure of mechanical elements, or current and voltage carrying electronics, to the environment, resulting in reduced utility in degenerative or combustible environments.  The objective of the phase II work is the development of a highly integrated optical sensor and associated electronics with excellent NO2 sensing capabilities, broadly applicable to many environmental monitoring applications, but uniquely suited to weapons propellant monitoring due to its optical nature, very small size, in-situ monitoring capability, low power consumption, and high reliability. The technical approach is to combine advantageous sensor technologies, aggressive electronics packaging, and facilitating communications to realize functionality targets without compromising utility.

        "abstract": "Aerothermal heating on the nose tip and leading edges of the Falcon hypersonic vehicle will create stagnation point temperatures that are beyond the limits of most materials. Furthermore, because Falcon has the requirement of being reusable, the challenges are even greater. Heat pipes offer a solution to this problem by providing a high thermal conductivity path for transferring heat from the hot leading edges to cooler areas of the vehicle where it can be radiated away. In Phase I, Ultramet designed and fabricated several low-cost lithium heat pipes using novel fabrication and wick concepts. One of the heat pipes was tested, and it was highly successful. Although not tested at maximum capacity, the measured performance data matched model predictions quite closely. In Phase II, Ultramet will characterize the two novel wick architectures in greater detail, determine which of the two heat pipe fabrication techniques is better suited to use in a leading edge, and select the best wick and fabrication processes for use in an actual leading edge. A detailed design will be developed for the heat pipe-cooled leading edge, and a demonstrator article will be built and tested. Lockheed Martin will provide input on the performance requirements for the leading edge and assist in the overall design effort; Advanced Cooling Technologies will provide assistance in the manufacture of the heat pipes and engineering support for their integration into the leading edge; and NovaTech will perform the detailed design of the heat pipe-cooled leading edge.",

The merit of the novel strategy to control in-flight large-scale geometrical shape changes while maintaining the overall vehicle stability and control, has been confirmed by ZONA\u2019s detailed simulation studies. In Phase II, a recently developed unified aeroelastic and flight dynamic modeling capability will be adapted and applied to model the fully aeroelastic Morphing UAV dynamics. In addition, this formulation will allow the inclusion of stability and control derivatives, estimated through wind-tunnel and/or flight tests, to achieve a higher fidelity aerodynamic model.  The proposed multi-loop controller topology assures both proven structure and self-scheduled features. Implementation issues of the synthesized multi-loop controller are readily accounted for using closed-loop pole placement linear matrix inequality regions. A comprehensive suite of software and hardware-in-the-loop tests using representative aerodynamic loads, computed using the unified aeroelastic and flight dynamic formulation, are planned to demonstrate the seamless integration of these of new technologies. Deliverables include the tailored unified formulation for Morphing UAV dynamics as well as the multi-loop flight controller methodology.

Phase 1 results clearly indicated that laser micromachining can significantly reduce cost and increase the precision when compared to conventional contour grinding.  One of the longest lead-time manufacturing processes is the mirror precision machining and subsequent polishing to achieve final figure and surface quality.  This proposal details the tasks required for constructing a 9-axis automated micromachining workstation and verifying its ability to machine on-axis and off-axis complex mirrors to a figure and surface finish suitable for transitioning to a final polish operation.  The combination of 6-axis motion system and 3-axis scanning system with an advanced laser system compose an unprecedented laser-based micromachining capability that does not exist today.  This effort outlined in this proposal will develop a capability that extends the current state-of-the-art in laser micromachining.  In addition to a 9-axis machining capability, the workstation will be automated to function in a 24/7 mode of operation and will include an integrated laser sensing technique for in situ metrology.

        "abstract": "Information Management is an important component in the development of viable information sharing systems, such as JBI, where shared information may be manipulated to derive further information. The qualities of such derived information depend on qualities of the contributing information and of their sources. Determining information quality requires propagation of qualitative and pedigree data about such manipulations through successive generations of information. Such data enables application-dependent decision making and attributing confidence to those decisions. However, the cost of propagating such data increases as the volume of information increases through generations. In general, users of an information sharing system are satisfied with approximate and rapid assessments of qualities along with a brief derivation history of the information. However, not all assessments need to be performed in a time-critical environment and not all approximate and rapid assessments can satisfy every quality need. In this project, we are developing an Agent-based Information Management System (AIMS) that enables rapidly establishing approximate qualities and related provenance within satisfactory limits to save computation time and storage costs. Complementary mechanisms support establishing complete, more accurate qualities of information.

Proposed technical approach is based on hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE). The HVPE technology is known to produce GaN epitaxial layers with low defect density and high carrier mobility. Recently, TDI has demonstrated world first 6-inch GaN epitaxy. These results open an opportunity to develop novel technology of low defect thick GaN and AlN materials on large area substrates. The Phase II research program will be focused on defect and stress control in thick crack free AlN and GaN layers.

A new X-Band system, XTAR, is being considered by the Defense Department as a precursor to the Wideband Gapfiller Satellite System for use on disadvantaged platforms, such as submarines and tactical aircraft due to its ability to support these higher data rates with smaller antenna sizes. The technology challenge is to develop affordable, small, conformal (low radar cross section) antenna systems for these tactical aircraft.  These antenna systems also need to support right and left circular polarizations, the ability to transmit and receive (with sufficient T-R isolation), and antenna gain of about 25dBic.  The antenna system should provide performance for nearly the entire upper hemisphere of angular coverage, which requires steerable transmit and receive beams.  ThinKom proposes to design & build antenna hardware using the VICTS phased array antenna technology suited for the F/A-18 E/F tactical aircraft.",

A critical enabling technology is a new class of channelizer capable of assembling information channels by adaptively combining subbands found within a broadband spectrum, while also capable of efficiently operating in hostile environments using radiation tolerant components. The Athena ACT1 solution is the fusion of multiple Athena authored and demonstrated innovations in the area of multi-band channelizer design, signal processing, fault tolerance, and implementation.

        "abstract": "Luna Innovations proposes to develop a set of Dynamic Module Servers (DMS) that manage dynamically reconfigurable modules to prevent fragmentation in runtime-reconfiguring FPGA applications.  The DMS will be capable of maximizing the available contiguous FPGA resources by efficiently floorplanning the modules currently running on the FPGA.  While many FPGA defragmentation approaches model the FPGA as a two dimensional (2D) memory grid and the configurable elements running on the FPGA as easily distributable blocks in that grid, such modeling simplifies the real-world complexities of routing between the interrelated configurable elements and external I/O.  Luna\u2019s proposed Dynamic Module Server will take into account not only fragmentation within the FPGA, but it will also provide for module interconnections and external I/O connections by pre-compiling both the modules and their interconnects.  This simplifies the runtime routing of these modules because most of the work will have been performed at compile time.  Optional pre-computations allow connections to be incorporated in the module\u2019s bitstream without incurring any runtime overheads.  The Dynamic Module Server will be useful in embedded, networked, and supercomputing environments.  The DMS can control reconfiguration on a variety of real-world FPGAs, including the Xilinx Virtex-II, Virtex-II Pro, and Virtex 4 FPGA families.",

CFD analysis has been performed on the candidate designs and further effort is focused on providing a preliminary geometry consistent with the specified goals of the program. To maximize the cost/benefits of the ITCS integrated design and to provide compatibility with current missile systems, the Phase II effort will draw upon work completed in both the Phase I and Phase II  of the related, variable thrust SRM programs. The objective of achieving a thrust vector control system that will provide the required directional control, including a 180\u00ba turn, will be achieved using the integrated design which provides the simplest and least expensive approach. Current concepts include radial plug movement, gas injection, or a combination of both. A key feature of the proposed thrust vector control system is the ability to provide directional control immediately subsequent to SRM ignition. This feature is important to maximize stability from any launch platform.",

The aeroshell is a quasi-isotropic, two-dimensional (2D), carbon fiber reinforced carbon matrix (C/C) laminate composite coated with silicon carbide (SiC).  Backing the 2D C/C-SiC aeroshell are layers of varying density foam filled with phase change material for thermal management.

This proposed Phase II program will design, fabricate and characterize vertical, through-thickness reinforced C/C-SiC aeroshell materials for leading edge applications.  An iterative model-design-analysis approach will be used to generate a geometrically-shaped leading edge structure that will be fabricated and assessed by testing under representative conditions.  A successful program will provide technology benefits resulting from an improved TPS architecture with low/high velocity impact resistance, the ability to integrate existing substrate materials, and a predictive modeling tool for use in continued TPS leading edge development.",

In an operational scenario, the ability of a warning system to estimate the threat posed by the intentional or inadvertent release of toxic chemicals is limited by the accuracy of the initial cloud estimate. There are sensors capable of measuring cloud parameters but they provide heterogeneous measurements and the means to combine these measurements into a single, integrated estimate of cloud parameters do not exist.

In Phase 1 of the Ersatz Brain Project (EBP ) we expanded our original conception to include a computationally richer representational architecture than the originally proposed two-dimensional locally connected lattice.   Additionally, through simulations, we have discovered how powerful learning rules can be easily incorporated into the EBP.",

        "abstract": "Today\u2019s information age relies on an extensive network of systems that form the Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG is threatened by numerous entities including terrorist organizations, hackers sympathetic to America\u2019s enemies, criminal organizations, and nation states interested in cyber warfare capabilities. The ability to prevent, detect, and respond to these cyber attacks is a crucial component for the protection of our computer networks and the mission critical software that relies on them. Network monitoring and management systems provide copious amounts of data regarding the status and health of computer networks. Intelligent information filtering and fusion systems are required in order to analyze this data to detect threats, analyze their source, and provide responses to these threats. Here we propose an Integrated Network Attack Fusion System (INAFS) to support cyber attack assessment and defense. Our approach leverages three synergistic technologies: intelligent agent-based information retrieval of network data; a rule-based mechanism for event, alert, and suggested responses generation based on retrieved information and current network assessment; and a Bayesian belief network approach to cyber attack detection and assessment. We see considerable potential for this approach in ensuring network survivability from cyber attack and maintaining continuity of operations.",

This research effort will also model, optimize and mature all solid-state pulse generator designs that will provide a high-voltage output pulse, be compact, portable and reliable, exhibit a fast rise or fall time, and will be capable of being command fired at high pulse repetition rates with very low jitter.  High-voltage, fast rise time sources are important for use in high power ultra-wideband (UWB) radar systems.  All solid-state pulse generator designs are the ideal UWB source solutions as they exhibit an inherently low jitter, require a low maintenance, and have a long lifetime.  The designs currently available either use commercially available components, which are not optimized to their full capability, or use custom made devices, which are not manufactured in the United States.  The key problems which we intend to address and solve in this Phase II research effort are developing the recipes for optimized solid state diode switches, fabricating these switches, and then using these switches in optimized pulse generator designs.",

        "abstract": "Low Noise Amplifiers (LNAs), used in communications, radio astronomy and radar applications exhibit improved performance when cooled to low temperatures (100oK). Range improvement of 20% and a 10x improvement in sensitivity can be obtained by cooling an LNA to 100K.  However, use of Cryogenic fluids is problematic in many applications.  Pulse tube coolers have been used to successfully cool LNAs to 100oK but are not considered desirable for shipboard communications applications.  Solid-state cooling devices or Thermo Electric Coolers (TECs) are also used, but have been limited to higher temperature operation.  Recent advancements in the ZT figure of merit for TEC materials, structure and fabrication technology, including thin films and quantum wells offer the potential to achieve 100oK-operating temperatures.   This Phase II effort builds on our Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC) technology experience by:  \u00b7 Identifying LNA Application and Performance Requirements \u00b7 Evaluating Several Advanced TCE Technologies, their Readiness and Applicability  \u00b7 Selecting Appropriate TEC Technologies and Cooler Structure for the LAN Application  \u00b7 Specifying, Designing, Building and Testing Prototype Hardware  \u00b7 Mitigating technical risk leading to production of flight hardware  \u00b7 Supporting integration into shipboard communications equipment The result of Phase II will be a low cost, low volume, active cooling prototype unit.  A modular package compatible with shipboard communications electronics enclosures is proposed as a baseline design. A multi-stage cooler is anticipated employing a hybrid bulk and thin film or quantum well TEC technology, to meet the LNA cooling requirements.  Forced convection, air-cooling is proposed to sink the heat generated by the package.    BENEFITS: It is anticipated that the first application of the proposed thermal cooler approach will be in Navy shipboard communications.  The cooler technology can then be applied to RADAR, spacecraft thermal management systems and radio astronomy.",

Unfortunately, it also means the decision-maker increasingly needs to efficiently and effectively utilize that data in order to stay competitive. In network-centric warfare the consequences of less than optimal performance can be extremely serious. With the deployment of CPoF (Command Post of the Future), a C2 system that utilizes a variety of sensor data and supports collaborative problem solving through workspace sharing and VOIP communications, a fielded modern network-centric warfare environment exists. However, to achieve closer to optimal performance on command metrics, such as situation awareness, and time to decide or act, it is important that systems like CPoF not only capture relevant data and support collaboration. They must also include an adaptive command feedback loop that (1) has an interface which supports efficient identification of conditions warranting a response; (2) includes analysis tools to reduce the cognitive demand and expertise required to identify complex situations, and (3) has the ability to produce, and sometimes share, the results efficiently with support from user-managed automated feedback where applicable. We propose a tool we call C2insight to meet these needs.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project demonstrates a breakthrough approach to high-resolution linearity error compensation (LinComp) using computationally-efficient digital signal processing to reduce harmonic and intermodulation distortion in analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) by up to 24 dB.  The core technology can also be used to reduce such distortion in digital-to-analog converters (DACs), sampling circuitry, and radio frequency amplifiers or the combination of these devices in the complete RF chain. This technology improves the dynamic range by up to four bits, enabling very accurate conversion of data at high intermediate frequencies (IF) with very high sample rates (e.g., distortion below -65 dBFS with 1.5 GHz sample rate, direct IF sampling at 1.2 GHz). The LinComp technology reduces the size, power, and cost of radar systems and RF transceivers by eliminating RF downconversion electronics.  The highly innovative LinComp processing will be demonstrated in real-time FPGA hardware and fully tested with two different manufacturers\u2019 ADC chips (e.g., MAXIM MAX108, and Atmel AT84AS003), providing 1.5 GHz sample rate, 8 to 10 bit resolution, and direct IF wideband sampling in the second Nyquist zone.  The LinComp processing will be implemented in a Xilinx Virtex 4 FPGA.  Innovative parallel digital signal processing techniques will be used to provide the full 1.5 GHz data throughput by partitioning the processing into multiple, simultaneous data streams within the FPGA.  V Corp has confirmed the technical efficacy of the LinComp processing methodology by testing with state-of-the-art analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters.  V Corp has executed a highly successful DARPA sponsored SBIR Phase I project demonstrating LinComp\u2019s technical viability. This compensation approach requires less hardware, provides much better dynamic range, and provides compensation over a wider bandwidth than competing linearity compensation methods. Very importantly, the LinComp processor will always exceed the state-of-the-art because it is extremely adaptive and can easily be applied to new, higher performance ADC, DAC, and amplifier products as they become available in the future.  V Corp has relationships with many commercial companies such as MAXIM, Raytheon, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, and others who have expressed strong commercial interest in LinComp (testimonials included in proposal).",

In this program, XCOM is extending the capabilities of our RF MEMS components by employing them as critical elements in a reconfigurable antenna feed.  Two approaches will be pursued:  (1) employing MEMS matrices to switch between transmit and receive filters in the bands of interest, and (2) employing MEMS as embedded tuning elements in the filters themselves, which is expected to enhance power handling capabilities.  The  performance requirements of the filters will support the present needs of Ground Mobile Terminals (GMTs) and the future needs of the Transformational Communications Architecture (TCA) to establish and maintain microwave and millimeter-wave links to ground-based terminals as well as airborne, mobile, and man-portable platforms.  XCOM has already released RF MEMS relay products based on a mature MEMS manufacturing process at a major domestic foundry, and has also developed a lower-cost MEMS process for use in future products, including prototypes developed in this program.  This program benefits from the strong internal interest in the underlying device technologies, and benefits from significant real cash infusion into maturing the designs and processes employed.",

        "abstract": "Recent military operations have demonstrated the use by adversaries of non-traditional or asymmetric military tactics to offset US military might. This issue has thus come into the forefront of national security. Rogue nations with links to trans-national terrorists have created a highly unpredictable and potential dangerous environment for US military operations. In his testimony to the US Senate, Vice Admiral Wilson, Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) identifies several characteristics of these threats including extremism in beliefs, global in nature, non-state oriented, and highly networked and adaptive, thus making these adversaries less vulnerable to conventional military approaches. Additionally, US forces must also contend with more traditional state-based threats that are further evolving their military fighting strategies and capabilities. What are needed are solutions to assist our forces in the prosecution of operations against these diverse threat types and their atypical strategies and tactics. We propose an Adaptive Model-based Adversarial Reasoning System (AMARS) to support both training and simulation based acquisition requirements for effective responses to enemy asymmetric tactics and strategies. The system generates and adapts an adversary model that reasons on both the entity and organizational level via an evolutionary algorithm using a low-fidelity simulation environment.",

To improve robustness and safety, these components need to be inspected to determine their mistuning characteristics so that high-response rotors can be identified and the appropriate maintenance action taken.   How to test IBRs for mistuning is a relatively new but important issue, since both military and the latest generation of commercial engines makes extensive use of IBRs.  A machine to measure mistuning could extend the life and help maintain safety for both commercial and military engines.  Phase I successfully demonstrated the Field Mistuning Inspection System concept that the measurement machine could be integrated with a database so that measured data could be  readily transferred over the internet and the data could be analyzed to extract key mistuning information which, in turn, is used to perform probabilistic analyses and risk assessment.

The LEP is achieved by incorporating a thin, flexible, polymeric reflecting film on or within the lens.  The film can be incorporated on soft lenses made of hydrogel materials, as well as \u201crigid\u201d or \u201chard\u201d lenses, including the gas permeable lenses.  The film is based on special polymers and is self-assembled to form a periodic structure.  The film is engineered to reflect completely incident light in the far red and near infrared (670 nm \u2013 1,200 nm) and be highly transparent (> 90%) elsewhere in the visible.  The film is high optical quality, as it does not impair visual performance or create distractions in the visual field.  The film is also processed to be nanoporous for exceptionally high oxygen permeability.  The technical results achieved in Phase I have demonstrated the proposed LEP contact lens technology viable, practical and realizable in a short time frame.

The miniaturized biosensor will use a modified, screen-printed microelectrode with high sensitivity and low limit of detection for OP and carbamate pesticides.  This biosensor will be selective for OPs and carbamates.  The enzyme used to generate the amperometrically detectable species is selectively inhibited by these insecticides, but not by other common classes of agricultural chemicals, such as triazine herbicides.  The device uses a single-use, disposable monitoring chip, because some of the active pesticides (e.g., the OPs) irreversibly inhibit enzyme activity.  Carbamate inhibition is more reversible, but the device, in this case, was evaluated for a single use mode.\n\n\n\nDuring Phase I, Eltron Research, Inc., demonstrated effective enzyme inhibition by two representative pesticides, aldicarb (carbamate) and methyl parathion, which is an OP insecticide.  Aldicarb was detected with a detection limit of 11 ppb, while methyl parathion\u2019s detection limit was 18 ppb.  This performance is compatible with existing maximum contaminant limits set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. \n\n\n\nBiosensors that can be taken into the field will enable cost efficient environmental monitoring of water supplies.  Pesticide contamination could represent a growing and currently underregulated threat because these toxic chemicals are used extensively in agriculture.  Potential pollution sources include rainwater runoff of mobile pesticides and spray drift during aerial applications.\n\n \n\nThe proposed sensor will offer a cost-reduction strategy for pesticide screening.  Prior field screening of samples could contain costs associated with laboratory testing by providing a means to screen out negative, or pesticide-free, samples.",

        "abstract": "Under this Phase II research project, TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) is developing  a novel non-carbon sorbent to control mercury emissions from flue gases, hazardous  waste incinerators, and coal-fired power plants. The sorbent easily could  be injected into the flue gas and recovered in a particulate control device  (PCD) along with the fly ash, minimizing capital investment. Unlike the  carbon materials used to date, TDA&rsquo;s sorbent does not alter the properties  of the by-product fly ash and render it unsuitable as a cement additive. TDA  materials combine an oxidation catalyst/oxidizing agent in the same particle.  The  catalyst oxidizes the difficult-to-remove elemental mercury to the much easier  to stabilize Hg+2.  The oxidized mercury then tightly binds to the sorbent. As  a result of this dual function, the sorbents have high capacity, good activity,  and can work at much higher temperatures because the mercury is tightly bound  to the surface. \n\n\n\nUnder Phase I of this research project, TDA demonstrated the technical feasibility  of using the non-carbon sorbent for mercury removal. The sorbent achieved  a higher mercury capacity than the Norit-FGD carbon, the benchmark sorbent  in mercury emission control from flue gases at 150\u00b0C (over 2,000 \u00b5g/g)  in a fixed-bed experimental setup under representative simulated flue gas. Unlike  the carbon sorbents, which do not work at higher temperatures, TDA&rsquo;s  formulation also performed well at high temperatures, absorbing 250 \u00b5g/g  at 245\u00b0C. The high-temperature operation capability of the sorbent  allows its use on the hot side of an electrostatic precipitator. Under  Phase II, TDA will continue to optimize the sorbent formulation and scale up  its production. In collaboration with Apogee Scientific, Inc., TDA will  demonstrate the performance of the formulation in a pilot-scale flow apparatus  using actual flue gas generated by burning Powder River Basin coal.  TDA&rsquo;s  commercial partners will assist in the scale-up, evaluation, and commercialization  efforts to improve the chances of successful sorbent development.\n\n\n\nThis technology may find immediate use for mercury abatement in hazardous  waste incinerators. In addition, the same technology would be applicable  to the much smaller application of mercury abatement in municipal waste incinerators  and waste-to-energy facilities. These facilities are becoming more prevalent  in the United States and are particularly common in Europe, where trouble-prone  packed beds of carbon currently are used. Regulated coal-fired power  plants account for 60 percent of the electric power generated in the United  States.",

        "abstract": "Applications for long life cryocoolers include missile detecting and tracking, space and ground surveillance, mapping, weather monitoring, supercomputers/workstations, Earth resources monitoring, astronomy and space-based laser. Cryocoolers are an enabling technology for missions with low temperature detectors, cold optics, thermal shields, and superconducting devices. Cryocoolers are small-scale cryogenic refrigerators with refrigeration capacities ranging from a few milli-Watts to several tens of Watts. The cryocooler cost can be a significant deterrent to developing a mission solution and architecture especially for large cooler production missions such as MDA\u2019s Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS). The cold head is a complex part to manufacture and we propose a new method to manufacture the cold head as one part using photo etching and diffusion bonding. This simplifies cold head manufacturing and provides more control over the geometry, particularly the regenerator, allowing a higher level of optimization, which would improve system performance and reduce mass. This program has a high payoff potential, and we have put together a program plan that addresses the fundamental issues associated with proving the technology. The manufacturing expertise of Micro Cooling Concepts combined with the cryocooler experience at Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. provides an expert team to perform this work.",

As the capabilities of modern warfare have expanded, so have the complexities of simulating those capabilities. The various programs of MDA require reuse of interoperable simulations as it is too expensive to develop a new simulation for each new problem. While the HLA simulation framework facilitates the interoperability and reuse of simulations models, the high cost and labor intensive effort required to develop a HLA Federation Object Model (FOM) has constrained the development of FOMs, and thus confining the development of large repositories of reusable, interoperable models. Additionally, information sharing across complex organizational boundaries requires not only provision for integration without violating military security, but also mechanisms to ensure interoperability between different simulation federations. Trident Systems proposes to develop the Collaborative Simulation Development Environment (CSDE), a HLA based tool suite that facilitates the construction of interoperable simulation models which operate within and across Multi-Level Security (MLS) networks.",

The need is to take raw data flows and rapidly turn them into critical awareness at the appropriate levels. Intelligence analysts need dramatically more productive tools to be effective. The right information needs to flow automatically in the right format to the right analysts.

With over 20 countries now having the capability to manufacture and use biological warfare agents, and the reality of the events involving the use of Anthrax on US soil after September 11, 2001, decontamination capability for biological agents has become a reality for military as well as civilian needs. Under the current SBIR solicitation, the DoD is interested in the development of novel decontaminating materials and methods to support rapid decontamination of interior spaces contaminated with chemical and biological agents. The proposed system should be portable, lightweight, self-powered and easy to use so it can be readily transported. The intended use of the portable system is to support (operational) decontamination procedures in the field so US forces can operate in treated spaces with a minimum level of protective equipment. METSS proposes to address this need through the development of a novel decontaminating system that can be applied using a conventional pressurized sprayer and/or fire extinguisher without requiring post-decontamination cleanup operations. The proposed approach will build upon recent advances in chemical and biological decontamination chemistries yet rely on familiar delivery methods that have been used for years to apply liquids and extinguish fires by both trained and untrained individuals.",

These techniques were collectively demonstrated in a proof-of-concept software entity referred to as EQuIP (End-to-End QoS IP Techniques for Heterogeneous Networks).  EQuIP utilizes existing networks\u2019 infrastructures and protocols to achieve security and end-to-end QoS provisioning for multimedia flows traversing heterogeneous environments. As a result, EQuIP does not require modification to existing networks and can be easily incorporated within current military and commercial networks.  In Phase II effort, Architecture Technology Corporation (ATC) is implementing and demonstrating a full-scale prototype of the product.",

New initiatives such as the Joint Battlespace Infosphere (JBI) and Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) have the goal of getting both \u201craw\u201d and processed information to the warfighter as quickly as possible.  In order to assess the trustworthiness of such information, the warfighter must be able to automatically check its provenance.  In Phase I, ATC-NY developed a design of a Pedigree Management and Assessment Framework (PMAF) that shows the feasibility of using pedigrees in an information centric environment to support provenance evaluation.  Key components include a model of information provenance, a run-time system, and a pedigree assessment tool.  An important Phase I achievement was the development of an approach to maintain and retrieve provenance information that may depend on the type of the object.  In particular, we have developed an approach using RDF that will allow a client to formulate appropriate queries.  In Phase II, we will build a prototype and provide example schemas that illustrate the advantages of using PMAF.",

Current methods available for generating reduced global mechanisms are tedious, and the resultant mechanisms often lack accuracy.  What is needed, and proposed for development in this SBIR effort, is a software package to efficiently and accurately generate global mechanisms from detailed mechanisms.  In Phase I of this SBIR, the feasibility of using optimization algorithms to automate the curve-fit generation process was shown through automating the thermodynamic fits of the current AFRL kinetics code, QuasiGlobalCustomizer.  Also, the ability to generate global rates from detailed mechanism calculations based on the Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) model was demonstrated in a preliminary version of the software.  In Phase II, the software developed during Phase I will be expanded to allow fitting of the global mechanism to a wide range of combustion phenomena, such as ignition delay, extinction limits, pollutant emissions, flame speed, and others.  The final code will have a very intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) and will allow the combustion engineer to generate reduced global mechanisms with speed and accuracy.",

In Phase I we demonstrated the  efficacy of our approach by demonstrating a QoS approach for assuring audio traffic in a lab configuration.

In its current configuration, MEVA uses pressure impulse (P-I) curves to model steel structural component response and damage.   However, there are fundamental limitations to these models.  P-I curve type models:  (1) do not account for connection behaviors, particularly connection failure related to member failure; (2) represent only a single mode of failure (i.e., flexural failure) and do not represent the several other important failure modes (e.g., shear and P-delta failures); (3) fail to account for the effects of axial loads on columns; (4) do not account for local failures due to close in detonations; and (5) do not account for fragment damage.   This proposal seeks to develop fast running models (FRMs) based on high-fidelity physics-based finite element models for structural steel components.  Such models are able to provide physics-based results, yet with the same rapid computational speed.

The TwinLine array system consists of two acoustic streamers that are towed by a heavy tow cable and separated by mine-sweeping paravanes on short tethers that pull out and down. The system is susceptible to entanglement by fishing gear which upsets the paravanes and causes collapse of the tow system. This results in a significant degradation in acoustic performance, often damages the tow system, and reduced operational availability. In Phase I, Adaptive Methods (formerly AHA Res., Inc.) developed and tow-tested a prototype TwinLine Separation And Roll Control (SARC) device that replace the paravanes. By design, the SARC is much less likely to become entangled in fishing equipment, and even if entangled it is designed to continue to function, thereby increasing operational availability and minimizing damage to TwinLine towed arrays. In Phase II, Adaptive methods will develop, instrument, and test an EDM and First Article SARC tow body, and develop documentation for its use aboard T-AGOS SWATH tow ships.",

        "abstract": "It has long been known that (aided) target recognition based on imaging sensors is fundamentally limited by the number of pixels on the target imaged. Very roughly, at least 10 pixels are needed for detection, at least 100 are needed for generic classification, and perhaps 1000 are needed for recognition. While the details of this structure depend on specific sensors, targets, and sensing conditions, this general trend is universally observed in all domains of ATR. Doctrinal requirements of Total Information Dominance thus lead to massive deployment of sensors. How to gather, store, communicate, fuse, and analyze that vast flood of data in (near) real-time is then a formidable technical challenge. Moreover, given the lengthy DoD acquisition cycle, the fielded sensors are always inadequate \u2013 the warfighter needs yet more pixels, to see more clearly. Without improving the sensors, there still exists the opportunity to improve their imaging resolution in \u201csoftware\u201d \u2013 e.g., post imaging. The above analysis then points to the dramatic impact that post-imaging resolution enhancement, if available, can have on target recognition downstream. Video image resolution enhancement is the science/art of taking multiple frames from imaging sensor(s) that cover overlapping (but not necessarily identical) scene content, and integrating or merging the content for improved resolution \u2013 for scene analysis, surveillance, situation awareness, ATR, and other applications. Fusing images for enhancement from the same sensor (under the same conditions) reduces to the problem of subpixel registration. For successive frames of a video camera in which there is subpixel dislocation of objects in the visual field, due to relative motion (even due to camera jitter), this provides an opportunity to increase resolution. FastVDO has developed advanced superresolution technology, as well as ATR technology, which are ready to use.",

        "abstract": "Honeynets (and their predecessor \u2013 honeypots) have been demonstrated to increase network defense posture by providing deceptive targets for outside attackers and malicious insiders. ISAC, Inc. proposes the development of a virtual, dynamic honeynet software package specifically developed for sensor-to-shooter networks. This approach uses passive network and operating system fingerprinting techniques to automatically configure, update, and maintain virtual honeynets that realistically mimic weapons system components. Attacks directed at a virtual, dynamic honeynet are transparently routed to a sandbox environment, allowing security managers to determine attacker intent and preserve evidence for forensic investigation. Since little-to-no network traffic to a honeynet is legitimate, ISAC\u2019s virtual, dynamic honeypot will provide an accurate detection enhancement (near zero false-positives) to existing intrusion detection deployments and will provide a much-needed defense against the malicious insider problem. In Phase I, ISAC developed the VDHS architecture, demonstrated feasibility of the approach, and developed a proof-of-principle demonstration that automatically configures a virtual honeynet to match the network to which it is connected and detects a malicious insider. In Phase II, ISAC will develop a full-featured prototype that automatically creates a realistic virtual network based on weapon system components, accepts attack redirects from the real network, and interfaces with existing situational awareness components.",

        "abstract": "Engineering-level tools for weapon/target interaction analysis are used to design new weapons by evaluating their potential effectiveness against various types of military targets. Tools such as MEVA (Modular Effectiveness/Vulnerability Assessment) have been developed in response to a need for a fast-running computer code that can accurately model the penetration of a structure and the resulting damage.  The current predictive capabilities of the MEVA code for masonry and stud walls are based on a methodology that has several limitations, including the representation of only one response mode (e.g., flexure); the use of simple loading models that exclude weapon casing fragment effects; the use of simple material models that neglect rate effects; and the production of limited output. This proposal seeks to develop fast-running models (FRMs) to predict the response of a variety of masonry and stud walls to a range of air-dropped munitions. The FRMs will be based on high-fidelity physics-based (HFPB) analytical models, which can provide results at a higher level of realism than their predecessors, yet with the same rapid computational speed. These FRMs will significantly improve the predictive accuracy of MEVA and other assessment codes in the area of masonry and stud wall response.",

Several of our advanced solid film lubricant coating technologies have been successfully evaluated as viable candidates for RL-10 rocket engine turbopumps.  The turbomachinery used for rocketry operate under extreme conditions with a zero fault tolerance. Gears and bearings operate at high speeds and high contact pressures at cryogenic temperatures. Based on our Phase I results a significant improvement in turbopump operation is possible. Improvements in coating uniformity, structure, wear life with a reduction in friction and vibrations yield improved turbopump operations. This study details specific cryogenic testing and laboratory characterization  at appropriate loads and speeds similar to that of rocket fuel pump.  Cryogenic WAM testing is used to provide the proper tribological test conditions. Coating compatibility with liquid propelent is investigated. Advanced coatings include PVD, Spray, Burnish and Smart Surface Laser Textured solid film lubes and Soft Metallic coatings by PVD and Hybrid PVD. We deliver a reference database of our advanced surface engineering treatments as well as surface treatment of the RL-10 bearing sleeve and turbopump gear based on our results with deliberate concern for economic industrial viability.  We provide a compiled matrix of tribological solutions to choose from based on operational level requirements. By working closely with Pratt & Whitney during our Phase I effort and as well as during this research project on technical issues and risk analysis we shall do our first engine test third quarter of 2006 on a bearing sleeve, followed by further engine testing with our new technology on turbopump gears.

In addition to high, irreversible, charge efficiency losses, hydrogen presents a major safety concern particularly in self contained oxygen systems. Under Phase I, Excellatron demonstrated innovative rechargeable Lithium-Nickel cells that preclude hydrogen gas generation.

Intermat has produced nosetip billets with a variety of \u2018carbide core\u2019 configurations. A variation of this technology is to insert core regions of solid high temperature metals or carbides to create a center core region that reacts differently from the parent C/C material in a manner that facilitates management of the ablation rate experienced by the nosetip.  In placing a core of material into the nosetip that will ablate slower than the C/C under glide reentry conditions, Intermat and its team have demonstrated that a lower than typical ablation rate on the nosetip specimen can be achieved. The Phase 2 program would expand upon the material screening performed under the Phase 1 effort and then permit the evaluation of a second generation of specimens (material configurations) that would apply lessons learned to managing the flight conditions over initial dive, glide and terminal dive with the goal of providing both extended flight capability through lower ablation rates.",

Advanced photodiode arrays using InGaAs are able to accurately track the reflected light as a function of time by converting the light return from a laser pulse to a photocurrent pulse for each pixel.  The Readout Integrated Circuit (ROIC) must be capable of accurately sampling and processing the return pulse at each pixel at intervals of 1 ns or less. A unique CMOS based architecture, called PASH ROIC, is presented, which permits sampling the photocurrent pulse of each pixel at 1-2 GHz frequencies and also includes high speed analog track and hold circuits for temporary storage of the sampled data at each pixel. The proposed PASH ROIC architecture also incorporates an ADC that could be integrated as part of the ROIC to convert the analog data to digital data for real time digital processing applications.",

It will demonstrate that a global control approach improves jitter performance over traditional methods that employ independent cascaded control. The new methodology treats jitter and beamwalk systems as an integrated opto-mechanical structure, and controls active optical components including mirrors so that the servos are informed by what happens elsewhere in the system. For laser weapon systems, reduced jitter means improved lethality, and for light gathering systems including telescopes and cameras, better imaging resolution at greater range. Overall system design cycle time is reduced since it is easier to accommodate system changes as hardware constraints and parameters are ascertained. Benefits of the global coordinated control methodology will be demonstrated on the Aerospace Relay Mirror System (ARMS) in both simulation and on the Low Altitude Field Experiment working with Boeing-SVS. The research will begin with review of the ARMS testbed and proceed to development and integration of system-level models. Design and application of the global methodology will then lead into software and hardware implementation tasks, leading to a demonstration on the ARMS testbed.",

Wavelength tuning and electro-optical tuning can be realized for coarse and fine tuning with scanning speed faster than 1 microsecond.

Absorption reduces the intensity of detected target signatures, bright atmospheric backgrounds reduce target/background contrast, temporal and spatial atmospheric structures confuse target detection algorithms.

This dependence makes it impossible to extrapolate information from one spectral region to another, limiting the use of measurements to their specific band pass.

The current highly accurate state-of-the-art (SAMM2) is limited in two ways: (1) it is designed to compute a single line-of-sight as opposed to scenes and (2) its core numerical algorithm is geared toward reproducing the exact line-by-line result as opposed to being optimized for speed.  This Phase II intends to address both technical limitations.  To address scene generation requirements, SAMM2 will be upgraded to efficiently compute collections of related lines-of-sight.  These upgrades will constitute additional functionality.  No existing capabilities will be eliminated.  To address rapid computation requirements, SAMM2 will gain a collection of new radiation transport algorithms.  These algorithms will be constructed either in-house or by third-party developers and will integrate into SAMM2 through a software interface.  Within SAMM2, the algorithms will operate at varying degrees of speed and fidelity.  Collectively, these algorithms will allow MDA to select the mix of speed and fidelity appropriate for any given problem with all algorithms operating within a single, physically consistent background code.",

This lack of precise alignment of the rhenium throat causes unacceptable directional control errors to the MKV\u2019s.

Current possible solutions for filling the void of radiation hard non-volatile memories are FeRAM, MRAM, NRAM, and CRAM.  From these options, CRAM is a major prospect to be incorporated in current space computer architectures for the hostile radiation environment of space. CRAM, however, still requires some advancement/refinement in technology to be a suitable replacement for Flash memory with operating characteristics similar to SRAM.  Several issues associated with CRAM technology are the long SET and RESET times and the high powers required to change the phase of the memory element.  Nantero\u2019s carbon nanotube (CNT) nanoelectronic technology may assist in overcoming several of the hurdles that are hampering the incorporation of CRAM as a reliable radiation hard non-volatile memory.  The goal of this Phase II proposal is to investigate the utilization of CNT nanoheaters to change the phase of the chalcogenide material employed in BAE\u2019s CRAM technology, creating a prototype CNT heated CRAM element.",

In order to justify the cost of switching from legacy proprietary satellite solutions to standard-based one such as DVB-RCS, cost alone is not sufficient. Because DoD is transitioning its future NCO based on the concept of GIG providing stable, high-bandwidth backbone and all the ground units need to comply eventually, having full GIG interoperability will make the decision to use DVB-RCS based solution less painful than upgrading their proprietary solutions.

        "abstract": "As airborne radar missions migrate to orbital platforms, the required size of the RF aperture increases significantly with operating range.  This places additional limitations on allowable mass and stowed volume relative to effective launch vehicle options  These large physical apertures, high stowage efficiency and low mass requirements promote RF antenna designs with limited mechanical planarity and temporal stability.  Large aperture space-based radar (SBR) approaches require some form of metrology to measure and compensate aggregate mechanical and electrical errors in the antenna subsystem.  The lack of antenna knowledge limits phase coherence and creates dynamic errors relative to antenna gain, sidelobe levels, beam steering accuracy, and amplitude/phase balance among multiple channel configurations.  Collectively, these errors significantly impact ISR performance and must be corrected to achieve operational utility. TSC will develop a RF-based metrology system architecture, hardware design and supporting software algorithms for both monolithic and distributed aperture SBR concepts.  The layered metrology architecture will support integration with multiple SBR payload designs.  The projected capability of the metrology system (i.e. residual errors) will be assessed with respect to its impact on overall SMTI/SAR mission performance. These coupled metrology-ISR performance models will support integrated trades of metrology, antenna design, and achieved ISR performance.",

        "abstract": "Cyber attacks are a constant drain on resource, and a serious threat to our privacy, commerce, and security.  Numerous efforts are underway to detect, analyze, deter, and respond to attacks.  Nonetheless, attacks will be successful, and Computer Network Defense (CND) systems themselves will succumb to such attacks.  The Secure Agent Based Operations Reconstitution (SABOR) technology addresses the problem of rapidly and automatically reconstructing a CND system, possibly in a degraded mode, with the resources that remain after an attack has occurred. In Phase I, a prototype implementation of key components demonstrated not only that SABOR was feasible, but that its applicability is not limited to a single system, and that the it may be used to recover from failures in general, and not only failures caused by a cyber attack. In this Phase II SBIR proposal, we submit plans to further develop the reconstitution technology explored in Phase I, and to extend the scope to include: detection of a system-wide failure in a running system, application of the SABOR technology to WCI-CND in a demonstration environment, and development of a plan for the future deployment of the SABOR technology to the fielded WCI-CND application.",

The technology has immediate commercial applications and the feasibility of AAR for small unmanned vehicles has been successfully demonstrated in the Phase I project.  A total system solution to AAR has been conceived that includes a precision relative navigation sensor system, an Intelligent Supervisory Controller, the engagement and fuel transfer hardware, and a receiver vehicle control scheme which together comprise the Autonomous Aerial Refueling System (AARS).  The Phase I project has rapidly matured the AAR technology by leveraging the skills and dedication of a team that includes Sargent Fletcher, Texas A&M University, Boeing and StarVision Technologies, Inc.  During the Phase I effort a novel supervisory controller was developed and tested that will govern the refueling operation between two unmanned vehicles.  A high fidelity simulation tool was developed to predict in-flight behavior and an innovative technique for conducting low-cost flight experiments was fabricated and tested.  Initial flight experiments in environments relevant to the intended use have begun.",

The proposed work is focused on development of several novel design concepts and manufacturing methods for composite-to-composite and composite-to-metal joints, including lap and butt joints, joints of composite skins and stiffeners, \u00d0-joint elements and other similar connectors. All of them are based on the use of hybrid 3-D woven and 3-D braided fabric preforms which incorporate metal filaments, multi-filament yarns, or wires. Dry preforms or composites that include these metal elements on specified surface(s) can be welded or brazed to another preforms or composites of a similar nature, or to solid metal elements. Using this new concept of joining will allow, as anticipated, to significantly increase strength and durability of dissimilar material joints. Design and manufacturing of special fabric preforms, fabrication of experimental joints samples and their experimental evaluation will be supported by 3-D micromechanics modeling and predictive analysis of stress/strain fields, progressive failure, and fracture phenomena. The combined experimental and theoretical effort will be used to validate the efficiency of proposed joining concepts.",

During Phase II, we will develop models of the relationship between actuation control variables and the resulting changes in the transient flow field around the airfoil in order to develop methods for the design and optimization of SJA systems for various UAV and wing geometries.

By taioring the material and/or thickness to allow higher strength capability near stess concentrations, fillet radii, doors or other features, weight can be reduced by using lower strength material and or thinner product than is conventionally used, i.e. higher cost materials are used only where necessary. Additionally, T-joint FSW with fillet radii will further enhance structural design flexability to offer the potential for lighter weight structures.

Specifically this effort will investigate CoMeld and Cold Spray technologies for their application to hybrid joining concepts.    This program will focus on these new technologies for formation of in-situ fasteners for joining composites and metals.  Initially coupon level tests will be performed using a design of experiments and the results will be used to populate the analysis database.  In addition, preliminary fatigue and corrosion performance questions for these new joints will be answered.  The data will be used for down-selecting the \u201cbest\u201d joining technique, which will subsequently be verified through subcomponent testing.

The proposed sensor will overcome the limitations of current point sensors for 3D flow field measurement, because SPHIRE is a full-field 3D optical sensor with light-speed holographic recording of an event in thousands of temporal sequence images.  From these images, a highly sensitive holographic interferometric analysis can determine the temporal and spatial distribution of 3D velocity temperature and pressure of the high-speed flow field.  In Phase I POC demonstrated the feasibility of the concept by developing a design of a SPHIRE sensor system, specifying the required key components available showing that the system can achieve the spatial and temporal resolution required for Mach 0.6 to 3 flow fields, and demonstrating the concept by laboratory experiments.  In Phase II POC will design and build a fully operational prototype SPHIRE system and integrate it with data collection and 3D reconstruction software.

In aluminum assemblies, FSW provides improved joint strength, fatigue properties and crack resistance compared to conventional arc welded or riveted joints.  One of the current barriers to widespread use of FSW is that the process generally requires the use of clamping systems that are often cumbersome, complex, and expensive.  During Phase I, Texas Research Institute Austin, Inc. (TRI/Austin) and Remmele Engineering, Inc. (Remmele) developed and demonstrated a new and innovative friction stir welding process enhancement, by which components can be efficiently friction stir welded without the need of expensive and cumbersome clamping systems. This new technology can make the FSW process more affordable by decreasing tooling costs and preparation time, and can increase assembly rates.  TRI/Austin and Remmele anticipate that this technology will facilitate the design of FSW assemblies that would otherwise be impractical due to the difficulty of clamping the components.  During Phase II, TRI/Austin and Remmele will further develop and demonstrate this process enhancement, with the ultimate goal of manufacturing an all-aluminum version of the F/A-22 Canted Inlet that meets all design requirements, but is less costly than the current design.",

This proof of concept work has shown an ability to schedule multiple sensors simultaneously.

The topcoat should have excellent adhesion to the properly applied corrosion coat of the epoxy barrier coating or other prime and/or intermediate coats on atmospheric steel surfaces.  This is responding to many needs of the Navy and other branches of the Armed Forces and civilian facilities owners.  In the course of Phase II Premier Coating Systems, Inc. proposes to evaluate the best formulations developed in Phase I using standard Industry practice.  Following this evaluation, the Low VOC Topcoat will be refined using the utmost available technology and materials available.  Final test criteria will be established for evaluation against the MIL-PRF-85285C, Type II, Coating, Polyurethane, High Build Finish.  Application of the selected formulation materials for laboratory and field testing will be evaluated in order to demonstrate that they meet the required Low VOC Topcoat performance criteria of application properties, VOC, dry time, pot life, gloss, flexibility, elongation, adhesion, sag resistance, opacity and weather resistance.  A Product Data Sheet detailing the Low VOC Topcoat's properties and its application procedures will then be drafted. BENEFITS: The UV protection for the many billions of dollars worth of atmospheric steel structures owned by the Navy that are subjected to sunlight exposure and weathering degradation will represent substantial repetitive annual savings.  In addition, similar installations belonging to other branches of the military and to municipal governments and organizations will benefit from the use of the moisture and oxygen impermeable Low VOC Topcoat.

        "abstract": "Broadband, true time delay phase shifters based on MEMS switches provide the high instantaneous bandwidth desired for applications such as multi-frequency antenna arrays with multiple functions such as radar, communications, and ECM. MEMS based phase shifters offer significant performance advantages compared to technologies using PIN diode or MESFET switches including high linearity that does not limit the dynamic range of the receiver in a crowded signal environment.  Furthermore, MEMS phase shifters offer a combination of low RF insertion loss and low switch control power consumption that is unmatched by PIN diode or MESFET technologies, giving the MEMS phase shifters a decided advantage at reducing prime power consumption in airborne or space based systems.  Radant MEMS Inc., with its demonstrated 500 billion cycle high lifetime MEMS switch, designed, fabricated and tested a proof-of-concept true time delay, 1-6 GHz, hybrid MEMS phase shifter during the Phase I effort.  During Phase II, Radant will finalize the design for an integrated 6-bit, 5 Watt MEMS phase shifter. This design will subsequently be fabricated and tested, resulting in a compact, low cost phase shifter that is hermetically sealed using the same wafer capping process now employed for Radant\u2019s MEMS switches.",

        "abstract": "The Navy has issued a challenge to develop an interactive simulation environment that will model tactical and environmental entities in real time and enable goal-directed scenario generation.  This will serve the needs of a myriad of applications, such as system integration, testing, certification, training, rehearsal, and life-cycle support. The current methodology of generating pre-planned \u201ccanned\u201d scenarios does not provide the testing personnel or training teams with the robustness and flexibility needed to optimize their objectives. Newly emerging technologies, such as intelligent agent-based software components, enable the creation of high fidelity models that can be controlled \u201con the fly.\u201d   Real-time control of any of the tactical entity-impacting variables, from sea state or threat submarine depth, will result in an immediate change in the stimulation level to reflect the changing simulated tactical or environmental situation. 21st Century Systems, Incorporated (21CSI) is pleased to propose to continue its research and development of the Submarine Automated Simulation (SubAutoSim). SubAutoSim is an intelligent agent-based software architecture that will enable the assignment of constraints and/or objectives for automated creation and control of simulated entities during a training or test scenario in order to improve realism for systems development and training activities. BENEFITS: The Modeling and Simulation community is making great progress in developing ever more complex virtual environments for training, testing, gaming, designing, rehearsing and planning, to name a few.  Many of these commercial M&S systems work with scenarios that have an input from an unpredictable human source.  In these cases, the requirement for agent-based simulation controls that can optimize the simulation for the unfolding situation would certainly be of great value. SubAutoSim\u2019s agent-based technology being development for the Submarine OBTT Master Controller will clearly have its initial applications in the back fit submarines employing the BQQ-10 Sonar system, of which OBTT is resident.  The technology will be equally useful in the various submarine attack centers and simulators.  As the fleet operators become more familiar with the submarine-based applications and its training benefits, it is expected that the other warfare communities will introduce the technologies into their afloat training products and systems.  While the specific agents discussed in this Phase II are submarine training centric and exclusively conceived for Naval training scenarios, the technology that unburdens the training system operators and enhances training effectiveness are universal and clearly has opportunities to transition with other military organizations. The leveraging of the 21CSI AEDGE\u00ae open agent architecture will allow rapid prototyping of warfare specific training applications and agents at a fraction of the development cost that others may require.  In general, the SubAutoSim concept adds intelligence and more mission fidelity to a simulation/stimulation training system. It fills the gap between qualification training and mission training/rehearsal. This allows the training to be enhanced from a mere \u201cdriving the boat\u201d simulator to an intelligent synthetic mission environment. The concept can be applied to any number of military, government, and civilian domains. Beyond submarines, the application of SubAutoSim-like concepts can be applied to a flight simulator to create a synthetic mission environment for the aviator. Beyond mere \u201cstick-and-rudder\u201d training, the aviator can train and rehearse in a variety of missions. In the commercial realm, transportation, power, and manufacturing operations are likely domains to apply the SubAutoSim-like concepts to create more mission-oriented training.",

Information overload concerns in real-time interactions require presenting the right information to the right user at the right time. Our approach is to model users, the roles users fulfill, task models, and task context to allow a customized view of information for each participant. The result of the Phase I project was a prototype groupware system for Time-Sensitive Targeting (TST) based on TREK, a Toolkit for Role-aware Exchange of Knowledge. This system aided users in maintaining shared awareness of tasks and roles. Under Phase II, we plan to expand TREK with a thorough investigation of the TST domain and the construction of models using Concept Mapping as well as ontological representation and reasoning tools. We plan to include intelligent systems for automated filtering and discovery of information and tailoring of representations. We foresee transitioning TREK to a Network Centric Warfare (NCW) environment via the incorporation of agent-based interaction. We envision these distributed software agents gathering information and negotiating routine aspects of remote coordination, aiding the transition of TREK-based systems to the distributed paradigm of NCW.",

It operates in local contexts over string operators.  The ABC Machine  is motivated by analyzing the biochemical processing in cells.

For Phase 2, the ABC Machine will be emulated on a High Performance Cluster (HPC) machine to achieve near term results on complex cognitive problems.  Phase 1 demonstrated advantages over traditional AI algorithms on cenventional machines in the following ways:  1)  pattern recognition problems with very large numbers of classes and noisy data perform well without training,  2) production systems with deep search spaces using heuristics or a \"best first\" search strategy generate good results with graceful degradation,  3) complex systems simulation with properties of \"emergence\" can be effectively modeled on a large scale.",

First, with Propheteer we abandon the typical consensus-driven modeling approach in favor of an approach that solicits asynchronous knowledge contributions (in the form of alternative future scenarios and indicators) without burdening the user with endless certainty or probability estimates.  Second, we enable knowledge contributions by personnel beyond the typical core decision making group, thereby casting light on blindspots, mitigating human biases, and helping maintain the currency of the developed behavior models.  Last, we propose to motivate knowledge contributions by supporting capabilities that go beyond the central threat modeling and prediction tasks, such as current situation monitoring and context enhanced search.

The driver for the active system therefore has to fit within the envelope of the earplug, and be able to produce sound pressure levels at the eardrum high enough to effectively cancel the noise at that location.  Using a systems model for the ANR earplug, we have determined in Phase I that three different basic designs (one electromagnetic and two electrostatic) have the potential for meeting these and other requirements.  The purpose of the work proposed here is to design and fabricate specific prototype units for full evaluation, and then select the most promising candidate for final delivery and incorporation into the ANR earplug.",

        "abstract": "We argue that traditional cultural factors (from Hofstede, Nisbett, etc.) are too abstract to provide good, predictive models of important human performance behaviors such as compliance with directives. Instead, we focus on culture-specific social interaction behaviors in language, gesture, etc. (i.e., \"etiquette\") as a more concrete and quantifiable bridge between abstract cultural factors and human performance. We describe a computational model of etiquette and face threat perception developed under other funding. In Phase I, we developed hypotheses about the relation of deep cultural factors to etiquette perception and directive compliance, with a testbed and experimental methodology for evaluating those hypotheses.  In Phase II, we propose a series of experiments to validate and tune our computational model of these related phenomena. Experiments will involve human task performance in a militarily-relevant, yet controlled domain where directives are given. Experimenters will select participants for cultural factors and will quantitatively control the level of etiquette of issued directives. Relevant compliance data (e.g., compliance accuracy, response time, attitudes, etc.) will be collected as dependent variables. Finally, we will incorporate the resulting model in a prototype design (notionally, a user interface or training materials) to illustrating the effects of culture-specific etiquette on directive compliance.",

There remain significant obstacles, however, before broadcast/multicast data can be transmitted securely over wireless channels.   Furthermore, issues regarding how information is shared between differently classified networks must also be addressed. Under Phase I, Trident delivered a high-level design of a multicast protocol framework, which allows for heterogeneity of protocols for different applications, yet provides a common API, including much needed security services.  This design provides for secure collaboration and adaptive algorithm/key management of multicast information, including SATCOM/wireless communications.  Under separate funding, Trident has developed the Collaboration Gateway (CG), which enables users on different classified networks to securely share information across a certified guard. Under the Phase II, we will continue the effort and we will implement a Secure Multicast Framework (SMF) that will provide complete end-to-end secure multicast processing capability. The architecture will be extensible, thus enabling collaboration using audio and video conferencing and shared whiteboard tools to be easily supported. The system will be based on the advanced industry standards including IPSec, GSAKMP, and PKI.

The Army spends an estimated $2 billion to $2.5 billion per year addressing corrosion-related issues with ground vehicles.  Low cost and easy to use corrosivity sensors are required to help the Army effectively manage corrosion and reduce vehicle life cycle costs.  Knowledge of cumulative environmental severity and corrosion protection system condition for individual vehicles will enable more effective prediction of asset life and reduce waste generation from vehicle depainting and repainting.  To meet this critical military need, Luna Innovations is developing an ultra low cost corrosivity sensor system specifically designed for the rigorous operational environment of Army ground vehicles.  The proposed sensor system integrates proven thin film corrosivity sensor technology to create a robust, ultra low cost, and highly adaptive monitoring platform.  The corrosivity monitoring system is being developed for easy integration into vehicle structures and to provide for a quick non-contact sensor reading that is easy to interpret.

The advanced strap down seekers being developed for programs such as MKV Carrier Vehicle, MKC Kill Vehicle and even THAAD potential future enhancements all require an IMU that can be mounted directly to the seeker camera detector platform.    A small form factor IMU can be mounted in closer proximity to the seeker camera detector, which is typically an IR focal plane array.  Having the IMU in a tightly coupled mount to the detector array allows for the best detector motion compensation due to being able to minimize any differences in motion between the detector and IMU.   By producing the gyro component of the small form factor IMU using a resonant micro optic waveguide it is felt that Fiber Optical Gyro (FOG) level performance can eventually be achieved while reducing the volume and mass significantly from FOG solutions.  This is primarily due to the resonant waveguide not requiring the lengthy optical path that FOGs must have to achieve the same level of performance.",

Spectral Sciences, Inc. proposes to develop a novel, high-speed, adaptive spectral imaging sensor for use as a research and development tool for monitoring combustion progress and temperature in the scramjet flow channel and exit plane.  The sensor measures temporally and spectrally resolved thermal radiance from combustion products (water and hydroxyl radical) over multiple lines of sight.  As the Phase I device demonstrates, by continually measuring different parts of the spectrum, time-resolved gas temperature and water and hydroxyl concentrations are retrieved.  This passive, non-intrusive approach is ideally suited to the demanding hypersonic shock tunnel test environment, which is characterized by a very short experiment duration (time scale of milliseconds), limited optical access, and inhomogeneous fluid densities.  The instrument features a robust, high-throughput design combining optical fibers with dynamically programmable dispersive optics containing no macroscopic moving parts.  The spectral and spatial resolution are controlled through software, and the bandpasses can be digitally shaped to cancel interfering background radiation.  This versatility should make the instrument applicable and cost effective for a wide variety of high-speed spectral applications.",

        "abstract": "As software systems become increasingly complex, distributed, component-based, and dynamically reconfigurable, the shortcomings of conventional verification and testing methods have become more pronounced.  Faults that lead to failures are hard to localize, and even when system failures are traced back to actual component faults, they are usually established through post analysis of the system execution.  Near real-time point-wise detection and localization of component failures at run-time is extremely difficult with existing test and verification processes, where test cases are developed a priori to exercise the system under specific configurations.  Emergent configurations along with dynamic patterns of interactions of component instances that are linked and associated at run-time complicate the analysis of the correctness of component interactions.  The lack of formal or semi-formal specifications associated with reused components further complicates modular reasoning about system behavior. Therefore, new methodologies and strategies of modular analysis and reasoning for component-based, dynamically reconfigurable complex distributed systems are necessary. In the Phase I SBIR, Trident suggested a computational framework that facilitated a scalable approach to localize the detection of faults that occur at run-time.  The elements of the approach are: (1) local certification of components with respect to their contractual specifications, (2) packaging of the contracts, test cases, and built-in self test mechanisms with the component using a metadata wrapper technology, and (3) use of associated run-time interface violation detector mechanisms to detect deviations from acceptable behavior as components reconfigure and interact at run-time.  By embodying the behavioral interface models with semi-automatically generated wrappers, the technology supports services for run-time contract violation checking and built-in-self testing even when the underlying component technology does not provide built-in introspective reflection capabilities. The benefits of the method were two fold:  First, it demonstrated how behavioral interface specifications and built-in testing could be used to locally certify components and to be packaged and distributed with them; second, the run-time contract violation strategy helped to localize the cause of faults as they occurred at run-time in complex systems. Under this SBIR Phase II effort Trident proposes to apply the methods identified in the successful Phase I, and prove their efficacy in a land-based demonstration in an E-2C computing environment in the ESTEL (Engineering System Test and Evaluation Laboratory) at NAS Patuxent River. Trident will develop and implement the Phase I research and concurrently leverage and tailor selected additional Trident SBIR-based technologies in order to develop, test, and demonstrate in a full scale CVD environment prototype (including the technologies and methodology) to significantly reduce the risks of instantiating the IABM into the E-2C program.",

New LADAR seeker concepts are desired that incorporate additional discriminants to improve target ID in scenarios including partially obscured targets and distant targets.  To enable these advanced LADAR concepts, new high performance laser sources are needed with output characteristics that enable advanced additional imaging modalities.

The proposed optical source is all fiber based and packaged in a compact, rugged, and U-rack mountable fashion.  It produces high pulse energy and excellent output beam quality.

This combination necessitates the cost-effective deployment of large apertures while maintaining aerodynamic performance. Externally mounted antenna arrays are not a satisfactory solution due to the large size at low frequencies, for example with UHF foliage penetration radar. Another approach employs copper-on-Kapton\u00ae (or RF-on-flex) circuits adhered to composite airframe wings and fuselages. However, Kapton\u00ae does not bond well to composites and requires delicate surface treatments that disrupt the manufacturing process while introducing delamination risks. We propose an alternate structurally-integrated conformal antenna approach employing 3D woven sheets of conductive fibers incorporating microwave array structures and through-layer structural reinforcements in a single co-cured structure. Impact resistance, fatigue tolerance and shear load carrying capability are improved with manufacturing compatible processes while overall airframe loads are reduced.  The proposed work will demonstrate advanced structurally-integrated conductive fiber antenna technology and transition this technology to an airframe with the cooperation of our transition partner. During Phase I, we constructed a canonical microwave antenna using conductive fiber stitched preforms and epoxy resin transfer molding (RTM). We are currently weaving 3D antenna preforms and constructing a ten square foot radiator section for manufacturability studies. In Phase II, we will extend these results by constructing several larger radiator panels and extensively testing the RF and structural performance.

The existing VSLRC is an interactive system that increases support to the space systems surface-fighter by providing access to near real-time system operational and equipment status and linking logistics data to its impact on operational readiness. The FTI/Synergy Team will provide important automation and data handling capabilities that will enable users to provide more timely updates of system status information, enabling effective decisions on system mission readiness. The Phase II research effort will develop prototypes of the enhanced capabilities for testing and user feedback of proposed software functionality and will implement the capabilities in VSLRC.

        "abstract": "Q-DOT proposes to develop an Ultra-Compact (1-2 chip) UWB Transient Receiver/Digitizer to enable the practical military application of UWB for identifying targets behind walls or in foliage. To date, UWB target identification system (TIS) deployment has been severely impeded by the rack-mounted, laboratory equipment required for the receiver/digitizer function. Besides its large SWaP, the dynamic range (i.e., ENOB) commercial equipment is inadequate for UWB TIS. With almost four to eight times more dynamic range, the proposed Receiver/Digitizer will enable numerous types of UWB TIS equipment for a variety of ground-based and airborne operations, specifically including handheld and UAV-borne UWB TISs. The critical UWB R/D RFIC leverages the Government\u2019s investment in Q-DOT\u2019s high-speed, high-precision ADC currently in development. The RFIC will be realized in IBM\u2019s 8HP SiGe BiCMOS process via DoD\u2019s ITAR-compliant Trusted Foundry Agreement (TFA).  During Phase I, the Receiver/Digitizer was configured to meet a wide range of mission requirements.  Critical elements were conceptually designed to project their performance.  The UWB R/D RFIC will be developed with Phase II SBIR funds under Phase IIA.  Hittite Microwave Corporation will provide resources to package and test the RFIC as well as develop an Evaluation Board under Phase IIB.  Both military and commercial products will be developed in Phase III.",

A small, unobtrusive UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) capable of transporting sensors such as a video camera to a bomb impact site would greatly assist in determining, in real-time, the efficacy of the strike without exposing the operator to danger.

The FAST concept offers many key system benefits including: (1) programmable 0.5 meter accuracy height-of-burst, (2) ground profiling, even with heavy foliage, (3) height-of-burst, near surface burst, and penetrator operating modes, (4) affordable design based on low cost commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components, and (5) meets production goal costs of $1500 for nose mount and $2000 for tail mount variants. This effort will consist of three major activities: (1) making modifications to the existing FAST algorithms, (2) demonstrating this capability through local drop testing, and (3) validating Mustang\u2019s launch-to-burst (LTB) simulation and using this simulation to predict the performance for Urban FAST operating in a tactical environment.

        "abstract": "The Advanced Tactical Laser is being developed as an platform for high-precision strike missions utilizing a laser weapon mounted to a tactical aircraft.  Boresighted cameras provide the system with high-resolution imagery for the identification and discrimination of targets of interest.  The ATL will allow precision, near-instantaneous delivery of laser energy from a long stand-off distance, with enough power density to melt metal.  The ATL will thus allow the disability of vehicles, command and communications infrastructure, or even missiles, without substantial collateral damage or casualties.  In situations where there is some uncertainty about the visual identification of targets, the coherent nature of the radiation from the ATL allows a more in-depth determination of what is being targeted by probing the material and surface characteristics of the irradiated object. By observing the polarization aspects of the scattered light from an illuminated object, one can determine the approximate engagement geometry and material.  The total amount of light detected then allows classification of the object based on surface roughness and texture.  The dynamic aspects of both the polarization and detected scatter allows detection of object motion or rotation, providing further opportunity for classification of the object\u2019s material, surface finish, and threat probability.",

The optics of both sensors will resemble the eyes of arthropods, which have evolved tiny, multi-aperture structures consisting of large numbers of independent facets on a convex surface.  An arthropod\u2019s \"compound eyes\" are built as conformal structures around the outside of its head in order to displace a minimal volume for maximum utility.  The proposed SPILAB optical systems mimic the same conformal architecture, though the specific implementation is derived from the superposition compound eye.

Magnet-based microphones in macroscale technologies have advantages in sensitivity, bandwidth, ruggednes, and water resistance; similar advantages can be expected on the microscale.  Ribbon designs in particular should show strong moisture and flight deck EMI resistance due to the low impedances involved.  The Phase II program will involve fabrication of a prototype co-located microphone/microspeaker array, including a circuit board and ruggedized housing; characterization of the new design and demonstration in ANR; refinement of the design, and fabrication of ten final prototype units for delivery to the Air Force.

The high-performance, monolithic, CMOS LIDAR receiver benefits from silicon\u2019s high, 532 nm quantum efficiency and its low avalanche multiplication noise. Monolithically integrating the SSIL\u2019s photodetector, amplifier, and sampling circuits in a single CMOS chip eliminates bond and solder connections, lowers parasitic capacitance, reduces noise, and increases bandwidth. The shorter connection between the photodiode and amplifier increases the receiver\u2019s immunity to electromagnetic interference.

The glue that holds many of these forces together and motivates them to fight is a common belief system, or shared cultural identity.

An individual person can have multiple cultural identities because he or she belongs to a number of different groups.  Cultural identities are also dynamic.  To address these difficulties, we propose to create the Simulation of Cultural Identities for Prediction of Reactions (SCIPR) system.  SCIPR is a set of analysis methods and a simulation modeling tool that combines a method for determining relevant cultural identities with an agent-based simulation tool to predict responses to events, including U.S. and adversary courses of action (COAs), as well as non-military events, such as civil reconstruction and political events.  SCIPR draws on cultural anthropology to understand how cultural identities are defined and how they may change over time in response to events and actions, and employs agent-based modeling to simulate these dynamics and predict responses to COAs.",

A key capability provided by OAUSV will be the ability to fuse data obtained by off-board systems with UV sensor data in real-time.  As shown in our Phase I work, the ability to utilize off-board data significantly improves the ability of the UV to maneuver around potentially threatening objects and dramatically reduces the number of false alarms.

        "abstract": "TSC will further develop a new three-dimensional Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) imaging algorithm that creates a 3D radar image of a ballistic target in arbitrary torque-free motion and simultaneously estimates its complete rotational state. The algorithm development and testing will be carried out using Project Hercules high-fidelity simulations and available measured flight test data. The TSC algorithm exploits the fact that the motion of such targets, and hence the space-time paths of scatterers rigidly attached to them, are deterministically constrained by Euler\u2019s torque-free equations of motion. The assumption of linear variation of scatterer phase with time (constant Doppler assumption) is eliminated in favor of modeled space-time trajectories depending on generalized coordinates.  TSC demonstrated the feasibility of 3D ISAR imaging of realistic ballistic targets in Phase I, and also demonstrated the unique capability to precisely estimate the rotational motion state of a simulated target via optimization.  The capability to image objects in three dimensions without the need of motion knowledge from other algorithms or sensors is a clear advance in the state of the art for ISAR imaging. TSC will fully develop and evaluate this promising radar signal processing algorithm for implementation in the radar elements of BMD.",

The technical approach relies on careful triggering of a large number of smaller pulsers such that the generated pulses radiate and coherently combine to produce a single large pulse in the far field.  The synchronization board that produces the timing signals will be able to generate arbitrarily timed trigger signals with a resolution of three pico-seconds and an RMS accuracy of seven pico-seconds. As a side benefit, the system will also be able to act as an electronically steer-able phased array.

Ceramic liners are obvious candidates due to their high wear and corrosion resistance, as well as high temperature capabilities, and Si3N4 is a preferred material. However, Si3N4 tubes greater that 200mm in length cannot be fabricated to the required tolerances due to bowing during processing. It is proposed that this problem be addressed by combining developed green body fabrication processes as practiced commercially by SiNeramics with the patented continuous sintering process of Dr. Dale E. Wittmer, Wittmer Consultants, Inc. (WCI). This sintering has already been demonstrated to be enabling in terms of producing ceramic bodies that maintain dimensional integrity over significant lengths. Two Si3N4-based compositions will be explored: (1) a cost effective, commercial one that has excellent properties, and (2) a typical one where oxide additives, incorporated as coatings, will be used to improve uniformity of the green body and minimize density gradients. The combined extensive advanced gun barrel material development experience of MER with SiNeramics and WCI\u2019s expertise ensures high potential for the successful development of SiN4 tubes for gun barrel applications.",

System timing jitter is fundamentally important for digital systems and phase noise is the figure of merit for RF systems. For multi-GB/s clocks,  optoelectronic oscillators using optical delay for the clock period,  appear to have significant advantages. The phase noise may be minimized because the delay variability lies only in stability of the refractive index, providing low noise figure devices are available. The significant phase noise may then be relegated to the clock period adjustment mechanism and the RIN noise on the optical source. Optoelectronic oscillators have been reported that use a collection of lasers, modulators, delays and RF amplifiers. Although phase noise is improved, the system is bulky and power consumptive. OPEL\u2019s integrated version is based upon a non-linear switching device that performs as both a laser source and detector. Monolithically integrated control HFETs and optical waveguides, enable an oscillator with minimal chip space and phase noise approaching the quantum limit, since the RIN noise is that of the VCSEL (-160dB/Hz).

We already demonstrated significant improvement in the RF performance of AlGaN/InGaN/AlGaN/GaN-based HFETs with the recessed gate design.  We used our novel Migration Enhanced MOCVD (MEMOCVDTM) deposition technique to incorporate a very thin (2 nm) InGaN layer into the AlGaN barrier.  The InGaN layer was used as a stop-etch layer for RIE etching and selective wet chemical etching was used to remove the InGaN stop-etch layer using two proprietary etch processes.  We propose to combine this approach with our novel AlGaN/AlInGaN/InGaN/GaN based Triple HFET (THFET) design.  A quaternary AlInGaN cap layer grown over the InGaN channel will be used as a second stop etch layer for the RIE. We will recess both source and drain contacts and will fabricate them on the In-containing AlInGaN cap layer for reduced contact resistance.  The expected benefits of the proposed design are higher gain and breakdown voltage, better linearity of the RF devices and suppression of current dispersion.  We will also use our MOSHFET gate dielectric process to achieve superior device reliability and stability for transition to commercialization.",

The combat controller does not have a single unified graphical view of the area of operations (AO) that would allow him to make quicker, accurate decisions. This requires both the CCT and pilot to envision a \"mental picture\" of the AO. The CCT must use multiple pieces of gear, which include a laptop, radios, lazing device, lights, and GPS. Scalability is dependent on the number of combat controllers who can carry all the ATC gear. VIPMobile will develop a highly integrated network-centric, software/hardware solution that will provide the combat controller with up-to-date situational awareness to allow optimal information transfer, improved decision-making, and succinct communications between the CCT and pilot. The VIPMobile Integrated Software Visualization (VIP ISV) package combines VIPMobile's existing visualization and interactive GUI software and Georgia Tech's FalconView to create a single unified combat controller interface with multiple selectable dynamic layers that can be customized for mission type and data availability.

        "abstract": "The purpose of this endeavor is to develop innovative protective coatings that can be applied over composite structures and impart unique and vastly improved flame, smoke, and toxicity (FST) characteristics. Texas Research Institute Austin will build on our previously successful Phase I work to further develop new preceramic coatings. This is a new and distinctive class of fire retardant intumescent coatings. Upon exposure to fire, this new coating swells into a tough, durable, insulating char that protects the underlying composite substrate. In the Phase I effort TRI/Austin developed and tested ambient cured, VOC and HAP free, abrasion resistant, chemically resistant, fire retardant coatings. These aerospace composite coatings exhibit extended times to ignition at very high heat fluxes in cone calorimetry tests. Peak heat times up to 530 seconds have been recorded in cone testing. Phase II focuses on further formulation optimization of the composite coating, product scale up, field application studies, and comprehensive laboratory testing. Extant intumescent coatings don\u2019t provide adequate heat and fire protection. The proposed preceramic coating binders are new materials, finding applications within the last five years. Improved fire and heat resistance for composite aerospace structures translates into saving warfighter and firefighter lives.",

Based on technology with a nominal lifetime of 105 hours of continuous operation, Voxtel\u2019s monolithic solid-state architecture is both more manufacturable and rugged than the existing tube-based instrument. Two innovations lie at the heart of the new wavefront sensor: 1) novel low-noise APD designs and 2) a proprietary readout integrated circuit (ROIC) with extremely low input noise. Development of new APD designs was begun during Phase I, supported by substantial device testing and simulation efforts. A working version of the ROIC already exists and has demonstrated performance characteristics compatible with the wavefront-sensing mission. Building upon this cornerstone, two APD detector designs \u2013 one well established and the other more sophisticated \u2013 will be manufactured during Phase II. Fabricated as 8\u00d78 FPAs, the low-noise near infrared (NIR) APDs will be characterized and integrated with high bandwidth ROICs in a prototype camera system.

The proposed program will demonstrate the feasibility of consolidating nanoparticle dispersions of high purity yttria (Y2O3) to produce transparent fine grain (< 1 \u00b5m) dual-mode material for missile domes and windows.  Reported IR transparent yttria results showed insufficient strength to withstand the stresses imposed by the application conditions.  CeraNova has developed techniques for shaping and densifying nanoparticle alumina to produce transparent polycrystalline alumina with grain size 400-700 nm, excellent transmittance in MWIR (3-5\u00b5m), and mechanical properties superior to sapphire.  These techniques, and previous experience gained from Phase I efforts on transparent yttria, will be applied to the proposed program.  The Phase II program will utilize dispersions of yttria-based nanoparticulates.  CeraNova\u00a1\u00a6s proposed approach involves shape-forming and consolidation of particle dispersions and a two-stage densification process (sintering and HIP) to achieve full density and control grain growth.  Phase I work has resulted in transmittance ~78% in the 3-5\u00b5m region for 1.4mm thick disks.

It is a simple, rapid, real-time analytical technique based on analysis of spectral emission from laser-induced sparks or micro plasmas.  The Army is interested in implementing the technique in a field portable instrument and possibly on airborne and vehicular platforms to analyze materials at distances of 100 meters.  Because of the small size and short lifetime of the resulting LIBS micro plasmas, the minimum detection limit for a potential instrument is in the range of parts per million, in many cases.  Furthermore, detection is less sensitive for any appreciable distances ~ 100 meters because the source is far away.  Based upon Envimetrics\u2019 successful Phase I project, we propose to delivery a prototype field portable LIBS system to the Army.  It will utilize microwave enhancement technology and the latest of LIBS technology to provide it with substantial improvement in LIBS detection limits.  In addition, the Phase I results imply that LIBS at distances ~ 100 \u2013 400 feet is possible in the near term.

At the same time, the thermal capacity of the jet fuel for heat removal from the equipment is limited. More and more, the demand is for electric power system that is efficient, power dense and robust. This proposal offers the solution using a high speed induction generator and controller that can be directly coupled to a high speed turbine to provide electric power in the range of 150 to 300 kW for aircraft utility, avionics, or weapon system. Directed energy weapons in particular need a power source that is in the proposed range of 150 kW to 300 kW. Efficiency issues are addressed by minimizing the fixed losses such as iron loss, windage loss, and the bearing friction loss. This results in high efficiency over a wide range of power output. Effective insulation system is designed to be robust and provide an average life of 30000 hours. Heat removal system is designed to lower insulation temperatures through conduction of heat without use of coolants in the generator cavity. This eliminates the high churning losses. Bearing damping system is incorporated to provide robust and nearly vibration free construction. Control algorithm is included for optimized performance at all operating temperatures and under all load conditions including steady state and transient conditions. During Phase II a complete motor generator set will be built to demonstrate the operation of the generator and controller at the speed of 60000 RPM. An interdisciplinary team of experts is organized to address electromagnetic, control, simulation, rotor dynamics, and thermal management issues.",

Reduced lifetime limits the space mission and requires replacement at very high expense.  Multi-layer coatings on the cover glasses function to increase transmission, reject damaging UV, and prevent the accumulation of static charges.  The causes for radiation-induced transmission loss are not understood. Our approach introduces advanced high-energy deposition and improved material technologies to the manufacture of the cover glasses, with the goal of producing coatings that have greater immunity to contamination and lower defect densities than are produced by the current coating techniques. In Phase I, we evaluated several coating materials deposited as single layers using ion assisted deposition, and we successfully demonstrated improved thin-film layer density. Analytical techniques developed for evaluating film properties and relating those properties to radiation tolerance will be enhanced. Our experience with the new technologies and with the effects of the space radiation environment on optics are focused on the.  As we expand the work in Phase II, we hope to contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for radiation darkening. Domestic and military applications will benefit from an end of life extension that would result from increasing the radiation resistance of the optical coatings deposited on the cover glasses. Our development of a domestic supplier of coated cell covers would reduce the dependence on off-shore sources.",

        "abstract": "The proposed innovation is the development of a novel dual band detector responding in both the UV and IR regions, based on a GaN/AlGaN heterostructure. The IR response is based on HEterojunction Interfacial Workfunction Internal Photoemission (HEIWIP) detectors, which was demonstrated using AlGaAs/GaAs and GaN/AlGaN structures. By also using interband transitions, response in the UV range at room temperature  was incorporated into the device during Phase I. A device with responses in the UV shorter than 350 nm and in the 5-13 micron range (at 80K) was demonstrated.  By varying the material composition the spectral ranges can be tailored for the specific application. The detector would allow simultaneous imaging of both spectral ranges using a single detector array. This would provide a large advantage over current approaches which use separate detectors to image the two regions. By varying the Al fraction in the AlGaN, the detector can be easily extended to cover the range up to 40 microns. During Phase II, work will concentrate on optimization for specific applications and development of methods for distinguishing the IR and UV responses in a single pixel. Incorporating InGaN once could even extend the coverage in to the visible region to have a detector covering UV- Vis-IR.",

Recent results by our SBIR partner at Cornell show that InN has a much narrower bandgap than previously believed: 0.7 eV, compared to earlier estimates of 2 eV.  This discovery opened the door to fabrication of photovoltaic devices responsive from the near infrared through UV ranges. Thus, unprecedented efficiencies should be possible. In addition, the inherent robustness of nitrides implies all-nitride-based solar cells have potentially greater radiation resistance and an ability to operate under temperature extremes than those currently available. In this program Structured Materials Industries (SMI) is utilizing its expertise in MOCVD technology, as well as recent success in developing and demonstrating a highly efficient nitride MOCVD system, to carry nitride-based solar cells from laboratory to production. In the ongoing Phase I effort, together with Dr. William Schaff of Cornell University, a pioneer in InN and InGaN technology, we have made outstanding progress in solving key materials issue in the system. Dr. Schaff is using his facility MBE tool and analytic capabilities to focus on material property optimization, especially the crucial issue of improving the quality of In-rich InGaN, including n- and p-type doping and junction interface understanding. SMI is focused on transitioning Cornell development into a solar cell manufacturing-ready process. Fabrication and demonstration of prototype devices and process scale-up will take place in Phase II.

        "abstract": "Cryptosporidium is a resilient waterborne protozoan pathogen that causes gastrointestinal disease and is one of five major causes for 5 million deaths each year worldwide. Recently, a Cryptosporidium outbreak sickened more than 1,700 people, mostly children and teenagers, in New York. Cryptosporidium oocysts are of particular interest in the water industry because the infectious dose is low (1 to 132 oocysts) and does not respond to common drug treatments. Self-contained microelectrochemical assays are desirable because precise detection can be performed down to a single oocyst on colored and turbid samples. In addition, electrochemical detection that depends only on loss and gain of electrons immediately adjacent to surface-bound assay components provides rapid signals even for very low analyte concentrations based on short transport distances for reporter molecules.\n\n\n\nIn Phase I of this research project, Vegrandis, LLC, successfully demonstrated its chip-based, self-contained, microelectrochemical hybrid assay (SMEHA). The assay involved an immunoassay followed by a DNA hybridization assay to confirm viability of the oocysts. Both assays, which took approximately 90 minutes to complete, were demonstrated in an 8 x 3 array of 50 \u00b5m diameter cavities. Phase I of this project proved the ability to detect live C. parvum oocysts down to 5 oocysts/10 L of pelleted surface water samples in less than 90 minutes.\n\n\n\nThis Phase II project proposes to develop disposable SMEHA cartridges for the quantification and viability assessment of waterborne pathogens to meet the escalating need for fast warning of pathogen outbreaks and possible dispersal of bioterrorism agents. Although the disposable SMEHA cartridges can be specified for nearly any pathogen of interest, this Phase II project will focus on the detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts. Both protozoans seriously threaten the nation&rsquo;s water supply because they resist ordinary water treatment processes and do not respond to common antibiotics. Because of the speed and specificity of the proposed device, investigators will be able to act quickly to suspected Cryptosporidium or Giardia contamination. Both the source and the path of contamination flow can be efficiently traced. The development of the disposable SMEHA cartridge and reagent kits will advance the state-of-the-art over existing U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Methods 1622 and 1623 by providing a previously unavailable combination of speed, sensitivity, affordability, ease-of-use, and testing for viability of waterborne pathogens.",

The project will include:  ruggidizing the SER-active, sol-gel capillaries; developing a universal sampling  system with a fiber optic probe interface; and developing comprehensive analysis  that includes rapid chemical identification.

        "abstract": "The objective of this Phase II research project is to develop and optimize the prototype environmentally friendly, isocyanate-free, solvent-free, ultraviolet (UV) curable hybrid resin system demonstrated in Phase I.  In Phase II, Light Curable Coatings will develop a system with properties suitable for commercial industrial applications, such as automobile refinishing, floor coatings, and aircraft coatings.  Properties of the proprietary hybrid resin system are significantly improved over those of conventional UV systems.  UV cure provides an immediate tack-free surface and significant property development, allowing materials to be handled for secondary operations.  The hybrid cure is designed to continue at ambient conditions following UV exposure for reduced molecular stress and an unusual combination of improved adhesion, flexibility, and hardness.  This dual cure system is user-friendly and allows for the convenient sanding of primer coatings before surface hardness increases to an extent that makes sanding operations unmanageable.  \n\n\n\nLight Curable Coatings is a technology leader for solvent-free environmentally compliant coating systems, with proprietary technology to rapidly cure heavily pigmented coatings with UV light, including low gloss camouflage color UV coating systems.  Phase II research will optimize fully formulated isocyanate-free solvent-free UV curable hybrid resin systems by incorporating pigments and chrome-free corrosion inhibitors.  Testing will be conducted according to military aerospace primer and topcoat specifications MIL-PRF-23377 and MIL-PRF-85285.  \n\n\n\nThis hybrid technology is more efficient and less costly for end-users while significantly reducing exposure of workers and communities to isocyanates, volatile organic compounds, and hazardous air pollutant materials.  Benefits of this approach include dramatically improved environmental friendliness and productivity capabilities.  Because hybrid resins do not contain isocyanates or solvents, application in confined spaces and occupied spaces should be possible without the hazards found in conventional materials.  The application of coatings during business hours (rather than weekends or overtime shifts) can be a tremendous cost-saving advantage.  The fast-curing nature of these products allows coated parts to be put back into service or produced quickly without the need for painting at a location remote from a manufacturing line.  There is no need to allow room for drying ovens and excessive ventilation.  Environmental savings apply not only in production, but also throughout and beyond the operational lifecycle of vehicles by reducing environmental risks associated with maintenance, storage, and disposal.  This research offers a significant positive societal impact in terms of a better quality of life for workers in the automotive and aircraft industries and for all citizens through safer workplaces and a cleaner environment.",

        "abstract": "Cupric chloride etchant is widely used in the etching of copper, particularly  in the manufacture of printed circuit boards. Currently, hazardous oxidants  such as chlorine are used to regenerate this etchant. In addition, the  hazardous waste generated must be hauled away for disposal. In Phase  II, Republic Anode Fabricators, Inc., will develop a device that will electrolytically  regenerate the etchant without the addition of oxidizing chemicals. Additionally,  it will recover copper metal and eliminate the formation of hazardous waste  products. Republic Anode Fabricators already has developed an electrolytic  system for ferric chloride etchant that will generate chlorine gas if used  on cupric chloride etchant. Phase I of this research project was intended  to develop ways of modifying the existing device so that chlorine gas could  be used to regenerate the etchant and would not escape into the environment. Republic  Anode Fabricators ultimately was successful in developing a sealed electrodeposition  cell that accomplished this goal. With no chlorine escape, at least 90  percent of the theoretical amount of copper and 99.8 percent pure copper were  recovered. In addition, the etchant was regenerated based on oxidation  reduction potential (ORP) values. \n\n\n\nRepublic Anode Fabricators has partnered with a firm that will help evaluate  the experimental cell developed during Phase I. To accomplish this, the  existing cell will be modified to increase its capacity for copper collection  and throughput. The capabilities of the cell then will be modified on  the customer&rsquo;s production etching line. Following this study, Republic  Anode Fabricators will design and build a small prototype working unit. The  partnering firm will help evaluate the small prototype unit and will purchase  the unit if all goes as planned. VTO will be performed on this working  model. Tests will include copper purity, copper collection efficiency,  ORP rate of increase, thermal effects, reliability and robustness of the unit,  and economic considerations. Following this investigation, a larger prototype  unit will be designed, built, customer-tested, evaluated, and sold. An  independent marketing survey indicates a large potential market and an acceptable  selling price within the anticipated range of system costs. The cost  of electricity needed for the system is well below the current normal cost  of the chemicals for etching copper. In addition, the recovered copper  can be sold for more than the cost of etching. The elimination of hazardous  waste production and hauling also is a major benefit for potential customers  and recognized as such by the customers contacted in the independent survey.",

The primary objectives are to develop two products:  (1) a virus &ldquo;capture-and-release&rdquo; bead for use in human enteric  virus and coliphage monitoring, and (2) a &ldquo;capture-only&rdquo; bead for  point-of-use treatment applications. The research will focus on assessing  the compatibility of eluates generated using the &ldquo;capture and release&rdquo; bead  with downstream enumerative assays (both culture-based and molecular-based  assays will be evaluated using waters seeded with human enteric viruses). In  addition, the research will focus on validation of the &ldquo;capture-only&rdquo; bead  for point-of-use water treatment and optimization of methods for commercial-scale  bead production (more than 1 kg of functionalized beads per batch).  Two  silica formulations will be produced and validated for virus concentration  and point-of-use treatment applications. The functionalized silica beads  that will be synthesized during Phase II research will have several commercial  applications as low-cost human enteric virus and viral indicator (coliphage)  concentration/detection products and for incorporation into personal water  purification devices.",

Today\u2019s building designers often struggle to design sustainable buildings, and this project is designed to help simplify their task.  The enhanced service developed by this research project will be called the Sustainable Design Suite.  The Green Building Studio Web service currently integrates today\u2019s leading 3D-CAD applications, including Autodesk Architectural Desktop, Autodesk Revit Building, Autodesk Building Systems, and Graphisoft ArchiCAD.  Additionally, it provides immediate whole-building analysis using DOE-2.2.\n\n\n\n\tPhase I work determined that the analysis features were feasible to enhance the service, including high-resolution local weather generation to enable accurate natural ventilation studies, rain harvesting analysis, photovoltaic analysis, and building water use analyses for the building site.  The generated local weather data enhance building energy analysis by providing more appropriate weather files.  Green Building Studio, Inc., also determined that it should enhance its current product relevancy engine to include green product-specific traits.  Interface for the user is key to a usable product.  Thus, Green Building Studio, Inc., has included various approaches for analyzing wind as it pertains to the building.  A design advisor was developed to answer users\u2019 questions on improving design for resource use.\n\n\n\n\tAccording to market research and a Web survey conducted on this subject, building designers would pay for the use of the features proposed for the Sustainable Design Suite Web Site.  Green Building Studio, Inc., plans to leverage its significant market connections to accelerate these sustainable building analyses throughout the United States.",

Mechanisms must ensure that the right information gets to the right person at the right time.  In this Phase II SBIR proposal for WorkRITE, we build on Phase I and extend a detailed case study conducted in a DTC to develop software to support dynamic workflow in the DTC.

The feasibility studies were carried out using CFDRC\u2019s multiphysics high fidelity engineering analysis tool. Enhancements and improvements were made to the analysis code to model in-flow heterogeneous catalysis of missile fuel JP10. During Phase II, the enhanced models will be used for studying the effect of copper on thermal stability of jet fuel and to design a filter to reduce the amount of copper contamination in jet fuels to acceptable levels. To achieve this, computational and experimental studies will be performed to identify and test new filter and support materials that do not interfere with fuel and its additives. Several filter configurations will be identified and evaluated, and finally a prototype filter will be designed for pilot-scale demonstration. Prototype testing and demonstration will be performed at CFDRC and NAVAIR.

The SpeedStar innovations allow a star tracker instrument to operate at update rates greater than 100 Hz,  providing a tactical spacecraft with inertial rates and attitude at low cost without sacrificing the accuracy of conventional star tracker/gyro systems.

        "abstract": "Current armor solutions for wheeled vehicles, are heavy, can be costly, and are limited in their ability to survive from Improvised Explosive Device (IED) threats.  They are very much in evidence and can be seen daily on the news from Iraq.  What is needed is an armor solution that meets 7.62 AP and Ball ammunition threats and will have a high likelihood of surviving roadside IED explosions.  Armor solutions using Rolled Homogeneous Armor (RHA) are heavy.  They severely limit the capability of the vehicle, and worse, when used with a thinner gage they may not be capable of protecting from 7.62AP and IED threats.  Composite armor solutions have historically been costly, susceptible to fire damage, and can be difficult to attach to existing vehicles.   Foam Matrix is proposing an innovative armor solution that utilizes commercial off the shelf materials combined with a low cost net molding process.  This process was developed for commercial applications, and has demonstrated successes in testing during phase 1. In phase 2 we will build a door for a military ambulance that demonstrates the weight, cost, and ballistic protection capabilities.",

        "abstract": "The problem of malicious code inserted by a hostile inside attacker is of increasing concern to the government.  The most efficient time to detect such code is during development.  This is currently very difficult as malicious code can often be disguised as an innocent error, and because much code will only be available as object code.  Sound static analysis tools that are capable of analyzing machine code directly offer the best hope of detecting these problems.  A survey of over fifty static analysis tools in Phase I found that none were capable of addressing this issue.  In Phase II we propose to develop such a tool.  It will leverage both high-level source information and the actual machine code to create a precise program representation that has many applications in addition to malicious code detection, including machine-code analysis and executable editing.  It will offer two modes: a lightweight screening mode requiring few resources but which will fail to detect some problems, and a much sounder mode capable of a much more stringent analysis.  The tool will directly benefit software protection as its more precise intermediate representation will enable better and stronger anti-reverse-engineering transformations.",

As a result, concern over binary protection has become a matter of national security. This has resulted in a new generation of powerful techniques to secure executable code. Currently, the growth in these defensive technologies has weakened the very tools we rely on to evaluate protection. With first generation reverse engineering tools ineffective, how does one insure that new vulnerabilities have not been introduced alongside the new protections? What do potential second generation attack tools look like? With new binary defenses deployed, our adversaries will eventually develop offensive tools to mitigate the protection. By developing these tools first, we extend the survivability of protected binary beyond what is currently thought to be adequate. This document proposes an approach to building one such second generation technology. This document describes the technology required to build a robust and extendable framework able to support binary protection evaluation. The primary nodes in this framework will be represented by specific second generation attack tools and technologies.

The proposed effort builds on our Phase I work in which we explored the integration of task network and cognitive modeling tools at both the conceptual and methodological level.  The result of that work is the notion of task decomposition as a unifying framework; in the same way that overt behavior might be decomposed into sequences of (perhaps interleaved) tasks, we realized that cognitive behavior can also be modeled in these terms.  We deepened our understanding of such a modeling approach with the careful consideration of possible use cases.  This led to a list of needs and requirements for the integrated tool.  During Phase II we will implement the software that satisfies these needs and requirements.  Our implementation effort will not only effect the needed integration, but it will also allow us to re-implement a fair portion of ACT-R legacy code.  The result of this effort will be a functional modeling and simulation tool that can be applied directly to the problems facing the Army during its transformation.",

        "abstract": "Software critical to national security and essential to a corporation\u2019s survival can easily be exploited through reverse engineering and unauthorized access. Without innovative protection initiatives, these vulnerabilities can be leveraged by an attacker to distribute a program without proper authority, tamper with its intended functionality, expose proprietary algorithms, and launch viruses/worms against identical applications on distributed hosts. When the attacker is a malicious insider, the challenge grows more complex because they may have decryption keys and are likely knowledgeable of auditing and detection capabilities. Therefore, to be successful, software protection mechanisms must be capable of defending against all methods of attack, including insider threats. During Phase I, Pikewerks drew upon the importance of diversity in application binaries to develop a prototype, ELECTRONIC ARMOR, that is capable of protecting software from various types of attacks. In Phase II, the prototype will be expanded and matured to include additional layers of polymorphic/metamorphic transformations, deception, and anti-tamper mechanisms that can be embedded within a binary. The product of Phase II will be a software security and digital rights management technology that can be successfully incorporated into both Government and commercial applications with minimal  performance impact.",

        "abstract": "TKC International LLC will produce a comprehensive, fully integrated weapon-target centric (W-T-C) model for use by the Submarine Force. The W-T-C model will enable the Submarine Force to make key strategic investment and acquisition decisions in terms of total force structure, build rates, and key systems and technologies that will cover multiple warfare domains and future threats.  TKC will build on its phase one prototype model. In phase two TKC will execute a detailed refinement of the basic model. Future target sets will be refined together with the various weapon systems, set against validated scenarios, set in the context of Submarine Force multi-mission operations across all the warfare domains. TKC will link its industrial base research and data and geospatial factors with its Submarine technologies and capabilities work. On the technical side TKC\u2019s expertise in C4ISRT will be harnessed to predicate the cost effective elements of various ISR systems and technologies within the total W-T-C model. In parallel to the primary work TKC will work to create first a tabletop and then a full gaming program to exercise with key DOD personnel the initial output from the W-T-C model.   BENEFITS: TKC\u2019s innovative technical approach can lead to a major review and restructuring of how the DOD executes its major platform acquisition programs. The impact will be significant, and can lead to extensive work in all major acquisition, force structure and R & D domains. The approach is a Joint approach and further work will look at the total force structure, of which the Submarine Force is the key National and Joint Component. The TKC unique approach can be used throughout the U.S. defense commercial sectors to help evaluate programs, R & D investment, and individual technology initiatives. There are technological, investment, and personnel implications that are crucial for US defense companies to consider as they work with DOD to maintain US military superiority.",

LIDAR data provides an excellent source for spatially accurate digital terrain and 3-D feature information; however, current visual database production techniques require hundreds of man-hours to extract and attribute features.  Automated processes are necessary to achieve the Navy\u2019s goal of good M&S data that is efficiently processed and correctly formatted.  Bottlenecks in producing good data are a result of manual processes used in (1) registering old features and imagery to newly acquired imagery and LIDAR, (2) extracting and editing complex 3-D geometries, and (3) updating and attributing features.  The proposed Phase II workplan promises to significantly alleviate these bottlenecks by developing a system that exploits the information content of LIDAR and multiband imagery using machine learning-based feature extraction technology.  The envisioned system will have the capability of automating the extraction of M&S features from LIDAR, registering features to images, allowing dynamic interaction with analysts, interrogating analysts when it needs additional information, and embedding the ability to create a continuously updated repository of feature extraction models.",

        "abstract": "Tanner Research proposes to develop and demonstrate the sensor component of a system to provide area defense for a convoy of light vehicles from mortars, and optionally, the sensor for another system to provide point defense for a light vehicle from incoming RPGs. Both sensor systems will have 360\u00b0 coverage, and will provide real-time target information to cue a response that engages and defeats the munition in-flight. Both sensors use low-cost COTS imagers, to allow for wide deployment to all light vehicles in harm\u2019s way. In this proposal we intentionally keep the technology R&D to a minimum, to ensure a rapid response to the pressing need in Iraq. We will validate our sensors\u2019 mission performance with live fire testing. Next to IEDs and small arms fire, mortars and RPGs are the most lethal threats faced by US forces in Iraq (http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/iraq_casualties-months.htm). Mortars are used against bases and convoys (in a one-shot strategy that makes knowing the launch point useless), and RPGs are fired at light vehicles (from short range that compresses the scenario timeline and challenges any active defense system). Radars can detect and track these munitions, but their cost and size limit their application to fixed installations and large, high-value vehicles. Their operation and maintenance requirements also limit their usefulness in Iraq. The cost and power demands of high-performance cooled IR sensors prevent their application to light vehicle and convoy defense. Uncooled LWIR sensors are low-cost and reliable, but until recently their sensitivity was insufficient for vehicle-based defense systems. Tanner Research will use COTS imagers, performance-enhanced by our sensor processing, to detect and track mortars and incoming RPGs, in low-cost and compact configurations that are practical for wide deployment to light vehicles. For area defense against mortars, we will integrate a COTS visible imager and hemispherical lens that detects the mortar launch flash, a COTS gimbaled uncooled LWIR imager that detects and tracks the mortar hotbody, and an FPGA-based processor that uses the flash detection to cue and control the pointing for the LWIR imager, and computes the mortar trajectory for hand-off to an active defense system that launches a counter-munition to engage and defeat the mortar. For point defense against incoming RPGs, we will integrate a COTS wide-FOV uncooled LWIR imager that detects the plume, with an FPGA-based processor that tracks the incoming RPG and computes time-to-hit for hand-off to an integrated CICM. We have been discussing with Picatinny the use of non-slewing airbag dispensers to intercept the RPG at ~1 m, providing adequate stand-off from the worst of its shaped-charge jet. The light vehicle would have several independent sensor/airbag units for continuous 360\u00b0 protection.",

The pre-processor allows constructing an object-oriented hierarchical \"preliminary\" model of the vehicle, tank, and terrain. The pre-processor includes a model tree editor along with interactive display of the model. It also includes an automatic mesh generator for generating the finite element (FE) model from the preliminary model. The FE model consists of hexahedral, beam, and truss solid elements, rigid bodies, joints, hexahedral incompressible fluid elements, and quadrilateral fluid-solid interface elements. The fluid mesh is modeled using a very light and compliant solid mesh which allows the fluid mesh to move/deform along with the tank using the ALE formulation. The fluid's free-surface is modeled using a mass conserving volume-of-fluid based algorithm. A parallel explicit-time integration solver is used to generate the coupled dynamic response of the vehicle, tank, and fluid. The post-processor allows near-photorealistic visualization of animations of: 1) liquid free-surface, iso-surfaces, vehicle, terrain and surroundings; 2) colored/contoured surfaces, 3) surface/volume arrows, 4) stream/streak/path-lines. Users can control the visualization using the tree editor or a clickable hierarchical list of natural-language commands.",

There are currently no therapeutic agents available to treat filovirus infections and the development of such drugs is important for bio-defense.  Apath has developed a novel, cell-based, infection-independent screening method that is based on replication of an Ebola virus minigenome. This proposal focuses on a strategy of combining existing drugs to discover combinations that have novel anti-filovirus activity.  The Apath screening method is very amenable to identifying drug combinations that inhibit EBOV replication. This method streamlines the process of defining chemical relationships to enable the discovery of combinations of drugs that exhibit novel synergistic activity. The use of a library of approved drugs together with inhibitors discovered by Apath should facilitate the development of a therapeutic drug combination. We will characterize the most potent combinations for antiviral activity and perform preliminary medicinal chemistry and pharmacokinetic studies.",

The proposed program involves 1) designing composite based ladders suitable meeting Navy specifications for shipboard use 2) producing environmentally sound flame retardant, fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites for use as inclined ladders 3) making FRP composite prototype ladders for shipboard evaluation.  The flame retardant FRP composites of this proposal are based on a novel method of imparting fire resistance.   The proposed FRP resins have been shown to be self-extinguishing in preliminary tests.  The proposed flame retardant offers advantages of being environmentally sound with minimal off-gassing of toxic compounds during combustion.  In addition, the proposed flame retardant resins are expected to have comparable mechanical properties with potential improvements in toughness compared with commercial non-flame retardant resins.  Luna has also identified a thermoset resin with thermal stability to meet high temperature load requirements.  This development will contribute to the Navy\u2019s goal of producing improving shipboard safety while reducing weight and costs.",

        "abstract": "Physical Sciences Inc. proposes to continue the development of the High Energy Imaging Particle Spectrometer (HIPS) to act both as a diagnostic for wave-particle interaction flight experiments and also as an operational space-weather threat sensor.  HIPS directly supports the SWx and WPIx experiments on the AFRL DSX spacecraft.  During periods of high geomagnetic activity, new radiation belts can form as a result of the energy deposited in the earth\u2019s magnetosphere.  A high altitude nuclear detonation (HAND) can also produce a similar effect.  Electrons become trapped in the Earth's inner magnetosphere, form new radiation belts, and in turn damage space systems.  Technologies that reduce the natural lifetimes of these anomalous belts can dramatically improve space system survivability and ensure the continuation of space-based services.  In order to determine the effectiveness of wave-particle interaction systems, one must measure the energy and pitch angle distributions of ambient electrons, particularly at energies >0.5 MeV.  HIPS would characterize the energy and angular distributions of the high energy electrons and protons (0.5-30 MeV electrons and 20-400 MeV protons).  While a new instrument design, the HIPS sensor is closely based both on PSI\u2019s LPD sensor currently flying on the SERVIS-1 satellite, and the LIPS sensor developed for AFRL/VSB.",

        "abstract": "Radioisotopes, nuclear isomers and deployable micro-reactors are of special interest as energy storage devices because they have the potential to store energy with higher energy density and longer life than chemical and most other devices. If isomer energy can be released by excitation (triggering) or if the energy of deployabls reactors is cotrolled externally, they can provide on-demand high power. Both nuclear isomers and radioactive isotopes release their energy at a specific rate by emission of gamma rays and/or charged particles. To use these materials as high energy density devices for remote applications depends on having a means to capture and convert the energy to useful form such as direct voltaic, thermal voltaic, chemical or mechanical. Whether or not isomers can be triggered, it is useful to examine how isotope and isomer decay energy can be captured and converted to one of these forms. This research examines means to capture and convert decay energy from triggered isomers and ordinary radioisotope sources. In addition, this research examines the salient paramteters of a deployable micro-reactor.",

The proposed technology will help analysts determine the post-deployment software operations and maintenance burden and the key factors that affect them.

During the past decades, jet aircraft engine noise levels have risen substantially.  One result is that significant numbers of career Navy veterans have to apply for total hearing loss disability after retirement.  The exponential increases in yearly VA hearing loss claim amounts indicates that hearing protector attenuation values have not kept up with increases in jet engine sound levels.  This Phase II program will begin with a refinement of Phase I designs for improved head protection, with a customer-driven process that will offer advancements in numerous design metrics for the headgear such as: new anthropomorphic data for fit, user studies that define shape and comfort, easy integration of NVD and CBR equipment, improved maintainability and durability, product cost, and strict adherence to total daily exposure noise limits in noise fields up to 150 dB(A) SPL.

It also has the ability to draw from a knowledge base of previously assessed cases to find spacecraft configurations that are most suitable for a mission based on Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs). To provide the most capable satellite candidates, the knowledge base must be populated with data derived from high-fidelity design tools or \u201cwizards\u201d. We propose to define these wizards for each spacecraft engineering discipline in Phase II efforts and extend the design space to accommodate some of that capability. We will accomplish this by identifying domain experts to assist in defining the functionality that best supports a long-range Testbed vision.",

        "abstract": "There are several variations of deployable booms, but for systems that need precise stability, articulated trusses are unequalled because they can use low coefficient of thermal expansion materials and provide the requisite stiffness.  Articulated booms all require a motor and deployment mechanism to form the boom once on orbit.  The current state of the art deployment mechanisms, used in articulated booms are large, massive and complex, requiring power from the host spacecraft to deploy.  For small satellites the volume mass and power requirements often preclude the use of these booms and limit the mission capability. Starsys Research has been developing articulated boom systems for several years.  Recent improvements in boom technology and developments in composite material hinges has made it feasible to develop a self-deploying articulated boom that does not require the motorized deployment mechanism of current booms.  This new type of self-deploying articulated boom will enhance the capabilities of small satellites and reduce costs when it is applied.

Polarization and wavelength multiplexing techniques are used to achieve simultaneous transmit and receive operations with a high degree of separation (less than 60 dB of crosstalk) between the high power transmitters (25 to 30 dBm) and the low-power (< -20 dBm) counter-propagating beam in the receiver.

The low voltage (Vpi < 5 Volts) transmit and receive phase shifters will operate over a large range (phase shift > 4 pi). Through the use of a wide variety of in-house technologies, EOSPACE has already demonstrated a majority of these operations during Phase I of this SBIR program.

The Army recognizes that the unique properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) offer a potential solution.  Unfortunately, existing CNT production methods, laser, arc discharge, and high pressure CO, are far too expensive to consider for the mass production necessary for obscurants applications.   During Phase I research NanoDynamics demonstrated combustion based processes to produce multiwall CNTs as well as significantly higher extinction coefficients as compared to materials such as graphite.  The proposed combustion processes can be readily scaled to bulk production and some of these processes can be adapted to run in a continuous manner, directly forming well dispersed CNTs in the field.

Increased cylinder pressure and reduced cooling requirements, heat energy recovery in the exhaust gas by turbocharging and turbo-compounding will likely be incorporated.  Thus significantly improved engine fuel efficiency, performance, and reliability will be achieved.  As temperature and pressure loads for base materials in diesel engines are pushed to the maximum limit, further improvements in engine life time can only be realized by changing existing component substrate or thermally protecting existing hardware by applying protective coatings.  Use of Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBCs), show numerous advantages such as higher allowable combustion temperature and reduced heat losses to the cooling fluids (water and oil). This Phase II effort will extend the research and development base generated from the Phase I work to both prove and expand on new endurable composite TBC technology.  Given the opportunity, we have demonstrated in a military FCS type multi-cylinder engine the feasibility of newly developed composite TBCs for power piston, cylinder liner, cylinder head firedeck, and exhaust hardware.

        "abstract": "Reliable diagnostic tools to support system health monitoring are critical both for liquid rocket experimental ground test facilities and flight systems.  Here, flow induced instabilities can generate flow anomalies such as large scale pressure fluctuations that may couple with other system components and generate deleterious structural vibrations or lead to system malfunction as was evidenced in the RS-68 engine on the Delta IV system.  Identifying the source of these flow  instabilities is extremely difficult since they may arise from a variety of coupled phenomena such as hydrodynamics, valve timing and scheduling, and cavitation related events in cryogenic propellant and oxidizer feedlines.  \n\nThe proposed Phase II program addresses this deficiency; the product of this effort will be a reliable predictive tool that can characterize flow instabilities, identify dominant frequency modes, and  elucidate structural response in valve and feed systems.  Phase I activities demonstrated the simulation capability for instabilities in varied flow devices (e.g.  venturis, orifices)  used in the E-1 test facilities at NASA SSC. The Phase II work will extend this to include fluid-structure interaction for analysis of system vibration, structural damage and gauge valve response.  Extensive validation will result in a predictive diagnostic tool for liquid rocket propulsion systems.",

We propose a modular architecture that involves solving the following problems: detection of stationary and moving humans in different cluttered backgrounds, state of the human (whether armed or not) and recognition of the particular weapon being carried and the intent of the human(s) carrying the weapon. In addition, the proposed system will determine if the detected humans are carrying harmless objects. The approach taken for detection of stationary and moving humans and the weapons they may carry uses a combination of shape and motion driven matching techniques. Patterns of motion exhibited by detected humans prior to conducting a hostile act are analyzed using deformable shape analysis methods. Finally, hidden Markov models are trained to recognize one of many hostile acts that the detected target may be planning to undertake. Our design methodology allows for operator intervention and on-line training. The system will be evaluated using data collected by SET Associates and also supplied by the sponsor. Issues such as real-time implementation and robustness to variations in modeled intents will be addressed.",

Second, it proposes a system that is designed to minimize human interaction and manual data entry.  Third (and possibly the most important) is that it proposes both the implementation of multiple algorithms to perform the data processing, as well as an extensible, open software architecture which allows algorithms to be incorporated into the system in the future.  This approach allows for the development of a dynamic system which can be extended not only by DDS, but by third parties as well.

        "abstract": "The proposal explains Phase I results, using UWB for sensing muscle water content and lays down the plan for transition in Phase II. Basic operation of our sensor is to inject a train of ultra low power UWB pulses into the body, and coherently measure the reflections with picoseconds time resolution. Our sensor is RF based, and therefore interacts with the electrical properties of the body part under test. For human tissue, which is non-magnetic, there are two quantities that fully describe the average electrical-magnetic properties, the dielectric constant and conductivity. These two quantities are related to water content, and concentration of charged particles (i.e. electrolytes), respectively. Therefore by determining the dielectric constant and conductivity, we calculate the quantities of interest (water content, and electrolyte concentration). The sensing mechanism is based on the large difference between the dielectric constant of water, and that of the host material. Because the sensor is radar based, it will be non-contact. Because of the large bandwidth of our signals, the sensor will be capable of generating two- and possibly three-dimensional images of skeletal muscle water. Final sensor will have compact monosatic radar, antenna array and integrated data acquisition unit with remote communication features.",

High frequency ray methods based on the Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) are often used for cases where the structure is very large in terms of wavelengths and the desired output can be determined from the interaction of rays bounced off the structure.  In some instances, neither approach is sufficient by itself but the two are combined to analyze a large, complex structure.   In the case of a Rotman Lens, a staged approach may be used with a high frequency method applied to the basic lens design and optimization and a full-wave FDTD solution used for more accurate results.

Our system will provide three functions: 1. \u00a0Stabilization of the hull to prevent excessive deck motion or capsizing in high sea state, 2. \u00a0Control of course and speed to navigate to designated target areas, \u00a03. \u00a0Avoidance of Collisions with flotsam or other vessels. \u00a0Migration of the algorithms to a second Navy USSV is one of the options for this Phase II effort and implementation of the obstacle avoidance algorithm is the second option in this Phase II.  The base effort of this Phase II will be developed on the same hardware and software platform that is being used on the Navy's low speed USSV  (a planing hull with about 18,000 lb displacement, and a top speed of about 27 kt) which is the USSV to be considered for the first option of this Phase II.",

The existing implementation of the Open Group\u2019s \u201cAssertion Definition Language\u201d (ADL) already has many of the attributes necessary to satisfy a systematic functional verification methodology.

The goal of the Phase II effort is two fold: to extend the current ADL product to support functional and nonfunctional behavioral verification of components that compose those design patterns, and to investigate test strategies applicable to OA design patterns. The resulting product will be a specification-based assertion testing methodology and test environment framework that provides the ability to specify and verify critical component behavioral characteristics in a systematic way.

In Phase I, SiC MOSFETs were tested and characterized, confirming lower losses.  It is projected that losses will be no more than one-fifth of that with silicon devices and, when combined with an operating temperature of 300 degrees C, the power semiconductor block of an inverter will be dramatically smaller and can be cooled with natural air convection (no fan).  A power block for a 5 kW inverter has been estimated to be approximately a 1-inch cube.  It will be constructed of entirely new materials that can withstand 300 degrees C with frequent thermal cycling.  The output filter elements will be extraordinarily small also due to PWM switching at 100 kHz.

However, the U.S. Army currently lacks a method to control robotic vehicles that does not require soldiers to give up their weapons in exchange for a control device.  A new and effective method of electromyographic (EMG) control has been developed by NASA over the last five years and made possible in a practical setting by significant sensor advances made by QUASAR.  Shown to be feasible in Phase I, the technique uses a combination of forearm and sub-vocal commands.  The forearm EMG system, which consists of a miniature wireless sensor harness on each of the operator\u2019s forearms, gives operator precise analog control of vehicle direction or camera aim. Subvocal speech, which is measured by sensors on the throat and processed by a small body-worn unit, allows for an extensive and intuitive command set.  Combining these two modalities, QUASAR will build and demonstrate a wearable prototype system that is minimally intrusive to the operator and is robust in a real-world battlefield environment. Drs. Charles Jorgensen and Kevin Wheeler of NASA will serve as consultants to the project.",

        "abstract": "Current Naval microwave power amplifiers operate at power densities around 200-500 W/cm2. Amplifiers under development may operate at 2-4 times this power density. Despite the development of active cooling technologies, the principal technology for removing heat from a chip remains thermal conduction. In most power devices, solders, such as AuSn, are used for die attach bonding. Solder is not adaptable to high volume, low cost processing. There is a critical need from T/R module developers for improvement in the performance of thermally conductive polymeric materials used in electronic packaging. There are few candidate polymeric materials for replacing eutectic solder bonding in electronic devices used in high-temperature environments. Most polymeric electrically conductive adhesives are not capable of long term reliability in such environments. We have demonstrated a low-temperature sintering adhesive that, with modification, will address these performance issues. Based on a novel polymeric resin formulation, they are solvent-free and easily processed. A unique combination of alloy powders in this resin formulation allows the preparation of composite adhesives capable of forming metallurgical connections to suitable metal surfaces.  These may be optimized to have electrical and thermal conductivity properties similar to solder materials but with the processing advantages of polymeric adhesives. BENEFITS: There is an immediate need for adhesive materials with improved high temperature performance in a myriad of high volume consumer and defense products, particularly those materials that have improved thermal and/or electrical properties. The market today exceeds over $100 Million annually. This demand is increasing with the development of advanced high power electronics systems used for the processing and control of high-energy electrical systems.",

In the Phase II project, Luna will continue to optimize these cleaners and demonstrate their compatibility with existing application methods and coating systems.  Luna will also quantify corrosion performance improvements that can be achieved using this cleaner with non-chromate coating systems.  Electrochemical testing, such as potentiodynamic scans, linear polarization plots and EIS will be used to rapidly screen and optimize the cleaner formulation.  The cleaner, pretreatment, primer and full coating systems will be evaluated according to Military specifications (MIL-PRF-87937, MIL-DTL-81706, and MIL-PRF-23377) and the Advanced Performance Coating Specification (SAE AMS G8-03AA).  In all cases, samples will be benchmarked against Military qualified products.",

The ODV with IMP can navigate tight spots around obstacles indoors and outdoors saving energy and time.    The smart ODV prototype will be built in Phase II, to demonstrate the usefulness of the omni-direction maneuverability of the vehicle.  The objective is to investigate the practical feasibility of the IMP concepts proposed in Phase I, and conduct a live demonstration of its applications. Demonstration scenarios will include autonomous ODV maneuvers from indoor to outdoor locations and vice versa, maneuvers around tight spots inside a building, and around a confined area in outdoor terrain.  The demonstration will show the potential applications for indoor-outdoor surveillance, deliveries, lift trucks, lawn mowing and facility maintenance.    Self-Guided Systems, LLC has already expressed interest in employing an ODV with IMP as an autonomous lawn service vehicle or security robot.

The LPE utilizes an innovative cutterhead to efficiently excavate a wide range of different planetary surface materials. Current mechanical excavators mount a fixed array of rock cutting tools on a cutterhead that operates efficiently only in a narrow range of material conditions. The LPE would be able to accommodate the different materials that are encountered on planetary surfaces. The LPE will sense geologic changes and respond with changes to achieve the lowest cutting energy possible. The result is a flexible machine with reduced power requirements. A large LPE would be used to mine ice deposits and regolith for processing, and to excavate openings for habitats and shielding. A small LPE would be used for exploration. One LPE would be simpler and easier to maintain than a stable of excavators, each for a specific geology or application. Phase II will further define the properties of the ice-regolith mixtures and then design, develop, test, and deliver a functional prototype LPE unit to NASA.",

        "abstract": "The size and accuracy specifications of telescope mirrors are ever more demanding.  This is particularly true for secondary mirrors, as they are convex and thus require large-aperture optics to test them.  Recent NASA programs, such as the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), include monolithic secondary mirrors of significant size (larger than half a meter).  Secondary mirrors of such large sizes are difficult and expensive to test due to the large-aperture converging and nulling optics required.  Furthermore, calibration of these optics to the level required for next-generation programs is extremely challenging.  Subaperture stitching has the potential to provide accurate high-resolution maps of large-aperture aspheric optics without the use of even larger aperture optics or dedicated nulls.  QED's Subaperture Stitching Interferometer (SSIREG) has achieved nanometer-level accuracies on spherical optics with its novel compensation techniques.  Non-null capability is enhanced since the individual subapertures have significantly less aspheric departure.  However, the system is currently only capable of testing up to 280 mm optics of mild asphericity.  Phase I work demonstrated that the technology is scalable to larger aperture sizes.  This proposal focuses on innovations for leveraging the considerable benefits of stitching (high resolution, automatic calibration, and flexible aspheric testing) to aspheric optics.  Activities will include uncertainty analyses of aspheric tests, subscale measurement demonstrations, and development of concepts for testing larger amounts of aspheric departure.",

One approach to this application, RFDACS, has shown reliability problems linked to use of COTS components.  In addition, there is a desire to push to higher frequencies for IO uses such as EW and ESM. High-frequency RF switch technology would enable such applications, while leveraging existing (legacy) antennas. Though immature, MEMS-based switches are developing rapidly. MEMS offer dramatic advantages in size, cost, and high-frequency performance, though power handling has been limited to the 1W range. This issue was addressed in Phase I, with the demonstration of an experimental 50W switch. This represents the highest power level of any MEMS switch reported in the literature. Initial results demonstrated a switch cycle life of 3x107, exceeding the target by 30X. In Phase II, MicroAssembly proposes to port the 50W design to a batch manufacturing process and demonstrate a 4x4 switch matrix, suitable for shipboard use.

FCS is a networked \u201csystem of systems\u201d that serves as a core building block within all Unit of Action (UA) echelons and is comprised of a family of advanced, networked air and ground-based maneuver, support, and sustainment systems. Currently, new technologies must be developed in isolated conditions, which render comparison with existing approaches and other new approaches difficult if not infeasible. The problem is that there is no environment in which logistics system developers can experiment with the unique approaches required by FCS. To support this need, Sentar proposes the Logistics Agent-based Algorithm Test-bed (LAAT). LAAT provides a flexible, integrated test environment for performing end-to-end logistic workflow analysis, validating algorithms and developing test scenarios of interest to logistics analysts. Sentar, teamed with Sparta, developed the LAAT concept and design under a Phase I SBIR project. LAAT is comprised of three primary tools - Sentar\u2019s KALAE/KnoWeb\u00ae, Sparta\u2019s LogMAIT\u00ae, and FCS SOSCOE. It is important to note that these tools exist today and are ready to be integrated into LAAT.

These types of microwave generators are in-tended to radiate a series of ultra-wideband (UWB) pulses of gigawatt peak power. Another unique feature of the proposed multiple-pulse systems is that they are not based on standard electron beam techniques for radiating high-power microwaves. Rather, they are based on the direct high-efficiency (90%) transformation of high-voltage and high-current pulses into high-power UWB microwave radiation without electron beam-based microwave devices. Such an approach makes the systems smaller, cheaper and more reliable in operation under harsh conditions on the battlefield.",

Existing HSI processing approaches that rely solely on spatial and spectral information fall short of demanding DoD needs because of the complexity of the ground clutter environment and practical sensor limitations on simultaneous acquisition of high-resolution spatial, spectral and temporal scene information at long range.  The Phase I SBIR showed the feasibility of obtaining large improvements in change target sensitivity, relative to conventional single-look approaches, using multi-look HSI observations at spatial and spectral resolutions commensurate with planned space-based sensors.  In Phase II we propose to further develop the core algorithms for registering, predicting and comparing spectral image observables in a robust change analysis framework, implement the algorithms in a prototype software tool, and apply them to current and near-term sources of satellite HSI.

In particular, advanced imaging spectrometers for x-ray astronomy will require significant improvements in the high density interconnects between the detector arrays and the first stage electronics. These detectors operate at 50 to 100 mK, while the first stage is held between 1.3 and 1.5 K.  Interconnects are needed that provide the required signal paths while imparting a total thermal heat load on the detector stage of less than 0.5 microwatts.

The logic that drives the agents must allow user commands to be efficiently executed to minimize data flow and minimize execution time. We propose to address these needs by designing and implementing agents that adapt to network conditions and ensure that task agents move and operate optimally. Specifically we envision on each node a Status Agent to maintain and propagate information on the network status, a Command Agent to configure mobile agents with a statically optimized Agent Itinerary and the necessary Agent Control Logic to dynamically optimize its itinerary, and a Schedule Agent to schedule services in our service-based architecture. We also propose to design and implement a Network Simulator Tool to enable testing, performance analysis, and eventual deployment in a hardware test environment.",

        "abstract": "Infected open fractures are a common battlefield injury, particularly in the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The current standard of care for infected open fractures involves irrigation, debridement, initial stabilization, and antibiotic therapy.  In order to provide local antibiotic therapy and fill dead space, antibiotics are often combined with bone cement, rolled into beads, and placed in the bone defect. While this approach has been effective in preventing infection, it does not address the growing incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria or the highly resistant bacterium, acinetobacter baumanii, that has emerged as the most frequently detected bacterium in warfighter wounds.  In addition, since bone cement does not resorb, numerous subsequent surgical procedures are required to remove the beads and harvest and graft bone, increasing morbidity and cost.  Luna is developing a novel bone graft substitute material that will simultaneously deliver antimicrobial drugs directly into the infected site and act as a resorbable scaffold for new bone growth.  The base material has a biomimetic architecture that is designed to resorb at a patient-specific rate via the natural synergistic remodeling activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts.  Luna has assembled a highly qualified, multidisciplinary technical and clinical team required for a successful program.",

        "abstract": "A significant number of battlefield deaths could be prevented through the development of devices and techniques suitable for application in the field as temporary measures for immediate treatment.  It is known that a significant portion of battlefield fatalities occur because soldiers suffer uncontrolled hemorrhage from wounds inflicted on their proximal extremities, where it is often not possible to apply standard first aid methods such as the tourniquet.  Payload Systems Inc. is approaching the solution of this problem by developing a device that could be inserted into a wound of the nature described above to slow or stop bleeding sufficiently long that the injured person can be transferred to a facility able to treat the injury appropriately.  This device would swell inside the wound, by absorbing the water component of the blood, and adapt to the cavity while applying a controlled amount of pressure on its walls.  In addition to the mechanical application of pressure, blood clotting would be enhanced by the dehydration of blood cells and concentration of clotting factors to stop or slow bleeding in injury sites that are difficult to treat with traditional methods.",

The Navy\u2019s move toward complex, precision guided munitions such as the JDAM and Paveway GBUs increases these manpower demands.  Introducing automation has the potential to improve weapons throughput while reducing the number of Navy personnel needed for the assembly process.  Any automated solution must possess both the payload capacity to handle heavy bomb bodies and the dexterity to perform the intricate assembly tasks associated with GBUs, all within the confined space of a carrier\u2019s magazine.  Square One proposes a novel automated workcell that that utilizes an articulated arm robot to perform the requisite assembly tasks.  The function of this robot is coordinated with servo-driven support fixtures that automatically adapt to the geometry of a range of air-launched weapons.  Automated end effector exchange incorporated into the robot provides operational flexibility and maximizes weapons throughput.  The Phase II development effort will include the design of a linear workcell capable of interfacing with up-stream material handling technologies, the construction of a full-scale prototype workcell and the complete evaluation of this workcell\u2019s functionality. The goal is to conclusively establish the feasibility of automated shipboard weapons assembly.  BENEFITS: The primary commercial application for the Compound Robotic Workcell is deployment on board the Navy\u2019s CVN-21 Next Generation Aircraft Carrier.

To exploit spatial diversity, a distributed multi-sensor array is used, whereas multiple pulses are used for temporal diversity.  In addition, transmit energy, polarization and spectral information are other additional degrees of freedom available for transmitter-receiver design. For a specific platform geometry and given set of multitasks, the problem of optimally designing the transmit waveforms and their companion receivers is addressed here.  To achieve multitasking without increasing the system requirements, new transmitter waveform design methodologies that exploit STEPS diversity will be investigated.  In this context, the payoff using multiple transmit waveforms versus a single waveform from collocated as well as distributed sensor scenes will be evaluated.  The set of tasks proposed here concentrates on demonstrating the increase in target detection and identification capabilities for multi-sensor systems using an optimum set of transmit waveforms and companion receiver design scheme.

Military systems, such as those managed and developed by the Army\u2019s Fire Control organization, have reliability and safety goals that management must work toward while reducing cost and schedule risk.  The MST team believes that to achieve the goal of reliable and safe software two items must be in place: 1. The system software specification must be complete, correct and consistent. 2. The system must be tested with sufficient thoroughness to demonstrate, with a high degree of confidence, that software reliability goals have been achieved. The model-based specification and testing methodology addresses both elements and will ensure correct, complete and consistent specification and test coverage are achieved.

The second is to develop an accurate, fast-running propagation model to predict link performance and determine deployment densities for UGS/munition systems using near-earth antennas, for the spectrum of geographical deployment environments. This code is based upon the recently formulated stochastic \u201cwandering-photon\u201d or random walk technique that has been shown to be capable of accurately calculating path loss using only two parameters that are obtained from land use data files.

        "abstract": "Toyon proposes to further develop an intelligent agent-based system to provide \u201cexpert\u201d assistance for the analyst in autonomously fusing, assessing, and collating relevant information. Agents will be expected to perform a variety of cooperative missions such as persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), target search, acquisition, and tracking, area denial, attack, route planning, and battle damage assessment under dynamically-varying bandwidth limitations, intermittent communications, and limited information. The system architecture provides a User-Interface Agent capable of communicating information to and from the User, including interfacing with existing combat applications. The system will be expanded to solve problems related to Homeland Security and distributed network centric warfare. The proposed architecture features centralized and decentralized solutions based on the information rate available to each agent within the cooperative network. The performance of the system will be guaranteed to degrade gracefully with the level of information available to each agent. The system comprises two data mining Agents, referred to as the Task Agent and the Information Agent. The Information Agent handles the details of communication with specific database formats that hold a history of sensor detections and track information. This data is then utilized by the Task Agent to fuse the data received from the Information Agent and create relevant situational awareness information that is then passed to the User-Interface Agent via a customizable Network Interface. Toyon will customize the software and hardware of the system to satisfy the needs of the Army and will use SLAMEM\u2122 to generate real-world data sources and, in addition, will demonstrate the interfacing capability of the system by testing over a dynamic network environment suitable for a given scenario of interest.",

The proposed framework is specifically targeted to both defensive and offensive assessments and analysis as well as Course of Action Analysis (COAA) in support of Maneuver Out of Contact (MOOC).  The framework will incorporate a high-resolution, full-dimensional visualization environment. SAWAF is used to rapidly build systems that will provide the commander with the ability to \u201csee\u201d his battle space through a full dimensional battlefield situational awareness and assessment display, with red/blue force composition, disposition, strength, recent activities, most probable course of action, and most dangerous course of action.

        "abstract": "A novel technique for controlling transition from laminar to turbulent flow in very low Reynolds number conditions has been developed.  Normally flows with Reynolds numbers in the range of 20,000 to 120,000 are dominated by laminar separation bubbles and are difficult to transition without using very large traditional trip devices, such as distributed roughness.  Additionally, these traditional trips are sized for one flow condition and are either not effective at off-design conditions or create a large device drag penalty.  RHRC's innovative transition control technology is capable of transitioning flow across a wide range of low Reynolds number conditions without resizing or incurring an off-design performance penalty.  The system also produces minimal device drag.  The novel transition control technology was shown to reduce trip drag penalties by as much as 35% to 60% when compared to correctly sized traditional trips, and increasing to as much as 190% at off-design conditions.  In addition, the system can be implemented without external power. The commercialization potential for the technology is extremely promising, with applications such as micro unmanned air vehicles, high-altitude long-endurance aircraft, Mars exploratory flyers, and propeller systems.",

Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) systems require clean, essentially sulfur-free hydrogen, and ppm levels of sulfur degrade even solid-oxide fuel cells.  Battlefield fuels (i.e., NATO-76, JP8) contain high levels of refractory sulfur specie, which must be removed before entering the fuel processor.  TDA Research, Inc. developed a low-cost, high-capacity regenerable sorbent that can directly remove organic sulfur from high sulfur military fuels, demonstrating the technical feasibility of a desulfurization process using this sorbent.  An engineering analysis showed that a 3 kWe APU running on JP8 with 10,000 ppm sulfur would need under 2 kg of sorbent.  We have already completed five consecutive adsorption/regeneration cycles; at least 40 cycles are planned during the remainder of the project.   In Phase II, we will further improve our sorbent and scale up production.  We will demonstrate our desulfurization sorbent\u2019s performance integrated with a fuel cell system in a full-scale factory allowance test, and complete a detailed engineering analysis to assess the impact of our sorbent on the overall fuel cell system.

        "abstract": "The Army Combat Feeding Equipment and Technology Team has recognized the potential merits of using renewable energy to power the refrigeration unit for their 20-ft food containers.  Using solar energy can reduce both the operational and location footprint of these containers, by reducing or eliminating the use of fossil fuels.  The operational footprint is reduced because the engines that currently drive these systems will need less fuel and service.  The locational footprint is reduced since the thermal and exhaust signatures of the engines are reduced or eliminated.  Another strong argument in favor of using solar energy for these food containers is that the true cost of fuel in the battlefield is extraordinarily high.  Some reports indicate fuel cost to be in the range of $10 to $50 per gallon based on the logistics required to provide fuel in these locations.  It is because of these tactical and economic considerations that the Army Combat Feeding Equipment and Technology Team has funded this work to look at developing a solar powered refrigeration unit.  The initial phase of this work is to analyze and develop preliminary designs for such a system.  The 2nd phase is to construct an operational prototype unit that can be field-tested.

        "abstract": "Unattended passive acoustic sensors are widely used for remote battlefield surveillance, situation awareness and monitoring applications.  They are rugged and reliable and can be left in the field for a relatively long period of time after deployment.   However, the current strategy of deploying expensive and large acoustic arrays of several microphones is being shifted toward deployment of a modest quantity of low cost, low power, small size wireless sensors that collectively form a sparse distributed array.  This new paradigm is expected to provide many benefits including much better coverage of the surveillance area, improved spatial resolution for separating multiple closely spaced targets, potential for dynamic array configuration, and widespread use in urban warfare, homeland security, etc.  Nevertheless, among the barrier issues is the development of a very low bit rate data compression and encoding system that can be integrated with the existing sensor packages and implemented on generic processing boards.  Moreover, effective strategies for large deployment are needed to yield sensor networks with great robustness to various operating and environmental factors.  Based upon our successful Phase I research, Information System Technologies, Inc. (ISTI) will further develop and fine-tune the new joint subband detection, feature extraction, and data compression system for transitioning to hardware implementation and prototyping.  All the operations will be performed on a generic off-the-shelf processing board that contains local A/D and I/O interfaces, a micro-computer, and a wireless transmitter.   This research will also lead to new methodologies for effective and economical sparse distributed sensor deployment that offer robustness to sensor location error, sensor failure, coherence loss, wavefront perturbations, and much better spatial resolution.  The effectiveness of the systems developed in this Phase II research will be demonstrated in two field testing that involve multi-target scenarios and various sparse distributed sensor configurations.   Testing will be done based upon the received signals at the mater station for data fusion, direction of arrival estimation and target classification.",

        "abstract": "A Phase I program was completed in which a non-ceramic SAPI solution was developed.  The system contained a hard-faced metal matrix composite (MMC) tile in place of the brittle ceramic tile.  Ballistic testing showed positive results and drop testing showed excellent durability.  The Phase II program aims to continue the work, leading to an optimized, durable SAPI system.  However, since the time of the Phase I program, additional more aggressive threats were added to the SAPI specification.  It is not known if an MMC solution will be sufficient for such threats.  Thus, two paths are proposed for the Phase II activities.  The first path will focus on the MMC tile approach, and the second path will focus on improved, high toughness reaction bonded ceramic tiles.  With two paths, the chances for a successful solution are high.  For both material systems being pursued, the goal is the same, namely to achieve a highly durable SAPI system that defeats the threats of interest at design weight.  The strengths of the team members are being utilized, such as M Cubed\u2019s expertise in developing and manufacturing advanced materials; Rutgers\u2019 skills in detailed materials characterization; and Simula\u2019s expertise in armor fabrication and testing.",

The tasks are transportable to a variety of procedures. The proposed project could thus significantly influence development of surgical training simulators. During Phase I, we established the haptic and visual feedback requirements for two trauma-related open surgical skills, and assessed how such training could be augmented with multisensory, psychophysics-centric concepts. During Phase II, we propose to build a prototype simulator during Year 1, and perform testing during Year 2 to determine the optimal combination of visual and haptic feedback needed for effective transfer of training for two tasks: wound debridement and pin placement for tibial fracture stabilization. These procedures have become increasingly necessary in recent conflicts, and offer very different sensory feedback qualities, thereby allowing exploration of a wide range of haptics needs for effective surgical training.",

However, the performances of these devices are often limited due to lack of direct access to organ systems. One powerful solution is to implant, using advanced minimally invasive techniques, a millimeter or sub-millimeter size, but highly intelligent device within the body. Resent development in sub-micron electronics, nanotechnology, and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) have provided powerful tools for constructing devices of this type. However, one fundamental problem has not yet been solved: how do these devices communicate with computers and receive power for long-term operation?  Running wires across the skin is clearly unacceptable in the battlefield, wireless radio frequency (RF) connection through the body has a number of drawbacks. The primary goal of this research is to develop a communication and power delivery channel capable of passing information between the inside and the outside of the human body. The Phase II project will focus on the design of this channel using the volume conduction property of the biological tissue, construct prototype implantable devices, and perform animal experiments to evaluate these devices.",

Additionally, because of the compact size of emerging missile systems and the limitations on traditional \u201ctin can\u201d battery designs, flexibility in battery configuration becomes an enabling factor in optimizing overall system performance.  To achieve these goals, a novel approach to electrolyte storage and activation will be employed.  Traditional Lithium Reserve Batteries contain two isolated sections.  One section consists of a dry cell stack and the other contains a liquid electrolyte.  This configuration requires a significant amount of storage space that is effectively useless once the battery is activated.  The approach to be researched will contain a cell stack that is \u201cwet\u201d with a neutral electrolyte and separate reservoir with the acidic, high molarity electrolyte component.  In the initial state, the battery can serve as a low discharge power source.  Upon high power activation, the high molarity electrolyte is injected into the \u201cwet\u201d cell stack and will infuse with the neutral electrolyte to provide high power capability.  This concept is described in detail in \u201cBimodal Battery,\u201d US Patent No. 6,187,471 B1, issued Feb. 13, 2001.

The broad conclusions are that SPs provide excellent performance, efficiency and programmability for such tasks, can support multiple applications running currently, have excellent IO capability, and with a development platform that includes a modular software framework, SPs can benefit a wide range of products. While SPI is commercializing this technology by building SP ICs and focused reference designs for specific products within its target markets, Phase II proposes to build such a development platform to broaden the usability of these SP ICs, especially to benefit military systems with multiple video and other demanding signal processing tasks such as multi-mode remote sensing applications.",

In Phase I, Ultramet demonstrated the feasibility of combining the light weight of carbon/carbon (C/C) with the long-duration oxidation resistance of ceramic matrix composites (CMC) in a unique laminate composite structure. This structure, composed of a C/C body with an integral CMC casing, effectively bridges the gap in weight and performance between coated C/C and bulk CMCs. Fabrication and initial performance of this laminate composite structure was demonstrated through an innovative variant of Ultramet's melt infiltration refractory composite processing technology. In its bulk form, this same CMC has survived >4300oF liquid propellant rocket engine testing at NASA GRC and >5200oF hot-gas testing at the Air Force LHMEL facility. Application of this reinforced ceramic material to a predominantly C/C structure would create a highly innovative material with the potential to achieve the long-sought goal of long-term, cyclic, high-temperature use of C/C in an oxidizing environment. In Phase II, Ultramet will team with Lockheed Martin and Pratt & Whitney for process optimization and comprehensive testing of this lightweight, high strength, ultrahigh temperature oxidation-resistant material system. The fully developed system will have strength that is comparable to that of C/C, low density comparable to that of C/SiC, and ultrahigh temperature (>4000oF) oxidation stability.

These fields may include stationary nodes and/or mobile nodes, but will have the need to move data among the nodes in the field and to reconfigure the system to respond to an evolving threat situation.  There are instances in which this network connectivity can be accomplished with hardwire links, but in the majority of cases, acoustic communication will be the preferred method.  Our goal is to develop the infrastructure to support robust, clandestine network-wide data fusion and data transmission to the end user. Our Phase 1 proposal listed five requirements in the statement of work: 1. Develop the top-level protocols necessary to enable asynchronous, CDMA-based acomms, and refine the existing CDMA signaling to support these protocols. 2. Evaluate requirements for high data rate signaling. 3. Redesign the electronic and acoustic characteristics of the modem to support dual frequency operations (full duplex). 4. Develop the top level protocols necessary to support dual band signaling. 5. Evaluate the requirements for modem-based, in-situ signal processing and data fusion and identify algorithms to satisfy those requirements. Each of these issues were addressed in the Phase 1 study, but the emphasis quickly became the design of a new generation modem able to satisfy the requirements derived from our analyses.  The current Benthos modem is the ATM 88x series, a successful and reliable tool which was developed over many years under SBIR, BAA, and IR&D funding.  It is, by far, the most versatile acoustic modem available anywhere.  However, the demand for acoustic communications is increasing at a rapid pace, and the capabilities of the existing infrastructure simply are inadequate for many of the new applications.  The present ASW application is an ideal example:  in order to support distributed sensors in an integrated network, a dual band telemetry system is required.  However, the existing modem cannot provide this capability. In summary, the Navy requires autonomous underwater systems which can collect environmental data, provide surveillance functions, and provide C2 and data connectivity with the outside world.",

        "abstract": "There exists a need to develop therapeutic strategies for the pharmacological modulation of angiogenesis to maintain force readiness.  Angiogenesis is the development and growth of new capillary blood vessels from the existing vasculature.  While increased vascularization of wounded tissue is essential for wound healing, increased angiogenesis is also critical in the progression of several pathologies including arthritis, diabetic retinopathy, and tumor proliferation.  It is also an essential process underlying tumor growth and metastasis.  Technologies that can modulate the process of angiogenesis are important to maintain the warfighter at full capacity.  These technologies will have long reaching effects including reduced need for evacuation and convalescence leave; and reduced the cost of operations based on a decreased need for extended medical logistical support. Recent research suggests that focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity is closely linked to angiogenesis.  During the Phase I program, the Luna team discovered several natural extracts that contained specific FAK modulators.  During the Phase II program, the Luna team will purify and identify the active component from each of the extracts that specifically influence FAK activity.  Additionally, the efficacy of the FAK-specific modulators on cell migration and angiogenesis in cell-based assays will be determined, along with preliminary animal testing.",

An initial \u201cshot\u201d non-lethally performs the wall penetrating function.  A second shot delivers the multi-mode lethal or non-lethal generic submunition.  Both shots are contained in a single munition.  Multi-mode capability is a key advantage against competing concepts.  Multi-mode means that (1) lethal or non-lethal submunitions are delivered through an 8 inch concrete wall non-lethally; and (2) a variety of non-lethal modes such as diversionary, calmative, marking, irritant, or a combination can be used in the submunition.  The \u201cDoubleshot\u201d munition can be designed to provide enough volume for the submunition yet still fit within the launcher size constraints.  Ensuring adequate clearance and shielding to minimize back blast against the operator was considered.  Shaped charged modeling work using the computer program hydrocode CTH indicates that the likelihood of meeting wall penetrating requirements is excellent under a Phase II project.  A second concept based on using a specialized detonation/propulsion unit is a viable option.  However, the \u201cB40\u201d M203 based munition is considered the best near-term product.

        "abstract": "The use of Multistatic/Multi-platform ASW capabilities are needed to counter the improvement in capability of enemy submarines deployed by potential adversaries.  The need exists for systems that provide a wide area search capability while at the same time providing sufficient standoff distances for friendly forces.  The use of Multistatic receivers for active sonar sources can significantly increase the effectiveness of the current shipboard and helicopter ASW systems by increasing the likelihood of aspect dependent target echo returns.  This SBIR will develop a new Mid-frequency Passive Sonobuoy designed to operate as an adjunct receiver for the high-power SQS-53C bow mounted sonar and the variable depth ALFS dipping sonar.  Extensive system performance modeling was utilized in Phase 1 of this SBIR to identify the best candidate adjunct receiver configuration.  In addition, the technical feasibility of developing and packaging a mid-frequency sonobuoy that is operationally compatible with the surface combatant sonar and the ALFS in an A-sized sonobuoy form factor was also an important factor.  In Phase 2 we will prototype the leading candidate configurations and evaluate the performance under real world environmental conditions.  In Phase 3 we will transition the sensor to an A-size air deployable fleet asset.",

Unmanned systems offer the military an \u201cout of harms way\u201d technology that enhances its tactical advantage by remotely providing situational awareness, force protection, and deployment of offensive actions and strategic maneuvers.  Although unmanned platforms have been proven in theater, they are controlled by closed and proprietary architectures.  The military must contend with non-interoperable assets.  Complementary technological advancements in sensors, communications, etc. can only be implemented by the OEM on its specific platform.     The primary goal of this program is to design and produce an all-terrain, cost-effective, rugged and reliable, modular, man-portable, unmanned ground system for military operations on urbanized terrain (MOUT) with a fully open architecture control comprised of plug-and-play remotely interoperable Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems (JAUS) compliant components.  The proposed architecture promotes third party hardware and software development and contains the required enabling technologies to support intelligent, netcentric agent collaboration among unmanned systems.  The final program objective entails the development and integration of enhanced teleoperation capabilities and semi-autonomous control strategies to increase awareness and alleviate the operator from tedious navigational tasks. The system will be interoperable with other JAUS compliant systems to ensure interoperability of assets, leveraging of technology that can be shared among assets, and encourage third party integration of hardware and software enhancements.",

        "abstract": "Development of air-to-air and air-to-ground imaging LADAR systems with high resolution is a difficult problem, because transmit and receive signals are distorted by atmospheric turbulence along the beam path.  The distortion has high-frequency spatial and temporal components due to the movement of the platform.  To dynamically correct the turbulence viewed from a tactical platform, the adaptive optic system needs to have a fast close-loop response.  The proposed Phase II approach combines an adaptive optics piston-tip-tilt beacon optimizing technique with a post-processing technique of applying an imaging sharpening algorithm to captured data.   The hybrid approach offers a robust LADAR solution for target identification, aim point selection, target tracking, aim point maintenance and damage assessment from airborne platforms that experience highly-dynamic atmospheric turbulence. In Phase II, Boulder Nonlinear Systems (BNS) and Lockheed Martin Coherent Technologies (LMCT) will demonstrate the adaptive optics (AO) capability of the hybrid approach by integrating the technology into an imaging LADAR breadboard system and demonstrating the system in an aero-optic environment.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this project is to develop a software tool to localize transmitters at unknown locations broadcasting with unknown power based on the intercepted transmissions aggregated from a network of receivers over time. The only information available for the localization is the signal power at the locations of the receivers and the corresponding frequency bands used. The goal is to use such information to triangulate the locations of the transmitters. Many factors complicate the triangulation problem. First of all, for such land-based transmissions, attenuation of the signal strength depends on many environmental conditions and is often unpredictable. Furthermore, for higher frequency transmissions, small changes of the transmitter and receiver separation or even movement of nearby objects can also significantly change the strength of the received signal. In Phase 1, we focused on developing the propagation models of electromagnetic waves in realistic environments and the associated computational schemes to localize the transmitters. The localization results are displayed in the form of confidence maps, which can be overlapped on top of DTED maps to facilitate user decisions. This will lay the foundation for the Phase 2 development where the transmitters can be mobile and the locations of the transmitters are to be determined from the transmissions collected over an extended period of time.",

The SET Phase II effort proposes to extend the successes of E3D to the RF regime to gain additional standoff range and all-weather capability. Unfortunately, the specular nature of the RF problem results in significantly less dense point clouds or, in this case, RF scattering centers.

We solved the compact size problem by using two plasma antennas with one nested inside the other. Nesting cannot be done with metal antennas, but it saves space. High bandwidth is achieved by using plasma spiral antennas and when there are several layers of nested plasma antennas, the bandwidths and power of each plasma layer adds.  In phase I we went beyond developing a theoretical model of our innovative antenna designs  and built and tested prototypes  which is not requested until phase II.   We are developing an innovative antenna which is smaller and covers wider bandwidths that those available will find communications applications in Wi-Fi applications, last mile applications ,and  RFID. By being invited and participating in the SMi Stealth Conference during the past two years,  The Haleakala R&D Inc. plasma antenna technology has become a high profile technology to the US DOD.",

        "abstract": "Compact, low-cost laser warning systems are in high demand for military, commercial, and battlespace platforms as lasers become more prevalent in tactical weapon systems. Present laser warning systems (LWS) are bulky when all features are integrated as a complete laser profiling analysis system. Critical elements that are difficult to integrate in military systems are the determination of the specific wavelength of the target source in conjunction with an accurate determination of the angle of arrival (AoA). Present systems with high wavelength resolution are not compact, require bulky dispersive or multi-sensor elements, do not possess fast data collection times, or have optics/detectors that are too expensive to warrant high volume implementation. To address the need for a compact, low-cost LWS, new techniques must be brought to bear on the optics, spectral sensing and packaging aspects of a LWS. Nanohmics will fabricate a laser threat detection system that identifies, in real-time, the angle of arrival and spectral properties of laser threats in a compact device package. The detection platform will consist of a custom low-profile optical assembly with a field-of-view that extends beyond one hemisphere, mapping the angle of arrival of the threat onto a low-cost CMOS image sensor that possesses a custom color filter mosaic for wavelength and intensity characterization.",

The BCF will provide the option to perform the simulations in an un-coupled mode in which the effect of the buried explosive on the ground vehicle is through a pre-determined load-history boundary condition or tightly coupled where the explosion and structural response of the vehicle metal are time-marched together to accurately capture interactions.

Unfortunately, such techniques have proved too computationally demanding because they require the solution of an often very large and dense matrix.  We therefore propose the use of reconfigurable hardware, specifically designed to solve the large, dense matrix equations.  In Phase I, EM Photonics demonstrated the viability of using a reconfigurable hardware approach to accelerate the simulation of scattering from electrically large objects.  Specifically, a successful hardware prototype was developed that demonstrated the tremendous speedups possible with our acceleration platform.  In Phase II, this technology will be extended to create a commercial quality solver for such scattering problems capable of 40x improvements over currently available software implementations.  Consequently, simulations that previously required one month of computation time can now be analyzed in less than a day!  Given our Phase I success and the numerous academic, commercial, and government groups interested in this technology, we are confident that the Phase II effort will be a complete success, directly enabling the commercialization of this powerful tool.",

Phase I results have shown the feasibility of these tools, which consist of novel modeling tools and advanced system and data analysis capability. The modeling tools differ from all known technologies in that they facilitate the capture of experimental data on COTS devices that get automatically transformed through novel modeling methods into newly created behavioral models with performance degradation and lifetime effects. These tools are relevant and important in providing NASA the means to quantify the reliability and lifetime (i.e., capability and risk) of COTS components and COTS-based systems and provide a trade structure for the assessment of competing technologies. Furthermore, these modeling and design tools provide a means of integrating disparate models, allow agile evolution of models, and encourage MBD reporting mechanisms be used in reviews. Ultimately, these MBD tools will enable lower-cost system development and cost versus lifetime assessment, shorten development time, and extend flight-proven technology to broader applications. Lynguent plans to develop MBD tools based on its Phase I feasibility study and to utilize a high temperature testbed (DC-DC converter) as a case study to demonstrate a calibration methodology for the tools to insure accuracy with respect to accelerated testing results. This calibration methodology will be developed in consultation with leading experts in the field of reliability modeling and high temperature measurements of electronics and packaging.",

        "abstract": "ASRI proposes to develop an advanced and commercially viable Non-Intrusive Vibration Monitoring System (NI-VMS) which can provide effective on-line/off-line engine vibration monitoring capabilities without relying on intrusive key-phasor speed measurements.  Many powerful vibration signature analysis techniques for engine-health monitoring rely on key-phasor signals to extract/enhance critical fault signatures from noisy vibration measurements.  In many situations (e.g. SSME HPOTP), such speed measurements are not available, usually due to the safety concerns of a key-phasor's intrusive installation (e.g.in a high-pressure liquid-oxygen environment for HPOTP).   As a result, the ability/reliability for health monitoring and post-test diagnostic evaluation is severely limited.  The proposed NI-VMS overcomes this problem by utilizing a novel signal analysis technique called Pseudo Key Phasor (PKP) to reconstruct a PKP signal directly from external vibration measurements.  This procedure enables powerful signal analyses that require a key phasor to become applicable, greatly enhancing fault detection and diagnostic capabilities.   NI-VMS can reduce the risks of catastrophic engine failure and improve the reliability of NASA's current/future propulsion systems.  Phase I feasibility studies using SSME test data have successfully demonstrated the technical merits of NI-VMS.  Phase II will complete design, development, and testing of the prototype NI-VMS hardware/software system.",

During Phase I, various microstructure models were investigated and numerical techniques to accelerate cogging simulations were evaluated.  As a result, a preliminary Cellular Automata-based microstructure evolution model has been developed; cogging simulation times have been reduced up to 90%, and feasibility studies have succeeded in demonstrating the effectiveness of the inverse technique for both flow stress modeling and for the quantification of difficult-to-measure microstructure modeling parameters.  Three additional tasks must be performed to combine these successes into a commercial product useful to industry, government, and academia.  Thus, in cooperation with industrial partner ATI Allvac, Phase II proposed work will (1) pursue further microstructure model development, augmented with material testing; (2) integrate the microstructure model into DEFORM, and (3) validate the integrated DEFORM/microstructure module with an industrial cogging breakdown process, and demonstrate the inverse analysis technique to reduce the number of experiments necessary to characterize new materials.",

        "abstract": "Today, technological advances have resulted in the ability for receivers to extract RADAR signal features from received signals resulting in Specific Emitter Identification (SEI). The problem can be summarized as follows: 1) Today\u2019s RADAR signal receivers are able to identify the class of the radar as well as specific signature characteristics emanating from a specific radar system. 2) Very high fidelity signal generation is required to adequately develop, test and reprogram SEI capable systems.  3) Flight tests over EW ranges and others are very costly so laboratory simulation is a highly attractive alternative. Further, laboratory simulation enables highly classified signal emissions to be contained, which is not possible while radiating on the range. 4) Unfortunately, today\u2019s laboratory simulators cannot reproduce the requisite signal environments with sufficient fidelity in order to permit SEI signal recording and generation for receiver development, test and library reprogramming.  KOR Electronics proposes herein to develop a prototype by continued research and innovation into techniques and technologies.  This will permit the construction of a very high fidelity RF emitter parameter generation capability capable of recording and generating these SEI signals with sufficient resolution that will enable the highly accurate, repeatable synthesis and reproduction of such radar signals including fine modulations for the test and evaluation of advanced receivers.",

        "abstract": "Signal Innovations Group (SIG) and its Fast Track partner, Integrian (www.integrian.com), propose development of an adaptive video sensing system, with a focus on intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). The proposed adaptive system is applicable for ISR in general environments, addressing base and port security, as well as urban and suburban sensing during wartime and peace-keeping operations. Of significant importance for current and anticipated DoD activities, the proposed system will focus on detecting asymmetric threats, with the goal of recognizing unusual behavior or activities. Specifically, we must detect unusual events that may never have been observed previously. Therefore, rather then addressing the impossible task of training an algorithm on events that we may never observe a priori, the ISR system will focus on learning and modeling the characteristics of normal or typical behavior. This motivates development of graphical statistical models, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), based on measured data characteristic of normal behavior. The graphical models will be employed within a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) algorithm, to develop an optimal policy for multi-sensor control and management. In this Phase II effort, SIG will develop and demonstrate real-time event detection algorithms on a multi-sensor Integrian video platform.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project is aimed at the development of an analytical instrument which combines the advantages of fast gas chromatography (GC) and a detector that is capable of sample identification independently from GC retention time. Experiments in the limited-space environment require from a GC system maximum productivity and universality with minimal resource consumption. A combination of a miniature short-column chromatograph with a detector capable of identifying unknown species would be an ideal instrument for flight analysis. A low-resource and power consumption micro-sized GC detector that is proposed for development in Phase II of this project is based on a technology of Penning Ionization Electron Spectroscopy in plasma (PIES). Adding another analytical dimension to the amperometric method that has earlier been employed in the metastable ionization detector (MID), PIES technology relies on the measurement of the energy of electrons liberated by Penning ionization in collisions between analyte molecules and helium metastable atoms in the afterglow of a gas discharge. Since the energy of Penning electrons is specific to the species, the resultant data can be used to identify gas components.  No optics or high vacuum is required, and the spectra in this technique are recorded by using a collector electrode placed into a glow discharge cell. In the Phase I of the project, the technology has been expanded to flowing plasmas with linear gas velocities of up to 9.3 m/s where PIES spectra were recorded in ~1.5 s. Phase II of the project is focused on further increasing the data acquisition rates, realization of PIES detector in a compact design, development of advanced measurement electronics, and testing the prototype detector with a commercial high-speed gas chromatograph.",

It allows existing planetary sample-preparation systems such as rock crushers and drills to be used in place of fine-grinding mills normally required for quality XRD analysis. A secondary benefit is that it offers a simple means of loading and removal of samples, with potentially no moving parts. This research will answer a critical need for sample handling devices for conducting definitive mineralogical analyses in the Solar System.  The Phase 2 effort will focus on addressing key technical issues in the development of a miniature Vibrating Powder Handling System.

While these data provide the basic terrain representation needed for vehicle dynamics and weapon system effects, they do not provide the semantic information needed for higher level reasoning, especially for modeling of human behaviors within a combat environment. Semantic information goes beyond the physical characteristics that most terrain databases provide, and includes relationships between terrain features and how they can be used in the performance of specific combat missions. Humans can interpret this additional semantic data and make decisions based on it, but human behavior algorithms need these data to be represented within the combat simulations. M\u00c4K Technologies proposes to develop terrain representation enhancements to augment common terrain representations that support the incorporation of semantic data that will enhance the current polygon and vector representation. We will develop automated tools to extract semantic information where possible, and other tools to assist terrain developers in extracting semantic information where it is not possible to fully automate the process.

The proposed Phase II effort will focus on developing and demonstrating the performance of two key innovations: the dual polarized, dual wavelength wideband antenna feed and transceiver.",

        "abstract": "The Navy uses helmet mounted displays (HMDs) in both training and operational situations. For pilots, HMDs are used to provide additional feedback such as target designation, heading, etc. In training scenarios, HMDs can also serve as the entire visualization display. While HMDs provide a mechanism for providing information to the wearer, they suffer from a few well-known problems. One of the major issues is keeping the exit pupil of the HMD aligned with the pupil of the wearer. If these become misaligned, the wearer may experience clipped images, unstable images, misaligned images, or other artifacts. These tend to increase eye strain and decrease usability of the HMD. Cybernet proposes to develop a system for automatically aligning the HMD to the wearer\u2019s head. The system will track features of the wearer\u2019s head and use this information to move the HMD in response to any misalignment. This will greatly improve the performance of HMDs in both training and operational roles.",

ORMSOL has excellent optical properties, thermal stability, durability, and flexibility, as well as excellent ballistic performance at a substantially reduced weight compared to current glass/polycarbonate laminates. ORMSOL is a highly crosslink-oriented nanocomposite of tetraethoxysilane and a precursor of polyurethane or polystyrene that integrates the best properties of both polymer and glass leading to higher optical transmission, higher tensile strength, and higher heat deflection temperature with 15% - 50% less weight per unit of thickness than standard glass/polymer laminates.  In Phase I POC developed and fabricated ORMSOL nanocomposite samples with 3 mm thick laminates and 91%+ optical transmission, thermal stability as high as 394\u00b0C, chemical resistance to strong alkali and sulfuric acid, no polarization effect, and only 1.5% haze.  The samples were tested for mechanical strength.  In Phase II POC will further develop and optimize the ORMSOL material matrix, and produce scaled-up laminated prototypes that will be subjected to ballistic field testing.",

NASA's micro-satellites and space exploration missions, like the Space Technology 5 (ST5) Project, are current examples of systems that employ a variety of voltage levels. Spacecraft have limited supply voltages and power at their disposal and this encourages the use of a higher percentage of low voltage microelectronics.

The ASI ReBiLS Phase II project will generate prototypes for stand-alone and embedded bidirectional level shifters. A stand-alone ReBiLS device will allow designers to provide efficient bi-directional communication between existing or COTS components operating at different voltages.

The Shotscreen RPG Defeat system is lightweight compared to competing concepts, and incorporates simplistic technology in an effort to provide a rapid fielding potential and high probability of success. The system releases a wave or screen of shot that collides with the fuze of an incoming RPG. The system is non-lethal, reliable, safe, and inexpensive. It does not rely on the input of acutely accurate range data, intricate timing, or time consuming aiming/slewing of a weapon for tracking purposes as with competing concepts.  The feasibility of shot-screen based anti-RPG technology was demonstrated during a successful Phase I SBIR project. It was proven that there is a high probability of RPG/shot intercept/collision resulting in premature detonation of the RPG shaped charge. A very capable design, manufacturing, and commercialization team has been assembled to produce a functional Shotscreen RPG Defeat system that can be rapidly fielded.  Phase II finalizes the shot and release mechanism design, integrates a COTS sensor/lens, and tests the complete Generation 1 system.  Phase II optional periods offer system improvements and additional production units, ready for field trials.

Anasphere has, in Phase I work, clearly demonstrated the feasibility of an entirely new technique for the in-situ measurement of cloud water content.  The new sensor is lightweight (under 40 g), consumes very little power (the sensor can run for days on one 9-volt battery), and is very inexpensive.\n\nPhase II work will focus on refining the sensor design from both mechanical and electronic perspectives, completing extensive laboratory and field tests of the improved sensors, and delivering several examples to NASA.  Two sequential cycles of design improvement, laboratory testing, and flight testing are envisioned.  Samples of the sensors will be sent to NASA as part of each flight testing cycle.  \n\nThe Phase II effort will culminate in the availability of a simple and inexpensive cloud water content sensor for cloud research.  This sensor will be very useful to scientists studying cloud formation and structure.  It will enable such scientists to inexpensively obtain in-situ data that previously was obtained only through the use of an expensive research aircraft flying through the cloud.",

The other construction wave was collimated. All six overlapping apertures require individually constructed plates, we delivered only 2 thus far. This method of correction requires the use of the final playback wavelength for construction and so is useful for 532 and 355nm but not for 2054 nm. Computed diffractive optics can be used for 2054 nm using measured aberrations at the same wavelength.

As early as the 1960s, Werner Von Braun and others recognized the need for a nuclear rocket for sending humans to Mars.  The great distances, the intense radiation levels, and the physiological response to zero-gravity all supported the concept of using a nuclear rocket to decrease mission time.  These same needs have been recognized in later studies, especially in the Space Exploration Initiative in 1989.  One of the key questions that has arisen in later studies, however, is the need to utilize a nuclear fuel form that does not emit fission products into the exhaust stream.  Unlike the Rover/NERVA programs in the 1960s, the rocket exhaust in a current day nuclear rocket should contain no radioactivity. We will investigate a series of coated fuel forms that will inhibit fission products and actinides from diffusing out into the surrounding coolant.  A demonstration experiment will be designed that will allow fuels containing uranium-238 to be fissioned, heated to very high temperatures, and assessed for emission of any products.",

Phase I also identified and tested new high temperature SMA (HTSMA) materials technology to enable the devices to operate in both low temperature (fan) and high temperature (core) exhaust flows.  The proposed Phase II effort will continue development of this technology and demonstrate extension of this concept to operation at full-scale stiffness levels and at realistic dynamic pressure and temperature conditions.",

(CRG) has completed the critical initial development steps for a deployable support structure meeting NASA's requirements for a structure to deploy, tension, and support gossamer antennas.  CRG proposes to further develop this lightweight, self-deploying VeritexTM strut for use as a supporting structure for gossamer antennas.  VeritexTM composites are similar to other high-performance composites, except that CRG's shape memory polymer (SMP) resin, VeriflexTM, is used as the matrix resin. This allows for easy manipulation of the composite above the activation temperature, making it a unique material for use in dynamic structures and other applications requiring both load strength and \"shape-shifting\" modulus flexibility. In this Phase I program, CRG has developed and evaluated materials and related fabrication technologies based on VeritexTM, and produced a sub-scale working proto-type.  This technical approach fulfills NASA's requirement for a very large, lightweight, on-orbit deployable RF antenna aperture structure by offering a practical, deployable, structural support that will address the short comings of current rigidified inflatables and mechanically deployed structures.",

While both problems have been studied for many years, there is currently no satisfactory technology for providing adequate non-parasitic shielding.  Even in low-Earth orbit, astronauts must be closely monitored for radiation exposure, and some missions simply cannot be performed due to the current inability to adequately shield astronauts (e.g. Mars or surface Lunar bases).  The overall objective of the proposed project is to construct, test, and deliver a prototype for hydrogen storage and radiation shielding.  In Phase I we experimentally verified the radiation shielding capability of these systems and its ability to operate after being bombarded by ionizing radiation at a nuclear accelerator.  In this Phase II proposal, AFR will join with Boeing to design two multi-layer configurations that could be of use for operational missions.  We will then work with Prairie View A&M Univ. to perform an empirical study of radiation shielding using NSRL and Loma Linda particle accelerators.  In collaboration with Prof. Larry Townsend, we will perform a complementary computational study to broaden shielding characterization and to validate shielding code performance with respect to this non-parasitic shielding concept.  During the process and product assessment, we will coordinate possible commercial ventures with Boeing.  The successful operation of the prototype would raise the system's TRL to 5 or 6 (system operated in a relevant environment).",

If there is an abrupt change in fluid quality, turbo-machinery can over-speed causing catastrophic failure.  The CFS will provide a means to avoid these failures as well as providing fluid quality data for a wide range of flow systems. Experimental hardware was able to detect the onset of two-phase flow and the presence of debris in the flow of water.  The innovation clearly shows that it can discern between entrained gas bubbles and unwanted debris.  The sensor has the potential to determine size and quantity of the contaminant.

        "abstract": "Two novel flight control actuation concepts for UAV applications are proposed for prototype development, both of which incorporate shape memory alloy (SMA) wires as prime movers.  These actuators promise considerable savings in weight, power, and volume over existing electomechanical and hydraulic systems.  Incorporation of these actuators within lifting surface structure, or as trailing edge control devices, would greatly simplify the actuation systems of these aircraft, thereby permitting greater payload fraction, increased range, enhanced robustness, and/or smaller vehicle size, and thus reduce both operational and fixed system costs.  Choice between the two actuation concepts for a particular installation represents a tradeoff in actuation system bandwidth and power availability, and thus the same vehicle may include both systems depending upon the particular functional requirements.  These actuators represent a derivative technology from a previous Army SBIR Phase I/II effort directed at providing in-flight helicopter blade tracking using actively controlled trailing edge tabs, and thus have been designed to have low mass and low power requirements from their inception.  Since they lack any physical hinge joints, they may be embedded directly within aircraft lifting surfaces, eliminating interference drag associated with control deflection.",

However, due to the cooling requirements, they consume large amounts of power and are bulky and unsuitable for many NASA applications.  During Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of employing dark current skimming to increase the operating temperature of HgCdTe mid-wavelength infrared devices to temperature regimes attainable by thermoelectric (TE) cooling. This work will be applied to two-color detectors and 320 ? 256 focal plane arrays during the proposed Phase II effort, leading to the next generation of HgCdTe infrared focal plane arrays. Multicolor detection will involve only an incremental development of the current skimming employed in Phase I. The resistor used in Phase I for skimming will be replaced with a photovoltaic detector that will have two functions: first, it will allow skimming by collecting part of the current flowing through the main detectors, and second, it will act as an independent detector for a second color. By employing a non-equilibrium mode of operation for the same detector, the majority and minority carrier densities will be greatly reduced. This will suppress Auger recombination processes in the active layers, and lead to dramatic increases in recombination lifetimes, dynamic impedances and detectivities. The proposed effort will exploit the excellent optoelectronic properties of bandgap tunable HgCdTe, the recent advances in the heteroepitaxial growth of this material by the flexible MBE manufacturing technique and innovative concepts such as dynamic dark current skimming and Auger suppression.",

A first-generation prototype motor was designed, built and tested in Venus-like conditions (460oC temperature, mostly CO2 gas environment) during Phase I. The Phase I tests demonstrated the feasibility of the design through verification that the motor can operate at 460oC for an extended period of time. A further developed and optimized version of this motor could be used to actuate drills, robotic arms, and other devices outside of an environment-controlled landed platform on the surface of Venus. The motor's capability to survive for hours (and potentially longer) in that environment is a major benefit to future Venus science missions since it would allow time for communication ground loops to optimize drill target selection and allow for multiple samples to be acquired from the subsurface. An extreme temperature motor would therefore revolutionize the exploration of Venus. In Phase II, both an extreme environment motor and an extreme environment drill system will be developed to TRL 6.

Optimized solutions had freezing points of about -30 C and freezing volume expansions 50%-75% less than water.  The toxicity of the fluids is predicted to be \"low\" and also compatible with SS, BNi-2, PTFE and pEVA.  The heat transfer Figures of Merit were 75-100 relative to water (\"100\"), and better than propylene glycol and organic heat transfer fluids.  The pump work metric was only about 60% higher than water.

The production of plastics and composites will also serve as feedstock for In Situ Manufacturing of a variety of useful components, such as inflatable structures, replacement parts, etc.  The direction set to NASA by the President on January 2004 placed high emphasis on a robust space exploration program.  Affordable planning and execution of prolonged manned space missions depend upon the utilization of local resources (e.g., soil, atmosphere, etc.) and the waste products which are formed in manned spacecraft and surface bases.  The purpose of the investigation is to develop materials and associated processing technologies for habitat structure on planetary surfaces to effectively shield humans and sensitive electronics such as solar arrays and integrated circuits from the harmful effect of deep space radiation environment.  Unlike Earth, on the Lunar or Martian surface, there is practically no protection from primary deep space radiation sources such as Solar Particle Events (SPEs) and Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs).

(MEI) supported by Lockheed Martin and the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) propose to develop an integrated hydrogen generator and purifier system for conversion of in-situ produced hydrocarbons to fuel-cell-grade hydrogen.  With increased space exploration activities, mobility on planetary surfaces becomes a vital resource: without mobility on the surface, exploration activities are limited to landing sites.  There are many needs and many solutions to the mobility challenge, depending on the distance and nature of the transportation required.  Rovers provide a range of transportation possibilities, from the very small rovers for site recognition to the large rovers for crew transportation during extra vehicular activities (EVA).  While very small rovers may be powered by photovoltaic cells, fuel-cell based power systems may be the alternative to power mid-size to large rovers.  Due to the various penalties of storing gaseous hydrogen on-board the rover, it is advantageous to carry methane instead of hydrogen and to have an on-board reformer to produce hydrogen on-demand for the fuel cell.  Proton exchange membranes (PEM) are currently the choice on many fuel-cell based power systems.  While other fuel cell technologies are being developed, proton exchange membranes (PEM) are currently the choice on many fuel-cell based power systems.

These values compare favorably to the strongest polymer films, including those of aramide polymers. The thermal oxidation degradation point of polyethylene is up-shifted by more than 100 oC at 1 wt. % loading of the DWNT filler. A prominent increase in proton radiation shielding efficiency, reaching 35 % in terms of water equivalence thickness was obtained for composites containing DWNTs and fullerene hydrides.

Instead, all of these functions would be automatically incorporated into a single framework using existing physics-based deterministic modeling codes and a set of computer-generated data transfer interfaces.  Thus, a design engineer would be able to rapidly explore the design space to identify the minimum weight design that meets a given reliability constraint ? thereby avoiding both an overly conservative design and an excessively risky design. \n\nMoreover, the methodology would also rollup component-level uncertainties to the system level for multiple components -- thereby enabling a system level reliability constraint to be imposed at the component level.

In this way, a single instrument chain can be used instead of different instrumentation for each of the reactor's operation ranges (start-up, ramping-up, and nominal power). This is a clear advantage for space applications where simplicity, reliability, and size constraints are of premium importance.

We will finish these optics to final specification using one of several candidate sub-aperture finishing tools.  The avoidance of surface and subsurface damage by the use of this non-contact RAP process is expected to substantially reduce the time and cost of optical finishing of lightweight SiC optics.  We will also demonstrate the scalability of the RAP process for SiC optics and optical segments up to 2 meters.",

The important goals include extending human presence in the solar system culminating in the exploration of Mars and other remote destinations.  One of the most critical problems facing such space missions is identification of effective methods to control solid waste.  With current waste models, 1300 kg of waste occupying a volume 20 m3 will be generated in a 180-day mission to Mars.  Unprocessed waste poses a biological hazard to the crew and exposure to odors from untreated waste is a threat to crew health and morale.  In Phase I TDA identified a low temperature process that effectively oxidized five model waste compounds to carbon dioxide and water at temperatures up to 220oC.  In addition the reaction rates we measured are much greater than biological oxidation process currently under development.  In addition, we found that the quantity of NOX formed was very low.  In the Phase II portion of the project, TDA will optimize the reactor configuration, identify the most effective oxidation conditions, and finally design and construct a fully automated pilot scale system for waste treatment that will be delivered to NASA Ames Research Center at the conclusion of the project.",

All objectives in Phase I were met and all tasks were completed as proposed. The methods worked very well for both 2D and 3D geometries, for tetrahedral, hexahedral, and general polyhedral element types, and for the simple viscous meshes. In Phase II, we will extend the software into a general purpose package for use by NASA, other Government agencies, and commercial customers.  We will implement our 3D viscous mesh generation method including a general solution-adaptive meshing capability. We will develop the software necessary to compute sensitivity derivatives of the mesh operations. Two important software design goals for our final Phase II software are ease-of-use and convenient access to its functionality. We will develop two types of user interfaces: graphical access (for the end-user) and programming access (for integration with flow solvers). We will assemble all of the methods developed in Phase II into a single, coherent, design-oriented, product-version code with extensive focus on incorporating a parallel processing capability into the software.  The verification & validation plan will follow the industry-standard approach now used by commercial software houses and will include an extensive set of NASA-relevant test cases.

The highest performing HG blanket resulted in ~5 dB reduction in radiated power from an aircraft test panel.  Reductions are broadband with an effective frequency range from approximately 100 to 1000 Hz resulting in decreased vibration and radiated acoustic levels across this range.

In the SBIR Phase I, VPT configured a space station power converter using a VPT standard product hybrid DC-DC converter and EMI filter.  The system met all Space Station power quality requirements including the very challenging input impedance requirement.  Two engineering units were developed and went through a full battery of space station power quality tests NASA-JSC.  The approach also demonstrated a significant size and weight savings.  The phase II workplan includes: (a) selection of three NASA power system applications across different branches for development of detailed power requirements, (b) design and build engineering units of each of these systems using a modular approach of VPT hybrid converters and subject each to engineering tests, (c) make necessary changes to selected VPT standard product hybrid converters in order to meet NASA requirements for design, parts selection, element evaluation, screening, radiation hardness, and qualification, (d) build a qualification unit for one system and subject it to formal qualification tests.",

The MUNSID toolbox augments the current match-point solution approach using the mu-analysis method with identified nonlinear operators.  The procedure calls for a high-fidelity linear aeroelastic model to be tuned quickly with available aeroelastic/aeroservoelastic flight data sets, while block-oriented models are used to highlight the underlying nonlinear structure of the dynamic system.  This framework is capable of accounting for several nonlinearities including those due to aerodynamics, structures, control/actuator, and/or geometry.\n\nSpecifically, this on-line Flutter/LCO predictor can be used to accurately estimate a supercritical LCO case if the global nonlinear dynamic behavior is described throughout a hardening nonlinearity, as well as a more dangerous dynamic behavior, denoted as subcritical LCO, could be developed if a global softening nonlinearity is identified. The devised MUNSID Toolbox will become the flight control engineer's \"every day tool\" to predict on-line Flutter/LCO phenomena. In Phase II, MUNSID will be updated with fast and computationally efficient routines for system modeling, LFT representation, identification of nonlinearity, estimation of uncertainty, and stability analysis. Deliverables include the MUNSID production software including a GUI, a library of S-functions, and the related user manuals.",

In Phase 1 we demonstrated that, compared to bulk PE, this composite approach has significantly improved mechanical properties, excellent electrical conductivity, good Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI) shielding properties, and maintains excellent space radiation shielding properties of PE. We also demonstrated exposure to large doses of high energy actually improved the mechanical properties. In Phase II, the epoxy matrix used in Phase I will be considered along with Cyanate Esters, and Polyimides, As in Phase I, coating the PE fabric and reinforcing the matrix material will be ultra-high strength, highly conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Zyvex's unique and commercially successful CNT processing technology will be adapted to maximize the transfer of the extraordinary mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of CNTs to the composite structures.

Both Ga and Al will be used to take advantage of the alloy enhancing properties that each offers when used in moderation, while avoiding the detrimental issues when using too much of any one element to achieve the optimum bandgap of about 1.45 eV for a single-junction in the space solar spectrum. Furthermore, a recently available novel lightweight, flexible and transparent substrate will be used that was specifically designed to enable high-temperature CIGAS depositions as needed for the highest efficiency TFPV.  TFPV specific power of over 1500 W/kg at the blanket/module level would be achievable The novel transparent substrates would also enable additional power from bifacial visible light collection and lower temperature operation, from improved infra-red (IR) transmission, in addition to enabling TFPV fabrication by low-cost roll-to-roll processing.",

        "abstract": "BioWATCH is a modular ambulatory compact wireless biomedical data acquisition system.  More specifically, it is a data acquisition unit for acquiring signals from biomedical sensors using modular acquisition modules attached to a common data and power bus. Several module slots allow the user to configure the unit by inserting sensor specific modules. The data is then sent real time from the unit over any commercially implemented wireless network including 802.11b/g, WCDMA, GSM, or EDGE. BioWATCH is of a distributed computing hierarchy and has a common data controller on each sensor module.  This innovation allows for the modularity of the device along with the tailored ability to control the cards using a relatively small master processor.  The distributed nature of this system affords the modularity, size, and power consumption that betters the current state-of-the-art in medical ambulatory data acquisition. The current state-of-the-art in biomedical data monitoring is limited in its modularity and relies on centralized computing models.",

In Phase I of this effort we demonstrated that personnel involved in the manufacture, storage, deployment, and triggering of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are likely to be contaminated with trace amounts of explosive residue and showed the effectiveness of using the Nomadics Fido sensor and related sample collection techniques as a useful tool to screen for these individuals.  Under the proposed Phase II effort, Nomadics will continue to improve and refine the Fido sample collection methodology and perform additional tests to enhance confidence in the technology.  Following a series of field trials, we propose to deploy the system with end users in-theatre for operational assessment.  The following activities are proposed:  1) Work with end-users to determine system requirements, 2) Improve the preconcentrator and sample desorber, 3) Explore improved sample collection media, 4) Refine the sampling protocols, 5) Conduct further investigations of advanced forensics applications, 6) Investigate the feasibility of developing a portable personnel screening portal, 7) Develop system documentation, user\u2019s manual, and conops.",

In US Army A04-191 SBIR Phase I, a tethered EC-7 consisting of 2 fiberoptic endo-probes (directed to the eyes) and a single fiberoptic exo-probe (directed away from the EC wearer)was attached to a soldier's helmet and night-vision scopes and coupled to 30-60 Hz as well as 500-1000 Hz micro-cameras for low (e.g. EBD, EBF, PERCLOS)to high (e.g. nystagmoid & saccadic velocity, pupillary latency response) speed oculometric analysis. EC-7 operated well under day and night-time ambient lighting with and without head movement, proving its potential to monitor a soldier's or pilot's eyes under all mobile and stationary environmental conditions and domains. The now U.S.-patented helmet-mounted EC-7 was integrated with EEG, PSG and EKG in a specially designed Drive/Flight Simulator installed in the WSDC for Performance Vigilance Testing (PFT) which will be conducted on sleep-deprived soldiers and civilians in SBIR Phase II. In SBIR Phase II, EC-7 & EC-8, a non-tethered ergonomically-designed wireless version, will be used to develop a complete systems-integrated Composite Oculometric Fatigue Index (COFI)safety-response algorithm within the WSDC Drive/Flight Simulator using a combination of EC-generated oculometric and other physiological (e.g. EEG, PSG,actigraphy) and cognitive performance Drive Simulator Test (i.e. PVT) measures. A parallel study in a dedicated UH-60 flight simulator will be conducted on sleep deprived helicopter pilots. The EC-7/8 COFI will eventually be able to: 1) identify and respond to portential or actual operational performance failure including inattentiveness, drowsiness, micro-sleep intrusions or loss of consciousness due to any cause (e.g. G-LOC, toxic poison exposure, hypoxia, seizures, etc.); 2) transmit oculometric signals to a remotely placed \"black box\" recorder or receiving station; 3) trigger a vibro-tactile seat (e.g. EC Rumble Seat-tm) or warning system; and 4) operate augmentative communication, control & computer programs, electromechanical devices and heads-up or head-mounted displays by means of its EC Eye-Mouse-tm functions for healthy and disabled soldiers, pilots and civilians in hands-free operations.",

To reach this goal, we propose a novel method for ovarian cancer treatment that combines radiotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT).  Under this concept, luminescent nanoparticles with attached photosensitizers are used as a new type of agent for photodynamic therapy.  In the first year, we will focus on the preparation of highly luminescent nanoparticles by considering size and dielectric confinements and on the conjugation of photosensitizers to nanoparticles.  We will characterize the performance of scintillation and long-afterglow nanoparticles in order to ensure the greatest possible chances of success.  These nanoparticles will serve as the foundation for a conjugated PDT system.  At the end of Year 1, we will use the most promising conjugates to demonstrate PDT against ovarian cancer in vitro.  This will constitute a go/no-go point in transitioning to Year 2 and will provide clear demonstration of the feasibility of our PDT nanoparticle system against ovarian cancer.  In Year 2, we will enhance the most promising PDT nanoparticle systems toward more efficient PDT and conduct in vivo testing and toxicity evaluation of these systems.",

The current Nanobreath\u00ae setup was successfully able to provide sensitive and vapor specific detection proportional to a 100 gram TATP IED 5 to 10 meters away and Phase II studies are proposed to improve the sensitivity and specificity resulting in a device that can provide rapid detection of concealed explosives at safe distances (50 meters).

        "abstract": "Impact Technologies, in collaboration Northrop Grumman and Lord Corporation, propose to develop a comprehensive health and usage monitoring system (HUMS) for direct application on the Fire Scout UAV selected as the Class IV UAV for the Army\u2019s FCS.   After several meetings between Impact, Boeing and Northrop Grumman, the Fire Scout UAV has been identified as the Army platform with the greatest need for prognostic and health management (PHM) capabilities and will replace the currently limited RTB (rotor track and balance) system.  Specifically addressing this need by NG and Boeing, the Impact team will re-design and deploy an innovative 3-lb HUMS unit and fully demonstrate the capabilities on a scheduled Fire Scout flight test with Northrop Grumman. This will include embedding real-time HUMS algorithms for anomaly detection, fault classification and prediction into a newly designed COTS, aerospace-certified digital signal processing (DSP) based platform.   Based on an analysis of the common and critical UAV subsystems, vital parameters related to UAV performance and mechanical health will be monitored to address condition-based maintenance activities that are required to ensure UAV mission success.  Key UAV mechanical systems including the engine and drive train, along with a core RTB capability, will act as the core of the HUMS-UAV system development for this next phase of the program.  A strong endorsement letter from NG is attached that highlights the need for this program in order to deliver the required Army PHM capability to the Fire Scout.     The proposed COTS-based HUMS system is expected to improve UAV mission success rates and positively impact total ownership costs.  The proposed Phase II development program includes the innovative 3-pound hardware design specifically addressing the needs of the Northrop Grumman Fire Scout UAV, but will be designed to be configurable to other UAV platforms.  This work will leverage Impact's existing expertise in integrated HUMS and vehicle prognostic health management (IVHM) systems, Lord\u2019s expertise in flight-qualified electronics hardware and Northrop Grumman\u2019s vehicle design expertise.",

We expect to improve upon these results during the Phase II project.  Specifically, we will integrate our novel approach with an ultra-precision machine tool to further improve the surface quality of the machined part.  We will provide superior performance control using a model-based adaptive controller to precisely control the temperature of the ceramic material near the cutting edge.  In doing so, we will create a machined surface that is free of any surface or subsurface damage and that is prepared for optical finishing.  The high material removal rate enabled by our innovation allows much higher sintered part tolerances compared to current finishing options; thus, our innovation will have indirect benefits by reducing the cost to sinter the near-net shape blank.

During armed conflict, bone trauma from penetrating missiles is similarly significant, as the experience in the Persian Gulf and Croatia has shown.  Anti-personnel mines and improvised explosive devices inflict considerable hard tissue damage in the feet and legs, resulting in substantial bone loss in these highly contaminated wounds. The current standard of care requires two procedures, one to aggressively treat the infection and a second to repair the bone.

In this program, we propose to test a keratin bioceramic antibiotic putty that provides osteoconductivity, osteoinductivity, and controlled antibiotic release.  This putty, comprised of a keratin hydrogel with ceramic filler, will incorporate controlled and sustained antibiotic release.

REX is based on POC\u2019s X-ray lens, which focuses backscattering photons from inspected objects.  It will operate in the energy range from 60 to 120 keV, detecting IEDs or land mines even through metal and soil, and discriminating them from similar objects.  REX directly addresses the Marine Corps requirement for a safe and compact system that can be mounted on a small remotely operated vehicle (ROV). REX will examine suspect roadside objects from all directions, imaging potential IEDs and land mines.  In Phase I POC experimentally demonstrated real-time X-ray imaging of metal and plastic objects through 75 mil steel or 1 in. of soil.  In Phase II a fully operational prototype compatible with small ROVs will be designed, assembled, and tested in the laboratory and at Navy facilities.  The prototype will be robust, teleoperated from 100 ft., penetrate all obstacles including 4-5 in. of soil and 1.8 mm metal walls, consume ",

        "abstract": "There is a need to complement the current Gen III image intensifier imaging system with a solid-state low light level camera that is better optimized for remote viewing applications.  A silicon-based solution is an ideal candidate for low light imaging because of its high quantum efficiency, low dark current, and excellent uniformity.  However, to meet performance requirements under overcast starlight conditions with minimum or no cooling, the total noise of a conventional CCD or CMOS camera is prohibitive.  A hybrid focal plane with CCD retina coupled to a CMOS readout integrated circuit has been shown to have sufficiently low noise so as to offer a true solid-state night vision capability.   In order to improve its utility as a night imaging sensor, the CCD must be designed to eliminate smear, which is the result of the sensor being illuminated during image readout.  To achieve this performance, we will design a high performance, split-frame interline transfer (split FIT) CCD imager that will achieve 10pA/cm2 dark current and less than 2 electrons readout noise per pixel per frame at room temperature.  The split FIT CCD architecture is absolutely necessary for low smear performance.",

        "abstract": "Aircraft noise abatement, particularly in the near vicinity of airports, is a serious and expensive problem for both military and civilian air fleets.  Previous noise abatement efforts such as engine replacement, structural modifications, or the addition of a Hushkit, have yielded mixed results.  These methods are not particularly effective at reducing noise and most also adversely impact the performance capabilities of the aircraft.  With the costs of noise abatement climbing, it is imperative that a cost-effective solution to the jet noise problem be developed.  Optimally, the solution would be effective for development aircraft and could be incorporated into the current fleet.  Foster-Miller\u2019s innovative Active Noise Cancellation System (ANCS) is a novel and cost-effective solution to this challenging problem.  Our ANCS controls inlet engine noise over a broad band of frequencies in a narrow and adaptable geometric range of the omni-directional source.  The narrow geometric location of the ANCS device is cost-effective and directly affects the particular noise source, which directionally impacts civilian areas around the airfield on takeoff.  In Phase I, we performed experiments and analyses validating the principles supporting our concept.  Herein, we propose the development and testing of a scaled, full-functional ANCS for inlet aircraft engine noise. (P-040436)",

Given this TP, ATDOS will optimize the utilization of all available anti-torpedo sensors, especially any active sensors, using non-Gaussian optimization algorithms.  Although our initial focus will be on generating the torpedo defense TP and optimizing sensor utilization, in Phase III we may potentially optimize weapon employment as well.  This use of advanced data fusion and optimization algorithms is critical for the success of an anti-torpedo system, since even the new passive and active sensors and their associated signal processing algorithms that are currently being developed will produce large numbers of both persistent false contacts (primarily from contacts on surface ships, although air targets could also be detected) and non-persistent false contacts.  Thus it is critical to develop a sophisticated data fusion system that can process all of the available information concerning targets of interest, taking advantage of all of the detection and non-detection information produced by passive acoustic, active acoustic, and non-acoustic sensors.",

The Phase I project established the technical and financial viability of the Laser/Gas Metal Arc Welding (LGMAW) process to manufacture flat plate blankets ready for further stiffening.  A major task in Phase II is the completion of a prototype system to be used in shipyards.  In addition, Phase II activities will encompass the design and construction of a manufacturing system for lightweight sandwich panels for advanced performance in combatant and other vessels. Phase I economic analysis predicted a two-year payback for a laser-based butt welding system, and an increase to throughput of nearly 40%.  Interest in the system is strong with US major shipyards, since plate butt welding is today a major cost-driver in shipbuilding. Equally, structural sandwich panels have been analyzed for a wide variety of trial applications, showing a weight advantage of up to 50% in total structural weight  compared to beam-stiffened plate structures.  However, prior efforts have not resulted in commercialization, due to high manufacturing costs.  This project will develop methodologies leading to significant cost reductions.",

        "abstract": "Commercial and government electromagnetic (EM) emission and immunity standards require testing over the frequency interval 10 kHz to 18 GHz. Currently, equipment must be tested in two or more test facilities to satisfy this requirement. The objective of the effort is the design of a relatively low cost EM test facility that has the ability to cover the full frequency interval. The full coverage facility design combines a low frequency test method with a high frequency test method. The Phase I effort showed that this design is practical except at frequencies where the transition from the low frequency method to the high frequency method occurs. This Phase II effort resolves the transition deficiency. The approach focuses on understanding the low frequency EM response of shielded enclosures and devises techniques for bridging the transition from the low frequency to high frequency methods. Also, the new test and analysis techniques to be developed during the conduct of the proposed investigation will have significant applications to other EM related problems. They can be used to quantify the EM induced response of electronics located in missiles and aircraft. This capability is required to assess the performance of systems illuminated by high-level EM environments.",

Earlier designs could not be employed in many practical applications due to their restrictive specifications (high cost and low accuracy). Since 1995, the technical staff of VeNIS Technologies has been actively developing a design methodology for producing just such   an accurate and inexpensive INS, based on distributed accelerometers in combination with small-size and low-cost gyros. Based on this methodology, several prototypes of inexpensive integrated gyros (i-   gyros) and i-gyro-based INS have been designed and tested. Tests of those prototypes have confirmed the validity of the proposed design methodology. The work already completed on this INS will lead to the development of a DISTANT (distributed inertial sensor tactical navigation tool). Phase I of this SBIR will concentrate on the development of virtual gyroscopes of the first and second type, on the combination of virtual gyros with small-size, low-cost gyroscopes and on the design of the resulting INS. Computer modeling of the proposed methods, as well as construction of prototypes and subsequent hardware testing are also among the proposed goals of Phase I. (Phase I abstract)",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultimate objective of this proposed program is the commercialization of a neonate ventricular assist device (VAD). Although VADs, both implantable and paracorporeal, have become an important surgical option for adult patients with myocardial failure unresponsive to less aggressive therapy, no VADs are commercially available for short-term use in small infants who are critically ill with heart failure. This is in spite of the fact that most cases for cardiac support via extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are for infants following complex surgical reconstructions for congenital defects.         An aggressive development schedule for a pediatric VAD is proposed. The necessary characterization of the VAD will be completed for a submission to the FDA for approval as a humanitarian use device (HUD). The clinical indication sought for the device will be for short-term use to bridge to recovery following complex surgical reconstruction for congenital defects. Specifically, the target population is neonates with a single functional ventricle anatomy undergoing life saving surgery. A significant fraction of these patients either have difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, or have cardiac failure after coming off bypass requiring the use of high levels of inotropes. The VAD is a pericardial wrap that contracts around the ventricle to provide cardiac support. The use of a short term, minimally invasive VAD should have a major benefit for these weakened patients.         The device developed here will be implanted either at the time of surgery, or on an emergent basis for cardiac rescue and assist. The device developed will fill a large hole in the current public health care system. Pediatric VADs for the neonate population are neither currently available nor being developed for clinical use, despite this patient population having the highest need. The current technology used for this patient population, ECMO has an associated high morbidity. Funding the development of the neonate VAD will follow recent federal guidelines related to orphan product development of necessary medical devices with relatively small market potential. ABIOMED, as a leader in cardiac assist, will provide the technical expertise to develop the needed device.",

Due to the fragmentation of the current health care system and lack of funding, no one single entity is responsible for providing or coordinating training and support for family caregivers. Family caregivers have difficulty getting to trainings and classes that would greatly benefit them and their ability to be a better caregiver because they have no one to relieve them from giving care while still maintaining other commitments. A portable health care support system that provides both recorded audio and picture-based instructions for each step in a home health care procedure could be a significant aid to alleviating this problem by providing a consistent, central source of information on the services provided to each individual. Very recently new computer devices, such as Tablet PCs, have been introduced that can provide powerful, portable computer systems for use in human service settings. Tablet PCs are fully functional PCs running a version of the Windows XP operating system, but with special features designed for portable use. The entire system is approximately the size of a notebook and users interact with the system through the touch screen display, rather than having to use a mouse or keyboard. These devices are lightweight, portable and can be used to present detailed instructions to family members on how to accomplish health care activities correctly while in the home. In Phase I of this project, we demonstrated the technical merit and feasibility of HomeCare Assistant for making it easier for family caregivers to perform health care services and keep track of the services that have been provided. The pilot study results showed significant reduction in caregiver stress for eight participating families as compared to eight control group subjects which received no experimental implementation (P",

Desktop network interface throughput must correspond to the bandwidth available on current high performance networks.  To meet these next-generation networking goals, this effort seeks to develop a novel implementation of a high-speed data path suitable for workstation throughputs of 10 gigabits per second and beyond. It incorporates industry-standard, high-speed interfaces into a modified workstation architecture and integrates a rapid-execution protocol stack with a middleware solution.  In Phase I, the feasibility of the modified network-centric workstation architecture was proven, the performance of the PCI Express interconnect was verified, and the validity of an FPGA-based approach was confirmed. It was shown that this approach had far-reaching potential for next-generation networking needs.  In the Phase II project, a prototype network interface controller will be developed and the workstation architecture will be substantially enhanced to provide previously unrealizable throughput to the end-user. The prototype will focus on reconfigurability, to provide a powerful and versatile solution for a variety of next-generation networking needs.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The proposed system will greatly enhance tera-scale collaboration and applications which require real-time distributed processing. This approach scales well from local to wide area networks, making it ideal for high-performance LANs and SANs, grid computing applications, and wide-area ultra high speed networks.

        "abstract": "The removal of all particles over a desired micron-scale size threshold from a powder sample is critical to the development of fine-filament, powder-in-tube superconducting wires, for which the final filament size is limited by the largest particles in the precursor powder filling.  This project will develop a particle-removal technology that disperses the powder in an aerosol suspension and then passes the dispersed powder through a Stokes-flow geometry, in which the powder particles are separated.  The basic approach has been used for several decades for size classification, but never for separation of bulk quantities of powder.  In previous work, a slot-geometry impactor was developed and evaluated for bulk separation applications.  Phase I improved the earlier process in three respects:  (1) dry nitrogen gas was used as the buffer gas rather than air, in order to eliminate contamination of the precursor powders; (2) a fluidized-bed dispersal system was developed to increase mass loading without aggregation; and (3) a boundary-sheet flow of powder-free gas was introduced along the walls of the impactor structure, in order to suppress particle wall interactions that limit large mass loadings.  In Phase II, an electron-beam-assisted precipitator will be developed to remove the separated fines from the aerosol flow.  The present pressurized inert-gas flow will be converted into a recirculating closed-circuit flow.  The slot impactor vane structure will be rebuilt with 1-m-long vanes, and manifolds for supply, exhaust, and boundary flow along the vane structure will be pressure-equalized to assure a uniform Stokes threshold along the extended geometry.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In addition to high-performance superconductors, the technology also should be applicable to the separation of particles used in specialty sintered metal and ceramic materials for aerospace and defense, and in consumer products.  For ceramics, large particles cause stress concentrations, which cause brittle fracture.  For sunscreen, powders utilize Ti2O3, the most effective UV absorber; however, Ti2O3 is also the pigment for white paint, and makes skin appear pasty.  By reducing particle size, the powder becomes invisible, while retaining its UV protection capability",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer continues to be a significant health problem, both domestically and worldwide. Numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of transperineal prostate brachytherapy in the therapy of prostate cancer. The success of brachytherapy chiefly depends on our ability to intra-operatively tailor the radiation dose to the patient's individual anatomy. Thus the objective of this research is to design, develop, and clinically test a method for intra-operative localization of the implanted seeds in relation to the prostate, to allow for intra-operative dosimetric optimization and exit dosimetry. Brachytherapy is predominantly performed with transrectal ultrasound guidance, which provides adequate real-time visualization of soft tissue anatomy, but does not show the implanted seeds. To overcome this problem, we propose registration of ultrasound to intra-operative C-arm fluoroscopy, where the implanted seeds will be reconstructed from fluoroscopy and superimposed on ultrasound. In particular, we will: (1) Design a system and workflow that is consistent with contemporary practice of prostate brachytherapy. (2) Develop optimized mathematical algorithms for reconstruction of seed implants from C-arm fluoroscopy images, spatial registration of fluoroscopy and ultrasound imaging. (3) Integrate the algorithms with an existing commercial prostate brachytherapy system and implant optimization methods. (4) Conduct Clinical System Performance Evaluation Trial on human patients. We have established the technical feasibility of this approach in a Phase-1 SBIR research grant. We are requesting Phase-2 support to develop a clinical-grade system and evaluate its technical performance on human patients. The resulting system will withstand the scrutiny of subsequent FDA approval and enter wide-spread clinical use via commercial dispersion.",

        "abstract": "Compact laser systems are needed to interrogate possible sites of nuclear proliferation that, for strategic or political reasons, cannot be sampled and inspected directly.  This laser system would be used with a nonlinear optical wavelength converter for remote spectroscopic analysis of effluents from suspected sites.  This project will develop an advanced laser system that will be compact, lightweight, efficient, and suitable for deployment on a UAV.  The laser system will be based on Yb:S-FAP, a relatively novel laser material with an upper state lifetime more than five times longer than Nd:YAG.  For this particular application, the increased lifetime translates into a fivefold reduction in the number of pump diodes, leading to a more cost-effective and compact laser system.  In Phase I, a full-scale, diode-pumped, Yb:S-FAP gain module was designed, fabricated, and tested.  The module provided an output over 400 mJ in long-pulse quasi-cw operation as an oscillator, and a single-pass small signal gain of Go = 7.6 (gol = 2 nepers) in an amplifier configuration.  A detailed analysis, along with the experimental results, showed that the approach was likely to meet the 200 mJ/pulse energy requirement.  In Phase II, Yb:S-FAP slabs will be procured, and the system will be built and tested.  Finally, the laser system will be configured into a rugged package suitable for airborne deployment.   Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:   Diode pumped solid-state lasers are used extensively in materials processing and other high value commercial applications.  However, to date, these lasers have not achieved significant market penetration in high pulse energy (> 100 mJ) laser markets currently dominated by excimer and lamp pumped solid-state lasers.  Despite their significant advantages, the use of diode pumped solid state lasers has been limited by the high cost of the diode laser pump sources.  By using Yb:S-FAP, the diode cost (the main cost driver in high pulse energy systems) should be reduced by a factor of 4 to 5, compared with an Nd:YAG laser, resulting in a cost-effective solution for a wide range of commercial applications.",

Optical stimulation can induce spatially precise, highly controlled and artifact-free action potentials, generated using energies well below tissue ablation threshold, presenting a paradigm shift in neural activation that has major implications to clinical neural stimulation as well as fundamental neurophysiology and neuroscience. This new modality opens the door to such possibilities as high resolution brain mapping and nerve conduction studies as well as high spatial selectivity in neural resection. While optical stimulation has been validated as a viable method for neural activation, to find its way to practical utility and clinical use, a simple, user friendly, portable, reliable and low cost device must be developed. In this phase 2 proposal, Aculight, in collaboration with Vanderbilt University, Northwestern University, and Washington State University plan to develop an Aculight portable optical stimulator (APOS) for use as a research device for nerve stimulation. The first aim is to develop a prototype APOS with a fiber probe. The second aim is to validate the prototype APOS in peripheral nerve studies. The third aim is to update and evaluate the APOS for facial and Vagal nerve stimulation, cochlear nerve stimulation, and brain slice stimulation. The fourth and final aim is to validate the safety and efficacy of TONS in a clinical setting using the APOS prototype. At the end of this grant period we expect to show the safety and efficacy of an APOS for use in a research setting that will be ready for pre-production qualification testing. Development of an optical brain/nerve stimulator Project Narrative Transient Optical Nerve Stimulation (TONS) provides a new method for scientists to further research and clinical applications involving neural tissue.

This will be achieved by building a system designed to work with x-ray compound refractive lenses. Research and development efforts will concentrate on the x-ray source, lens and detector as well as the construction of a prototype to be used and evaluated at the Orthopaedic Research Laboratories of the University of Michigan. Experiments during the first phase of the proposed work demonstrated the utility of the system and a resolution of 1 fm. A new source will be implemented to provide an order of magnitude more intense, spatially uniform x-ray output over a large area with proper angular and spectral filtering. The aperture of the lenses will be enlarged to increase throughput, decreasing imaging times. A high-resolution imaging x-ray detector will be assembled from available technology. The end-product of the proposed research will be a table-top computerized tomographic imaging system for use in research laboratories using small animal disease models with per frame exposure times of a few seconds. A CT system will be built in Phase II capable of 100 nm resolution, and the technology may eventually achieve 20 nm resolution. This technology will have the ability to image large volumes of tissue and even entire organisms at ultra-fine resolutions, which will generate exciting images of development and disease not possible by current methods. This system can be used for both in-vivo imaging of small animals and ex-vivo imaging of microscopic biological samples. The in-vivo resolution is limited by allowed dose, while sample imaging is limited by the system's capabilities. Given that the proposed technology is x-ray-based, the most immediate impact this technology will be in the morphological evaluation of radiodense tissues, such as calcified and ossified material. Additionally, this technology can potentially be used to interrogate compartments which contain exogenously administered radiodense contrast media, or for microscopic non-invasive imaging such as genetic phenotyping in insects such as Drosophila melanogaster. The nanometer scale CT system resulting from this project should advance research into a wide range of disease entities that present a significant burden to society, including cancer, heart disease, osteoporosis and a wide range of bone disorders.

The desired outcome will be the identification of a therapeutic candidate to replace theophylline, a non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist that is effective in treating asthma, but limited by side effects, primarily insomnia, mediated by blockade the A1AR in the brain. This proposal continues the collaboration between a biotechnology company, Adenosine Therapeutics, LLC (ATL) located in Charlottesville, VA and the University of Virginia laboratory of Joel Linden, PhD, an expert in the study of adenosine receptors. The now completed Phase I SBIR proposal was predicated on the hypothesis that antagonists of the A2B adenosine receptor (A2BAR) inhibit allergen-mediated activation of mast cells. This was based on the observation that selective A2B blockers such as our proprietary compound, MRS1754, inhibit adenosine-mediated activation of certain mast cell lines such as canine BR and human HMC-1 mast-like cells. In Phase I we optimized procedures for preparing purified human lung mast cells and we showed that these cells have functional A2BARs that facilitate allergen-mediated degranulation. MRS174 is not a therapeutic candidate since it has very low aqueous solubility and poor bioavailability. Chemists at Adenosine Therapeutics, headed by the Principal Investigator of the proposal, Robert Thompson, Ph.D., have now succeeded in synthesizing a new family of proprietary selective A2BAR blockers that are bioavailable and therapeutic candidates. One of the new compounds (ATL829) has been tested in allergic sheep and shown to reduce by > 50% adenosine mediated bronchospasm. The primary goal of this Phase II SBIR application is to identify an A2BR antagonist therapeutic candidate for the treatment of asthma that is orally available, potent, and efficacious in a sheep asthma model. We propose to develop procedure for the large scale synthesis of clinical candidates (Aim 1), screen A2BAR therapeutic candidates for activity on human mast cells (Aim 2) and evaluate oral activity of the test compounds in sheep (Aim 3). We will evaluate three drug candidates in sheep asthma models to identify an optimal lead therapeutic candidate and one backup compound (Aim 4). Sheep studies will be done on a contractual basis by Dr. William Abraham at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, Florida. These objectives directly relate to the mission of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is to conduct and support basic and applied research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases, by targeting drug development for asthma, for which current therapies are not ideal for patient care. The goal of this project is to develop improved drugs for the treatment of Asthma, a disease that affects millions of Americans. Exciting new preliminary data in sheep establishes the effectiveness of a new proprietary class of A2B adenosine receptor antagonists. Current therapies are plagued by limited efficacy, tachyphylaxis, or adverse side effects.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is the most common disorder observed in the practice of sleep medicine and is responsible for more mortality and morbidity than any other sleep disorder. OSA causes daytime drowsiness, and has been associated with hypertension, increased risk of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias and stroke. Untreated OSA patients are 3- 7 times more likely to be involved in industrial and motor vehicle accidents and have demonstrably slower reaction times and impaired performance on tests of vigilance, memory and executive functions. Further, the cumulative 8-year mortality has been calculated as high as 37% for patients with an RDI >20. The gold standard for the diagnosis of OSA is attended, overnight laboratory polysomnography (PSG). Advanced Brain Monitoring, Inc. designed the Apnea Risk Evaluation System (ARES) as a simplified OSA diagnostic alternative to PSG. The ARES incorporates existing knowledge on sleep-disordered breathing into an easy-to-apply system that uniquely combines physiological recordings acquired during sleep with anthropomorphic and clinical information obtained from a standardized questionnaire. Significant improvements in the ARES were accomplished in Phase II and scientific validity was demonstrated in the largest U.S. study conducted to-date (n=187) comparing laboratory PSG to unattended limited-channel in-home studies. However, significant barriers to successful commercialization of the ARES remain. To address these issues, the competing continuation proposes to modify the ARES to acquire additional signals, and make changes that will increase the system's ease-of-use for patients and clients. Clinical studies of 60 patients referred for PSG will be conducted to validate improvements to the ARES Unicorder, and will also provide additional direct comparisons to PSG. A multi-stage regulatory strategy is proposed to complete the ARES FDA clearance.         Although characterized over 40 years ago, Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) has only recently gained recognition as one of the world's most prevalent, undiagnosed disorders, and due to associated morbidity has been identified as a major public health concern. Despite this growing evidence that untreated OSA threatens public health, safety and productivity, recent estimates reveal that 93% of women and 82% of men with moderate to severe OSA remain undiagnosed. This failure to identify and treat OSA is estimated to cost $3.4 billion in additional medical costs per year in the U.S., resulting from increased physician visits, hospital stays and use of medications for hypertension and cardiovascular disease among untreated OSA patients. A lack of knowledge regarding OSA and other sleep disorders among primary care physicians and the general public in combination with limited access to and cost of overnight sleep studies has resulted in the current failure to diagnose and treat the majority of patients suffering from OSA.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this SBIR Phase II application is to continue the development and evaluation of a novel device designed to increase the efficiency of manual CPR. This hand-held lightweight device, termed the ErgoPad, helps to transform the thorax into a bellows during CPR, thereby enabling the rescuer to manually perform active compression decompression (ACD) CPR. The combination of ACD CPR and the inspiratory impedance threshold device (ITD) quadruples blood flow to the heart and brain compared with manual CPR alone. The ITD was invented by the applicant and recently commercialized. The ErgoPad and ITD technologies work synergistically to decrease the decompression phase intrathoracic pressure, creating a vacuum within the thorax relative to the rest of the body, thereby a) enhancing blood return to the thorax, b) enhancing blood return to the brain, c) providing real-time feedback to rescuers to maintain high quality CPR, and d) improving overall CPR efficiency. The ErgoPad is intended for home and professional rescuer use to increase the chances for meaningful survival after cardiac arrest. The ErgoPad has been shown in Phase I studies to be significantly better than the current suction cup version of the ACD CPR device as it is lighter in weight, adheres better to the chest, allows the rescuer's hands to be closer to the chest, does not wobble and thereby transfers kinetic energy more efficiently, is easier to use, has a more user-friendly gauge to guide compressions and decompressions, requires less work, has a larger compression surface to optimize dispersion of compression forces, is easier to store in a small box with a defibrillator, and is more amenable to adapt to a skin electrode for physiological monitoring or defibrillation. Phase I proof of concept studies also demonstrated that the combination of the ErgoPad and ITD increased neurologically intact survival in a well established porcine model of cardiac arrest, in which we extended arrest without CPR time to 8.5 minutes and resuscitated >90% of the animals. The SBIR Phase II research is primarily intended to further develop the ErgoPad and ITD combination by a) adding several key features including audio and visual cues to guide rescuers on the optimal performance of CPR so that it can be easily implemented into the home and ambulance setting, b) creating and evaluating an easy to understand training program for the lay rescuer, and c) measuring the clinical performance of the ErgoPad in patients in cardiac arrest. Once Phase II studies are completed, the ErgoPad and ITD will be ready for commercialization into the home and professional markets. This SBIR Phase 2 research is primarily intended to further develop a manual active compression decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ACD CPR) device that can be easily used by lay and professional rescuers so that it can be implemented into the home and ambulance setting, to create and evaluate an easy to understand training program for the lay rescuer, and to measure device performance in patients in cardiac arrest. If this program is successful, the new resuscitation system has the potential to resuscitate approximately 50,000 more patients of the 400,000 sudden cardiac deaths that occur outside the hospital each year in the United States. This estimation does not take into account a nearly equal number of patients with sudden cardiac death that occur in-hospital each year. With the increasing trend of vital life saving technologies such as external defibrillators being bought for home use, this new resuscitation system is an ideal technology for the lay rescuer to use at home.",

These statistics can provide valuable insights for supporting critical decisions in store layout design, merchandising, marketing, and customer service. Further, since it is automated, video mining can become a tool for monitoring the impact of all customer-facing elements in a store. The Phase II research will continue in cooperation with the proposing company's partners and customers, while addressing the remaining challenges for video mining. The proposed tasks include robust person detection, tracking people across multiple cameras, modeling and recognizing complex shopping behavior involving shopping groups and sales associates. The approach will be to use a variety of computer vision and statistical learning techniques under the constraints of a typical retail environment. Retail enterprises today operate in a hyper-competitive environment characterized by blurring categories, eroding market shares and fickle, but more demanding customers. These challenges have prompted retailers to adopt customer-centered strategies focused on uncovering and matching the needs of customers to gain (retain) market share. These strategies rely heavily on obtaining deeper insights into shopper behavior. Current methods (human observation and manual video indexing) for analyzing shopper behavior are limited in their scope while being expensive and time-consuming. On the contrary, the shopper insights gained from the proposed video mining platform will enable more informed decision-making leading to improvements in retail productivity and business process optimization. The proposing company has plans to immediately incorporate the outcome of the SBIR research into its retail product line.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human genome contains at least 30,000 unique open reading frames that may yield >100,000 polypeptide products. These products assemble into more than a million biologically relevant structures or proteins of interest per organism. Crystallization and X-ray diffraction of these proteins is routinely performed to determine their 3D structure which needs to be understood for any effective protein engineering, rational drug design, or controlled drug delivery. Crystal structures of proteins such as enzymes, ribosomal proteins, bacterial toxins, hormones, and receptors are essential to understand important physiological processes and also to understand and treat diseases caused by microorganisms. Recent antiviral drugs against AIDS are enzyme inhibitors, and their design was based on the detailed protein-drug interactions provided by crystal structures of the enzymes with the drugs, based on structure-activity relationships.         In order to obtain a protein crystal, large amounts of protein need to be screened to find favorable conditions for crystallization but unfortunately many interesting proteins are very expensive or sometimes even difficult to express in large quantities. And in cases where native proteins are desirable to be crystallized, they could be available in extremely limited quantities. The equipment currently used for screening and optimization of crystallization conditions is very expensive and uses large amounts of precious proteins.         In phase I, we have successfully demonstrated a protein crystallization lab-on-a-chip using 25 nanoliter protein droplets of 3 proteins viz., lysozyme, glucose isomerase, and proteinase K. Such low volumes of protein per screening condition translate to significant cost savings in the upstream protein expression and purification. During phase I, we resolved a number of research issues to demonstrate the feasibility of performing crystallization screening on a digital microfluidic chip while in Phase II we will build on those results to: develop a screening chip that requires only 1 drop of protein to screen against 384 coarse grid reagents and develop an optimization chip which will programmably and automatically set up 96 fine grid conditions on-chip from just 5 reservoirs of salt, precipitant, buffer, water, and protein. Our instrument and disposable chips would be affordable even for an individual investigator.         Crystal structures of proteins such as enzymes, ribosomal proteins, bacterial toxins, hormones, and receptors are essential to understand important physiological processes. This structural information will help reveal the roles that proteins play in health and disease and will help rational design of new medicines. Recent antiviral drugs against AIDS are enzyme inhibitors, and their design was based on the detailed protein-drug interactions provided by crystal structures of the enzymes with the drugs, based on structure-activity relationships.",

Conventional laboratory analysis of blood samples while in the field (accidents, disasters, battlefield, etc.) is impractical. A handheld, automated, inexpensive, multi-analyte and multiplexed blood chemistry analyzer will help reduce the blood analysis volume from milliliters to nanoliters, reduce the need for further transfusions, and make the analyzer available at the point-of-care (clinics, operating & emergency rooms, intensive care units, and in the field). In Phase I, we have successfully demonstrated a digital microfluidic platform for manipulation of nanoliter-sized droplets of reagents and sample for dispensing from on-chip reservoirs, high speed transport, mixing, splitting and dilution, and colorimetric measurement of glucose, lactate, and creatinine. In phase II, a disposable lab-on-a-chip for blood chemistry will be developed where 0.5 microliters of human blood will be the input to the digital microfluidic system and it outputs the measurements of metabolites, proteins, electrolytes, gases, hematocrit, and enzymes in a completely automated fashion.",

Current wireless headstages are too heavy for mice. The proposed headstage will advance the state-of-the-art in wireless ambulatory animal neurological monitoring by enabling mouse studies, and, thus, filling an important marketplace void. It will also enable new neurological research. Because mice are genetically manipulable, they accommodate scientific experiments that are unavailable in other species, such as rats. This device will support detailed animal neurological studies, which support numerous research areas including Alzheimer's, Huntington's disease, and epilepsy. A digital wireless headstage for mice has only recently been made possible due to developments in very low power, high data rate, wireless radios. A major US semiconductor manufacturer has recently been developing high data rate radio technology for implantable devices and hearing aids requiring minimal external components and low power (~1mW). The power consumption is more than an order of magnitude lower than other wireless solutions, such as Bluetooth, which has been proposed for rat headstages. This low power radio technology is necessary to achieve a digital wireless headstage while meeting the strict low weight requirements of headstages for mice. The phase II will fabricate a custom IC, the hybrid circuit board and the molded plastic package to productize the device.

Our research develops new technology using ground-penetrating radar to image groundwater contaminant plumes underground, and monitor them in time-lapse mode as they undergo natural biodegradation or are cleaned up by a remediation process.  Our research enables engineers to monitor the effectiveness of the clean-up operation in real time, make adjustments to the remediation process if needed, and locate any residual contaminants before leaving the site.  We performed a technical feasibility study to predict whether our technology would be able to image groundwater contaminants for realistic properties of rocks, water, contaminants, and radar noise conditions.  We developed prototype methods and software algorithms to process time-lapse radar data to produce images and quantitative estimations of the contaminant saturation distributions underground, with uncertainty analysis.  Based on the successful results of our Phase I technical feasibility study, in Phase II we plan to perform a field trial of our technology at a DOE/DOD contaminant site undergoing active biodegradation or remediation clean-up of groundwater contaminants.

The algorithms were evaluated using asymptotic analysis, Monte Carlo experiments, and deployment in a testbed.  Phase II will:  (1) develop statistical meth\u00adods for an efficient, anomaly-\u00adbased local detector with a low false alarm rate, as well as a hybrid anomaly-\u00adsignature local detector with profiling capability; (2) develop an architecture for the distributed deployment of detectors, along with fusion algorithms to combine outputs for network-\u00adlevel detections; (3) design and implement sensor and fusion nodes using commercial-\u00adoff-\u00adthe-\u00adshelf technologies; and (4) develop a laboratory testbed to support implementation and testing.   Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new intrusion detection system should be of particular relevance to DOE networks that support large-\u00adscale science applications.  Advantages over existing systems include an increased probability of detecting unknown attacks, and a lower false alarm rate and detection time",

This portable x-ray needle, is intended for delivery of low energy, high RBE radiation directly to the tumour beds and is considered to be a viable alternative to radioactive sources used in the High Dose Rate Brachytherapy. The main advantages of AXT's x-ray device include such features as a controllable on/off mode, exceptional stability of the produced radiation, adjustable dose rate, and the ability to function in a conventional operating room with almost no radiological exposure to staff. The initial application of the device is the accelerated partial breast irradiation. The main goal of the Phase II project is to design, build and test a new model of the x-ray needle with an elevated dose rate of the produced radiation (1Gy/min at 10mm in tissue). Other goals include the development of low-energy (8-18 keV) dosimetry protocols and a treatment planning approach involving the x-ray needle. To achieve the stated goals the following specific aims of the project have to be fulfilled. The specific aims of the project are: (i) design, build and test an ellipsoidal and Johansson type concentrators fabricated from a Highly Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite, (2) incorporate the concentrators into an optical collimator, (3) integrate the collimators into an x-ray needle, (4) perform measurements of dose rate and dose rate spatial distribution (isodose), (5) design and build a balloon applicator and test it jointed with an x-ray needle, (6) install an x-ray needle device in a conventional movable arm. The potential market for such device is significant. It is estimated that more than 275,000 women in the United States are annually diagnosed with breast cancer and about 50% of them are treated with radiotherapy. Development of the new model of AXT's insertable x-ray device offers hope and promise for cure and improvement to the quality of life for many affected people.",

PRSs are inhaled drugs that increase lung recoil by safely altering the surface tension properties of native lung surfactant. Unlike existing medical therapies for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, PRS is the only medical therapy designed specifically to treat emphysema by improving lung recoil and decreasing hyperinflation. During Phase I SBIR funding (9/2004 to 3/2005), Aeris identified two PRS formulations that favorably alter lung surfactant function in vitro, and effectively increase lung recoil in emphysema models in vivo. The best of these preparations has been selected for product development. Dose-response and dose delivery studies demonstrate that PRSs can be effectively delivered to the lung using conventional nebulizer systems. Repeat dosing studies confirm the safety of PRS administration, out to two weeks. GMP sources of raw materials for manufacturing PRS have been identified, and a manufacturing protocol, clinical plan, and regulatory strategy have been developed for advancing this product into clinical testing.

Detailed chemical characterization of ambient aerosol particles is necessary in order to fully understand the physical and chemical processes underlying the formation and transformation of aerosol particles in the atmosphere.  However, standard analytical methods for detailed aerosol chemical speciation require long sampling times, are subject to artifacts during aerosol collection and storage, and are labor intensive.  This project will develop an Aerosol Collector Module and demonstrate its feasibility for routine measurements of ambient and laboratory-generated aerosols in near real time with high time resolution (< 1 hour averages), and without artifacts due to filter sampling and storage.  Phase I designed and assembled the aerosol collection chamber, connected it to an existing vacuum chamber, and prepared an interface to analytical instruments.  Control hardware and software were designed and implemented.  Laboratory-generated organic particles were used to evaluate the concept.  During Phase II, an integrated, stand-alone Aerosol Collector Module will be developed.  Further improvements to the hardware will improve sensitivity and linearity.  A scheme to obtain particle size measurements will be implemented.  Finally, the performance of the Aerosol Collector Module will be demonstrated in field measurements of ambient aerosol particles.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The Aerosol Collector Module should provide a universal interface for aerosol collection and concentration and should easily be adapted to existing analytical techniques and new spectrometric techniques. The instrument should be ideal for the on-line characterization of airborne particles emitted from anthropogenic and natural or photochemically-produced sources in the atmosphere.

A large fraction of the anthropogenic aerosol is generated from energy-related activities, and organic compounds are known to constitute a significant fraction of ambient aerosol mass in many locations.  Yet, large uncertainties remain in quantifying the chemical composition and atmospheric transformations of these aerosols, especially with respect to organic particulate matter.  Particularly lacking are real-time, size-resolved, quantitative instruments for the identification, speciation, and source apportionment of carbonaceous aerosols.  An innovative thermal desorption, time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer recently has been developed with capabilities that can fill a critical need for size-resolved, quantitative chemical composition data on aerosol particles.  This project will develop and demonstrate a light scattering module for this instrument, which will enable full characterization of carbonaceous components, including their state of mixing (and atmospheric aging), along with other chemical components such inorganics and dust.  In Phase I,  the light scattering system was optimized and installed in a quadruople aerosol mass spectrometer, ray tracing calculations were performed to optimize optical detection, software for analyzing data on individual particles in real-time was developed, and the system capabilities were quantified.  Phase II will continue the development of the light scattering module and its incorporation into the new time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer.

At low levels, ammonia is a source of particulates which are not only a human health problem but also affect visibility and global climate. It has been estimated that 80% of ammonia emissions in the United States are from livestock operations, which have environmental impacts on global, national and regional scales. There is a strong need to better quantify and monitor ammonia sources and their impacts, leading to control strategies to protect the public health and the environment.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer kills over 1.3 million per year worldwide. Conventional oral and i.v. chemotherapies used today have toxic effects in many organs besides the lungs. Consequently, doses are limited when treating lung cancer to an extent that it is often not effective. Drug resistance also reduces the impact of chemotherapy on the lungs. Animal studies demonstrate that anticancer drugs delivered directly to the lungs as inhaled aerosols may be the best way to treat lung cancer and other forms of cancer. In these studies it has been found that inhaled nanoparticles of chemotherapy drugs (e.g., paclitaxel, camptothecine) remain in the lungs at concentrations 30 times higher than in the blood. Furthermore, 5% CO2-enriched air can cause a 5.7-fold increase in lung deposition from the same aerosol size and concentration. The proposed technology is the only inhalation chemotherapy system that combines small aerosol particle delivery with CO2 enrichment. The aerosol-generation system is based on a patented method that uses carbon dioxide for the drug formulation and propellant. This makes it ideally suited to deliver many of the hydrophobic (non-water soluble) drugs that are easy to formulate in CO2 and difficult to formulate with water nebulizers. In the Phase I SBIR project we developed an aerosol-delivery system specifically for lung cancer treatment, demonstrated that the aerosols generated are in the size range that would be most effective for lung cancer treatment, and showed that the aerosolized drugs retained their activity in vitro. New formulations of anticancer drugs (topotecan, paclitaxel, taxotere, etoposide and vitamine E succinate) were developed for the new system. The Phase II goal is to demonstrate the potential efficiency of the new drug formulations in vitro and in vivo and to develop aerosol equipment that is suitable for pre-clinical testing, clinical trials, and patient care.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many contemporary medical and dental therapies include the replacement or repair of tissues using materials such as metal.  Currently there are at least 150,000 hip replacements, 300,000 knee replacements, and 500,000 dental implant procedures performed in the US each year (Kurtz, Mowat et al. 2005).  These numbers are expected to increase as the baby boom generation ages.  While a large number of individuals experience uncomplicated healing, there are a significant number of complications associated with metal implants.  For example, the revision rate for arthroplasty varies between 10-20% (Fitzpatrick, Shortall et al. 1998) and it has been estimated that 16% of the annual total joint surgeries in the US are revisions (Mahomed, Barrett et al. 2003).  The majority of these revisions are due to failure at the implant-bone interface, suggesting a need for improved technologies to increase bone growth onto the implants.  Improving the integration of metal implants will be advantageous to society benefiting from next generation devices.  In phase I, we used phage display to identify peptides that bound to titanium with high affinity.  These titanium-binding peptides were synthetically linked to a cell attachment RGD sequence to generate peptides that promoted rapid attachment and differentiation of osteogenic cells on titanium.  We have also identified unique general cell attachment sequences and peptides with high affinity for Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2.  The goal of this Phase II proposal will be to develop a prototype IFBM coating for metal implants that promotes cell attachment and improves osseointegration.  In Phase II, we will bring these advances together to develop a coating that utilizes: 1) improved metal, 2) improved cell, and 3) BMP binding peptides to promote osseointegration of metal implants.  In aim 1 we will: 1) optimize metal-binding peptides in the presence of biologic fluids and 2) identify peptides that bind specifically to osteoblasts.  In aim 2, we will generate different classes of IFBMs: 1) a general cell-binding peptide that promotes the attachment of osteoblast-progenitors; 2) an osteoblast specific binding peptide that promotes mature osteoblast attachment; 3) a BMP-2 binding peptide that recruits, binds, and retains BMP-2 and other members of the BMP family.  Each class of IFBM will be tested individually in a series of in vitro assays.  IFBMs will then be combined to generate a mixed coating that will bind and guide the biologic response of osteogenic cells and BMP-2 on the surface of titanium.  In aim 3, we will complete: 1) biophysical, 2) molecular, 3) mechanical, and 4) toxicological characterization of prototype IFBMs.  Finally in aim 4, we will examine the efficacy of these IFBM coatings in a rat femoral model of osseointegration in collaboration with Dr. D. Rick Sumner (Kuroda, Virdi et al. 2004).  Upon successful completion of Phase II, Phase III would involve testing the prototype coating in a large animal model such as gap healing in a canine humeral model (Sumner, Turner et al. 2004) or a canine hip replacement model (Sumner, Turner et al. 2001).",

Thin plastic films (typically polyethylene) are spread along the rows of plants at the beginning of the growing season. Holes are made in the films to plant the seeds or seedlings. The use of mulch films speeds the ripening of crops, conserves moisture and fertilizer, and inhibits weed growth, fungus infection and insect infestation. At the end of the growing season (generally 3-5 months) the film, contaminated with dirt and vegetation, must be collected, transported and disposed. As the use of mulching films becomes more common, the disposal of the polyethylene film becomes a significant waste problem.

Such probes provide benefits of increased tissue specificity obtained for biopsy, minimally accessed incisions, and the reduction of inpatient hospital utilization with an improved patient recovery. At present most of the probes on the market are non-imaging gamma probes that suffer from the lack of ancillary information of the surveyed area, such as clear delineation of malignant tissue. Also, the highly penetrating gamma radiation arising from other parts of the body increases the background and limits the practical use of these probes. We are addressing these limitations by designing a new-generation intraoperative probe intended to rapidly image the tumor bed with short-range beta rays. The probe is based on a combination of two innovative technologies, namely a high resolution, high efficiency scintillator coupled to a high sensitivity, low noise readout sensor. The proposed device will allow real time imaging of the surveyed area for rapid and accurate delineation of lesions. The Phase II research will be focused on developing a fully functional prototype and demonstrating its efficacy by performing detailed animal studies. This new imaging technology has enormous potential in both medical and non-medical applications. The estimated market size for probes and other technologies being developed under this program is well over one hundred million dollars. A significant fraction of this market represents areas where the involved technologies will have a major impact. The outcome of the proposed research will be a solid state digital intraoperative imaging beta probe (IBP) that will improve the diagnosis and treatment of solid tumor cancers, including those of the head and neck, female reproductive system, skin, peritoneum, mesentery, lung, bronchus, colon and rectum. For detecting small tumors, this probe will provide unprecedented spatial resolution, high signal to background discrimination, a very high sensitivity, and a real time imaging.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection and routine clinical screening represent the first line of defense for managing cancer, a disease that claimed over 570,280 lives in the U.S. during the year 2005. Significant advances have been made in the medical imaging of tumors; however, many of these techniques are too expensive to be implemented for routine screening. Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) and diffuse correlation tomography (DCT), which images blood flow, promises to provide a method for routine, non-invasive cancer screening that increases the frequency of screening procedures by reducing, or eliminating, the exposure to radiation. Unfortunately, the need for many single photon-counting detector elements, which are expensive and bulky, constrains the development of DCT instruments. The Phase I funding for this project supported the successful development of a new imaging technology that surmounts the limitations of conventional CMOS (complementary-symmetry metal-oxide-semiconductor) APS (Active Pixel Sensor) and CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) imaging technologies and provides the necessary foundation for DCT imaging. In Phase I, we designed, fabricated and tested CMOS avalanche photodiode pixel capable of single optical photon sensitivity, in the near infrared region of the spectrum, with a timing jitter of less than 350 ps. These CMOS Geiger photodiode (GPD) pixels digitize the incident photo-signal, which solves many of the noise issues that have limited the use of CMOS APS camera pixels for high-speed, high- sensitivity, and high spatial-resolution applications, such as DCT. The Phase II goal is to develop a fully integrated, nearIR digital camera chip for DCT imaging of blood flow. This all-digital, CMOS imaging technology fulfills the demanding requirements for providing high signal-to-noise DCT images through the use of many detector elements. In the Phase II effort, we propose to implement the successful pixel designs, identified in Phase I, to construct a prototype chip that will be incorporated into a patch. We will perform DCT imaging of phantoms in the laboratory of our collaborator, Dr. A. Yodh at the University of Pennsylvania. The diagnosis and imaging of breast tissue, as well as sport related injuries, represents the clinical target of the proposed DCT instrument.

The first employs pathogen capture on antibody-decorated, paramagnetic nanospheres and will provide rapid, preliminary warning based on the hydrodynamic properties of the nanoparticles when the targeted viruses are bound. This stage will monitor the relaxation of the magneto-optical birefringence of the nanoparticles and will trigger an alarm when the birefringence relaxation rate drops off dramatically. The methodology allows for continuous surveillance over virtually unlimited periods. The second stage will provide either confirmation or correction to the preliminary identification. It is based on the ability to interrogate the captured nucleic acid with a series of unique probes that change their fluorescence properties when they hybridize with specific nucleotide sequences of suspected viral genes. We will compare the speed and sensitivity of detecting these genes by fluorescence generated from molecular beacons, and by the temporal correlation of fluorescence issued from tagged probes. The detection method exhibiting the best performance will be incorporated into the sensor. In each case, Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification (NASBA), an isothermal nucleotide amplification scheme, will be employed to raise the number of target template copies to detectable levels. The biosensor will integrate the two stages of sample transfer, amplification, and analysis in a microfluidic architecture that enables high throughput processing and parallel detection of multiple probes. Employing both proportional mode avalanche photodiode (APD) detectors and Geiger-mode fAPDs that are responsive to extremely low light levels, sensitivity to low virus titers will be possible.         This proposal solicits funding for developing an instrument to detect and identify pathogenic viruses in a rapid, automated two-step analysis that can be used by emergency workers who are responding to a suspected release of airborne (waterborne) agents. The first step screens the sample to determine if there are any virus particles that possess a targeted group of exposed coat proteins. If the answer is affirmative, the virus is isolated and its nucleic acid is analyzed to determine if it carries pathogen genes.",

Three different scintillator materials - LaBr3, LaCl3 and CeBr3 - have been shown in Phase I to provide outstanding results even when subjected to high temperatures. This trait makes these materials well suited for geologic well logging applications where radiation measurements must be in environments where temperatures exceed 175 C. The keys to furthering these materials are tailoring their chemical composition through dopants, producing ingots of larger sizes and packaging them to resist such environments. Producing more accurate well-logging tools should be a direct outcrop of this project. These tools should in turn enable the geology researcher to more efficiently conduct experiments, and to reduce some of the uncertainties in the otherwise highly speculative field of oil exploration. The broader impacts of this program will encompass both a better understanding of this family of scintillator materials and their use in other applications for which temperature performance is not a key issue.

The long-term objectives of this application are to develop novel manufacturing processes using transgenic plants to significantly lower the up-front capital investment and processing costs, shorten the product development cycle, and provide products with superior safety profiles. These objectives are best achieved by utilizing the high-yield transgenic lettuce expression system developed under the funding of the Phase I proposal. In this Phase II plan, transgenic lettuce producing a model antibody will be used to evaluate the scalability of the process and quality of the product from a larger scale pilot production. The same model antibody produced in standard mammalian cell culture will be used for all of comparisons. This model antibody is a fully humanized IgG1? anti-tissue factor antibody (hOAT) that is currently in pre-clinical development as an anti-cancer therapeutic. The specific aims of this research proposal are to: 1) generate 200-kg of transgenic hOAT lettuce biomass using hydroponic production in a greenhouse setting; 2) establish a scalable protein purification method to generate highly purified hOAT from transgenic lettuce; and 3) evaluate lot-to-lot consistency of the plant-derived hOAT using in-vitro and in-vivo testing and further establish its comparability to mammalian cell-produced hOAT. The lower production and capital costs, shortened product development cycle, greater flexibility and scalability, and improved safety of using transgenic lettuce expression methods provides significant value and appeal to this platform for manufacturing therapeutic and diagnostic antibody products. The lower cost of goods would enable wider spread use of antibody therapeutics, particularly in less economically developed markets. The rapidly develop transgenic lettuce capable of producing kilogram quantities of functional recombinant antibody is well suited for biodefense applications where stockpiles of therapeutic proteins are needed to address numerous and continuously changing threats. The use of hOAT as model protein will provide proof-of-principle, demonstrate favorable production economics and confirm antibody functionality/efficacy. It could also lead to the advance of a plant-derived antibody into clinical studies against cancer indications. 7. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel, cost-effective manufacturing process to commercially produce therapeutic antibodies using transgenic lettuce. The lower cost of goods and better safety profiles of these products would enable broader use of antibody therapeutics, particularly in less economically developed markets and for biodefense purposes.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this project is to develop an anti-tissue factor antibody, Sunol-cH36, as a treatment for Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The association between coagulation and inflammation has been well established and a central role in the coagulopathy of ALI/ARDS has been attributed to tissue factor (TF). TF binding to Factor VIIa (FVIIa) activates FX to FXa, forming a transient ternary complex, TF-FVIIa-FXa, which is involved in inflammatory signaling by generating downstream products of activated coagulation and by signal initiation by the TF complex itself. The latter involves signal transduction through the cytoplasmic tail of TF or sequential presentation of FVIIa and FXa to protease activated receptors (PARs) on the cell surface. In vitro, TF-dependent FVIIa and FXa action on PARs have independent, pro-inflammatory effects that include upregulation of cytokine gene expression. These discrete signaling events (signal transduction by the TF intracellular domain and TF activation of PARs) represent unique opportunities for intervention. We hypothesized that blockade of FX binding to established TF-FVIIa complex by Sunol-cH36 would attenuate coagulation-dependent inflammatory responses in ALI and ARDS. In addition, TF blockade by Sunol-cH36 may also attenuate the coagulation-independent intracellular signaling. The safety of Sunol-cH36 has been previously established in numerous preclinical studies and in a phase 1 clinical trial for coronary artery disease. The specific aims of the current proposal will evaluate the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of Sunol-cH36 when multiple doses are administered to cynomolgus monkeys. The results from the current proposal will complete pre-clinical pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies to support a regulatory approval from the FDA to advance the molecule into clinical development using a multiple dose regimen.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer is the most common malignancy which occurs in women and the second leading cause of cancer death. While the majority of breast cancers are sporadic (e.g. not inherited), approximately 10% are due to inherited mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes leading to a lifetime risk of 85% for breast cancer and 40-65% for ovarian cancer. Importantly, recent progress in understanding the molecular basis for inherited breast and ovarian cancer has led to the development of candidate drugs (PARP inhibitors) which for the first time offer the hope of preventing and treating cancer in women carrying defective BRCA1/2 genes. There is also increasing evidence that pre-surgical genetic screening of breast cancer patients helps assist in deciding on therapeutic options. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to be able to identify carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations. However, current breast cancer susceptibility gene testing which involves DNA sequencing is prohibitively expensive in many cases. The objective of this project is to develop a cost-effective technology to screen for mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes. Two related methods have been successfully tested in Phase I, both based on in vitro expression of peptides from overlapping segments of PCR amplified BRCA1/2 genomic DNA and mRNA. One approach utilizes an ELISA-based protein truncation test (ELISA-PTT) to detect chain-truncations which constitute 95% of all deleterious mutations in BRCA1/2. A second approach, utilizes mass spectrometry of in vitro expressed proteins (MASSIVE-PRO) to scan for all possible mutations, including missense mutations. In both cases, studies on normal and mutant bearing cell-lines and a limited number of patient samples reveals the tests are highly effective scanning techniques with a sensitivity approaching DNA sequencing. During Phase II, we propose to further develop and extensively evaluate these novel BRCA1/2 assays. The ELISA-PTT chain-truncation assay developed in Phase I will be improved to cover the entire BRCA1/2 coding region using single-step PCR reactions. The test will utilize a combination of DNA and mRNA extracted from blood. The MASSIVE-PRO assay will also be extended to scan for both chain truncations and missense mutations in both genes. Advanced technology based on several innovations, which can significantly reduce the number of PCR, and cell-free reactions will be evaluated. The new assay will be extensively evaluated in collaboration with Dr. Jessica K. Booker, Associate Director of the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory at the University of North Carolina School Of Medicine (UNCSM) using a repository of 250 pre-validated genomic DNA and mRNA samples from patients screened for hereditary breast cancer. Clinical a-testing will be performed during the third year in both Dr. Booker's laboratory and at Quest Diagnostics, Inc. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy which occurs in women and the second leading cause of cancer death. While the majority of breast cancers are not inherited, over 20,000 cases per year in the U.S. are due to inherited mutations in two specific genes leading to a lifetime risk of 85% for breast cancer and 40- 65% for ovarian cancer. Importantly, a new generation of drugs are being developed which target hereditary breasted cancer. However, current breast cancer susceptibility gene testing is often prohibitively expensive for patients and insurance companies. The objective of this project is to develop a new, cost-effective technology to screen for mutations indicative of hereditary breast cancer. A new approach to detect these breast cancer mutations developed by AmberGen will be extensively tested during this project. This test promises to be rapid, highly sensitive, low-cost and easy to perform in a typical clinical laboratory setting. If successful, the test will enable more extensive screening and consequently increased surveillance and early treatment for hereditary breast cancer.",

While several proteomic tools have been extensively investigated for this purpose, including two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, quantitative proteomics is still difficult to achieve due to the limited accuracy and inability of these methods to survey the entire proteome. The goal of this project is to overcome these limitations by developing a new approach to quantitative proteomics based on the use of PhotoCleavable Isotope Coded Affinity Tags (PC-ICAT) along with mass spectrometry. PC-ICAT reagents are composed of four distinct elements: a biotin affinity tag, a photodeavable linker which exhibits rapid and efficient photocleavage, a variable mass linker and a chemically reactive group. The light and heavy versions of the PC-ICAT reagents are used to tag two different samples, for example extracts from normal and disease related tissues. After digestion, capture and photorelease, the relative abundance of the tagged peptides in each sample is measured using LC-MS. During Phase I of this project, a sulfhydryl reactive PC-ICAT maleimide reagent has been synthesized and extensively evaluated using both model peptides and proteins. Significantly, the performance of PC-ICAT exhibits superior performance compared with the conventional (CAT reagent. During Phase II, we will extend the usefulness of PC-ICAT in proteomic research and clinical applications by: 1) synthesizing and evaluating an amine reactive version of the PC-ICAT reagent, 2) evaluating a solid supported PC-ICAT reagent and 3) exploring the use of PC-ICAT reagents for protein expression profiling and biomarker discovery. For this purpose, we will apply PC-ICAT reagents and LC-MS to study cell lysates derived from normal and malignant human prostate cell lines.

In the last three years, miRNA publications have increased exponentially as researchers have discovered the potential importance of these small RNAs in human cancer, neurological disease, and viral infection. Ambion researchers have worked to develop the tools necessary to understand the relationship between miRNAs and human health. Our results and the results from other institutions indicate that miRNAs may provide useful markers for the development of diagnostic and prognostic assays. In addition, there are hints that miRNAs might play an active role in disease progression, making them candidates for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this proposal is to develop rapid, sensitive, high-throughput methods to quantify the levels of small RNA molecules such as microRNAs (miRNA) in biological samples. These small RNAs have emerged as important regulators of gene expression which are critical for development and disease progression. Unfortunately, there currently are no rapid, quantitative methods available to measure levels of miRNA in clinical samples. The proposed research will result in the development of kits and reagents to rapidly quantify miRNAs in samples derived from tissues or cell culture. During Phase I, we invented a qRT-PCR based method to convert target miRNA molecules into cDNA and which are then amplified and detected using PCR. This method enables the specific detection of individual miRNAs in RNA samples. In Phase II we propose to optimize the method to facilitate its commercial use in research and diagnostic applications. Our Phase II research will improve sensitivity and specificity, permit simultaneous detection of multiple miRNAs in a single reaction, and enable detection on a Luminex liquid bead array platform. These improvements will enable rapid miRNA profiling for basic research, clinical validation of diagnostic and therapeutic miRNA candidates, and put a system in place for rapid development of miRNA-based clinical diagnostic assays.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Leukemia is a set of blood cancer characterized by the uncontrolled growth of developing white blood cells. The accumulation of cancerous cells interferes with the body's production of healthy blood cells therefore impairing immune response to infection. Worldwide, an estimated 257,000 new cases of leukemia are diagnosed each year, with approximately 195,000 deaths annually. According to the American Cancer Society, 30,800 new cases of all types of leukemia were reported in the US in 2003. Leukemia is the number one cause of deaths from cancer in children and young adults under age 20. One of the most important laboratory features used to categorize leukemia patients is the specific chromosomal translocations within the leukemia blasts, which are used to choose the therapeutic options that are likely to provide the best outcomes. Fusion proteins formed by the translocations are thought to contribute to the development and progression of leukemia and are thus therapeutic targets as well as diagnostic markers. New therapeutic approaches are likely to further increase the importance of identifying specific leukemia-associated translocations in order to determine the most effective course of treatment. Liquid bead arrays with flow cytometry detection are particularly suited to the requirements of the diagnostic laboratory and will be the basis for our multiplex detection assay using the Luminex xMAP technology platform. This format has been generally applied to clinical analytes, including serologic, genetic, and infectious disease targets. Phase I funding for this project supported the successful development of a rapid single-tube assay for simultaneous detection of leukemia-associated chromosome translocations using fusion transcripts as markers (21 fusion transcript markers). The phase I study also showed the feasibility of a comprehensive control system for use in clinical implementation of the assay. As a result we have launched a kit (for Research Use Only, RUO) for rapid detection of 12 fusion transcript markers from most common leukemia-associated translocations under the trade name Signature LTx Leukemia Translocation Panel. The ultimate goal of proposed phase II project is to adapt and expand this assay into a robust, high-throughput clinic diagnostic kit for rapid risk-stratification in leukemia. Specific Aims of Phase II are: 1. Expand the assay to include additional clinically relevant markers. 2. Develop a comprehensive assay control system for clinical test of this assay. 3. Clinical evaluation of our assay system for rapid leukemia subtyping (risk stratification). The overall goal of this proposal is to develop an assay (Signature LTx) for subtyping and risk-stratification of leukemia. This liquid bead array format of this assay will provide efficiency and cost benefits to diagnostic laboratories and provide crucial information to physicians and patients for use in making treatment decisions.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Numerous proteomics platforms for measuring multiple proteins in parallel have been developed, but adoption has been limited by the fact that they all are orders of magnitude less sensitive than standard ELISA assays. By contrast, methods for quantitatively measuring the levels of multiple mRNAs in parallel are very robust and sensitive. The real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most sensitive and commonly used method for quantitative gene expression profiling; it allows extremely sensitive measurement of hundreds of mRNA transcripts in parallel. We have now developed a proprietary method for using the real-time-PCR technology to measure protein concentrations, also in a multiplexed fashion and with very high sensitivity and reproducibility. The method, Multiplexed Real-time-lmmuno-PCR (MRI-PCR), consists of a sandwich immuno-assay in which the detection antibodies are labeled with different DMA sequences. Real-time PCR is then used to quantify all of the DNA labels in parallel, thus revealing the quantities of the cognate proteins in the biological samples. Phase I data show that multiplexed protein measurements employing MRI-PCR assays provides about 2 orders of magnitude more sensitive detection and >2 orders of magnitude increased dynamic range in comparison to standard ELISA assays, along with very low standard deviations (CV ",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acne is the second most expensive skin disease, resulting in $2.23 billion in medical spending annually. Although the overall health is not impaired, acne can produce cutaneous and emotional scars that last a lifetime. It is not surprising that there is high willingness to pay for acne treatment, and the market is expected to grow to $12 billion. Currently, available medicines are mainly used to treat symptoms and are associated with severe drawbacks, such as skin irritation, requiring long-term treatment, teratogenesis, and acquisition of antibiotic resistance. Androgens, which act through androgen receptor to express their biological response, play an important role in the development of acne, i.e., the cause of disease. In theory, use of an androgen receptor inhibitor should induce symptom relief for all types of acne and more importantly, intervenes in the progression from comedones to the more severe, scar-causing inflammatory lesions. Currently, there is no topical androgen receptor inhibitor available. In Phase I of this SBIR study, a patented androgen receptor degradation enhancer, ASC-J9, has been demonstrated to be effective and safe in inducing regression of androgen-stimulated seborrhea in two different animal models for human acne. ASC-J9, a new chemical identity, is potentially superior to currently available medicines for acne treatment. AndroScience Corporation has committed substantial resources in developing ASC-J9 through the necessary regulatory approval process for evaluation as an anti-acne drug. In this Phase 2 application, we request support to complete critical development steps needed for Investigation of New Drug (IND) submission; precisely we are asking support for required regulatory studies related to drug substance scale-up, drug product formulation and manufacturing/quality control, as well as preclinical biosafety and bioefficacy testing. The acquired information will support AndroSciences effort to request approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to commence human clinical trials (Phase 3) and also help in securing follow-up funding or forming partnerships with established pharmaceutical companies to register the process necessary to bring a new drug to the marketplace. We believe that commercialization of an ASC-J9 topical cream will benefit public health by alleviating clinical symptoms in acne sufferers in a safer, and more effective and satisfactory fashion. ASC-J9 topical cream commercialization could replace some undesirable anti-acne drugs currently in use. Acnes are androgen-dependent. More effective, safer, and better-tolerated treatments for acnes are lacking. This project is designed to develop and eventually commercialize ASC-J9 topical cream as the first-in-class androgen inhibitor to accomplish the goal to alleviate clinical symptoms and achieve a higher degree of satisfaction in patients and doctors.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary Fibrosis is a diffuse interstitial lung disease characterized by chronic inflammation and progressive fibrosis of unknown etiology. Pulmonary fibrosis affects five million people worldwide and in the United States there are over 200,000 patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Of these more than 40,000 expire annually. Typically, patients are in their forties and fifties when diagnosed. Median survival from time of diagnosis is 5.5 years. Pulmonary fibrosis is associated with pronounced morbidity and mortality and responds poorly to currently available therapy. While steroids and other immunosuppressive agents serve as the standard treatment for pulmonary fibrosis, these agents have proved inadequate and have deleterious side effects. Recent studies have identified hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) as an antifibrogenic agent that protects against transforming growth factor (TGFbeta) mediated apoptotic effects on epithelial cells and extracellular matrix accumulation in liver, kidney and lung fibrosis in animal models. In order to overcome the shortcomings and expense of protein therapy, we have developed a small molecule mimetic of HGF activity that was rationally designed through a novel combination of phage display and molecular modeling technology. In vitro, our lead HGF mimetic, Ang1170, activates the HGF receptor, c-Met, and induces its biological functions including activation of endothelial and bronchial epithelial cell proliferation, without stimulating SMC/fibroblasts and suppresses TGF beta expression similar to HGF. In vivo, Ang1170 inhibits collagen synthesis and decreases the liver and kidney fibrosis. Our recent preliminary PHASE-I studies suggest that Ang1170 treatment decreases collagen content in bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. Quantitative histological evaluation demonstrated that Ang1170 treated mouse lung sections have reduced interstitial fibrosis, alveolar apoptosis, and damaged tissue compared with the vehicle-treated group. In the proposed studies, we will further evaluate the protective effects of Ang1170 (via delayed treatment and oral route) on lung from lung fibrosis in three different pre- clinical animal models of lung fibrosis. The objective of this application is the evaluation of our lead small molecule compound, Ang1170 in clinically relevant models of lung fibrosis to develop sufficient data to successfully file an investigational new drug (IND) application to the FDA to perform clinical trials of our lead small molecule antifibrotic therapy for pulmonary fibrosis.         Pulmonary fibrosis affects five million people worldwide and over 200,000 patients in the United States. Median survival from time of diagnosis is 5.5 years.

In fact, myocardial infarction is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Recent evidence suggests that scatter factor / hepatocyte growth factor, exerts direct protective effects on cardiac myocytes and can potentially be used for salvage of the ischemic myocardium. However the feasibility of using this growth factor in the form of gene or protein therapy is compounded by numerous logistical issues. Using a product discovery engine comprising phage display, 3-dimensional molecular modeling, protein chemistry and preclinical biology, we have identified two distinct chemical classes of SF/HGF-like small molecules. In vitro screening of member compounds led to two distinct lead candidates, one from each chemical class. Phase I studies that these two candidates exert significant protective effects. In this translational Phase II program, we will first make an in- depth comparison of our two small molecule candidates in a rodent model of in vivo myocardial ischemia- reperfusion injury. The single lead candidate emerging from Aim 1 studies will be entered into Aims 2 and 3, which comprise of efficacy studies in clinically relevant models of myocardial ischemic injury. Supported by separate funding, a comprehensive set of studies to characterize the pharmacokinetic, biodistribution, acute safety and safety pharmacology profile of our SF/HGF mimetics is already underway and preliminary results from these studies are extremely encouraging. Together with these ongoing regulatory studies, the proposed efficacy studies will provide sufficient information to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for initiation of a clinical trial with an SF/HGF mimetic.

Most models of tumor cell trafficking and blood flow are either based on subcutaneous transplantation of tumors or dorsal skin- fold window models. These models generally do not allow metastasis. There is also evidence that tumor vascularity may be organ-site specific and therefore orthotopic models would be very important. We have previously developed orthotopic metastatic models of cancer which express green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Nature Rev Cancer 5, 796-806, 2005). We have shown that these models enable high resolution whole-body imaging of tumor growth and metastasis and angiogenesis on internal organs (PNAS 97, 1206-11, 2000; 99, 3824-9, 2002). New developments in Phase I include the construction of dual-color cancer cells with GFP in the nucleus and RFP in the cytoplasm (Cancer Res 64, 4251-6, 2004; 65, 4246-52, 2005) that can enable imaging of tumor cell migration, nuclear-cytoplasmic dynamics, and extravasation in the live mouse. Nude mouse models with GFP-expressing blood vessels have also been developed in Phase I which can facilitate imaging of tumor blood flow (Cancer Res 64, 8651-6, 2004; 65, 5352-7, 2005). With these technologies developed during the Phase I grant, the Phase II grant will further develop these technologies in orthotopic models to evaluate inhibitors of tumor blood flow, intravascular tumor cell trafficking and extravasation. The specific aims include: (1) Use of transgenic nude mouse models with GFP blood vessels, orthotopically transplanted with RFP tumor cells for testing agents that target blood flow in the vessels of tumors and their metastasis; (2) Use of dual-color cancer cells with GFP in the nucleus and RFP in the cytoplasm orthotopically implanted in nude mice for in vivo testing of agents that target intravascular trafficking of tumor cells; (3) Use of dual-color cancer cells with GFP in the nucleus and RFP in the cytoplasm orthotopically implanted in nude mice for in vivo testing of agents that target extravasating tumor cells. These orthotopic models are unique in that they will enable visualization tumor blood flow, intravascular tumor-cell trafficking and extravasation at the nuclear-cytoplasmic dynamic level in clinically-relevant mouse models. The newly developed Olympus OV100 whole-mouse imaging system has optics for macro- and high-resolution subcellular imaging along with the models to screen an initial set of potential inhibitors that target these critical steps of metastasis.

USA 98, 2616-2621, 2001 and Yang, M., et al., Cancer Research, 64, 8651- 8656, 2004) and the nestin-driven-GFP (ND-GFP) nude mouse in which nascent blood vessels are labeled with GFP (Amoh, Y., et al., Cancer Res. 65, 5352-5357, 2005). All of the tissues of the BAD-GFP mice, with the exception of erythrocytes and hair, fluoresce green under blue excitation light. In ND-GFP mice, nascent blood vessels express GFP. Transplanted red fluorescent protein (RFP)-expressing tumors and GFP- expressing stromal cells can be clearly imaged simultaneously in the BAD-GFP models. Dual-color orthotopic models of human breast, colon and prostate cancer will be developed in both the BAD-GFP and ND-GFP models to image tumor-host interaction in both primary and resulting metastases. Dual-color imaging enables resolution of the tumor and the host tissues down to the single cell level. All tumor- interacting host stromal cells can be uniquely imaged in the BAD-GFP model including live mice. The stromal cells are targets for new stromal therapy. Nascent tumor angiogenesis can be uniquely imaged in the ND- GFP model. Nascent angiogenesis is a potentially critical target for antitumor and antimetastatic therapy and is uniquely visualized in human tumors in the live ND-GFP nude mouse. These color-coded nude mouse models of human cancer will be used to visualize new targets which should greatly enhance the discovery of stromal-targeting and anti-angiogenesis drugs.

Our recent results suggest that the hair follicle is a promising source for such stem cells. Our discovery that the neural stem cell marker nestin is expressed in hair follicle bulge area cells, the site of hair-follicle stem cells (1), suggested that hair-follicle stem cells and neural stem cells have common features. We have demonstrated that the hair follicle gives rise to blood vessels in vivo with the blood vessels originating from the hair-follicle bulge cells (13). We have also demonstrated in vitro that hair-follicle bulge cells can be induced to form neurospheres, which in turn form neurons (21). These results suggest pluripotent hair follicle adult bulge cells could have important therapeutic applications, in particular for neurological diseases. This application utilizes transgenic mice with green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the nestin regulatory sequences (nestin-driven [ND]-GFP) as the source of labeled hair follicle bulge cells. The hair follicle bulge area cells that we have isolated are positive for the stem cell marker CD34, as well as keratin 15-negative and a-III-tubulin- negative, suggesting their relatively undifferentiated state. These cells can differentiate into glial cells, smooth muscle cells and keratinocytes as well as neurons in vitro. The severed sciatic nerve of C57BL/6 immunocompetent mice was transplanted with ND-GFP cells from the bulge by injection between the two severed regions of the nerve. The nerve was subsequently rejoined. Most of the transplanted GFP-expressing hair follicle bulge cells differentiated into GFAP-positive Schwann cells with myelin sheaths in the rejoined sciatic nerve. The rejoined sciatic nerve contracted the gastrocnemius muscle upon electrical stimulation. Walking print length and intermediate toe spread significantly recovered after transplantation of hair-follicle bulge cells between the severed tibial nerve indicating the transplanted mice recovered the ability to walk normally. Preliminary results indicate that ND-GFP bulge area cells can promote the functional rejoining of the severed spinal cord in mice. These results suggest that hair-follicle bulge cells promote the recovery of peripheral nerve injury (22). The specific aims of this Phase II application are as follows: (1) Characterize the hair follicle bulge area ND-GFP cells by FACS to identify and sort the cell types present. (2) Determine optimal conditions for hair-follicle bulge cells to rejoin and confer function to the severed peripheral nerves in immunocompetent mice. (3) Determine the optimal conditions of hair-follicle bulge cells to rejoin and confer function to the severed spinal cord in immunocompetent mice. These aims will test the hypothesis that hair follicle bulge cells can provide a readily available source of neurologically therapeutic stem cells.

In order to achieve the desired performance from space, the antenna systems must have surface areas that are hundreds of square meters in size. However, to make it affordable to deploy such large-area antennas into space, it is necessary to fabricate these antennas on flexible substrates, which are lightweight, and can be rolled into small volumes. The fabrication of flexible antennas calls for new manufacturing techniques that are capable of addressing the challenges of patterning high-resolution features on very-large area flexible substrates, while achieving precise registration of the antenna features over the entire substrate area. In this Phase II proposal we will develop and demonstrate processes to fabricate large-area antennas on flexible substrates, focusing, in particular, on JPL's 2 x 3 m active membrane phased array radar; and we will fabricate the flexible panels required for JPL's antenna.

Because of its critical role in sphingolipid metabolism, we have focused on SK as an innovative molecular target for the development of new drugs for the treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs). Sphingolipids are being increasingly recognized as key mediators of stress responses, cell differentiation and proliferation, and are known to mediate the effects of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa) that is of central importance in IBDs. Because of this pivotal role of SK in regulating inflammation, we are developing SK inhibitors to be used as drugs to treat IBDs. In Phase I of this program, we demonstrated that our SK inhibitors block signaling pathways induced by inflammatory cytokines, and that oral administration of these compounds alleviates the development of IBD in the DSS model of ulcerative colitis, without toxicity to the mice. These studies provide the first proof-of-principle demonstration that SK inhibitors are likely to be effective in the treatment of IBD. The following Specific Aims will be addressed in Phase II of this project: To evaluate the anti-IBD activity of orally-delivered ABC294640 and ABC747080 in the TNBS-model of Crohn's Disease and in IL-10 knock-out mice; To pharmacodynamically optimize the schedule for oral delivery of ABC294640 and ABC747080; To determine the efficacies of ABC294640 and ABC747080 in the inflammation-driven model of colon carcinogenesis; and To complete cGMP synthesis and formulation and IND-directed toxicology studies with the single best SK inhibitor.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bridging the gap between science and practice continues as a major problem in the effective delivery of treatments for alcohol abuse and dependence. Twelve Step Facilitation, an empirically supported therapy, is well positioned to bridge this gap. That is, although TSF is a highly structured manual driven approach, its basic tenets are familiar to many counselors and hence can be an effective 'bridge' to other empirically-supported, manualized approaches. In a randomized training study, we have demonstrated that intensive didactic training by ABR staff (Dr. Kathleen Carroll and Stu Baker, two of the original writers of the NIAAA Project MATCH TSF manual) dramatically increases 'real world1 substance abuse counselors' ability to implement TSF effectively, compared to simply reading the manual. However, standard training models, regardless of their effectiveness, are not feasible to train large numbers of clinicians. Computer-assisted training models, which offer greater flexibility in the location and timing of training, as well as a high level of interaction, the opportunity to view effective implementation of the treatment, and numerous other advantages, have not been explored as a strategy to train practitioners and their ability to implement empirically validated therapies. In Phase I of the proposed project, we developed a single introductory module of computer-based training program in TSF (\"CBT for TSF\") and then conducted a randomized pilot study evaluating its effectiveness compared with reading the manual among 25 substance abuse counselors. Even in this comparatively small sample, the prototype 'CBT for TSF1 program was associated with statistically significant differences in the counselors' ability to implement TSF, as measured by independent ratings of adherence and skill, as well as their knowledge of TSF, with large effect sizes (d=1.0). Thus, having met the a priori criteria for determining success for Phase I, we are now proposing a Phase II project in which we will complete the full \"CBT for TSF\" program and conduct a randomized training trial with 90 counselors. Counselors will be randomly assigned to one of three training conditions: Manual Only, the \"CBT for TSF\" program, or three days of face-to-face didactic training in TSF. The primary outcome will be pre-training/post-training independent ratings of the counselors' level of adherence and competence in delivering TSF, as measured by a standardized videotaped role play exercise.",

        "abstract": "Farmers, crop consultants, and regulators are constantly faced with management/policy decisions that require the integration of current crop and soil conditions, and current and future weather conditions. Farmers and crop consultants must make these management decisions within a regulatory environment that is becoming more restrictive and complex. Regulators are forced to make policy recommendations without sufficient understanding of the environmental processes they are attempting to regulate. In short, evaluating alternative management strategies that account for the broad variability in agro-ecosystems can be difficult given the complex processes impacting soils and crops within climatic conditions and farming practices. Dynamic, process modeling can be an effective tool for assisting farmers in effective management strategies to enhance profitability while protecting the environment. The purpose of this project is to prototype a web-based decision support tool that will provide crop consultants, farm managers, and policy makers with the technical tools for the evaluation of site-specific best management practices. This tool will utilize geographic information system (GIS) capabilities to capture spatial and temporal variability in agricultural, environmental, and climatic conditions, and will be implemented within a user interface on the internet. NUGGET will assist users in developing management strategies that minimizing nutrient and pesticide leaching, ammonia volatization, and greenhouse gas emissions.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop Li-ion battery anodes that exploit the unique morphology of low cost carbon nanofibers (CNF). Primary efforts will focus on reduction of irreversible capacity, through a variety of nanofiber surface modification techniques, characterization of the upper limits of anode discharge rate, and development of a new type of compound anode material that combines CNF with elements that form high energy alloys of lithium. The latter effort has the potential to combine the high rate capability of CNF with the higher operation voltage of alloys in a manner that synergistically increases the reversible capacity of both components of the compound anode. Safe, rechargeable, inexpensive Li-ion batteries are enjoying a growing customer base in diverse markets from consumer electronics to space vehicles. The unique morphology of carbon nanofibers and the fact that these materials can readily be transitioned into an existing client base of Li-ion battery producers and users, holds great promise for this cutting-edge research.",

Under Phase II support, we will extend the feasibility studies of Phase I to the development of a commercial Chinese hamster ovary cell line for high yield production. We will then utilize the recombinant protein to determine whether inhibition of platelet activation with the optimized apyrase in vivo attenuates thrombosis after arterial injury in rabbits and pigs.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microarrays are a powerful way to measure the biological impact of contaminants in the environment. Because they are used to test changes in expression of many genes in parallel, they provide data on the mechanisms by which compounds affect health more quickly than methods now in use, which makes them much less expensive than current tests. Today, gene chips (microarrays) are an established technology in human disease research. The purpose of the Phase I grant we just completed and this proposed continuation is to bring their power and precision to environmental toxicology. By understanding how contaminants affect gene expression in fish and other wildlife, we can begin to link environmental exposures to adverse health effects in these animals and by extrapolation, to humans. In this Phase II proposal, EcoArray intends to develop, validate and begin to market large oligonucleotide-based glass microarrays for fathead minnows and largemouth bass and develop the backbone of a powerful database. In Phase III, we will use knowledge obtained in this grant to finalize our product offering of a suite of general- and special-purpose microarrays for research and environmental monitoring by Academia, Government and Industry. Our successful Phase I grant validated the use of arrays for a small set of environmental contaminants and resulted in prototype arrays for the two species, as described in our publications, presentations and posters. Our goal for this Phase II work is to expand the current arrays to a larger, more robust format, resulting in a 10,000+-gene fathead minnow microarray and 2,000+ gene largemouth bass microarray. We have engaged five collaborators, all of whom are experts in fish biology, to carry out exposures and field analysis in fathead minnows or largemouth bass. For the fathead minnow studies, we will use the microarrays that we will develop to identify and characterize the genetic signatures for 14 different compounds commonly found at superfund sites, and that are known to have distinct modes of action. Many of these compounds are on the 2003 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) Priority list. We are currently involved in a collaboration (CRADA) with the EPA to pick the best microarray platform and validate its use, and this commercial platform will be the basis for our enhanced microarrays. We will incorporate the gene expression data into a relational database that will also include other parameters such as water chemistry data and biological and physiological endpoints in the treatment species. We will conduct similar laboratory and field studies, but on a smaller scale, in largemouth bass and identify and characterize the genetic signatures for 5 different compounds. We have begun our marketing plan, and have had early success in selling laboratory services associated with gene discovery. We expect to offer an oligonucleotide-based chip developed with the EPA in late 2005 and then begin our marketing launch of the chips developed in this grant, as well as several other complementary products, in late 2006.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Arbor Vita Corporation (AVC) has developed a novel cervical cancer diagnostic based on an understanding of the biology of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases with an estimated 5.5 million new infections per year in the U.S. alone. High-risk (oncogenic) HPV types are correlated with virtually all cervical cancers. Pap smear and liquid based cytology screening has greatly reduced the incidence of cervical cancer, but the Pap test has both high false-negative and false-positive rates and requires an extensive infrastructure of trained cytologists to interpret the results. A cheaper test with greater reliability and predictive value would be of great clinical benefit. The virally-encoded E6 and E7 proteins of high-risk HPV types have been shown to be essential for cell transformation and cancer progression and E6 proteins from high-risk HPV types, but not low-risk HPV types, are known to bind cellular PDZ domains.  AVC has extended those studies and demonstrated a perfect correlation between high-risk HPV and E6-PDZ binding. Based on these findings, we have developed a novel cervical cancer diagnostic assay of HPV E6 using PDZ protein capture. In our SBIR Phase I, AVC developed a novel PDZ capture sandwich ELISA test for HPV E6 that detects over 75% of high-risk HPV types and demonstrated its utility with human cancer samples. We were able to begin quantifying E6 from cells and improved sensitivity to allow E6 detection in a much smaller sample than typically collected in a Pap test. In Phase II, we propose to complete development of our prototype PDZ-based cervical cancer test in preparation for clinical trials. Specifically, we propose to: 1. Expand our antibody detection to include 95% of known high-risk HPV types. 2. Optimize clinical sample handling for E6 protein detection. 3. Optimize the PDZ/antibody sandwich ELISA for clinical laboratory implementation. 4. Extend the studies correlating high-risk E6 protein levels and clinical cytology staging.",

        "abstract": "Native grass seed is important to restoration or reclamation of burned, mined or otherwise disturbed lands. The native seed industry is growing rapidly to meet increasing demand for more seed species in commercial quantities. However, the morphology of the seed of many important species of native grasses makes them difficult to harvest resulting in limited supplies and high prices. Combines and other conventional harvesters such as strippers are often unable to effectively carry out one or more of the key steps of harvest: 1) dislodgement, 2) separation, 3) conveyance, and 4) offloading. This creates an opportunity for new devices such as the pneumatic conveyance system on the Arbuckle Native Seedster that improve seed handling efficiency and overall productivity. The Arbuckle Native Seedster patented technology achieves a high level of seed recovery by plucking seed with almost no impurities thus simultaneously carrying out the first two steps-dislodgement and separation. This makes development of an effective system to convey and off-load harvested seed crucial to development of a high productivity continuous flow native grass seed harvester. The premise of the PCS is that the increased seed flow is most effectively handled by a system of pneumatic conveyance that seamlessly engages dislodged native grass seed in flight and conveys it to a bag. This is because many species of native grass seed have seed morphology that often coheres and clogs if it comes to a stop. Pickup velocity of air flow is several times the saltation velocity that moves seed already in flight.",

        "abstract": "With worldwide energy consumption becoming an epidemic and the future need for power conservation self evident, the improvement of power conversion systems and the reduction of energy waste has become a global priority.  This project will develop very compact, light-weight, silicon carbide power converters, capable of operation at high efficiencies and high junction temperatures.  Silicon carbide \u00bf which offers higher blocking voltages, higher operating temperatures, higher frequency, and lower switching losses compared to other more conventional devices \u00bf is a new semiconductor material with the promise of vastly exceeding the constraints of devices based on silicon.  High temperature operation will result in highly miniaturized and power dense converters, with an order-of-magnitude smaller footprint and reduced volume over state-of-the-art silicon systems.  In Phase I, a single-phase, silicon-carbide-based, three-kilowatt inverter module was built and tested, achieving significant volume reduction (85% smaller) over similar, state-of-the-art , single-phase inverter modules based on silicon.  The feasibility of high temperature operation beyond 500\u00b0C at the junction was demonstrated.  Phase II will design, build, and test a high-energy-efficiency, silicon-carbide, 100-kilowatt, three-phase inverter system with a size and volume reduction of 75%, compared to state-of-the-art silicon-based inverters, with nearly an order-of-magnitude increase in power density.  The approach will utilize a multichip, power-module design strategy, which integrates control and power devices into a single module, and will allow for higher frequency operation.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  By improving electrical efficiencies through the use of silicon carbide electronics, and in implementing the technology in a wide range of power converter applications, the technology should have the potential to save billions of dollars annually in wasted energy.  Commercial power-electronics systems that would significantly benefit from these high efficiency energy improvements include:  high efficiency and low cost industrial motor drives, light-weight motor drives for electric and hybrid-electric vehicles, power inverters for renewable energy and power distribution/transmission, and backup power supplies for telecommunications systems.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The built environment can promote health by meeting the behavioral needs of residents in long-term care settings. Spending even moderate amounts of time outdoors can potentially benefit mental and physical health by increasing activity levels and providing contact with natural environments. Assisted living residents are known to value outdoor access and perceive health benefits, but are frequently discouraged from going outdoors by the design of outdoor areas and transition zones. With little or no increase in cost, the provider industry could design more successful outdoor access by applying environment-behavior principles, but the available information is not formatted in a way that is easily applied to facility design. This Phase II SBIR project will create an interactive multimedia educational series to convey these principles to key decision makers in the assisted living industry, in a way that is easily understood and applied by developers, owner operators, architects, and planning officials. In Phase I, a prototype was developed to test the feasibility of this approach, as a sample CD-based program that was subsequently evaluated by industry professionals as being worth developing further into the final product in Phase II. For Phase II, the Specific Aims will be: Aim 1) Develop the subject matter for the complete series, based on translational research and post-occupancy evaluations conducted to integrate existing research; Aim 2) Create the visual, verbal, interactive, and instructional components that comprise the educational experience, incorporating improvements learned in Phase I; and Aim 3) Produce a final comprehensive version of the CD-based multimedia series, using interactive learning concepts to address the diverse skill sets of a broad target audience, with a user-friendly interface that combines information with activities and challenges. While Phase I developed a prototype format and preliminary subject matter for one learning module, Phase II will refine the format, conduct further research to confirm the primary behavioral principles, and create a comprehensive set of learning modules. The research conducted in Phase II will be useful to both researchers and designers in the field of evidence based therapeutic design. Phase III will develop and market the product in collaboration with an established educational publisher, using distribution networks within the long-term care and healthcare design industries, from contacts that have been established during the Phase I evaluation process. Facilities applying the product will gain a competitive edge by better meeting the needs of residents. Because this innovative learning tool will be marketed aggressively and is highly application-oriented, it is expected to have a significant impact on future design of outdoor access at assisted living facilities.",

There presently is no neuroprotective agent that can be given to patients with acute stroke, and stroke is the third leading cause of death. The costs for rehabilitation of patients that survive a stroke is greater than $40 billion per year in the U.S. The reason that an effective neuroprotective drug has not been developed so far, despite intensive efforts in the pharmaceutical industry, is that most of the drugs do not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Neurotrophins are potential large molecule neuroprotectives but these, too, do not cross the BBB. The present research plan aims at a merger of neurotrophin drug discovery and BBB drug targeting technology, so that a recombinant neurotrophin can be re-formulated as a genetically engineered fusion protein to enable transport of the neurotrophin through the BBB in vivo following delayed intravenous administration in humans. Such a drug will cause neuroprotection in stroke patients following intravenous administration, because the neuroprotective agent will have been specifically designed to cross the BBB. Prior work has produced AGT-120, which is a genetically engineered fusion protein wherein the neurotrophin variant is fused to a targeting ligand that undergoes receptor-mediated transport across the BBB in vivo. This BBB transport vector has been previously genetically engineered to enable use in humans without immunological reaction. The fusion protein is a bi-functional molecule that not only crosses the BBB, but also binds to the specific neurotrophin receptor on neurons to cause neuronal neuroprotection. The following will be done in the proposed work: (i) pharmacology/toxicology of AGT-120 under Good Laboratory Practice conditions, (ii) submission of an IND to the FDA for single intravenous administration of AGT-120 to patients with acute stroke, (iii) phase l-ll clinical trial to examine safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics, and to explore the efficacy of intravenous AGT-120 within 5 hours of an acute stroke.

The current PMI prototype has undergone several progressions of hardware and software development leading to the final device concept validated in model experiments and in clinical studies which have yielded promising results. ProUroScanTM is the first PMI commercial device to be developed, clinically tested and submitted for FDA approval in the course of the proposed project. Digital records obtained by ProUroScanTM could be used to document palpable prostate abnormalities and to monitor disease progression over time. The ProUroScanTM will include a transrectal probe comprising force sensor arrays and a motion tracking system, a compact electronic unit with single electronic board powered through USB port from a laptop with touch screen capability and a wireless color printer. As a separate component, an automatic calibration setup for tactile sensor testing, tuning and calibration will be designed and built. Specific aims of the proposed project include PMI hardware and software refinements. The hardware development will include several technological improvements in the PMI transrectal probe and data acquisition board. Software for prostate 3-D real-time reconstruction and nodule detection will be refined and validated. Substantial amount of effort will be committed to assure the activities and resulting design of the PMI development comply with regulatory requirements. A key focus of pre-commercialization engineering will be on completing the design history file, verification, validation and safety certification testing. Two-stage clinical studies will be conducted at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center (New Brunswick, NJ) and at VA Medical Center (Minneapolis, MN) to document system safety and efficacy. The focal point of all proposed activities and the endpoint of the grant will be preparation and submission of the PMA application for the FDA approval of PMI. The core partnership was established between Artann and ProUroCare, publicly traded medical device company, to ensure commercialization success of the PMI. ProUroCare has committed necessary financial and managerial resources for regulatory clearance and commercialization of the PMI technology to complement NIH support of the project. There is a $50 billion prostate-related market with estimated 40 - 60 milion adult males suffering from one or more prostate conditions. Industry analysts believe that only 10 - 15% of incidents are reported, stressing the urgent need for new screening technologies.

        "abstract": "A high sensitivity laser-induced incandescence system is proposed for the detailed characterization of environmental soot. The Phase 1 effort has clearly demonstrated the feasibility of (1) reducing the lower detection limit of soot volume fraction and increasing the overall measurement range by at least 2 orders of magnitude from what is currently achievable, and (2) providing PM particle size measurement capability. The prototype instrument to be developed in Phase 2 will be capable of real-time PM measurement over any engine transient operation. It will also have orders of magnitude more sensitivity than the gravimetric technique. The wide dynamic range and lower detection limit of the LII make this technique a potentially preferred standard instrument for particulate matter measurements. COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The primary application for the LII system is for monitoring the soot particulate emissions for vehicles (diesel and gasoline). Artium believes that the LII instrument could be used for enforcing EPA regulations on particulate emissions. A version of the instrument can also be used for R&D purposes. Specifically, this instrument will help engine manufacturers develop low emission engines and development of products by emissions control equipment manufacturers. Regulators looking for better measurements to develop new emissions regulations will find the LII system to be attractive. It will provide them with real time analytical capabilities for exhaust gas particulates, particularly diesel soot emissions. It is also expected that the LII method can be developed into a field portable compact rugged system that can make roadside measurements of diesel exhaust, be used in test centers for monitoring vehicle emissions, or installed on stationary power plants and operated remotely.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Assenti LLC is a 10-person start-up company formed out of collaborative research teams from the University of Louisville's Speed School of Engineering and the Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences along with key industry partners. Assenti's enclosed SBIR Phase II application will allow us to continue our significant progress and momentum towards becoming the first company to bring a MEMS (Micro-Electrical-Mechanical Systems) based device to market for treating glaucoma patients. This revolutionary technology has the potential to eliminate the root cause of blindness for patients with glaucoma by providing continuous, non-invasive monitoring of Intra-Ocular Pressure (IOP). Our near term goal for commercialization is to develop our Gen I \"Smart IOP\" monitor that will strictly monitor IOP, so patients can self-administer eye drops to reduce pressure, which will lead to the elimination of optic nerve damage and hence prevention of blindness from glaucoma. However, our eventual longer term goal is to develop a self contained system that will either release hypotensive medication to reduce IOP or use a switch controlled MEMS valve, to create a totally autonomous system requiring no patient intervention. Recent studies have shown that applying topical ocular hypotensive medication was effective in delaying or preventing the onset of primary open-angle glaucoma [1,2]. Assenti has met or exceeded all three specific aims from our funded SBIR Phase I and we anxiously look forward to build upon this progress in Phase II. We have identified the following three specific aims to accomplish for Phase II: 1. Develop a reliable, production ready, battery-free IOP monitoring system using an ultra-miniature MEMS pressure sensor as well as a telemetry 1C, whose combined size measures less than 2mm x 2mm x 0.5mm (75% volume reduction from the phase I device) for FDA animal and eventual human trials. 2.Implementation of our strategic FDA test plan developed by Arkios LLC to obtain our IDE and lead Assenti towards a PMA of our Smart IOP monitor. S.Research into our longer term goal of combining Assenti's Smart IOP monitor with an invivo IOP reducing mechanism that can lead to autonomous control of the entire system and completely eliminate patient intervention.",

The primary application is for use with patients who are candidates for surgery to control or eliminate occurrence of epileptic seizures. Other applications will include functional mapping to plan surgery for other brain diseases such as tumors and research on brain electrical stimulation to control seizures. The need and specifications for the system come from recommendations of an expert panel of clinical users who have been consulted throughout the conception and Phase I research and will continue to be consulted in Phase II. In Phase I, we solved key technical issues associated with the design of the electrical stimulator and EEG amplifiers to minimize the interference to the exquisitely sensitive EEG amplifiers caused by the relatively huge electrical stimulation pulses. In Phase II, we will utilize the knowledge gained in Phase I to build two prototype systems. These will be tested on epilepsy patients in the normal course of their hospitalization for pre-surgical evaluation.",

        "abstract": "A wide range of practical instruments is needed for monitoring carbon dioxide concentrations of the land, air, and sea.  Moderate accuracy of order 1 ppm (dry mole fraction) and temporal response of a few seconds will suffice.  Expense, weight, size, and electrical power must be kept low to make the instrumentation applicable to a large number (~10,000) of one-way deployments per year.  Accessible platforms include weather balloons, floater buoys for probing the ocean's surface, sky hooks (tethered, small blimps) for vertical profiling of the atmospheric boundary layer, and towers for monitoring the accumulation of nighttime transpiration and its dispersal as a transient flux.  This project will use a variation of a proven electro-optical design to build and deploy solid-state probe detection systems.  Manufacturability, as expressed by a fully integrated electrical/mechanical/optical design, will be a key consideration to make the Probe detection system inexpensive and robust.  Phase I built and tested two kinds of nondispersive infrared probe technologies:  photo-electronic and photo-acoustic.  The functionality of the photo-acoustic probe was proven for the stable isotopes of CO2.  Based on a wide range of laboratory tests, the photo-electronic probe proved advanced and robust enough to serve as the basis for Phase II.  In Phase II, the photo-electronic probe will be upgraded and its observational capabilities will be demonstrated.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new probes should serve as the basis for:  (1) observational services, consisting of deployments of the probes from sky hooks, towers, weather balloons, and floater buoys, and of management of the data streams; (2) sales of the probes for use on these same platforms and also for monitoring leaks from geosequestration of carbon dioxide; and (3) improved measurements of the amounts of sequestration of carbon dioxide by natural ecosystems.",

A vertically-integrated suite of technologies could be used to evaluate ecosystem-atmospheric interactions and determine the actual utility of tower-based systems; however, for reasons of safety and expense, piloted aircraft cannot be used to provide the needed observations.  This project will build and deploy such a vertically-integrated suite of technologies that will include:  (1) probes for monitoring the transient flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) associated with the dispersal of respiration at the onset of solar heating each morning; (2) tower- and mooring-based instrumentation for continuous observations of CO2 concentration and steady-state, eddy covariance flux; and (3) a radio-controlled Unmanned Airborne Vehicle (UAV), fitted with a high precision analyzer system and capable of monitoring the time series of CO2 for the entire range of ambient conditions.  In Phase I, a commercial UAV was purchased and integrated with a high precision CO2 analyzer.  The UAV was deployed multiple times, and observations were verified by sampling from a short tower sited at the center of the flight pattern.  Discrete probes were developed successfully to monitor CO2 concentrations on or within the atmospheric interface.  In Phase II, the UAV will be upgraded for increased flight time and the measurement of additional atmospheric variables. Inexpensive UAVs that carry the same payload will be developed to provide a platform that is suitable for high risk deployments.

The first will be repeated shipboard deployments with the goal of developing expert protocols to facilitate oceanic CO2 measurements, particularly in the dynamic coastal regions.  The second will be a system running constantly at a fixed point to determine and solve problems involved with environmental loading on extended deployments.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the last decade, hearing aid technology has advanced rapidly and digital hearing aids are now widely available. Paralleling the advancements in hearing aids has been the rapid development in wireless communications. Digital cell phone has become an indispensable tool that enables people to communicate wirelessly around the world. The acoustic characteristics of a cell phone, however, are designed for users with normal hearing. People with sensory hearing loss would have to wear hearing aids during a cell phone call in order to accommodate the hearing loss. It is cumbersome to have to use two (digital) devices to make a simple wireless call. In addition, many digital wireless phones can emits electromagnetic energy that interferes with hearing aids, turning amplified sounds into static and squeals. FCC, for example, has issued a requirement that cell phone manufacturers need to provide hearing aid friendly phones by 2008. Recognizing that cell phones are digital devices that have all the necessary hardware components to support the function of hearing aids, the specific aims of this project are: (1) to develop the software needed to enable hearing aid functions on a cell phone so that people with hearing loss could make a wireless call without the need of hearing aids. (2) to develop and modify system software of the cell phone so that it could be used as an alternative, stand- alone hearing aid/assistive listening device in the off-line (not making a call) mode. (3) to develop advanced noise reduction and speech enhancement programs that otherwise would be difficult to implement on the resource-limited hardware of digital hearing aids. During Phase II, we will determine the speech recognition benefit and listener preference for the hearing aid features of the cell phone in simulated and real-world listening environments. Evaluations will be conducted in both the call mode and off-line (assistive listening device) mode using participants with mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss. The long-term goal of the project is to develop the necessary software and hardware to enable and enhance hearing aids functions on cell phones. The hearing-aid enabled, cell phone system is expected to be an economic, efficient, and effective device of communication for people with sensory hearing loss.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is an immediate need for novel drugs for the treatment of fungal infections, (antibiotics resistant) bacterial infections, and cancer. Cyclic peptides constitute a class of compounds that have made crucial contributions to the treatment of these diseases. Although cyclic peptides can be very efficient drugs, they are complex natural products and as such, difficult and expensive to optimize with conventional, chemistry- based methodologies. Currently used compounds are either native or native with minor modifications. Hence, the full potential of cyclic peptides for the treatment of human diseases has not been explored. The overall goal of the project is to develop a cost-effective production system for a novel antifungal drug. This molecule is a cyclic peptide and although it is both potent and well-tolerated, it requires structural modifications that cannot be introduced in a cost-effective manner by synthetic chemistry, to become a marketable product. Thus, the project involves development of methodologies and a set of genetic tools that will allow introduction of the required modifications by engineering of the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) complex responsible for synthesis of the molecule, in the producer organism. In Phase I, the gene encoding this NRPS complex was identified, cloned, sequenced and mapped. Phase II will involve modifying this gene such that the resulting, engineered organism will produce a drug molecule(s) with the properties required for a marketable product. Notably, successful engineering of the (NRPS gene in the) producer organism will allow production of this drug molecule at a fraction of the cost of synthetic chemistry thereby ensuring the successful commercialization of a potent, cidal antifungal drug with a novel mode of action. Successful generation of the engineered drug producer organism will: [1] provide an efficient, well-tolerated drug to a market with a strong demand for new products; [2] address a very immediate need from a growing patient population which currently have very few treatment options; and [3] provide proof of concept and critical tools for a novel and potentially very powerful genetic engineering approach to the discovery of new and improved therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad long term goal of this project is to prevent mother to child transmission of HIV through breast feeding in resource poor countries. In the developing world, perinatal transmission is greatly reduced through relatively simple expedients such as dosing mother and child around the time of delivery with nevirapine. However breast feeding still accounts for approximately 315,000 cases annually of pediatric AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite concerns about potential toxicity, a Phase III trial is underway to study daily oral nevirapine to be given to infants in order to reduce this transmission. We have developed a platform technology for the sustained release of a broad range of drugs by subcutaneous / intramuscular injection that can potentially provide 6 weeks of protection from each injection. A program that incorporates these injections could piggyback onto existing accelerated DPT immunization protocols currently in widespread use in Africa. In Phase 1 of this project we accomplished the specific aims proposed: we formulated sustained release suspensions for nevirapine; we tested the in vitro release characteristics of these formulations into buffer; and we determined preliminary in vivo pharmacokinetics and safety of the formulations in rats. Specific aims of this Phase 2 proposal are to: 1, optimize the production parameters of the formulation; 2, manufacture lots for clinical trials under FDA Good Manufacturing Procedures (GMP); 3, perform required animal pharmacokinetic and safety studies in 2 species under Good Laboratory Procedures (GLP); 4, submit a request for an Investigational New Drug Exemption (IND) to the FDA; The successful completion of this project will lead rapidly to the development of an injectable dosage form that could ideally deliver continuous antiviral blood levels through weaning. Completion of these aims will constitute a readily identifiable milestone that will continue in Phase 3, in which we will carry out Phase 1 testing in volunteers and Phase 2 testing in a small population at risk. Ultimately a trial comparing daily oral therapy to the injectable system will prove the potential value of this approach. Each year 315,000 infants in sub-Saharan Africa are infected by HIV though breast milk. Lack of clean water prevents bottle feeding. Daily oral nevirapine administered by mothers to their breast feeding babies is being tested in a Phase III clinical trial but will be resource intensive. The goal of this work is to develop an injectable drug depot formulation for nevirapine that could reduce the infrastructure requirements for an effective prophylaxis program to prevent mother to child HIV transmission in breast feeding populations.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typhoid fever is an infectious disease that annually afflicts an estimated 16 million people worldwide, resulting in 600,000 deaths. The etiologic agent of typhoid fever, Salmonella typhi (S. typhi), is transmitted to humans by the fecal-oral route through contaminated water or food. The use of antibiotics to treat typhoid fever has transformed an often fatal disease into a readily treatable condition. The recent emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of S. typhi found in regions like Southeast Asia has resulted in an increase in the incidence of severe and fatal typhoid fever as well as heightened medical concerns. These concerns may be partially addressed through the use of an effective typhoid fever vaccine that can control morbidity and mortality and limit the spread of drug resistant strains. There are limitations of commercially available vaccines to typhoid fever, which include inconvenient dosing, parenteral administration frequently associated with local reactogenicity and fever, variable protective efficacy, and unpredictable duration of immunity. AVANT Immunotherapeutics, Inc. is developing live, attenuated S. typhi TySOO as an orally administered, single-dose vaccine against typhoid fever. Freshly prepared TySOO was well tolerated and remarkably immunogenic when administered as a single, oral dose to eleven healthy, adult volunteers. A vigorous mucosal response was also detected within seven days of vaccination. Lyophilized TySOO was recently manufactured for evaluation in a Phase I/I I clinical study sponsored by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases at the NIAID. Lyophilized TySOO requires storage at -20C, requiring a \"cold chain\" to maintain vaccine potency. AVANT now has technology to preserve bacterial vaccines using a proprietary preservation process that markedly improves vaccine stability at room temperature. The goals of this proposal are to (1) optimize the production methodology to incorporate this innovative drying technology into the production of a thermostable formulation for TySOO; (2) develop multidose and bulk manufacturing techniques that would significantly reduce cost and manufacturing capacity needed for production of large quantities of doses; and (3) perform scale up and GMP production of preserved TySOO. Meeting these goals will facilitate the advance of TySOO as an oral, single-dose vaccine that can be delivered outside of the storage cold chain.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This phase II SBIR project will test the feasibility of producing large amounts of human monoclonal antibody into transchromosomic avian egg white. We will use a full length ovomucoid genomic locus expression construct created and tested in phase I, to drive expression of the monoclonal's heavy and light chain cDNA. Using these constructs we produced transgenic hens that expressed human monoclonal antibody into their egg whites. This antibody was purified and analyzed for antigen binding and effector function. The results of this analysis support the conclusion that the transgenic produced antibody exhibits antigen binding and effector function that is comparable to the same antibody produced in a mammalian cell culture. This phase II project will also utilize an improved gene delivery system to generate fully transchromosomic avian hens. We have recently generated transchromosomal founders that exhibit germline transmission of a 60MB artificial chromosome. The offspring of these birds contain single copies of the artificial chromosome in every cell. This represents a breakthrough in avian transgenesis which to this point has been restricted by the limited payload capacity of retroviral-mediated methods. We will utilize this improved avian transgenisis technique to deliver the two ovomucoid-based human monoclonal antibody expression vectors developed in phase I to stage I embryos. Transgenic human monoclonal antibody from GO, G1 and G2 birds will be analyzed for expression level, purified and characterized for bioactivity and glycosylation.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): LED based curing lights are beginning to replace conventional halogen lamps as the first choice for dental photo-curing applications. The target of this proposal is to develop a new generation LED dental curing light. It will be the first curing light that is optimized according to the kinetic response of the dental composite, which plays a key role in determining the curing time, the quality of the cured resin, and the heat production. The proposed LED light cures the dental composite by a train of short-duration light pulses, where the time scale of the pulse width and pulse period is designed to match with the response time of the photo-initiation process. This 'resonant' curing mode yields the best quantum efficiency for photo-polymerization. Phase I study of this project leads to successful demonstration of the feasibility and advantages of the proposed pulsed LED light over conventional light curing units (LCUs). It was found that the pulsed LED light yields 10-12% more curing depth and better surface hardness than that obtained by a continuous wave (CW) light with same exposure energy. For phase II project, we will establish a simple but practical model to analyze the kinetic characteristics of the photo-polymerization process and use the model as a guide to help us further explore the potential of the pulsed LED light for dental composite curing. A Raman spectrometer will be utilized in combination with the pulsed LED for real time and in situ monitoring of the photo-polymerization process as to obtain the parameters used in the kinetic model. We will conduct a systematic study on the physical properties of the dental composite cured by both conventional LCUs and the proposed pulsed LED, which will be used to further optimize the pulse sequence. A novel automatic curing time control method employing fluorescence level monitoring at off-time of the pulse train will also be explored. Finally, we will develop a prototype pulsed LED photo-curing system capable of curing all dental polymer resins currently on the market in a time scale comparable to that can be obtained using laser radiation (typically 5-10 seconds) and with a high \"quality\" of cure in terms of depth of cure, hardness, shrinkage, shear bond strength, and temperature change in the resin.",

A design and list of tasks were proposed that will result in a commercially viable product from Phase II.\n\nThe commercialization marketing work in Phase I indicated that the potential market is estimated at over 6,000 potential installations in the US and possibly double that number internationally, depending of enabling government regulations.\n\nFor Phase II, BEI proposes to utilize the feasibility it proved in Phase I to produce a commercially viable product.  It will develop a Fine and Coarse Particulate Monitoring System (FCPMCEMS), capable of continuously measuring and reporting PM10-2.5 and PM2.5 on most particulate emitting sources.  Proposed research and development includes, design, production and testing of two prototype systems including documentation; development of a calibration scheme; testing on a wide variety of possible samples; and a basic field test of the technology and implementation.  These products will be ready to begin commercial activities.\n\nA  Commercialization option is proposed that will extend the research to include testing of the FCPMCEMS on several different types of emission sources.  This research will determine the critical application parameters for these different sources.  The data will provide the basis for BEI to configure systems for different applications and to generate the printed materials it need to facilitate sales of the product.

MD will use a behavioral self-control training (BSCT) protocol that helps drinkers learn skills to either moderate their drinking or to abstain. The target population is members of the self-help organization, Moderation Management (MM) and to visitors to their web site. MM describes itself as an organization that can be helpful for problem drinkers wanting to either moderate their drinking or to abstain. Its members tend to be less severe problem drinkers with few signs of dependence. MM offers written materials describing a program of behavioral change, an online mutual-help community, and face-to-face meetings. Their behavioral change program is a version of a current generation BSCT protocol that will be used in the web application. BSCT is an intervention with strong empirical support. The interactive program will be unique on the Internet. The program will help users choose a goal (moderation or abstinence) then learn cognitive and behavioral skills necessary to achieve and maintain their goal. Modules include goal setting, self-monitoring, \"doing a 30,\" increasing motivation and self-efficacy, identifying and managing triggers, developing alternatives, coping with lapses/relapses, and a segue to abstinence if the user is having difficulty achieving and maintaining moderation. Because moderate drinking is an option, the program may to appeal to less severely dependent drinkers who might otherwise avoid a program that is purely abstinence based. This group of less severely dependent drinkers is an under served but growing population. Phase II goals are to complete the development of the program, pilot test it, and conduct a randomized controlled trial with a 12 month follow-up to assess its effectiveness.

A number of barriers limit accessibility to evidence-based therapies in routine clinical settings. Substance use disorders (SUDs) co-occurring with borderline personality disorder (BPD) pose serious and complex public health problems. Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Substance Abusers (DBT-SUD) is a comprehensive psychosocial treatment, efficacious for substance-dependent individuals with BPD.         In Phase I, we developed and evaluated an innovative computer-based training (CBT) prototype highlighting DBT-SUD Validation strategies for drug treatment providers using an iterative process of prototype development. Validation strategies are among the core treatment strategies used in DBT-SUD. We tested the prototype's efficacy in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the DBT-SUD CBT (n = 12) to a control CBT (n = 12) in a sample of treatment providers from routine drug treatment settings. Results demonstrated that the DBT-SUD CBT was efficacious at producing knowledge gains, recall of course strategies, increased self-efficacy in treating drug-addicted BPD patients, and use of skills in therapeutic settings in subsequent weeks. We propose to significantly expand this course content and its evaluation in Phase II. We will again use an iterative process of development, relying on extensive end-user testing and feedback from a panel of scientific advisors and DBT-SUD experts. Upon completion, we will begin a RCT (n = 120) to compare the CBT (n = 40) to other 'standard' training methods, specifically instructor-led training (n = 40) and text (n = 40). In addition to the outcome variables assessed in Phase I, we will include a performance-based test assessing clinical application of skills for Phase II. In the clinical application test, subjects will take part in a role-play scenario where they will act as DBT-SUD therapist, and a research assistant will act as a fictional 'client'. These role-plays will be video-taped and coded for adherence.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are over 500 protein kinases in the human genome and several hundred other enzymes that utilize ATP as a phosphate donor or energy source. Protein kinases are the second most intensively screened target class, with links to all of the major therapeutic areas, most notably cancer. Important disease links for cancer and anti-infectives also are emerging for lipid kinases, carbohydrate kinases and ATPases. Despite their high pharmaceutical relevance, the rapid movement of new ATP- dependent enzyme targets into drug discovery is being hampered by a lack of flexible high throughput screening (HTS) assay methods. This problem extends into secondary screening efforts for selectivity profiling and lead optimization as well. To address this need, BellBrook Labs has developed a novel fluorescence-based immunodetection method for ADP, the invariant product of all kinase and ATPase reactions. In Phase I, we developed a monoclonal antibody and fluorescent tracer that enable detection of ADP with 100-fold selectivity over ATP using fluorescence polarization as a readout. We commercialized the ADP detection platform as the Transcreener Kinase Assay kit in November, 2005, and it has since generated revenue approaching $250,000. In Phase II we propose to 1) enhance Transcreener Kinase Assay performance by developing a more selective ADP antibody, 2) extend the platform to additional target families, including GPCRs, by developing a similar immunodetection method for GDP, 3) increase HTS market penetration by formatting the assay for a second commonly used fluorescent detection mode, TR-FRET, 4) develop bioreactor hybridoma culture methods to scale up monoclonal antibody production and reduce animal usage, 5) use the unique capabilities of the Transcreener Kinase Assay to test a) the importance of using physiological protein substrates rather than widely used peptide acceptors for kinase screening and b) the potential for off target effects of kinase inhibitors with other types of ATP-dependent enzymes. By providing pharma with the tools and strategies to implement more physiological kinase screening methods, we hope to accelerate the discovery of improved therapies for cancer and other debilitating diseases. There are over 500 distinct protein kinase proteins encoded in the human genome and they have attracted intense interest from pharmaceutical companies because of their links with numerous types of cancer, inflammatory disorders such as arthritis, and other debilitating diseases. To accelerate the discovery of improved therapies for these diseases, we are developing an enabling screening method for finding drug molecules that will correct the aberrant behavior of malfunctioning kinase proteins.",

        "abstract": "Recreation trails are a key component of the social, economic and health of rural communities. People with mobility impairments are often excluded from trails, shared-use paths, parks and other public areas where barriers are erected to prevent access by motorized trail vehicles (MTVs), to control livestock or wildlife, as an access point in a fenced area, or for a variety of other reasons. Many people who use wheelchairs, hand bikes or other personal mobility devices (PMDs) have been forced to crawl on the ground in order to enter, or cannot enter at all. As a result, vehicle barriers that are currently being used all over the country do not comply with the newest Architectural Barriers Act/Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility for gates. The research goal is to develop a trail barrier that will prevent MTVs from using recreation trails while allowing access by people who use PMDs. During Phase 1 of this research, the size and performance characteristics that distinguish between MTVs and PMDs were identified and used to develop design concepts for barriers that would be accessible to hikers who use PMDs. Phase 2 of this research will further develop and evaluate these trail vehicle barrier design concepts to verify their effectiveness in allowing access for permitted users and restricting access of prohibited trail users. Phase 2 research will also establish the commercial viability and suitability of these trail vehicle barrier designs for use in a wide variety of trail environments and by diverse land management agencies (e.g., Federal, state, local, volunteer).",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Solid-phase oligonucleotide (ON) synthesis produces a complex mixture that contains, in addition to the target sequence, a plethora of other ONs and by-products. Purification is necessary to isolate the desired sequence from these other oligonucleotides. \"Trityl-on\" purification is a standard technique for short ONs (20-40 mers). In this approach, nucleobase deprotection and cleavage from the solid support gives a mixture of oligonucleotides, some of which still bear a hydrophobic S'-dimethoxytrityl (DMT) group, which allows affinity purification on reverse phase adsorbents. Unfortunately, as the oligonucleotide becomes longer or more complex, the effectiveness of the trityl-on method diminishes. Prior attempts to make more hydrophobic DMT analogs have met with some success, have never proceeded beyond analytical scale proof-of-concept studies. Researchers who require pure oligonucleotides, especially long ones or those bearing modifications, must still resort to laborious, low-yielding purification methods. Phase I funded the development of a new class of affinity tags involving highly fluorinated (\"fluorous\") ponytails as well as a highly fluorinated chromatography adsorbent (Fluoro-Pak), for which the fluorous-tagged ONs had an unprecedented affinity, allowing the purification of ONs up to 100 nucleotides in high yield. The main objective Phase II funding is to extend the fluorous affinity purification approach to include important modified ONs, such as those bearing biotins and fluorophores. These materials are more difficult to make and purify than standard ONs, and represent a considerable challenge for scientists interested in fluorescent diagnostic probes, modified RNAs, etc. A secondary objective of Phase II Is to apply this technology to the synthesis and purification of nucleoside S'-triphosphates, which are useful as building blocks for the enzymatic synthesis of nucleic acids that are used in diagnostic and sequencing applications. Relevance to public health: Therapeutic and diagnostic oligonucleotides (small fragments of DNA and RNA) are increasingly important in the detection of genetic mutations and the treatment of disease, but they are notoriously difficult to purify from the complex mixtures that result from their synthesis. The proposed work seeks to further develop an entirely new method for oligonucleotide purification, thus streamlining the development and production of these crucial substances.",

This is the big picture in science learning -- establishing the relationship between experiments and hypotheses; the idea that theories are models and not reality, and that the test of a theory is its predictive power.  The research focuses on the careful design and testing of both the simulations and the lessons in which they are embedded, to ensure that they are as effective as possible.  Tomorrow's citizens need to know how science works. This project will help erase dangerous misconceptions about the origins and extent of scientific knowledge, and give students tools to evaluate scientific (and quasi-scientific) claims more effectively. This project also probes unusual models for both delivery of instruction and commercialization in the education world: it will use the Internet not to deliver content but to mediate a simulation and promote inter-group communication, usually within a single classroom rather than more widely; and will do so using subscriptions - a way that is cost-effective to the teacher in the short term.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chiral drugs comprise a steadily increasing percentage of new pharmaceutically-active substances, and their synthesis demands methods that can produce compounds with high stereochemical purity. Chiral alcohols are ubiquitous intermediates in the synthesis of chiral drugs, and the stereoselective reduction of ketones is therefore a reaction of central importance in the preparation of chiral pharmaeutical products. In Phase 1 an Escherichia coli host strain was developed that had genes encoding native ketoreductase enzymes deleted. This mutant strain was demonstrated to be an excellent host for expressing heterologous ketoreductase genes because the genes producing background ketoereductase activities in the host were eliminated, thereby allowing new ketoreductase enzymes to be produced without the presence of other ketone-reducing enzymes that could lead to side reactions or reduced stereoselectivity. The host was shown to be effective in carrying out whole cell reductions to produce chiral alcohols with high stereochemical purity. In Phase 2 we plan create an array of production strains incorporating at least 12 different ketoreductase genes from Saccharomyces and other organisms as single ketoreductase activities. New ketoreductase genes discovered during the course of the project may also be used to produce new production strains. The end result will be a set of host Escherichia coli strains, each containing a single ketoreductase activity. This set of newly created production strains will constitute the first set of host strains developed to contain only a single ketone-reducing enzyme activity for biotransformation. A cofactor recycling enzyme will also be cloned into the host strains, creating a set of organisms useful for the economical production of a broad range of chiral alcohols at large scale.",

In the proposed Phase II program we will focus on increasing the number of individual spots c reated in a single print cycle while maintaining a high degree of r eproducibility and minimal sample cross contamination. We will optimize linear array (1-D) SPTs containing 10 individually loaded cantilevers and then expand in a second dimension, culminating i n a planar 2-D print head for simultaneous printing of up to 100 nanoarray spots, each capable of containing a unique biomolecular species. E mphasis will be given to controlling sample spil lover (cross-contamination), spot size, printing repr oducibility and SPT-surface alignment. We will also begin to explore forward looking development in the areas of localized magnetic field cantilever control, alternative (non-microcantilever) SPT designs and soft polymer print substrates that can be used for microfluidics and for nanoar ray cloning via contact printing.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project involves the research and development of a real-time FPGA-based volume rendering system. Medical radiologists face a data overload crisis that is getting worse with each year. This crisis is caused by ongoing advances in diagnostic imaging technologies (i.e. CT, MR and ultrasound) that produce more images with higher resolution each year. Compounding this problem is the fact that the number of imaging studies is also growing each year. Current hardware and software solutions are not up to the challenge. As a result, important data is often overlooked producing inaccurate medial diagnoses. The goal of this project is to develop a low-cost FPGA-based volume render that will alleviate this data overload crisis. By eliminating data that does not contribute to 3D images, the volume Tenderer's performance will far exceed current solutions. By being based on FPGAs, the volume renderer will be upgradeable, allowing for future performance and functionality enhancements. Additionally, the renderer will support very high quality renderings through the use of higher-order gradients. Thus, the volume renderer will appeal to users in many markets, including: medical diagnostic imaging, oil exploration, security inspection and engineering simulations. One very exciting application of the 4D capabilities of the volume renderer will be in multi-slice CT cardiac imaging, enabling non-invasive procedures to be performed in place of current invasive procedures. As a consequence, the nation stands to benefit from productivity increases and improved health care. The volume renderer developed in this project will enable very large 3D and 4D data sets, generated by CT and MR scanners, to be viewed in real-time. This will make medical imaging more accurate and useful, improve the radiological workflow and speed up the discover of drugs. In addition, new high-end application such as 4D cardiac rendering will become possible.",

The resulting chromatographic media and devices will have a combination of high efficiency and robustness, making their use more effective, more efficient, and at lower cost than existing media for similar applications. The specific aims are to (1) optimize and develop chemistries for a family of coated non-wovens having ion exchange functionalities, (2) develop and demonstrate the performance of the coating process using an apparatus for continuous coating of non-woven sheet stock, (3) characterize substrates for applications to recombinant proteins, (4) build prototype devices based on the properties of the coated non-wovens and characterize performance. Purification of large biomolecules is an important component of biological research and for the production of recombinant proteins utilized for numerous applications in medicine. Conventional chromatographic media for this purpose have large pores to accommodate these large molecules. As a consequence, they are fragile and compressive making their use in column chromatography and bioprocessing difficult. Also, to minimize the compressive pressure drops produced by buffer flow, the particle size of the media need to be large (50-100 ? dia.). The large particle size and small diffusion coefficients of large molecules within the particle pores reduces efficiency of the separation process. Potential innovations of this project address the inherent problems with existing technology. This research will result in new, low cost materials and technology for purification and isolation of recombinant proteins and large biomolecules. Potential commercial applications of this project are (a) coated non-woven materials for anion and cation exchange chromatography, (b) coated non-woven materials for affinity chromatography, (c) low cost, disposable devices for scale-up chromatography, and (d) application specific licenses to companies involved in membrane products. The relevance of the proposed research to public heath is for the accelerated and improved development of therapeutic drugs that are being developed to eliminate suffering and death due to cancer.

Despite the obvious medical importance, there presently are no effective therapies to control excess mucus secretion in these diseases, and very few potential therapeutic targets. We discovered that a specific protein called MARCKS is a key molecule in the mucus secretary pathway. Based on this finding BioMarck developed a novel peptide, which inhibited mucus hypersecretion in human airway epithelial cells in culture and in a rodent model of asthma. With funding from SBIR Phase I and Phase II grants, BioMarck continued work on this project, has accomplished GMP manufacturing of a peptide (BIO-11006) that inhibits MARCKS, and successfully finished the nondinical safety studies of BIO-11006 in order to support an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA. This SBIR Phase II Competing Continuation grant application, if funded, will allow BioMarck to file an IND with FDA and conduct a dose-escalating, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 1 clinical trial in 56 healthy volunteers designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BIO-11006. This will be followed by testing BIO-11006 efficacy and pharmacodynamics in 184 COPD patients in a multi-center double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial. This project, if successful will lead to commercialization of BIO-11006 by providing data required for further expanded clinical trials in collaboration with a large pharmaceutical company.

This application proposes the development of a simple, easy-to-use software package for shielded facility design and effective dose determination. Such a package will allow the user to evaluate a range of different shielding scenarios in which materials and/or layout are iteratively altered. This capability is prohibitively laborious and tedious with existing hand calculation approaches. The proposed software package will launch by icon from the users computer desktop using a pre-installed JAVA application. All details regarding radiation sources, facility and detector/phantom locations will be supplied by the user via an easy-to-use design interface. The software will then interpret all entries and assemble an appropriate input file to be run with the MCNP Monte Carlo code. Use of the MCNP code as the simulation engine allows full 3D modeling of the realistic scenario, including many radiation types, creation of secondary particles and full accounting for all interaction processes, something not possible with existing approaches. In addition, users will be able to calculate effective dose equivalent, also not possible with the hand calculation approach which provides estimates of exposure or air kerma. All simulations will be performed on multiple tiered secure servers, freeing the user's computer for other tasks and limiting unauthorized access to the MCNP code.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oral candidiasis (oropharyngeal candidosis or thrush) is a common infection in immunosuppressed individuals, and, if not blunted, can transit to esophageal candidosis or life-threatening candidemia. These potentially life-threatening fungal infections originate from the endogenous flora of the individual. For cancer patients, radiation therapy or chemotherapy further suppresses the immune system and causes the patient to become more susceptible to oral candidiasis and/or systemic fungal infections (fungemia, a fungal infection disseminated by the blood). Oral candidiasis is generally treated with systemic antifungals or oral rinses. Fluconazole tablets and clotrimazole troches are the most popular therapies. Fluconazole is indicated for use for the treatment of oral candidiasis with a single daily dose for two weeks. However, certain Candida organisms in biofilms have a dramatically reduced susceptibility to antifungal drugs including Fluconazole. Furthermore, side effects of Fluconazole include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headaches, dizziness, drowsiness, fever, diarrhea, rash and changes in the sense of taste. The most serious effect is liver toxicity but this usually reverses after treatment when the drug is stopped. Nonetheless, the scope and severity of the side effects can cause some patients not to be compliant with their prescribed drug regimen. Clotrimazole is used 4 to 5 times daily for 1 to 2 weeks. Its side effects include an altered sense of taste, nausea, and an upset stomach. Once again, patient compliance with the prescribed drug regimen can be an issue not only because of the side effects but also because the patient must take 4 to 5 doses daily. The goal of this project is to develop a safe effective mouthwash without side effects to treat oral candidiasis in head and neck cancer patients. The Specific Aims include implementing current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) including long-term stability studies, filing an Investigational New Drug application with the FDA, and conducting clinical efficacy trials in cancer patients to demonstrate efficacy. Candida spp. exist in 40-80% of normal individuals in the mouth, intestines, and vagina. However, Candida spp. are extremely opportunistic and if immune systems are compromised and the environment changes, Candida spp. can begin to rapidly multiply resulting in candidiasis and engender a potentially deadly disease. Given the large numbers of cancer patients worldwide, coupled with other high risk immuno- compromised individuals such as patients infected with HIV, along with the growing number of patients with xerostomia (dry mouth), a safe effective mouth rinse without side effects could have profound public health benefits.",

Develop new methodologies for rate filtering over small geographies, incorporation of spatial interactions among neighborhoods into multi-level analysis, assessment and propagation of the uncertainty attached to filtered rates through the statistical analysis. 4. Build and test a complete set of functionalities based on the research results and simulation studies, and incorporate them into Biomedware's space-time visualization and analysis technology. 5. Apply the software and methods to demonstrate the approach and its unique benefits for the measurement, mapping, detection and explanation of health disparities. 6. Create instructional materials, including a short course, to foster the adoption of this approach in health science. Feasibility of this project was demonstrated in Phase I. This Phase II project will accomplish aims three through six. These technologic, scientific and commercial innovations will revolutionize our ability to interprete geographic variation in cancer disparities, detect changes in space (e.g. cluster or anomalies) or through time (e.g. change in health disparities following strategies to improve cancer prevention and early detection), and to better understand the causes underlying observed racial disparities in cancer incidence, mortality and morbidity.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We believe therapeutic effect is enhanced when hyperthermia and radiation therapies are delivered simultaneously and when these two modalities are focused efficiently into the target disease. In Phase I, we constructed applicators that combine the uniform heating capabilities of conformal microwave array (CMA) printed circuit board applicators with an improved patient interface that allows positioning of HDR radiation sources for simultaneous brachytherapy of superficial tissue disease. We investigated the feasibility of using these applicators for treatment of large-area chestwall recurrence, studying radiation dosimetry and analyzing interactions between heat and brachytherapy components. While meeting our objectives for Phase I, we identified key improvements needed to reproduce and distribute the device commercially. The goal of Phase II is to complete design optimization and begin clinical evaluation of the combination applicator. To accomplish this, we propose three specific tasks: 1) Refine applicator design based on clinical requirements, 2) Optimize design based on manufacturing considerations, and 3) Evaluate combination applicator performance in both laboratory and clinical use. We will upgrade current CMA designs to include heating arrays that shape power delivery to fit typically contoured anatomy with non-rectangular \"vest\" shape applicators . We will refine bolus design to promote rapid flow of cooling water evenly distributed across the treatment surface. We will integrate adjustable air bladders and elastic garments into the structure to insure precise positioning of heating and brachytherapy sources over contoured anatomy. Once clinical needs have been addressed, we will optimize device design for manufacturability. By the end of Phase II, we will have a device that meets all clinical requirements for effective hyperthermia and brachytherapy delivery. We will have established appropriate treatment protocols and verified clinical performance. And we will have manufacturing capability to produce applicators that meet the needs of the cancer treatment community.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II Small Business Innovative Research application proposes to dramatically expand the commercial availability of optical coherence tomography (OCT) technology for pre-clinical human and animal research applications by commercializing Fourier-domain OCT (FD-OCT) technology and developing robust interfaces for retinal OCT imaging in a wide variety of subject classes. Fourier domain OCT (FD-OCT) is a recent innovation which has significant advantages in sensitivity and robustness compared to conventional time-domain OCT (TD-OCT) systems. In the Phase I project, a novel Swept Source OCT (SS-OCT) system for retinal imaging was proposed and implemented, however the system performance was hampered by the availability of swept laser components at the 830nm wavelength, resulting in low power and a slow sweep rate. Simultaneous with development of the swept-source 830nm laser by a subcontractor, a second retinal imager based on Spectral Domain OCT (SD-OCT) was successfully developed at Bioptigen. SD-OCT is an alternative form of FD-OCT, in which a broad band light source and a spectrometer are used in place of a rapidly swept laser source. The Bioptigen SD-OCT imager exhibited outstanding performance, with 6 micrometer axial resolution, 106 dB of SNR at a real-time image update rate of 17 images per second (at 1000 axial lines per image), and user-friendly software.     The proposed Phase II project will continue the development of our high-performance SD-OCT retinal scanner system, adding additional functionality and moving the system from an engineering beta prototype to a commercial system. Our team of investigators, subcontractors, and consultants includes experts in optoelectronic component manufacturing (the basis of OCT technology), optical sensing, one of the original developers of OCT systems for retinal and anterior segment imaging, and a leading expert in human and animal research applications of OCT.     The specific aims of the proposal are to: 1. Design and build a production prototype 820 nm SD-OCT engine, 2. Develop high speed \"OCT Fundus\" imaging, 3. Build a modular platform interface for non-contact imaging in humans and research animals, 4. Develop handheld SD-OCT probes for contact imaging in humans and research animals, and 5. Develop and test an enhanced software suite for the OCT retinal scanner.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persons with asthma are characterized by hyper-responsive airways, tissue inflammation, airway remodeling and the consequent impaired mucociliary transport. This proposal is based on the hypothesis that the IL-4 and IL-13 activated STAT6 pathway is up-regulated in persons with atopic asthma and subsequently responsible for pathogenic epithelial functional changes with the consequent impairment of mucociliary clearance. The relatively high specificity of this pathway to airway respiratory epithelial cells indicates that an immortalized epithelial cell line with functional over-expression of STAT6 binding motif together with a STAT6 activation luminescent reporter will provide an enabling platform to search for modifiers of this pathway and thus \"druggable\" target sites. Additionally, the utility of this cell line will be markedly enhanced by using it in fluorescence-based mechanistic physiological assays coincidentally with, or immediately following the primary screening of new chemical entity's (NCE's) which either activate or suppress the IL-4 or IL-13 activated STAT6 pathway. In Phase I of this Project we developed and validated the genomic sequence the first stable IL-4 elicited \"hyper-responsive\" human bronchial epithelial cell line by incorporating 5 tandem copies of human C/EBP-STAT6 binding motif into the chromosome with reportable luciferase activities, designated, sub-D1 BEAS-2a. The Z-score of the resulting sub-D1BEAS-2a cell line based on luciferase measurements was 0.65; well within the applicable range for use in cell-based high throughput screening drug discovery platform. In Phase II, we propose to a) further validate the molecular signal transduction of this IL-4, IL-13, activated STAT6 pathway in the sub-D1 BEAS-2a cell line, b) subsequently demonstrate that this cell line is suitable for high throughput screening (HTS) drug discovery using both the luciferase assay as well as the fluorescent functional assays of intracellular ions and cell membrane potential as predictors of pathogenic changes in respiratory airway epithelial cellular function; and (c) establish the primary and secondary cell banks of sub-D1 BEAS-2a. This project will broadly impact drug discovery research in asthma, allergy and inflammation. Its applications address the needs and missions of the SBIR solicitations by several institutes of the NIH. These applications include: 1) the understanding and treatment of COPD and asthma at NHLBI; 2) the Asthma, Allergy and Inflammation Program at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and 3) the development and use of new assays based on molecular targets that interact with signal transduction (NCI).",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): BioTechPlex proposes to develop a high content, high throughput, cell-based screening system for drug discovery using epithelial cells. This system will enable the dynamic responses of multiple cellular fluorophore-repo\nrtable molecular species to be simultaneously measured in a 96 well plate. The dynamic responses will be measured in a time frame consistent with the temporal nature of the respective intracellular kinetic processes. The activation or inhibition of a targe\nt site will be determined with high specificity following the characterization and classification of the dynamic  fingerprint  from three fluorescent probes. In Phase I, BioTechPlex developed the optics and the firmware of the Multi-Fluorophore Acousto Opt\nic Plate Reader (MAPR(tm)) system. MAPR simultaneously measures three fluorescent signals from 96 cell samples with a dwell time of 10 ms per well. In Phase II, BioTechPlex will further develop MAPR, add bioinformatics data base, Al decision making and val\nidate the entire system making. This will be achieved by accomplishing the following 3 objectives. 1) Add fluid handling and environmental conditioning to MAPR by incorporating robotic plate and liquid handling as well as temperature and atmospheric regula\ntion. 2) Develop Target Identification Algorithms that will classify, characterize and file the unique identifiers of the dynamics of three fluorophores as well as extract this information for target identification and decision marking. 3) Validate the com\nplete MAPR system using normal, pathologic and engineered respiratory epithelial cell lines prior to and following perturbation of muscarinic, adrenergic and IPS receptor activated signal transduction pathways which predictably perturb intracellular ions a\nnd thus plasma membrane potential. This enabling technology will provide the pharmaceutical industry a novel, multi-probe cell-based platform for high content screening and high-throughput drug screening for drug discovery, validation, and cytotoxicity. Th\nis system addresses the needs of FDA (funded by FDA). In addition, the project directly responds to the NIH Roadmap Initiatives released in 2004. This project also directly responds to the 2005 SBIR general solicitations by NCRR for the development of high\n throughput screening technologies as well as by NIDDK for general interest in epithelial biology.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will continue development of a novel optical probe for non-invasive characterization and monitoring of the biochemical and morphological changes in oral cavity epithelium leading to dysplasia and ultimately to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Oral squamous cell carcinoma is a pathological condition that kills approximately half of patients afflicted within five years of diagnosis and may leave surviving patients with severe aesthetic and/or functional compromises. Early detection of oral precancerous lesions can have a dramatic impact on oral cancer mortality rates, increasing survival rates from 50% to about 80%. Current methods of oral cancer screening include visual assessment enhanced by application of acetic acid solution or stains such as toluidine blue or Lugol iodine. Definitive assessment is by invasive excisional biopsy. Visual assessment suffers from a wide variability in perception between clinicians and is unable to detect extremely early signs of neoplastic transformation. Biopsy can only be used sparingly. In this proposal we will combine the power of tissue autofluorescence imaging, (which is highly sensitive to biochemical changes associated with very early neoplastic transformation) with optical coherence tomography (which provides detailed sub-surface morphological information.) By combining these two modalities, we can leverage the speed and sensitivity of fluorescence imaging to direct the highly specific application of OCT imaging. In this way we produce an instrument which can be used for rapid and definitive screening or diagnosis of oral pathology. We will characterize the utility of the instrument in a study of 80 patients in the UTMB ENT clinic. Finally, while we have focused this application on oral cancer, the FIG-OCT system will have wide application in a number of other tissues as well including cervix, bladder, colon, and upper GI tract.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Public health experts have identified smoking cessation as the most cost-effective tobacco control strategy. Smoking cessation support delivered by health care professionals can be a highly effective means of reaching out proactively to smokers and helping them quit. Pharmacists are in an ideal position to advise and influence smokers regarding nicotine related therapy and to counsel smokers. Yet, pharmacists experience significant barriers to providing consistent, high-quality supports to smokers, including; time limitations, lack of training in effective counseling techniques and lack of reimbursement for counseling smokers (Ossip-Klein et al., 2000). This software system will provide basic training in pharmacy based smoking cessation counseling, save pharmacist time by conducting relevant assessments and provide high quality feedback to the smoker. The goal of this Phase II application is to finalize development and test the efficacy of the computer-based expert system (\"Exper_Quit\") developed in our Phase I project. Specifically, our goals are: 1) to increase the frequency with which pharmacists address smoking cessation in their interaction with customers, and 2) to increase the number of smokers who will be successful when making a quit attempt. The first six months of the project will be devoted to finalizing programming, coding, testing and writing content for the additional assessment and feedback components. Efficacy of the system will be tested at a HMO-based pharmacy. Exit interview data will be collected from smokers to assess the extent of pharmacist counseling for smoking with no intervention (observation only: OBS). Pharmacists will then be trained in providing smoking cessation counseling. Two additional groups of smokers will recruited by pharmacists and randomly assigned to either the TEST or CONTROL conditions. TEST participants will complete assessments, receive personalized feedback and a matching pharmacist report and be counseled by the pharmacist. These subjects will return in 1 month for a follow-up Exper_Quit assessment and to receive feedback on their progress. CONTROL participants will complete the baseline assessment but will not receive feedback and no pharmacist report will be printed. Exit interviews will document the extent of pharmacist counseling. All subjects will complete 2 and 6 month follow up assessments. Cessation (7 day point-prevalence abstinence) will be verified by saliva cotinine at month 6.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been identified as a key mediator of tumor angiogenesis and has emerged as the single most commonly upregulated angiogenic factor in both grafted and naturally occurring tumors. VEGF exerts its biological activity by binding to its tyrosine kinase receptors, VEGF-R1 (Flt-1) and VEGF-R2 (Flk-1/KDR). Preclinical studies have examined the biological activities of different types of VEGF antagonists, including anti-VEGF neutralizing antibodies, soluble versions of the receptor molecules, and inhibitors of VEGF-R2 tyrosine kinase. In each case, significant inhibition of tumor growth and reduced vasculature was observed. We propose to prepare and evaluate long acting versions of one of these antagonists, specifically VEGF-R1 receptor (Flt-1). During Phase I we identified sites in the soluble portion of Flt-1 (sFlt-1) that can be modified with a polyethylene glycol moiety without significantly affecting the protein's in vitro bioactivity. In addition, pharmacokinetic studies were performed in rats to verify that the addition of an inert polymer extends the circulating half-life of sFlt-1. During Phase II, we will manufacture sufficient quantities of the modified sFlt-1 proteins for testing in a number of animal models of cancer. Based on our previous work, these modified sFlt-1 proteins should be superior to unmodified preparations of recombinant soluble Flt-1. In particular we expect to see improved stability, higher potency with less frequent dosing, greater solubility and reduced antigenicity. These improved biological and physical characteristics should expedite pre-clinical and clinical evaluation of sFlt-1 as an anti-angiogenesis agent.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the United States and adversely affects the health of both adults and children. While dieting and exercise have had little effect on the overall problem, dramatic long-term weight loss has been achieved by gastric bypass surgery. The risk of complications and death limits this surgery to only the morbidly obese. However studies indicate that a concomitant marked suppression of plasma ghrelin levels is a likely physiologic basis for the effectiveness of this surgical procedure. Ghrelin is an octanoylated peptide that is produced by the empty stomach, enters the circulation and then passes into the brain to trigger a hunger response. This project uses actively and passively administered antibodies that can intercept ghrelin in the blood stream. Those antibodies will tightly bind to ghrelin or catalytically inactivate the hormone so that it cannot enter the brain and induce hunger. Thus by reducing ghrelin levels, immunotherapy should mimic the gastric bypass results of quelling hunger and controlling obesity. A vaccine therapeutic for obesity would have high commercial value. Mice and monkeys produced anti-ghrelin antibodies after immunization with the different ghrelin-based vaccines generated for this research. The monkeys are healthy and show no autoimmune disease even though ghrelin is a self-antigen. Mouse monoclonal antibodies were produced against native ghrelin and a ghrelin transition state analog. The later is designed to elicit catalytic antibodies which will inactivate ghrelin by cleaving its octanoyl ester. When mice were stimulated to secrete ghrelin by fasting overnight, they ate less food in the morning if injected i.p. with a monoclonal anti-ghrelin antibody versus saline. Ghrelin-specific, human, single chain antibodies have been obtained from a yeast recombinatoral display library. Safety of these novel immunotherapeutic agents will be tested in monkeys. Those human single chain antibodies can then be evaluated for suppressing hunger and reducing obesity in patients.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project deals with the ever-increasing burden placed on the microelectronics industry as computational speeds increase. While the number-density-speed of transistors doubles every 18-24 months (a phenomenon known as Moore's Law), the ability to retrieve and store data from external sources is not increasing nearly as quickly. The performance improvement rate of key computing tasks such as simulation, signal processing and database searches is becoming limited by off-chip bandwidth. Approaches such as \"flip-chip bumping\" are not a panacea, because despite their small size, these structures leak signals to one another; a significant performance detriment. The company has developed a novel MicroCoax interconnect technology to address these problems, utilizing existing semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure. The research objectives are to gain insights into MicroCoax fundamentals and understand application specific issues within market segments that are most impacted by current technological limitations. Research will focus on continuing exploration of MicroCoax material set, process flow, integration, and reliability, along with specific application to three distinct market spaces namely, MMICs, High-speed Digital/Optoelectronics, and high-frequency test.  Electronics technology impacts nearly every person on earth in some way. Even folks living in remote places are subject to natural disasters, which may be predicted by atmospheric and geological simulation and warning systems, allowing timely evacuation. Goods distribution and logistics are increasingly dependent on computationally intensive database search and tracking. Medical diagnosis and treatment rely increasingly on signal processing for imaging and therapeutics. High-bandwidth wireless systems allow for recovery of communication infrastructure following floods and hurricanes. All of the aforementioned technologies have high-speed electronic systems at their core, and MicroCoax can affect them all. High-bandwidth systems are quite expensive today, in large part because of interconnects based on machined waveguides and significant labor content associated with such approaches. If successful the proposed technology, MicroCoax, can eliminate much of the cost, making such systems more commercially viable and ubiquitous. While a disruptive technology such as MicroCoax will be invisible to the average user, electronics designers and will be able to expand their application horizons due to elimination of prohibitive cost constraints. Electronics, semiconductor, communications and related industries will stall without continued innovation in packaging and interconnect strategies. The economic implications are significant, as worldwide electronics sales number somewhere around US$1.3 trillion at this time.",

We will investigate Nd:Yttria ceramics as solid-state laser materials. Initial testing will be done at the primary emission wavelength of 1.07 ?m.

The optimized ceramic materials developed will be used for laser experiments at 914nm and 946nm. Initial experiments will be carried out at reduced temperature (77K). After successful demonstration of low-temperature lasing at 914nm/946nm, the possibility of efficient lasing at higher temperatures (up to 300K) will be explored.

Ultra-high bandwidth will be needed to achieve this transfer.  While the bandwidth is available in network link technology, transport architectural inefficiencies severely limit the throughput attainable over such links.  This project will develop an innovative network transport mechanism, Transport Control Protocol-Fiber (TCPF) technology, that allows networking at full link speed over an ultra high-speed network.  The approach deals with network data transport inefficiencies by providing intelligent, fast, and accurate network measurement, and employs a hardware-assisted approach for congestion control adjustment.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility and potential of the TCPF technology by using a real-world 10 Gigabit network testbed.  For file transfers, network utilization improved by a factor of nine.  Phase II will focus on optimization of the TCPF design, development/experimentation of the ultra high speed advanced network measurements, development of full-scale TCPF software, development of the TCPF Network Interface Card hardware, integration/testing/evaluation of the system prototype, and evaluation of commercial scenarios.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The Transport Control Protocol-Fiber should enable large-scale distributed scientific applications such as environmental monitoring, energy physics, nuclear energy, computational genomics, climate modeling.  It also should have significant commercial value in inter-networking applications such as private enterprise networks, distributed multimedia networks, and entertainment network applications.

The introduction of computer graphics, together with force-feedback (haptic) devices, has the potential to further improve clinical training across a broad range of skills acquisition. Given that a restorative dental procedure is a planned intervention in a complex 3-D space, the application of these technologies would allow the student and clinician alike to practice skills acquisition in a virtual 3D world. The aim of this project is to further develop and evaluate a computer-based simulation system for dental procedures. Our Phase I project was successful in demonstrating technical feasibility of all specific aims of the project. This novel system integrated 3D registered multimodal imaging data (microCT and microgrinding), presented the user with an interactive, stereoscopic, 3D computer-generated reconstruction of the imaging data in a 3D space, and allowed for the interaction with that dataset with a number of virtual instruments while generating real-time haptic feedback at over 1000 updates per second using a unique, advanced distributed processing system. The advanced core technologies developed in this system would be leveraged for this Phase II SBIR to produce a useful, no-nonsense, clinically-validated simulation of the complete variety of tooth preparations that clinicians would typically encounter. Such a system would be useful for initial training of dental students; would provide for objective, quantitative metrics for student evaluation; and would be useful for continual training, evaluation and retraining of clinicians in practice.",

        "abstract": "Recently completed electromagnetic analysis and synthesis codes have been used to generate efficient designs for Vlasov-Denisov-type quasi-optical (QO) launchers in gyrotrons.  However, significant improvements still can be achieved over existing QO launcher and mirror transmission approaches.  Examples of advanced QO launcher concepts include compact QO launchers, coaxial mode QO launchers, step-tunable launchers, and systems for direct coupling of cavity mode power to corrugated waveguide.  In this project, existing codes, developed for the analysis and design of Vlasov-Denisov type QO launchers, will be modified to increase capability and computational speed.  These codes will then be used to design advanced QO launcher systems that are relevant for gyrotrons for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, the DIII-D tokamak at General Atomics, and the ASDEX tokamak in Germany.  In Phase I, the QO launcher analysis and synthesis codes were extended to increase their speed and capability.  Using the extended synthesis code, a large improvement was achieved in the design of a two-frequency launcher.  The extended analysis code allowed a rapid calculation of scattering.  Phase II will perform additional optimization and extensions of the QO launcher analysis and synthesis codes.  The improved codes will be used to design a compact launcher and a multi-frequency coax launcher.  The launchers then will be built and tested.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The QO launcher systems should reduce electron-cyclotron heating-system costs by approximately 10%, allowing gyrotron systems to be more compact.  The technology also should increase the efficiency of launcher systems and deliver more power to the tokamak plasma.  Other applications include the stabilization of neoclassical tearing modes, plasma diagnostics, and spectroscopy (including electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy).",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Refractive surgery is the most rapidly evolving discipline in ophthalmology today, with 1.2 million procedures performed in 2002. The emergence of phakic intraocular lens (PIOL) technology expands the capabilities of refractive surgery to address higher level of myopic and hyperopic corrections than were previously possible. Despite careful preoperative measurements and calculations of required lens power, errors in the effective implanted lens power, and thus the degree of refractive correction, are similar to errors seen in cataract IOL patients.    In addition to imprecise IOL power determinations, uncorrected visual acuity is often limited by pre-existing or induced astigmatism, making it necessary for the PIOL patient to continue with some form of spectacle correction or undergo an additional refractive surgical procedure to become spectacle-free.    The objective of this program is to develop a light adjustable acrylic phakic intraocular lens for use in refractive surgery. Using the Company's proprietary technology, any residual spherical or cylindrical refractive errors can be corrected post-operatively in a simple, non-invasive procedure to insure the phakic IOL patient achieves freedom from the need for spectacle correction.    Upon successful completion of this project, the Company will be able to commercialize a PIOL for hyperopia (+3 D to 15 D) and myopia (-3 to -20 D), including astigmatism correction of up to 3.0 D. In Phase II, we propose to further study the selected material to optimize the soft acrylic LAL formulation, develop the irradiation conditions to produce predictable myopic, hyperopic and astigmatic changes in refractive power, establish the biological safety of the material through toxicity, animal implant and stability studies, and to evaluate phakic lens designs for feasibility testing purposes. Phase III of the project will include US clinical studies, leading to PMA approval and commercial sales.",

The injectable, accommodating light adjustable intraocular lens system proposed to address presbyopia in the cataract patient is comprised of an injectable, gel-filled capsular lens with an adjustable, anterior capsule supported intraocular lens (AC-LAL). The AC-LAL is formulated from Calhoun Vision's proprietary light adjustable silicone material which allows for in situ post-operative refractive correction of pre-existing and induced spherical and astigmatic errors. The capsular gel lens with modulus mimicking the young human lens promotes restoration of natural accommodative ability for cataract patients.    The primary goal of this Phase II proposal is to demonstrate the in vivo performance of the proposed adjustable, injectable intraocular lens system in a primate model. This will be accomplished by: (1) Optimization of UV-absorbing gel material from Phase I for mechanical and optical properties, (2) Develop the AC-LAL design based upon proprietary light adjustable materials, (3) Demonstrate the safety of the AC-LAL and gel material through biocompatibility studies, (4) Develop prototype packaging for sterile gel delivery into the eye, (5) Conduct in vitro testing to demonstrate accommodative amplitude, (6) Conduct rabbit studies to evaluate posterior capsule opacification with the proposed lens system, and (7) Demonstrate accommodation amplitude of the optimized adjustable, injectable lens system in a primate model.    Presbyopia is a progressive, age-related loss of accommodation affecting 100 percent of the population which is characterized by the noticeable loss of near vision at the age of 40-45 years with complete loss of accommodation by the age of 50. Conventional treatment has been limited to reading glasses, bifocals or contact lenses. Calhoun Vision's proposed adjustable, injectable silicone intraocular lens incorporating our proprietary light adjustable lens (LAL) material technology may provide for the restoration of accommodative power with in situ post-implantation refraction correction to provide the patient with true spectacle independence for both near and distance vision.",

        "abstract": "The number of genes in the genome of higher organisms is relatively small; however, the protein complexity arising from these genes has been shown to be much higher.  In part, this is due to alternative splice variants that are created during the processing of gene transcripts.  The formation of gene splice variants has implications for human disease (for example, in cancer susceptibility) and also for medical diagnostics, drug development, and bioengineering.  However, there are hundreds of thousands of exons for each higher organism, which imposes a technical problem of generating millions of exon-specific detection reagents.  This project will advance gene splice variant detection and quantitation by utilizing a small library of a few thousand universal-probe reagents and universal-probe microarrays, sufficient to analyze any gene from any organism.  In Phase I, efficient assay designs and analysis software were developed, and accurate exon detection was demonstrated on 11 genes.  Accurate exon detection was also demonstrated on pools of 10 cDNA clones representing 10 distinct genes.  Over 300 cDNA clones (~1Mb of DNA) from 6 human tissues were efficiently analyzed using this new splice variant analysis method.   Phase II will develop fully functional prototypes and user-friendly protocols, and perform end-user-directed testing of:  (1) pre-made probe pools for human genes; (2) on-demand probe pools for gene mixes and genes from other organisms; and (3) a universal set of labeled probe pools for multiplex detection of DNA clones or amplicons longer than 100 bp.  The technical goal is to provide novel or improved chips, probe reagents, assay kits, and software, underlying all three products.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Pre-made or easy made-on-demand-labeled gene probe cocktails, combined with universal 6-mer microarrays, would have many research and diagnostic applications, including fundamental studies of gene expression control, organism development and evolution, understanding disease susceptibility and progression such as in cancer, drug development for gene expression control, and agricultural and industrial research.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cellerant has successfully completed the Phase I feasibility research for the development of a neutrophil progenitor for the treatment of neutropenia e.g. during bone marrow transplantation, chemotherapy or after radiation exposure. In Phase I, the company demonstrated that human hematopoietic stem cells could serve as the seed inoculum for an 8 day production process that yields high levels of cultured myeloid progenitors (MPc). These progenitors can, in the presence of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, go on to full neutrophil maturation, showing that they are poised to colonize the patient?s immune cell reservoirs. In a mouse model of neutropenia, ex vivo expanded murine MPc protected irradiated mice from lethal fungal infection, whether given in an autologous (matched) or allogeneic (mismatched) setting. Furthermore, infusion of pooled MPc derived from several MHC disparate donors is as effective as MPc derived from a single allogeneic donor. Ex vivo expanded human MPc were introduced into an immune-restricted mouse model and the transfused cells proceeded towards neutrophil maturation rapidly. These accomplishments clearly indicate that the ex vivo expanded MPc product can be produced from human stem cells to yield a highly purified, potentially safe and effective cellular therapy. In Phase II, Cellerant will focus on addressing the most critical of preclinical tasks. The Specific Aims will be: 1. development of cryopreservative methods, 2. optimization of culture medium and conditions, 3. evaluation of persistence and long term effects, and 4. evaluation of the risk of HLA sensitization. The accomplishment of these Specific Aims will support Cellerant in a meeting with FDA representatives on the regulation of MPc. If successfully approved for sale and successfully advanced to large scale production this cellular therapy would be a novel universal treatment that provides temporary but effective protection from fungal and bacterial infections of neutropenic patients. PROGRAM NARRATIVE Neutropenic patients at risk for lethal fungal and bacterial infections as a result of pre- transplantation conditioning, radiotherapy or chemotherapy have few effective alternatives for treatment. The successful development of a commercially available, universal Myeloid Progenitor cell therapy will have a significant positive impact on the survival of this population. The availability of a safe and effective, ?off-the-shelf? treatment will also have a significant positive impact on the ability of local and federal governments to respond to mass casualties as a result of a nuclear power plant accident, terrorist detonation, or other localized radiological disasters.",

The most mature retrofit technology available for mercury collection is the injection of a sorbent such as powdered activated carbon.  Unfortunately, carbon injection technology is accompanied by high concentrations of mercury in the fly ash, (an important by-product that is used in concrete), which renders the fly ash unacceptable for concrete use.  This project will develop reaction-bonded, castable ceramic materials, made with high carbon/mercury content fly ash, that can replace concrete in commercially viable applications.  In Phase I, it was demonstrated that various types of fly ash, containing excess activated carbon and mercury could be made into strong reaction-bonded, castable ceramic materials through the selection of activators, water content, and curing temperature.  The reaction not only generated strong bonding materials, but effectively encapsulated both the mercury and activated carbon, rendering the new cement composition environmentally benign and suitable for use in various concrete applications.  Phase II will further characterize and optimize the engineering properties of the materials, including compressive strength, workability, freeze-thaw resistance, indirect tensile strength, elastic constants, etc.  These properties will be compared against the standards developed for current fly ash concrete and Portland cement based concrete.

        "abstract": "The development of processes to convert lignocellulosic biomass into ethanol and other chemicals is being enthusiastically pursued by the federal government as well as by private organizations.  However, before these processes can be made cost effective, new materials are needed that are resistant to abrasion and corrosion in the aggressive streams associated with lignocellulosic processing \u00bf for example, in the removal of suspended solids from the hydrolysate produced in the pretreatment of biomass.  This project will develop low-cost inorganic microfiltration membranes that have the requisite abrasion resistance and chemical durability for use in the clarification of hydrolysate generated during pretreatment.  In Phase I, membrane fabrication and synthesis parameters were developed on laboratory-scale, ceramic membrane coupons.  The performance of the new membrane was then demonstrated on a pretreated, corn stover hydrolysate sample.  In Phase II, the membranes will be further optimized and scaled to produce pilot-scale elements.  Field testing of the membrane elements will be conducted on hydrolysate streams.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new membranes should find use in the separation and isolation of the sugars produced during the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass.  If chemicals can be produced from biomass sugars, the process of converting biomass to ethanol would become more cost effective, providing Americans with an abundant supply of fuel and reducing the need to import petroleum.  Other applications of the membrane technology include clarification processes in the production of sweeteners, sugars, and fruit juices",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Particle adhesion to tissue (vascular endothelium) depends critically upon particle/cell property (size, receptors), scale/geometric features of vasculature (diameter, bifurcation, etc.) and local hemodynamic factors (stress, torque etc). Currently, this is investigated using in-vitro parallel-plate flow chambers which suffer from several serious limitations including (a) idealized, macrocirculatory scaling (b) lack of critical morphological features (junctions, network), healthy vs. diseased vasculature and (c) large volumes (several ml) and (d) contamination due to non-disposability. We propose to develop a novel microfluidics-based platform for cell/drug-particle adhesion which overcomes these limitations In Phase I, anatomically detailed microvascular network structures were obtained from in-vivo image data and patterned onto a plastic, disposable substrate (PDMS). Perfusion and particle adhesion studies were successfully carried-out and the data was analyzed using high-fidelity computational models. The presence of significant stagnant regions, non-intuitive particle and flow splits, spatially non-uniform adhesion as well as first evidence of dependence of particle adhesion on vessel branching angle were identified and documented. In addition, endothelial cells were cultured on the PDMS and success was demonstrated with the upregulation of adhesion molecule (P-selectin) and subsequent adhesion of anti-P-selectin coated particle to the cultured endothelial cells. Net usage of reagents was decreased by over two orders of magnitude. Phase I results clearly established the value of using the proposed microvascular environment to gain new insights and make quantitative predictions on particle adhesion in the microvasculature. The Phase II efforts will include (a) expansion of the in-vivo network databases (and idealizations) (b) adhesion studies using micro/nano particles and endothelial/cancer cells and (c) validation against intra-vital measurements and analysis with computational models. By enabling the study of particle/cell-tissue interactions under controlled conditions that truly mimic the microvascular environment, the final Phase II product will advance drug discovery and delivery research in a variety of therapeutic areas including inflammation, allergy/infectious disease, cardiovascular disease and cancer among others. A multidisciplinary team has been assembled with expertise in microcirculation and cell adhesion research, microfabrication/microfluidics, computational modeling and intra-vital microscopy.",

Phase I resulted in the manufacture of the EP-Horizontal expanding the visual field of hemianopes by 20 degrees into the unseeing area. One approach in Phase II is to increase expansion modestly with the use of higher power prisms and move field into midline view. A second approach introduces a more complex device that could expand the visual field by more than 40 degrees using prisms in excess of 80 diopters, also arranging them to shift images to midline, the area important for general mobility and driving. These prism components will be incorporated into a pair of eyeglasses, effectively doubling the expansion of the current design. Arranged properly, this configuration would safely allow victims of stroke, brain trauma and tumor (many young and otherwise healthy) to enjoy a vast increase in mobility, occupational choices, and potentially regain their ability to drive without endangering themselves or others. These devices will be evaluated in Multi-center clinical trials and driving simulator studies using various prism powers, angles and components. These evaluations will determine the optimal configuration of the final design. One component to be tested is the ComPrism designed to reduce the chromatic aberration inherent in high power prisms. Fitting and prescribing protocols will be established. Although the actual number of Hemianopes and Quadranopes is unknown, extrapolating data of stroke and head trauma cases indicate the number to be over a million per year in the U.S. alone. Hemianopes are totally unseeing in half their visual field. One year after the incident, only half this population has returned to work. The condition causes victims to run into obstacles on the blind side and they are afraid of being in crowded places. Significant Phase 2 improvements can be made to our current, Phase I, EP-Horizontal design to allow people with field loss to regain their place in the workforce and society.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of dental implant procedures are performed in the US every year, increasing at an estimated rate of 20% per year. There is an increasing demand in clinical dentistry communities for a new implant system that offers accelerated tissue-implant integration and improved treatment application in more challenging cases. During Phase I and post-Phase I research, we successfully developed a nanotechnology for treating the surface of roughened implants with nanostructured biocompatible hydroxyapatite. The 20-60 nm thick nano-HA material is bonded to titanium implant surface via amino functionalized silica biocompatible molecular layer, using low-cost solgel and solution-based \"self-assembly processes. In vivo rat push-in testing has confirmed significant acceleration of healing and improvement in biomechanical strength is achieved with Chemat's nano-HA treated surfaces. After only two weeks, the bonding of the new bone/implant was already so strong that the push-in fracture around the bioactivated implant actually occurred in the new bone, while for controlled (untreated) implants the fracture occurred at the interface of implant surface and new bone. Substantial acceleration of tissue/implant integration was achieved via this nanotechnology in Phase I, with the rate of healing more than double that for the control implants at the two-week point. Preliminary biocompatibility testing has shown no toxicity or other adverse reactions, and the nano-scale nature of the HA treatment is believed to resolve the historical issues experienced with thick HA coatings. An agreement has now been signed with a leading manufacturer of dental implants (the \"Partner\") under which they will provide substantial assistance with further development and evaluation of the nano-HA technology. The objectives of Phase n are to (a) further develop and optimize the nano-treatment processes; (b) extend studies of the biological performance of the nano-HA functionalized implants to early stage and long term implantations including clinical trials (much of which will be done by the Partner); (c) further develop methodologies for characterizing the treated surfaces; and (d) develop prototype production lines for solution and treatment processing. This project is to develop a nano-structured bioactive functionalized surface on commercially available micron roughened dental implants. This bioactive nano-structure promotes more rapid tissue-implant integration and stronger bonding between the implant and new bone. Success of this project will result in shorter healing times for dental implantations generally, and improved results for patients with inadequate bone structures.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High frequency ultrasound imaging has many clinical applications because of its improved image resolution. It is gaining acceptance as a clinical tool for the examination of the anterior segment of the eye, skin and intravascular imaging. Its development has pushed the limits of ultrasonic imaging technology, giving diagnostic quality information about microscopic structures in living tissue. One of the technical challenges for high frequency imaging is the fabrication of transducers with piezoelectric elements of a thickness of only a few tens of micrometers. It is very difficult and time consuming to lap down the ceramic to very thin elements and to dice very small elements in the fabrication of high frequency single element transducers and arrays. Piezoelectric thick-film technology is an alternative solution with a low cost. With NIH SBIR Phase I funding support, we have proven in Phase I that 20-40 urn thick PZT film can be deposited via a novel sol-gel drop-on process, with relatively high dielectric constant (typical er=780). In the post Phase I research, thick PZT film transducers were designed using a PiezoCAD model and fabricated from thick PZT film with one matching layer. The central frequency of the transducer was 40 MHz. The bandwidth at -6 dB was -75%. In proposed Phase II research and development, the sol-gel drop-on PZT thick film technology will be further optimized towards application in high frequency medical imaging. For device design, it is difficult to match both acoustic impedance and electric impedance and other requirement. During Phase II, we will address this problem by developing PZT film with adjustable dielectric constant in the range of 1000 to 3000. Five-element prototype linear arrays with frequency of 50-100 MHz will be designed and fabricated using PZT thick films under different substrates. The thickness to width aspect ratio will be adjusted to avoid undesirable lateral resonance. As a supplier for sol-gel precursors and nano powders, Chemat will production develop PZT fine powder and PZT nanocomposite thick film precursor and market sol-gel drop-on thick PZT film high frequency ultrasonic transducer. This innovation may impact high frequency medical imaging market, since lapping down ceramics to a few tens micrometers is very difficult and time consuming. Success of this project provides an alternative solution for fabrication of high frequency single element transducers and array with scale-up capability and low cost.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this SBIR Phase II project is to develop a novel fluorescence detection technology for highly parallel microarray analysis that will provide dramatically increased fluorescence signals so that high-sensitivity detection can be achieved with an inexpensive CCD camera and low-cost disposable plastic chips. The technology is based on the phenomenon of surface plasmon coupled fluorescence (SPCF) emission. In the Phase I we demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed technology. In phase II we will build an instrument prototype and demonstrate its application to highly parallel cytokine detection. Fluorescence-based detection is one of the most important techniques for sensitively detecting low concentrations of biomolecules. Fluorescence-based microarray assays are probably the most powerful current platform for massively parallel analysis of proteins, nucleic acids and cell function and they play a central role in many areas of biotechnology and biomedical science. Because of the need to detect biomolecules that are present at extremely low concentrations in ever decreasing sample volumes, higher detection sensitivity is the highest-priority need in the field of microarray-based assays. Additionally, microarray-based bioassays have reached a sufficient level of maturity to begin migrating from the research laboratory to more routine use in clinical and industrial settings. This has created a growing need for reducing the complexity and the cost of the instrumentation and the consumables (chips). The proposed technology will fill these market needs by providing a relatively inexpensive platform employing CCD imaging detection and low-cost disposable chips with about 1000-fold greater sensitivity than current systems. Technology to be commercialized in this effort will enable more cost-effective and more sensitive tools for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.

The success of this project promises to reduce the current dependency on the error-prone and labor intensive manual procedures currently practiced to manage sponge and instrument counts in surgery. Current counting practices require a large amount of manpower, unnecessarily expose staff to hazardous materials, and leave an estimated 1,500 foreign bodies behind in patients each year in the U.S. alone. ClearCount Medical Solutions, Inc. (formerly Surgical Resources, LLC) is currently commercializing a system based on radio frequency identification (RFID) which can automatically detect, identify, and count surgical sponges that are introduced into the patient's body during surgery. RFID offers an ideal solution to the problem of tracking potential retained foreign bodies, in that it is fast, accurate, and can detect, identify, and count items even if they are obscured inside a body cavity. The initial feasibility of this device was validated with support from a successful Phase I grant from the NIH. ClearCount has been and will be working over the next year with support of public and private investors to commercialize its surgical sponge tracking system. ClearCount respectfully requests funding in order to further develop the surgical tracking device into a system which can count not only sponges, but surgical instruments as well. Several major technological challenges must be overcome in order to achieve this goal. This specific aims of this study will focus on developing RFID tags for surgical instruments which can withstand the rigors of the operating room environment, including sterilization. The study will also address the challenges of creating a reliable RFID system for use in tracking metal objects, which tend to distort RFID signals. Successful completion of these goals will be validated by simulated surgical trials as well as a human clinical trial. The proposed system is the only one in the field that can simultaneously count surgical items as well as scan the patient's body as a final safety check for retained foreign bodies. The implications for each of nearly 40 million surgical procedures each year in terms of patient safety, operating room productivity, and better allocation of healthcare resources make the successful completion of this project extremely beneficial to public health worldwide.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will make the creation of effective intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) easier, and it will enable the dissemination of that technology to a broader audience than currently realized. ITSs have proven to be highly effective in delivering computer-based instruction, but they have historically been expensive and difficult to build, requiring specialized skill in artificial intelligence and production systems programming. Building upon Clearsighted's Phase I accomplishments, the firm will: (1) finish a fully-functional software development kit (SDK) that will allow non-cognitive scientists to create the cognitive model that powers an ITS; (2) develop technology that will enable an ITS to communicate to the vast majority of third-party software; (3) develop techniques that will allow an ITS to work with an institution's existing on-line learning system; and (4) evaluate the research team's work with respect to both time-savings in building ITSs and customers' return on investment. Two main results are anticipated: (1) a two- to three-fold decrease in the amount of time it takes to author an ITS; and (2) an estimated savings to customers of 30% per hour of the cost of traditional training time. The success of ITSs is well documented (e.g., Koedinger, Anderson, Hadley, & Mark, 1997; Corbett, 2001; Morgan & Ritter, 2002). However, ITSs have not been broadly deployed, due to the high level of expertise needed and the cost to create. Furthermore, lack of viable options to interface the cognitive model of an ITS with already existing software impairs wider dissemination of that technology. By increasing technological understanding of how to reduce the amount of the expertise needed to create an ITS and how to accomplish interfacing ITSs with existing software, the result of this supported work will be a wider distribution of ITSs. Clearsighted is well poised to become a market leader in on-line technical training by leveraging this technology. Clearsighted has partnered with Carnegie Learning, the ITS leader in K-12 education to assist in these goals, and it has the additional expertise needed to perform the required work. By transitioning ITS technology from its currently very small market to a wider audience that includes not only education, but also corporate and industrial applications, the costs to the many companies and institutions that do on-line training will greatly decrease, and the productivity of their workers will increase.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Myc family of transcription factors play key roles in cell proliferation, differentiation and cell death (apoptosis). However, deregulated expression of Myc family members, such as that which results from gene amplification or chromosomal translocation as observed in a variety of cancers, can have dire consequences. This is no more clearly illustrated than by the relationship between the amplification of the N- myc oncogene and patient outcome in childhood neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma accounts for 8-10% of all childhood malignancies. In the context of Phase I SBIR funded research, we have screened a 34,000 small molecule library for inhibitors of N-Myc using a cell based readout system. We identified a series of hits representing distinct structural classes that demonstrated strong growth inhibitory effects against Myc- expressing cells compared to cells lacking any Myc family member. These hits are also reasonably specific at the transcriptional level since they were much more effective (3-6 fold) against N- and c-Myc mediated transactivation than against other E-box-targeted transcription factors. In addition, these hits showed strong activity against neuroblastoma cells but not normal cells (~3-5 fold more sensitive). These results provide proof-of-principle that N-Myc inhibitors with desirable properties can be identified. The goal of this proposal is to perform structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies using focused libraries generated around the top 5 structurally distinct hits from the Phase I screening in order to identify more potent and specific advanced hits. Based on SAR analysis, the most potent and structurally \"druggable\" molecules from a minimum of 3 classes will be evaluated for their toxicity, pharmacokinetic properties and efficacy in vivo using a murine neuroblastoma model. Successful completion of this proposal will enable us to identify chemical structures that will serve as the basis for the hit-to-lead optimization phase of this project such that we can identify N- Myc inhibitors with the best biological activity and physiochemical properties that will have the greatest potential for successful use as targeted drugs for the treatment of childhood neuroblastoma.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The perioperative management of surgery patients can be seriously complicated by Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB). Anesthetics can suppress the Central Nervous System (CNS), reduce pharyngeal muscle tone and depress respiratory drive, which promote airway occlusion in SDB patients. Numerous research including a new guideline circulated in draft form by the American Society of Anesthesiologists is promoting careful management of SDB patients including preoperative sleep evaluation. Despite its significance, sleep disorders diagnosis is not done before surgeries. While testing can be done in the lab, sleep evaluation of hospitalized patients is best done in their hospital room because it is more comfortable to them and does not interrupt planned cardiac care. Other reasons include lack of sleep facilities in a significant number of hospitals, scheduling and cost (will be evaluated in this proposal).         This proposal will complete the development of a novel telemetry sleep monitor (Crystal 20-H) that will allow attended polysomnography (PSG) to occur in any hospital room at any time. The system, based on previous SBIR Phase II technology, is small and wireless with software and hardware specifically designed for this application; it will transmit PSG data from the patient's room to a nurse's station and to a sleep lab (if available) many floors away. We will demonstrate device safety and efficacy by conducting a large prospective evaluation on 400 cardiovascular surgery patients pre-operatively at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and Johns Hopkins University, which we believe has never been done previously. Important study outcomes include demonstrating superior performance over current methods (sleep assessment questionnaires), and quantifying SDB prevalence and morbidity in that population. Cost effectiveness of sleep evaluation in that setting will be determined. We will also obtain FDA approval. In addition to demonstrating device effectiveness in this application, the powerful results from this proposal will raise the awareness level for this emerging unmet clinical need and will encourage hospitals to include in their pre-surgical protocols inpatient PSG assessment for at risk patients.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term objective is to develop a new class of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) devices that in addition to treating OSA patients can conduct simultaneous cardiorespiratory measurements for improved therapy assessment. CPAP is by far the most common therapy for patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) with over 300,000 new therapies initiated each year. Unfortunately, once prescribed, CPAP treatment is not typically monitored. In order to properly assess symptoms, patients must be brought back to the lab for evaluation, which is expensive, inconvenient and has long waiting periods. Some of the more advanced CPAP machines can monitor patient's breathing pattern by measuring the airflow signal during the night. However, accurate patient assessment requires simultaneous evaluation of multiple cardiorespiratory information to confirm events such as Apnea, Hypopneas, Desaturations, and Cardiac function. Cardiorespiratory information can also help classify the origin of the event such as differentiating central from obstructive events. Research found that OSA patients, especially those with comorbidities, do suffer from unresolved nocturnal events that were not detected using current technologies and that additional therapy intervention was needed. Also, detailed efficacy data has been shown to actually improve patient compliance through fast intervention and encouraging feedback. We propose to develop a new CPAP device that can monitor EKG, chest effort, pulse oximetry, body position, and airflow. Monitoring of all parameters is expected to be intermittent warranted by weight gain, alcohol use, resurgence of OSA symptoms, or emergence of new complications. When monitoring is needed, patients simply wear a small wireless Chest Module and data is transmitted automatically into the CPAP, which is equipped with special data reception, storage capability and analysis algorithms. The CPAP automatically downloads the data to the doctor's office including raw waveforms and quantitative information such as AHI, desaturation profiles, and heart rate variability. The result is efficacy data that can be truly compared with original assessment done in the lab. The Chest Module can be easily recharged for multiple night recordings. We have successfully met and exceeded Phase I objectives. We developed and tested wireless hardwdare including the Chest Module and a CPAP interface. Testing was done on 3 volunteers. Additionally, we conducted a case study that showed unresolved significant nocturnal events during CPAP; events that would have gone undetected with current technology. We have assembled a team with excellent clinical and commercial expertise for this project. In Phase II, we will finish the design, fabricate 10 complete systems and test on 20 OSA patients to confirm performance, and ease of use. Comparison with current CPAP techniques and in-lab PSG will be done.",

Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that 15-25% of ADHD diagnoses may be secondary to unrecognized SDB. There is currently no independent diagnostic test for ADHD and the current method of diagnosis is somewhat subjective. NeuroAD provides an objective, practical, and quantitative means of assessing ADHD by combining a highly portable multi-channel wireless EEG acquisition and analysis device with an auditory-based test of attention and advanced signal processing algorithms. The 15 minute test protocol can be administered at virtually any location (primary care physician/pediatrician office/clinic, psychiatrists? office/clinic, etc.). Phase I effort involved the successful implementation of the Multi-EEG NeuroADTM in a number of clinical studies with both normal and ADHD, children and adults. NeuroADTM s novel algorithms and discriminating indices, which combine EEG-related variables with the profile of the behavioral response, have been shown to be very effective in distinguishing normal children from children with ADHD and ADHD-like symptoms. Phase II effort centers around finalizing and fine-tuning the hardware/software/algorithms developed in Phase I. In addition, we will develop NeuroADTM which will be a miniaturized configuration using NeuroADTM s coin-sized EEG device. This highly portable and easy-to-use device will utilize a commercial hand-held PDA along with an easy-to-attach headband for fast and convenient placement of the electrodes. This system will undergo extensive multi-center clinical evaluations with adult and children subjects (normal, ADHD pre- and post-medication, and SDB pre- and post-adenotonsillectomy). The results of these tests will be grouped together to perform a comprehensive statistical analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of NeuroADTM in screening and identifying of ADHD and evaluating the effects of medication/therapy. The Neurobehavioral Attention Evaluation Device (NeuroADTM) that is being developed under this project is aimed to be utilized as an ambulatory, easy-to-use, and highly quantitative method to screen for the presence of ADHD and evaluating the effects of medication/therapy. The 15-minute test can be administered at virtually any location (primary care physician/pediatrician office/clinic, psychiatrists? office/clinic, etc.) and has the potential to differentiate ADHD from ADHD-like symptoms caused by sleep apnea and other sleep disordered breathing.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective is to design, build, and clinically assess an Untethered Home Therapy System (UHTS). The proposed system should speed the time course and increase the amount of functional recovery from upper extremity motor deficits resulting from a stroke. There currently has been tremendous growth and active research into brain plasticity and motor relearning after stroke. The proposed UHTS will provide a home-based system for continuing and monitoring therapy. Allowing patients to continue therapy at home with flexibility around their schedule should increase therapy time and hence functional improvement. Additionally, it will provide underprivileged better access for therapy. The patient and/or their caregiver could be easily trained to use the UHTS. The proposed UHTS will utilize wearable sensing and stimulating technology to automatically modulate functional electrical stimulation (FES) and improve therapy. The UHTS will employ a lightweight, easy to wear sleeve embedded with dry surface electromyography (EMG) electrodes, motion sensors, a stimulator unit, and radio transceiver. The untethered design will increase patient safety and allow patients to break without removing the device. EMG and kinetic data will be transmitted from the sleeve to a nearby laptop computer. A dynamic clinical movie will instruct subject therapy tasks, including a variety of simple and complex arm movements, grasp force tracking, EMG and/or position tracking, and grasp force tasks. Each task will be repeated for a specific clinician prescribed time period. By monitoring EMG and kinetic signals we will discriminate therapy tasks, monitor compliance time, and provide feedback. Additionally, movements, coordination patterns, and/or EMG will be used as inputs to an algorithm trained to output an appropriate level of FES to target muscles that will assist therapy. In other words, it will automatically detect when a user is trying to perform a therapy task they cannot voluntarily complete and assist with FES. A unique software interface will encourage patients through movie-based instruction, real-time feedback, and physician defined therapy goals. Quantitative measures related to functional improvement will be calculated and presented to clinicians in reports. Reports will be transmitted from patients' homes to a physician's office via the Internet so therapy can be monitored and modified on-line. Monitoring home therapy should give physicians a barometer for changing treatment protocols and ensuring compliance. Specifically during Phase II we will design, build, and clinically evaluate the telemetry sleeve design, upgrade and integrate algorithms for task discrimination and FES, and upgrade the user interface software. The UHTS will be clinically evaluated with fifty stroke subjects to ensure clinical efficacy. We hypothesize the UHTS will 1) accurately transmit data 2) accurately detect therapy tasks and apply FES when required, 3) provide effective subject feedback, and 4) improve motor recovery. The proposed untethered home therapy system should speed the time course and increase the amount of functional recovery from upper extremity motor deficits resulting from a stroke. The system will include a sleeve that the user can slip over their arm which will measure muscle activity and motion and supply real-time feedback with a video interface. The system will provide a home-based system for continuing and monitoring therapy and provide the underprivileged better access for therapy.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this program, we propose to develop an advanced intra-operative monitor, the NeuroGUARD, for the early detection of brain dysfunction and ischemia.  This monitor will be particularly useful during cardiovascular surgeries since these procedures are specially prone to inducing intra- and post-operative brain injury.  One of the major difficulties that surgical team faces is the potential interruption of blood flow to the brain for example, the following aortic or carotid clamping.  This can result in brain ischemia, a critical drop in the oxygenation level in the brain, which seriously affects the neurologic outcome (cognitive impairment, seizures, loss of motor/speech/vision functions, and ultimately, death).        Our proposed intra-operative brain dysfunction monitor/detector will quantify and analyze cortical activity of the surgical patient through real-time analysis of EEG acquired from multiple scalp locations.  The proposed system will utilize state-of-the-art technology developed by Cleveland Medical Devices Inc. (CleveMED), for neurophysiologic data acquisition in electrically hostile environments such as the Operating Room (OR).  This intra-operative neuromonitoring hardware will be integrated with an enhanced mutli-channel version of a novel wavelet-based algorithm - WAV, which was developed by the PI for quantitative depth of anesthesia monitoring based on a single frontal EEG channel.  The multi-channel cortical activity indexes (M-WAVs) to be developed in this program will represent a real-time assessment of the global brain state.  In addition, the M-WAV indexes will be compiled into a warning algorithm module, which will signal an alarm based on predetermined patterns of cortical activity indicative of local/global brain dysfunction. In order to ensure that the clinical community endorses the NeuroGUARD, the proposed system will undergo an extensive clinical evaluation using data from two medical centers during two high-risk cardiovascular procedures - Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) and Carotide Entarterectomy (CEA).",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aging of the U.S. population presents many challenges. The existing paradigm of care will not allocate resources efficiently as the size of the population requiring home care assistance grows. Our objective is to enhance elder independence by providing both better and more timely predictive health-status assessments and direct, real-time, recommendations and warnings. These together will lower the risk of elders remaining at home or in low intensity care settings. The objective of the Phase II research and development effort is to develop technology that can detect and track activities in the home environment and to demonstrate its usefulness in allowing elders to remain in their homes longer than is now possible. CleverSet will develop and deploy a prototype CleverSet Activity Tracker, CAT, that processes data from a robust set of simple sensors to (1) track the activities of daily living over time (2) modify these tracked activities to include uncertainty about the environment and risk to produce notifications of Events Requiring Intervention (ERIs); and (3) demonstrate the results of the models. The technological innovation of the proposed work is the application of dynamic relational Bayesian networks (DRBNs) to activities in the home environment. CleverSet's DRBN algorithms collectively referred to as CleverSet Modeler, exploit the data model and meta-data from the schema to guide and frame relational queries about behavior and events. In the proposed work, DRBNs will be used to represent complex, dynamic, multi-scale processes involving multiple actors, as probability distributions over the elements, queries, and relationships in the DRBN model. Activities of daily living (ADLs) will be identified using DRBN machine learning algorithms from sensor data and tracked through time. Short-term rhythms of daily life as well as longer-term transitions will be tracked. Risk modifiers relevant to elders will be integrated into the model and used to adapt the sensor data input. Sensor studies will also be performed to determine the relative contribution of sensors to the DRBN ADL models. A software prototype integrating the elements of the Phase II effort will be developed.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most commercial therapeutic proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies (Mabs), are produced from traditional hybridoma cultures or genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using large scale : bioreactors. Bioprocessing of therapeutic proteins is exceedingly expensive because of the high costs of , building and maintaining FDA-approved facilities, complex serum-free media, and talented labor. There is a tremendous market need for methods that can enhance protein production that ideally complement the current methods of production. The overall goal of the proposed project is to evaluate the effectiveness of senescence-enhanced protein production (RP Shift) in commercially relevant bioreactor setting. In the Phase I portion .of this project, Mab production was enhanced nearly 20-fold from RP Shift-competent hybridoma cells in small flasks. The Phase II portion of this project addresses the effectiveness of the RP Shift in commercially relevant bioreactors, the most commonly used being batch and flow-through systems. The aims of this Phase II proposal are to monitor commercially relevant endpoints from RP Shift-competent CH450 and MH70 hybridoma cells that were engineered in the Phase I portion of the project. Specifically, 1) enhanced productivity of Mab (in pg/cell/day monitored daily), 2) increased culture lifetime measured in days), and 3) the stability and integrity of the Mab produced will be measured. First cell lines with increased productivity of at least 2-fold during RP Shift in small volume test systems will be isolated. Of these RP Shift competent cell lines, the best two will be transferred to commercial scale bioreactors and examined for enhanced protein production and increased bioreactor lifetimes. It is expected that enhancements of at least 2-fold in large-scale bioreactors will attract interest from biopharmaceutical manufacturers. During Phase III, the RP Shift technology and ready-to-go RP Shift-competent cell lines will be licensed to biopharmaceutical manufacturers in an effort to reduce costs for them and ultimately the general public.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is to develop and evaluate a multimedia program to instruct lay caregivers in safe and informed use of massage as a form of support in cancer. Phase I focus groups identified common concerns about use of touch as support in cancer. We then delivered instruction using a workshop format. Feasibility was demonstrated by significant and sustained increases in use of massage, self-efficacy, satisfaction, and qualitative data from focus groups. In Phase II we will develop a DVD with manual (each in English and Spanish) to deliver the instruction, and evaluate its effects in a randomized controlled trial. The final product will be a multimedia program for use by the mass audience of family members and other lay care providers for cancer patients. Specific Aims: 1. Produce a multimedia program to deliver instructional content in massage for lay care partners and cancer patients. 2. Determine the effects of the multimedia program on caregiver esteem and stress and on the frequency and duration of the care partner's provision of their assigned form of support to the patient. 3. Determine the effects of the multimedia program on patient symptom levels, functional quality of life, perceived stress, and physiologic indices of stress. Hypotheses: 1. Partners in the massage condition will show greater gains in caregiver esteem and reductions in perceived stress; and they will provide their assigned form of support with greater frequency and duration than will partners in the quality time condition. 2. Patients in the massage condition will have greater improvements in symptom levels, functional quality of life, and perceived stress than will patients in the quality time condition. 3. Patients in the massage condition will have reduced morning rise at 30 min post awakening in salivary cortisol relative to controls and an enhanced diurnal decline from waking to evening sample. Salivary DHEA will be increased overall in patients receiving the massage intervention. Secondary aim: Examine the impact of the multimedia program on care partner concerns about use of touch as a form of support, and on self-efficacy in massage. Secondary hypothesis: Partners assigned to the massage condition will experience greater reduction in levels of concern about touch and increase in self- efficacy in using touch as support over time. Method: Randomized controlled trial with 100 patient/caregiver dyads, over a 6-month period. Subjects will use standardized self- report measures and investigator-generated measures. Patients will use a new non- invasive approach to saliva collection for physiological data. Relevance to public health: Home-based caregiving in cancer is a rapidly expanding societal phenomenon. Simple massage techniques have been shown to bring significant relief from suffering in cancer, but lay caregivers are reluctant to use touch for fear of causing harm. The proposed educational product will promote wide societal acceptance of safe and informed use of touch as palliative care in cancer by family members and other lay caregivers. This project will develop an instructional multimedia program to promote wide societal acceptance and normalization of the safe and informed use of touch as a form of support by family members and other lay caregivers for people with cancer. If successful the program will contribute to enhanced caregiver self-efficacy, reduced suffering by patients, and reduced costs associated with amelioration of symptoms and side effects of treatment.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Though quality parenting is widely recognized as key to a child's healthy development, no assessment tool has gained common use by those working with families to strengthen parenting practices. Programs serving families with young children have long sought an assessment of caregiver behavior that is simple enough for routine use by their staff and that provides information relevant to intervention. To address this need, we propose to validate and refine the Keys to Interactive Parenting Scale (KIPS), a 12-item observational assessment of caregiving behavior. With KIPS, providers can identify parenting strengths and needs, make informed interventions, track progress and evaluate program outcomes. The time, cost, quality and availability of training are important hurdles to any instrument's use. To promote wide dissemination of KIPS, we will develop a convenient online training and support system that develops and maintains reliable KIPS scoring at low cost, and consistent quality. The Phase II Specific Aims are: 1) Conduct further psychometric studies of KIPS; 2) Refine KIPS using information from the validation studies and input from a panel of experts; 3) Test KIPS' ability to detect changes in parenting behavior with intervention; 4) Revise the KIPS online training program to accommodate changes made in the KIPS instrument and develop new features to enhance learning; and 5) Develop an online practice library and recertification system for KIPS. Construct validity will be studied in a representative sample of 400 families; and criterion validity in a sample of 150 families. The KIPS instrument will be refined based on results from factor analyses, validation studies, feedback from a panel of experts and users in the field. To determine KIPS' value in program evaluation, a random sample of 125 families in an adolescent parenting program will be assessed using KIPS at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months of intervention. The online training program will be revised to reflect the instrument's changes. Additionally, the impact of including automated customization features will be studied by comparing learning and satisfaction of a group of 30 providers using the basic model of the online training, to a group of 30 providers using the automatically customized version. Additionally, an online practice library will be developed so users can conveniently maintain KIPS reliability. A practical and useful assessment, coupled with an online training and support system, can promote wide KIPS use. With such a tool, family service providers can help families build responsive parenting, promoting healthy development and well-being for thousands of children.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing the ability of older adults to live independently is a growing public health priority. Because age- related memory declines intimate risk of dependency, older adults are concerned about their ability to remember information and events of a few hours ago and acts performed even a few moments ago. We propose an innovative CD-DVD/Web Attention Trainer program, aka Attention Works, to improve three basic components of attention, i.e., 1) coordinating, 2) allocating, and 3) focusing, relevant to everyday cognitive function of community-residing elderly. Memory theories pose a central role for attention in guiding the initial encoding and later retrieval of to-be-learned information, and deficits in attention, rather than in retrieval, may undermine the well elderly's everyday memory functioning. Enhancing basic attention components will help mitigate against many everyday cognitive complaints of the elderly when running multiple errands, complying with medication regimens, and keeping physician appointments which place heavy demands on coordinating, allocating, and focusing attention. The proposed intervention holds promise for older adults in bolstering their attentional skills including the encoding of new information into memory and remembering habitual acts. The program, designed to be comfortable, entertaining, and engaging, will equip elderly adults with skills to: maintain and increase attentional skills; improve perceived efficacy for successfully completing everyday tasks with heavy attention demands; and monitor the effects of increased attentional function on everyday cognition, memory, and performance. Phase I field-tested the acceptability and efficacy of the pilot program dealing with two of the core components of attention: coordination and allocation, with samples of community-residing elderly. Phase II will fully develop the ATTENTION WORKS to include the third 'focusing attention' component in CD, WEB, and DVD program versions to meet the everyday cognitive needs of elderly across a spectrum of demographic variables. The Phase II goal is to develop the ATTENTION WORKS to meet a variety of specific attention training needs for community- residing individuals of advancing age, and to encourage individual behavior change with regard to both everyday attention performance, perceived attentional difficulties, and global aspects of day-to-day functioning.

        "abstract": "Ethylene is a growth hormone for fruits and vegetables that is generated by the plants themselves; that is, it acts as a self-ripening agent. Hence, the removal of ethylene gas can play a central role in maintaining the freshness of these products. Whereas the temperature and the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide gases are also important system variables that demand a significant economic investment in order to maintain fresh produce, it is the effects of uncontrolled ethylene gas that lead to significant amounts of product loss for both the wholesale and retail distributions of these foods. Importantly, much of the loss manifests itself as a reduced food quality rather than actual product loss. This SBIR program introduces a novel technique for the selective, controlled destruction and removal of ethylene. A successful control of the ethylene gas concentration would lead to a greater preservation of fruits and vegetables. In turn, these items could be shipped longer distances and over extended times, features that would enhance their value greatly.

        "abstract": "The conversion of corn and other biomass to fuel grade ethanol not only would reduce U.S. dependence on foreign energy sources but also would be a major industrial application for agricultural products.  However, the process of drying the ethanol to fuel grade consumes significant amounts of energy, incurring costs that continue to increase as cost of natural gas increases.  This project will develop technology for introducing a hybrid membrane distillation process that will significantly reduce both the energy and capital requirements for drying.  Phase I demonstrated that the membrane technology could preferentially remove water from water-ethanol azeotrope and produce fuel grade ethanol (FGE).  The membranes were shown to operate at high temperature (130oC) and high pressure (200 psia) while providing high flux, high separation, excellent chemical resistance, and long term stability.  An engineering and economic model demonstrated that the membrane modules could provide major savings in both capital costs ($0.7 versus $4.2 million) and energy consumption (33 \u00bf 239 billion BTU/yr) for a typical 70 million gallon/yr ethanol plant, compared to conventional molecular-sieve driers.  In Phase II, both prototype laboratory systems and field test systems will be built and evaluated.  Participation by ethanol design firms will facilitate field testing and subsequent engineering and economic analysis.Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The intial target market for this technology is the growing 13 billion gallon/year ethanol business.

        "abstract": "The need for natural gas continues to grow, and recent increases in petroleum prices have been paralleled by large increases in the price of natural gas.  However, natural gas at the source often has high concentrations of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, which must be removed.  Although existing commercial polymeric membranes (e.g. cellulose acetate and polysulfone) do a good job of sweetening the natural gas by removing both carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide to meet feed line requirements, these membranes are subject to foulant disruptions, which can lead to system outage and loss of productivity.  This project will develop natural-gas-sweetening membranes that offer dramatically-improved fouling resistance while maintaining commercial flux and separation targets.  The fouling resistance will be broad based and will have application to many membrane foulants and many membrane systems.  Phase I demonstrated that the enhanced fouling resistance for natural gas sweetening membranes would significantly reduce the fouling outages.  An engineering and economic analysis suggested a 1% increase in natural gas capacity (based on reduced outages) and significant energy savings associated with less loss of natural gas, due to high membrane effective selectivity.  Phase II will:  (1) optimize system performance related to fouling resistance, separation, flux, and projected cost; (2) fabricate full-scale membrane modules for laboratory and field testing; (3) perform extensive and long term (e.g., 1000 hours) laboratory testing with multiple foulants; (4) perform field testing at an actual site; and (5) upgrade the economic evaluation.   Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The high-selectivity and robust membranes should economically enhance the 30% of natural gas wells in the United States that are in need of upgrading to remove impurities.

The use of these materials requires a high-temperature process to complete the production of the coil.  As part of the process, a ceramic insulating layer is added to the superconductor.  However, the currently available ceramic insulation is produced in tape form, which causes an increased-thickness buildup within the insulation layer.  Braided ceramic insulation, which is stable at the superconductor processing temperatures, could provide a thin radiation-resistant insulation if it could be co-processed with the superconductor at elevated temperatures.  This project will develop a method for braiding ceramic fibers directly onto superconducting cables to produce a thin ceramic-based insulation that is both radiation resistant and stable at the superconducting processing temperatures of 600 to 700\u00b0C.   In Phase I, a process for braiding ceramic fibers directly onto continuous lengths of conductor cables was demonstrated.  Insulation thicknesses on the order of 0.2 mm were measured via optical microscopy, and insulation performance was assessed through mechanical and thermal testing.  Phase II will continue the development and optimization of the high-strength, braided ceramic insulation.  The process will be scaled-up to levels suitable for industrial magnet fabrication.  Insulated superconductor cables will be delivered to the Department of Energy at the conclusion of Phase II.   Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The thin ceramic-based insulation would provide magnet developers with a means of producing densely packed superconductor coils, using a high-temperature wind-and-react process.  This processing technology should simplify magnet production, lower fabrication costs, and allow for higher operating fields.  Applications such as high field magnets, fusion magnets, and medical MRI instruments would become more viable, with improved magnet processing, higher strength, and improved reliability.  Higher efficiency transformers that are resistant to heat damage also would become viable",

        "abstract": "Networking and security technology have become inextricably linked as enterprises rely on computer networks for everyday operations.  It is imperative to integrate several types of security technologies into the network to foil various kinds of attacks before they can do any damage.  Generalized Multiple Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) has extended Multi-Protocol Label Switching to provide the control plane for devices that can switch packet, time, wavelength, and fiber domains.  This common control plane simplifies network operation and management, but increases the risk of service disruption, because the control plane has not been secured.  This project will develop an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that discriminates between correct and incorrect signals on the basis of the context, content, and history of control messages.  Phase I developed an intrusion detection and prevention technique that protects the GMPLS control plane from external as well as insider attacks.  An analysis of signaling and management protocols was conducted, a security framework to protect the control plane was developed, and the integrated intrusion detection and protection techniques were validated by using a primitive test-bed architecture.  Phase II will develop syntax and semantics verification modules for appropriate routing protocols (similar to those developed in Phase I for signaling and management protocols); add support for the state-dependent analysis of various control plane protocols; analyze the inter-protocol interactions among the link management, signaling, and routing protocols; and develop detailed security attack scenarios.  A prototype IDS will be implemented and tested.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The intrusion detection system would provide a unique security product that can be utilized to protect the control plane in the DOE\u00bfs GMPLS-based high performance network.  Other network applications include the Department of Defense\u00bfs net centric network infrastructure.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An efficient and effective conformational search method is essential for solving the computational protein folding problem. Prevalent conformational search methods are fast but incomplete. Proposed here is an exhaustive enumeration-based search method that combines a focus on the most promising search paths with a complete coverage of a discretized conformational space. The search is a prioritized building-up process: Structural templates of low energy are generated for short segments of the chain. Structural elements, either templates or individual residues, are added to a growing conformation one at a time. The addition of a structural element is prioritized on its energetical contribution to the conformation as a whole. Simple templates such as tight turns, helices or strands form packing clusters such as hairpins and beta-sheets. A finished conformation is often the assembly of packing clusters. Search efficiency is achieved by pruning unpromising search branches at each building-up step.         In phase I, the architecture of prioritized assembly-based search has been implemented, demonstrating the feasibility of the approach. Phase II will develop algorithms for computing tight lower bounds of conformational energy, which are crucial for effective branch-and-bound search, and for integrating exhaustive enumeration with minimization. Phase III, with peer-to-peer parallelization, will develop a comprehensive conformational search program for computational protein folding.",

Therefore, microscopy must be performed separately to obtain the needed complementary information about molecular domain size.  This project will develop a high-resolution Brewster Angle Microscope (BAM) to enable simultaneous scattering, diffraction, and processing experiments.  Phase I implemented the tilted-plane imaging design; speci\u00adfied the laser source, custom optical elements, and charged-coupled-device (CCD) chip to optimize the image; and built a working prototype capable of diffraction-limited Brewster Angle imaging from a tilted surface, as needed for monomolecular films on water substrates.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease. Many patients never need treatment, whereas others have an aggressive clinical outcome with significantly reduced median survival. New treatments that can induce complete remission permit patients with poor outlook to be treated while they are still asymptomatic. However, asymptomatic patients with low tumor burden (Binet stage A) derive no benefit from treatment and should be spared the unnecessary ordeal and expense. The problem is how to distinguish those patients with aggressive disease and who are candidates for treatment from those with indolent disease who are not. ZAP-70 is an intracellular protein that is expressed in T-cells and natural killer cells, but absent in B-cells of healthy people. First evidence that presence of ZAP-70 in B-cells of patients with aggressive form of CLL was identified by Rosenwald et al. in 2001 and verified by Wiestner et al. in 2003. ZAP-70 present in B-cells is a biomarker that can accurately differentiate these two patient groups and, thus, a very important prognostic indicator. Current test methods are either not widely available or insufficiently standardized. In Phase I, we demonstrated that the Integrating Waveguide Biosensor technology can be used to detect very low concentrations of proteins and cells in buffer and various matrices by sandwich immunoassay and fluorescence detection. Detection is rapid, as fast as 20 minutes, and quantitative. In this Phase II SBIR, we will apply the biosensor to detection of ZAP-70 in B cells of patients who have been diagnosed with CLL. The level of ZAP-70 so detected will provide useful and sought-after information for physicians and patients in order to understand the stage of CLL disease and determine the appropriate timing and choice of treatment, and to confirm post-treatment minimal residual disease. Assays, instrument, and a test cartridge will be developed and tested against blood specimens from CLL patients and controls. The most common human leukemia is B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Patients with a slowly progressive subtype of CLL may have a normal life span and may never require treatment. Patients with the more rapidly progressive form of CLL typically progress to symptomatic disease and need chemotherapy. The principle of delaying chemotherapy until the disease has progressed is founded on the observation that chemotherapy given to all patients at diagnosis is not beneficial to all. ZAP-70 in B-cells was found to be a reliable marker of disease progression. This proposal will develop a sensitive detection for ZAP-70 in B-cells to allow the doctor to identify the patients with aggressive form of CLL and provide treatment immediately.",

These functions make ACC a prime target for the development of therapeutics to treat obesity and type 2 diabetes. Knockout studies in mice, and animal studies with ACC inhibitors, have validated this approach. The most potent inhibitor of eukaryotic ACCs identified to date is the natural product soraphen. Soraphen has been demonstrated to have pharmacological properties consistent with the potential to treat obesity and diabetes; however, soraphen is not suitable as a therapeutic due to toxic side effects. Furthermore, soraphen is not a good starting point for drug development due to its complex structure. We propose to identify novel small molecules that target the soraphen binding site and inhibit mammalian ACCs with high potency. In Phase I research we cloned and expressed biotin carboxylase (BC) domains from the human ACC1 and ACC2 isozymes that retain high affinity soraphen binding, developed a high throughput screening assay, and solved the x-ray crystal structure for yeast BC alone and in complex with soraphen. In Phase II research we will use these tools to identify novel inhibitors by completing the following specific aims: 1) molecular docking of ~2,000,000 commercially available compounds to the soraphen binding site; 2) high throughput screening of the top ranked docking hits, and of an in- house small molecule library; 3) in vitro and in vivo characterization of leads; 4) lead optimization through iterative synthesis and testing of analogs; 5) determination of the structures of additional BC domains and of novel leads in complex with the BC domain; and 6) efficacy studies in animals with 1 to 3 leads to demonstrate potential for treating obesity and type 2 diabetes.

In addition to biodefense related vaccines, the Easy Vax vaccine delivery system which is the subject of this commercialization project can be used in other infectious disease and cancer vaccines. The specific vaccine being developed for delivery by the Easy Vax vaccine delivery system is a dengue vaccine. Dengue is a virus specifically mentioned in the NIAID Strategic Plan for Biodefense Research. The polynucleotide vaccine delivery system called Easy Vax, uses a microneedle array coated with the vaccine directly on the needles of the array. There are hundreds of needles, each less than 0.5 mm long. The array is inserted into skin using a device that contains an insertion mechanism and electronics. The needles penetrate at least to the basal lamina of skin, adjacent to target cells such as skin Langerhans cells and epithelial cells. After insertion, the vaccine polynucleotide leaves the needles and is available for delivery into cells. Brief electrical pulses, delivered by the self-contained electronics deliver the vaccine polynucleotide into cells. Once in cells, vaccine antigen is expressed and stimulates both humoral and cell mediated immunity. A dengue DNA vaccine is being developed for delivery by the Easy Vax vaccine delivery system. All work to date was done using dengue 1. Since there are four dengue serotypes and all need to be included in a commercial vaccine, vaccine plasmids need to be made for the remaining three serotypes. Dengue is a major public health problem in many tropical areas. Specific aims of this project are to produce a pilot production line for manufacture of the microneedle arrays, molecularly engineer the remaining three vaccine plasmids, test the tetravalent vaccine in mice and primates, safety test the vaccine and assess acceptance of the delivery system by humans.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A lightweight power propulsion attachment for manual wheelchairs will be developed to bridge the gap between manual and power wheelchairs for the majority the 2,500,000 users in the United States who depend entirely on wheelchairs for their mobility and quality of life. All manual wheelchair users encounter real-world situations that require strength and endurance that exceed their capabilities and are potentially detrimental to their health. When this occurs too frequently, users are forced to transition to power wheelchairs. While liberated from their physical limitations, power wheelchair users face significant disadvantages including high cost, total loss of therapeutic physical exertion and dramatically reduced transportability. Studies have found that maintaining mobility is essential for quality of life and reduces overall health care costs. Society as a whole also gains from users' full participation. It is therefore important to enable the user to extend as long as possible, without risking injury, the transition from manual to power wheelchairs. The proposed design replaces one front castor with a new castor coupled to an efficient and lightweight drive system steered with a manual joystick. The user can easily detach the entire drive unit and revert to the original manual wheelchair configuration. The lightweight power attachment unit can then be folded and stowed. The Phase II objectives are to complete the product development by adding the remaining required features, and optimizing the drive system, user interface, and structure. The specific aims are to meet weight, range, speed, traction, stability, reliability, cost, and ease of attaching/detaching requirements. These requirements were developed from user input, product analysis, and previous user, industry, and market studies. Phase II will begin with a detailed requirements analysis and design investigation. The design work will begin with the motor, gearbox, and brake systems. This will be followed by the design of the wheel coupling, the battery and power electronics, and the user interface. Complete industry standard tests will be performed at an established wheelchair test facility. User testing will verify functionality in real-world conditions. The combination of the simple, innovative design with the use of existing components, materials, and fabrication techniques results in a product with revolutionary features at a lower cost than existing products, creating an entirely new product category. With a superior market position, the power attachment is poised to capture a significant market share of the $800 million dollar power mobility industry. A successful introduction of this innovative product will stimulate further technical innovation in an industry constrained by antiquated structural and technological paradigms. A cost effective, exceptionally lightweight power propulsion attachment for manual wheelchairs will be developed that can be easily attached/detached by the user. This product will allow users to exercise their individual physical abilities without risking the injuries due to overexertion. The product seamlessly combines the transportability of manual wheelchairs with the functionality of power wheelchairs, increasing the overall mobility of the user.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      The objective of this proposal is to develop a curricula of role specific online e-Learning courses that meet the needs of a diverse workforce of Hazardous Material workers in the transport modalities of: highway, marine, air, rail, and International. This specifically relates to the goals of the Worker Education Training Program and Health Worker 2010. Hypothesis: Online e-Learning can improve mandated workforce Hazardous Material training by increasing individualization, using the web to simplify dissemination, and shortening time-to-competence, while saving costs. Phase I developed and implemented a highly interactive, e-Leaming course, HazMat Truck, and supporting systems. Experts and workers have favorably evaluated the streamlined approach, time-savings, and opportunity to practice designed into the course. Phase II proposes to broaden that study in number and occupation and to develop a curricula of courses with interactivity that addresses the needs of workers in all transport modes. Once finalized, courses will be translated to Spanish and test-marketed. Phase III will sell or license the courses to companies required to provide training combined with the unique delivery system that specifies exactly the right course to take, maintains training records, and sends refresher reminders. Technological innovation will provide: (1) a curriculum of up-to-date, interactive courses that meets diverse needs, (2) a protocol that matches competency needs to course content, (3) analysis of the efficacy of e- Learning for this population, (4) a customization database that can add state, local, and institution specific requirements to the generic courses. The potential commercial outcome will benefit workers and companies. Millions of people in the US, federally mandated to receive workplace Hazardous Material training, often they do not receive it due to time, travel, or language. These courses will solve that. Companies responsible for delivering yearly training could save $1.4 billion per year in the US and ensure valid, up-to-date training, available anytime, anywhere.",

Under physiological conditions HOO-IFOS under goes spontaneously ring opening and conversion to isophosphoramide mustard (IPM), the active cytotoxic metabolite of IFOS. The objective of the proposed research is to synthesize 4-hydroperoxyifosfamide (HOO-IFOS) in sufficient quantity to document and validate purity and stability. A lyophilized product will be prepared at The University of Iowa, Pharmaceutical Services under GLP/GMP guidelines for clinical use in patients with advanced cancer. GC/MS and HPLC assays will be validated for quantification of bulk and pharmaceutical grade drug. Toxicology studies using a 3-day dosing regime in mice and dogs will be conducted at a GLP facility using the final product. An assay to monitor plasma HOO-IFOS PK and acrolein/chloroacetaldehyde levels in dogs receiving HOO- IFOS will be finalized. An IND package will be prepared after all the above has been finalized and submitted to the FDA. In summary - HOO-IFOS had improved anticancer activities vs. human glioblastoma and breast cancer xenografts and CPA-resistant leukemia murine models. The goal of the SBIR application will be to develop a new pro-drug, 4-hydroperoxyifosfamide (HOO-IFOS) that will generate in vivo - isophosphoramide mustard (IPM) - with reduced formation of associated toxic - chloroacetaldehyde and acrolein - by-products, normally produced during IFOS.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this Phase II SBIR we propose to complete the production of a computer-based interactive multimedia (CBIM) training program for substance abusing offenders, \"SKILLS.\" It will consist of 1) multimedia adaptations of 15 skill trainings considered crucial in effective cognitive behavioral treatment programs, with practice opportunities; 2) patient-completed workbooks, and 3) a counselor manual. We will place particular emphasis on cognitive-behavioral skill scenarios useful in reducing HIV/AIDS risk behavior. In addition, we will conduct a randomized controlled pilot test (RCPT) of SKILLS efficacy. For the RCPT, all subjects (males and females at least age 18) will be substance abusing offenders (SAOs) sentenced to the \"Community Corrections Facility\" (CCF) of the Diagnostic & Rehabilitation Center (DRC) in Philadelphia PA with an average stay of 5 months. 123 SAOS with histories of recent cocaine or other stimulants and/or opiate use will be randomly assigned to 3 conditions, the experimental condition consisting of counselor supported SKILLS training or of two control conditions (supportive 12- step counseling or a digitized video 12-Step training program). A full battery of baseline measures will be administered including the Drug Scales of the Addiction Severity Index, the TCU Intake Crime Chart, the TCU Pre-Treatment Survey of Correctional Populations and the TCU HIV Risk Assessment. Outcome measures will be obtained with the same or related instruments while in detention, and nine months after the baseline assessment at which time the offender would have been on parole for several months. Parameters will include risk-taking and social support scales, HIV/AIDS risk behavior, compliance with treatment protocol and facility rules, results of urinalyses, evidence of treatment-seeking efforts and criminal recidivism. Substance abuse, criminal behavior and HIV/AIDS risk behavior are intimately intertwined and the majority of individuals under criminal justice supervision are significantly involved with illicit drugs. The resources to adequately treat substance abusing offenders and reduce HIV/AIDS risk behavior are severely limited. SKILLS is intended to address the critical need for effective and affordable substance abuse treatment in the field of corrections. It takes advantage of modern technology and of the inherent efficiencies of utilizing well designed computer based interactive multimedia to accomplish training in those cognitive behavioral skills which have been shown to help in the reduction of drug relapse and criminal recidivism, and might reasonably be expected to help in reducing HIV/AIDS risk behavior.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Communication is impaired early in dementia and with the burgeoning number of individuals with dementia, caregivers need specialized knowledge to effectively communicate with and manage patients'. Translating research related to effectively communicating with those with dementia is critical to improving communication, hence quality of life, in this vulnerable population. However, it presents a unique challenge to investigators because many caregivers have at best only a high school education and many are foreign born with English as their second language. DCDI's aim is to integrate the latest research into a program using a Web DVD delivery format that includes increased interactivity and dynamic updates, which are easily understood and adaptable by the bedside caregiver. TRANSLATION. Many care manuals consist of a restatement of regulatory rules related to safety and sanitation, do not adequately address care issues such as communication and rarely, if ever, are based upon the most recent research. In fact, it typically takes 20 years for research to change bedside care. DCDI's proposed program is innovative because it rapidly and continually translates the most recent scientific research using familiar technology (In 2005 DVD players have become ubiquitous in care facilities and homes.) and employing a reading level that can be easily understood by caregivers. In Phase I DCDI developed a prototype product and methods necessary to translate the latest research findings and the knowledge of the caregiver. In Phase II, DCDI will use a team of dementia and other experts to expand, evaluate and refine the product in a random sample of care facilities. The final product should improve the quality of care of those with dementia by providing the caregiver with the knowledge necessary to communicate with and care for a person with dementia. Web DVD format will increase usage amongst the caregiver population because it provides convenient, dynamic and flexible access to the program materials, thus contributing to improving the overall quality of care for dementia patients. Additionally, a Spanish language version for Hispanic caregivers is planned. COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL. A Market Feasibility Study identifies 6,329,754 total institutional and/or individual buyers consisting of caregivers, nurses, researchers, schools, libraries and the lay public. This study projects a first year market penetration rate of 1.5% of that total market.",

The CD-ROM is designed to be an adjunct to the existing health education curriculum provided for 6th through 8th grades. The CD-ROM is based upon our Phase I prototype program entitled Tobacco World in which students are presented with a video arcade interface that offers them random access to several game-like activities in which they learn about tobacco and the negative health effects associated with tobacco use. We will expand the menu of options to include more complex activities and entertaining games. The Phase II program will deliver engaging media to educate students about the risks of tobacco and peer and industry influences on their decisions regarding tobacco. Games and activities will be designed to act on mechanisms shown to be effective in decreasing intentions to use tobacco through changing attitudes, social images, beliefs about short and long term physical consequences, perceptions of peers' social images, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. We will test individual components of the program with middle school students for effectiveness in changing mediating variables related to initiation and use of tobacco. The final program will be evaluated in a randomized trial where middle schools in Oregon and New York will be assigned to either an established tobacco prevention curriculum, or to the usual tobacco curriculum plus the Tobacco World program. Students will be assessed at pre-, post- and 6-month follow-up to evaluate the impact of program use on intentions, and actual tobacco use.

Ge-FLC mesogens synthesized during Phase I demonstrated breakthrough layer shrinkage properties that will solve the longstanding bistability problem in FLC's, thereby raising the achievable brightness of FLC-based projection displays to commercially viable levels. Phase II research tasks include: (1) the synthesis and characterization of a library of approximately 100 new Ge-FLC compounds, (2) the formulation from this library of FLC mixtures engineered for three specific approaches to bistable switching, and (3) development of alignment layers conforming to the device physics requirements of the three bistable approaches. These tasks support the overall project objective of demonstrating robust engineering-prototype bistable FLC devices with characteristics appropriate for commercial microdisplay products. Commercially, the project furthers the emerging technology of silicon-based microdisplays with very large potential commercial impact. The company's previous success commercializing SBIR-funded technology into a rapidly-growing $40-million business provides a foundation for growth into billion-dollar markets for camera and automotive microdisplays enabled by the Phase II innovation. Success in these markets will generate outstanding returns for the company's shareholders, and will provide higher-performing, lower-cost electronic cameras and safer and more convenient automobiles to U.S. consumers",

The introduction of a high-resolution, non-destructive imaging technique that is capable of penetrating deeply into the highly-scattering scaffold medium has the means to accelerate the development and commercial utilization of these novel materials. Multi-photon microscopy (MPM) is based on the detection of the fluorescence emitted by endogenous or exogenous markers. Optical coherence microscopy (OCM) delivers information on the sample's scattering properties. These modalities provide different imaging contrast mechanisms. It is highly desirable to combine both imaging functions into a single instrument. We propose to design and construct a dual function OCM/MPM platform based on expertise developed building a similar system for a biophysics research program at the University of Illinois. COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The unique configuration of the proposed setup, and the opportunity to obtain both anatomical and functional imaging information will make the combined microscope a very useful and attractive imaging tool that could be widely exploited by the scientific community. Particular useful applications can be found in the field of tissue engineering. Other possibilities exist in the field of plant biology to study for example the localization and interaction of different proteins attached to fluorescent proteins in different plants in relation to their development.

        "abstract": "Wind power has the potential of supplying a significant percentage of the United States electrical demand at low cost.  However, costs of transportation, erection, and repair must be reduced before these systems are competitive with current technology.  The large size of multi megawatt turbine components makes transportation from manufacturing facilities to wind sites problematic.  Once on site, the installation of these machines requires very large and expensive cranes.  If a turbine fails during operation, these same cranes must be re-deployed to the site for the repair.  This project addresses theses issues through the design of a direct-drive generator/power converter system that uses a modular architecture.  Such a design allows for the transport and erection of a multi-megawatt turbine in sub-system-level building blocks.  Further, if a module fails during operation, the rest of the turbine can continue producing power while the module is repaired or replaced in situ using on-board service equipment.  Phase I developed a conceptual design of a sectional generator and power converter for a 6 MW wind turbine.  Assembly procedures and detailed cost estimates were completed.  The results showed that an improved cost of energy can be realized with modular, permanent-magnet direct-drive turbines.  Phase II will:  (1) verify the manufacturing and assembly processes by fabricating a full scale segment of the generator; (2) validate full and partial power mode operation for a 100 kW generator/power converter; and (3) fabricate and test specialized service tools.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology, which should be ready for commercial development at the multi-megawatt level in Phase III, would be directly applicable to large commercial wind turbines in the fastest growing sector of the energy industry.  The result will be a more robust and reliable energy supply to the national grid and a lower cost of energy to the end user.",

Typically, each amplifier is built to a unique design, potentially by multiple vendors, resulting in high acquisition costs, and complex operations and maintenance over the lifetime of the system.  If a single modular design could satisfy a wide range of RF requirements, such an amplifier could be built in quantity, lowering its price to all users.  This project will develop a modular RF amplifier, based on a vacuum electronic device (VED), suitable for use over a range of frequencies and applications.  In Phase I, the RF amplifier was designed, the specific VEDs required for target commercial frequencies were selected, and the key RF drive elements of the amplifier itself were demonstrated.  The design utilizes common power supplies, controls, and other components.  Estimates of RF amplifier cost, reliability, and extensibility were made for a wide range of VED powers and frequencies.  In Phase II, the modular RF amplifier will be designed for two widely applicable frequencies.  The selected amplifier will be constructed and delivered to a national laboratory for assessment of its operability, controls and interfaces, and flexibility.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The modular RF amplifier should find use in military systems, communication systems, and industrial applications such as plasma generation, RF heating, and drying/curing.  Currently, none of these applications benefit from the efficiencies of scale that would be available if their requirements could be met with a single, modular design.

This machine will require nearly 600 high voltage modulators and power supplies, capable of driving the accelerator's L-band klystrons.  The cost of these modulators and power supplies will represent a significant portion of the overall budget of the International Linear Collider (ILC).  This project will apply the inherently modular capability of solid-state Marx banks \u00bf a relatively recent combination of a traditional pulsed power design and modern solid-state switches \u00bf to reduce the overall cost of the modulator and power supplies.  In Phase I, a solid-state Marx bank modulator and power supply was designed, based on the design requirements for potential ILC klystrons, with the primary objective of minimizing both acquisition cost and total operating costs.  A major element in the design was the optimization of energy storage and control in the modulator, in order to meet the klystron pulse fidelity requirements without very large and expensive capacitor banks.  The cost-saving potential of a solid state Marx modulator for the ILC was estimated to 25-50%, compared to alternative architectures.  Phase II will focus on the construction of a full scale, full power ILC Marx bank modulator, which will be delivered to a DOE laboratory for assessment and test with potential ILC klystrons.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:   In addition to the ILC application, the Marx bank modulator should provide a highly-cost-effective means of applying solid-state, pulsed power technology to commercial and industrial high voltage systems.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The sensitivity of gene detection in blood specimens in important clinical and forensic PCR applications is limited due to inhibitory blood substances which reduce amplification efficiency and may lead to false negative results. Different pre-PCR treatments that are being used to overcome this inhibitory effect significantly increase the duration and cost of the tests. Our project started with the idea to use the in vitro evolution approach to develop KlenTaq polymerase mutants that are highly resistant to the blood inhibition, which will allow a faster and lower-cost direct PCR analysis of blood samples. We also proposed to select KlenTaq mutants with rapid DMA elongation, which will reduce the time of the amplification cycle. Both types of mutant enzymes were obtained and characterized in the Phase I of the project. KlenTaq mutants combining the two selected phenotypes were also obtained. In Phase II we propose to further evolve the obtained mutant enzymes by determining the best amino acid substitutions at the codons responsible for the above mutations. To this end, we will use saturating site- directed mutagenisis. Next, using the same technique, we plan to transfer these amino acid changes into the full-length Taq enzyme, thus expanding the scope of PCR applications. Finally we will try to combine the two novel qualities of Taq with the cold-sensitive mutants of the enzyme designed for highly specific hot-start PCR already achieved by our company. The resultant triple-quality enzymes will be included in PCR kits specialized for detection of clinically important targets including HIV and Hepatitis B. Until now, the diagnosis of infectious diseases and genetic disorders has required costly and time- consuming procedures. We believe our new products will provide improved accuracy, efficiency, and lower cost of these tests, which will benefit the public by making them more affordable in the U.S. and worldwide.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term objective of this project is to develop technology to provide low-cost ( 90% and to reliably assemble these into genes. We aim to lower the cost of building block synthesis 3- to 10-fold by combining advanced chemistry with alternative engineering allowing a reduction in reaction volumes and reagent concentrations. It is essential for this application that this reduced cost is accompanied by an increase in quality: lower quality oligonucleotides assemble into genes that have increased error frequencies and thus require additional downstream manipulations and sequence verification, increasing the overall cost of production. We will therefore optimize synthesis on a 2- dimensional support to improve the stepwise coupling efficiency to >99.5%; in Phase I we demonstrated the feasibility of this by obtaining coupling efficiencies of 99.9% using modified chemistries and procedures. Small scale, low cost, high coupling efficiency oligonucleotide synthesis will allow greater flexibility in oligonucleotide gene building block design, remove the need for oligonucleotide purification prior to assembly into complete genes, reduce sequence confirmation costs and shorten order to delivery times. To achieve this, in Phase II we will develop an automated 96 channel instrument for synthesizing oligonucleotides with >90% purity. The machine will be integrated into our existing high throughput gene production line at DNA2.0. A low cost high fidelity oligonucleotide manufacturing process may have additional applications in related areas including diagnostic microarrays, real time PCR and RNAi-reagents.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this program is to reduce the occurrence of stroke. This leading cause of disability, and third leading cause of death, strikes without warning in 80% of cases; finding and correcting the conditions that lead to stroke can prevent stroke. At least 50% of strokes arise from plaque at the carotid bifurcation. Removing plaque (a \"carotid endarterectomy\") from asymptomatic patients who have significant carotid stenoses reduces their stroke rate over the next five years by a factor of almost three. This is an excellent way of reducing the occurrence of stroke. Unfortunately, screening to find this significant plaque before it causes stroke, using conventional, general-purpose duplex Doppler ultrasound instruments, is too expensive to justify; these ultrasound instruments require a skilled sonographer and skilled physician to be effective. Realization of a special-purpose ultrasound instrument, specifically designed for carotid screening and meant for use in primary-care offices as a quick and inexpensive means of finding carotid stenoses and directing them to specialists to correct, is our aim. In the \"proof-of-concept\" Phase I of this SBIR we developed and built such as special purpose instrument, and showed that it had high sensitivity and specificity for finding significant carotid stenoses. The examinations required only a few minutes, nonspecialists learned to use the instrument quickly, and the cost of the instrument was only a few thousand dollars. In Phase II, a pilot study of such screening is proposed. Using an improved version of the Phase I instrument, four to six primary care physician offices will be equipped with the carotid screening system and nurses instructed in its use. Physicians will invite appropriate patients, those aged 60+ with at least one additional risk factor, to be screened with the device, and those found with carotid stenoses will be directed to a central certified non-invasive vascular laboratory for conventional duplex Doppler examination. The data from 1400 patients, calculated as the number required for statistical significance, will show whether this two-step screening system is (or is not) cost-effective; the cost-effectiveness will be determined by a Markov model appropriate to this screening that will be developed as part of this research.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are developing a fast, low-dose, direct-conversion x-ray detector for pre-clinical small animal imaging. The detector will improve micro-CT imaging of animal and specimen with fast readout, reduced dose, high throughput, and low detector cost. It can be incorporated into micro-CT systems to reduce the radiation dose delivered to animals and will enable new procedures that are not currently feasible due to the characteristics of present x-ray detectors. Micro-CT scanners have become integral to the study of disease progression and to drug development in small animals. By combining the ease of animal studies with the high resolution of small-animal CT, research is faster and at a lower cost than with conventional techniques. Manufacturers of functional imaging systems such as microPET and microSPECT (1) are also integrating micro-CT detectors into their systems for localizing functional activity anatomically, performing attenuation correction, and for enabling CT-based diagnostics. Although these systems enable longitudinal studies, multiple micro-CT scans deliver a large radiation dose to the animal, which can perturb the intended experiment or even kill the subject. The dose efficiency of current scintillator-CCD or -CMOS photodiode array x-ray detectors is compromised by inefficient conversion of x-rays to light, transport of the light to the detector, and conversion of the light to electric signal. We have successfully developed a new direct x-ray converter material, polycrystalline mercuric iodide, which is a high-Z large bandgap compound semiconductor with outstanding charge collection properties. The proposed detector is a thin film of poly- crystalline mercuric iodide for direct conversion of incident x-rays into charge, coupled to a CMOS readout structure for charge readout. Dose reduction and improved throughput will be achieved due to the very high sensitivity of mercuric iodide films. We expect to widely market the device as an OEM component to scanner manufacturers. In Phase I of the project, we developed a specialized high-speed large-area CMOS readout chip specially designed for compatibility with Hgl2. In this Phase II we will customize the design of the CMOS readout chip for full optimization, modify the Hgl2 deposition as required, and complete and test a product prototype. Testing of detector prototypes will be performed at both Gamma Medica and UCLA Children's Hospital in their small animal CT/SPECT systems.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II SBIR effort will research and test a novel system for blood analysis that utilizes micro-electro- mechanical systems (MEMS) fabricated chips and radio-frequency electric impedance (EI) interrogation signals to differentiate blood cell types. The project's long-term objective is to create an inexpensive handheld hematology analyzer with single-use disposable cartridges capable of performing a complete blood count (CBC) using a 12fL sample of whole blood. In pursuit of this long term objective, this Phase II SBIR focuses on successfully miniaturizing the necessary conductance and impedance-based cell counting technologies, design and testing of the single-use CBC microfluidic cartridges, as well as testing the supporting electronics and micro-fluidics interfaces for the proposed handheld system. The system will be powered by a programmable personal device assistant (PDA) for test control, data collection, analysis of raw EI cell data, and results display. Specifically, three aims will be pursued: (1) design and testing of a CBC disposable cartridge; (2) design and testing of the PDA driven electronics and analysis software; and (3) integration and performance testing of the CBC analyzer system components. If successful, the eventual introduction of such a groundbreaking point-of-care device would constitute a technological breakthrough in hematology and will offer health care providers a valuable alternative to the traditional hematology analyzers currently used in most clinical laboratories. Anticipated benefits from such a device include dramatically lower test costs, rapid test results, next-to-patient care & portability, and increased efficiency in diagnosis and treatment. This new point-of-care system has the potential to significantly reduce the CBC equipment and per-test cost and could result in millions of dollars saved in the US healthcare industry alone (2004 US CBC market estimated at $12 billion), with even greater worldwide cost savings potential. This new micro-fabricated platform technology and its first product application (i.e., a handheld CBC analyzer with disposable cartridges) is the only known commercial effort of its kind. The successful completion of an inexpensive, portable handheld hematology analyzer would constitute a significant breakthrough in hematology by offering healthcare providers a less expensive, simpler platform to conduct the most common blood diagnostic test currently performed in the US. Such a breakthrough will dramatically improve testing efficiencies with its single-use, disposable test cartridges and will make it possible to rapidly test patients at bedside, in remote locations, or in areas with limited healthcare resources. Finally, this new point-of-care system could significantly reduce current CBC equipment and per-test costs, thereby resulting in millions of dollars saved in the US healthcare and insurance industries (2004 US CBC market estimated at $12 billion), with even greater worldwide healthcare impacts in developing countries.",

The purpose of this project is to design, pilot test, and field test interactive multimedia (IM) programs for teaching social skills to youths with social-adjustment problems. The instructional programs will be designed for use in a variety of settings, including special education classes, in- school suspension programs, group homes, foster-care homes, mental-health centers, probation programs, transition programs, and detention centers. The IM prototype previously developed in the Phase I project will be used as a model for an expanded version of the original program plus two additional instructional programs to be developed in this Phase II project. The three instructional programs will serve as alternatives to traditional adult-directed formats currently used in social skills instruction. The IM programs will be field tested with adolescents with a history of social problems. A pretest-posttest control-group design will be used in each field test, with each field test focusing on one program. The effectiveness of each program will be evaluated relative to: (a) youth use of the IM program, (b) youth knowledge of the social skills, (c) youth use of the social skills, (d) adult perception of student use of the social skills in the natural environment, (e) judges' ratings of youth use of the social skills in role-play performances, (f) disciplinary offenses committed by the youths, (g) social validity of the medium, and (h) required instructional time. This project is relevant to public health because the number of youths with social problems is substantial. Their problems are common, persistent, often escalate from minor conduct problems to criminal offenses, are resistant to change, and are associated with poor psychological and emotional adjustment later in life. The empirically validated IM products that will result from this project will address the potentially devastating effects that social maladjustment can cause in children's lives and in society at large. Since social conduct problems are highly correlated with future criminal activity (Loeber & Farrington, 1998), an important goal for our society is the instruction of appropriate social behavior, especially with those children who have been identified as having behavior problems. The training would be used to prevent social isolation, address antisocial behavior, and provide youth with alternatives to the behaviors that result in formal and informal reprimands from authority. The instructional modules that will result from this project will be usable as prevention or intervention programs based on individual needs. In addition, the proposed programs will serve as a model for the development of future IM programs for youths.",

        "abstract": "The Department of Energy (DOE) has 280 underground tanks used to process and store over 90 million gallons of high-level radioactive chemical waste.   The conditions in the tanks are conducive to the formation of flammable gases such as hydrogen, ammonia, and methane, as well as fire accelerants (oxidizers) such as nitrous oxide.  An accumulation of these flammable gases above their lower flammability limit (LFL) increases the risk of fire and explosion.  To mitigate these risks, this project will develop a Raman instrument that can be deployed inside the tanks for monitoring the concentration of these hazardous gases below their lower flammability limit.  Phase I showed that flammable gases such as hydrogen and methane can be detected at concentrations below their lower flammability limit in near real time with a multipass retroreflector Raman cell.  In its current configuration, the limit of detection of the multipass Raman probe is at 10% of the gases lower flammability limit.  Phase II will involve refinements to the multipass Raman gas probe design and the associated Raman instrumentation, in order to permit gas detection at concentrations lower than 10% of the lower flammability limit.  A deployable probe and instrument will be developed for field-testing in a high level waste tank at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL).  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In addition to the application to tank monitoring, the probe could be used by the DOE as an in-line monitor for hydrogen isotopes and other gases in tritium facilities, such as the hydrogen-tritium thermal cycle absorption process.  A sensitive Raman probe also could benefit the private sector in relation to:  (1) pollutant monitoring, where the probe could be used to monitor the release of hazardous gases from industrial sites for regulatory purposes; and (2) process control, such as in furnace atmosphere control monitoring, where the control and monitoring of such gases as nitrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, ammonia, carbon dioxide, oxygen and other hydrocarbon gases are required",

The coating is based on a co-polymer of poly(ethylene glycol)/polylactic acid (PEG-PLA) that contains a neurotrophic factor as a slowly releasable constituent. Release of the neurotrophin promotes the extension of neural processes to the electrode surface. The close proximity of the electrode to viable neural processes will enhance the stability and sensitivity of neural recordings and may reduce charge- injection thresholds for neural excitation. Surface treatment of electrodes with cell adhesion peptides will also be evaluated as a means of preserving the interface once the neurotrophic factor is exhausted. Our objectives for the Phase II effort are 1) to assess the benefits of neurotrophin-eluting polymers on microelectrodes implanted in an animal model appropriate to intracortical recording for direct thought-based control of extracorporal devices for the spinal cord injured, 2) to assess the benefit of neurotrophin-eluting coatings on stimulation electrodes in a model of neurodegenerative disease, specifically retinal stimulation electrodes in visual prostheses for retinitis pigmentosa, and 3) to evaluate the use of surface-bound coatings of peptide adhesion molecules to chronically stabilize the close proximity of neural processes at the electrode surface established by short-term neurotrophin elution. Prostheses are being developed for individuals with spinal cord injury, deafness, blindness and diseases that impair movement. These prostheses will function by electrically stimulating nerves or by recording nerve activity in the brain. The use of biodegradable coatings on these electrodes to enhance the electrical connection between the implanted metal electrodes and nerve cells in the brain is proposed. The coatings will elute biologically active molecules that encourage nerve cells to grow to the implanted electrodes, increasing the efficiency and reliability of the stimulation and recording properties of the prostheses.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research will create a small and inexpensive multichannel physiological data acquisition system. It will allow dense array (128 or 256 channel) EEG systems to be made at a similar cost as conventional (19 or 32 channels) systems, and it will allow conventional systems to become very compact and inexpensive. The initial implementation will be an ambulatory EEG recording using EGI's Geodesic Sensor Net, an electrode system noted for its comfort and ease of installation even with very high channel counts (to 256 electrodes). Recent high-performance laboratory EEG amplifier designs are providing full DC bandwidth capability, by using a single 24-bit delta-sigma A/D converter for each channel. This capability is especially important in epilepsy studies, for prompt recovery from artifactual noise (such as from movements during seizures). In addition, very low frequency (near DC) phenomena may be clinically significant. By combining multiple low-noise input instrumentation amplifier channels and delta-sigma modulators on a single chip, and then integrating the digital filtering and signal processing functions of multiple delta-sigma converters on a single FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array), we can implement a full-bandwidth data acquisition unit with much smaller overall size and reduced power consumption, compared to existing systems. The system will incorporate local disk storage and a wireless data link for continuous downloading to a base station. Ambulatory systems are gaining increasing acceptance in EEG for epilepsy assessment, because of lower costs of outpatient recording and better opportunities to capture epileptiform events, with longer recording times in a variety of settings. Published research on source localization of interictal epileptic foci has shown that dense array EEG provides substantial improvements in source estimation. Our own recent research at the University of Washington Harborview Hospital shows we can conduct long-term monitoring for several days with the 256-channel system, with quantifiable improvements in accuracy of localizing seizure onset. In addition to the benefits for fully ambulatory applications, the proposed research will allow dense array measures to become cost- effective, while at the same time greatly reducing the cost and size of conventional EEG recording systems. Advances in computational capacity can improve the information yield from medical devices if matched by similar advances in data acquisition technology. The proposed VLSI dense array EEG system will allow low cost, compact, wireless ambulatory acquisition of human brain activity for applications such as long-term monitoring to characterize seizure onset in epilepsy.",

In Phase II, the catalysts will be incorporated into self-cleaning reformer walls, and the system will be optimized and tested.  A design for a commercial prototype diesel fuel reformer will be completed and a techno-economic analysis, leading to commercialization in Phase III, will be performed.

Existing systems rely on multi-channel analog-to-digital converters with a single-in/single-out architecture, 8-12 bit accuracy, sampling rate below 250MS/s, low component density, and high power consumption.  Improvements to the sampling rate and the input dynamic range is limited by the converter complexity, power consumption, and cost.  This project will develop a novel multi-sampling system with a power-efficient, sub-Nyquist, shifted-phase, sampling tree architecture utilizing proprietary single-input/dual-output sample-and-hold amplifiers.  The programmable system-on-chip also contains a signal preprocessor that performs a preliminary identification of the signal amplitude range, in order to detect the event occurrence and to extend the input dynamic range by means of the controlled signal attenuation.  During Phase I, the preliminary system architecture was developed and the most critical blocks were designed and simulated.  The feasibility of a novel, low-distortion sample-and-hold amplifier with a dual CMOS transmission gate was proven in computer simulations.  Phase II will develop, fabricate, and test the programmable system-on-chip as an application-specific integrated circuit in SiGe BiCMOS technology.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In addition to the application for nuclear physics, the system-on-chip should find use in wireless ground stations, radar systems, software definable radio, medical diagnostic equipment, and measurement instrumentation",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II proposal addresses development of a field-portable, amperometric biosensor for monitoring organophosphorus (OP) and carbamate insecticides in water.  The miniaturized biosensor will use a modified screen-printed microelectrode with high sensitivity and lowlimit of detection for OP and carbamate pesticides.  This biosensor will be selective for OPs and carbamates.  The enzyme used to generate the amperometrically detectable species is selectively inhibited by these insecticides, but not by other common classes of agricultural chemicals, such as triazine herbicides.  This device is a single use, disposable monitoring chip, since some of the active pesticides, e.g., the OPs, irreversibly inhibit enzyme activity.  Carbamate inhibition is more reversible, but the device, in this case, was still evaluated for a single use mode.\n\nDuring Phase I, we demonstrated effective enzyme inhibition by two representative pesticides, aldicarb (carbamate) and methyl parathion (OP).  Aldicarb was detected with a detection limit of 11 ppb, while methyl parathion\u00bfs detection limit was 18 ppb.  This performance is compatible with existing MCLs (maximum contaminant limits) set by EPA.\n\nBiosensors which can be taken into the fields will enable cost effective environmental monitoring of water supplies.  Pesticide contamination could represent a growing and currently under-regulated threat, since these toxic chemicals are used extensively in agriculture.  Potential pollution sources include rainwater runoff of mobile pesticides and spray drift during aerial applications.\n\nThe proposed sensor will offer a cost reduction strategy for pesticide screening.  Prior field screening of samples could contain costs associated with laboratory testing by providing a means to screen out negative, or pesticide free samples.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the impact of product variety on the customer order fulfillment process. It aims to help the manufacturers of highly configurable products with many possible \"variants\" or \"configurations\" to maximize product availability and order fill rates.  Prior research by Emcien has created a methodology for representing product variants, modeling customer demand, and computing an optimal set of product configurations to maximize margins. These stockers are optimal in the sense of satisfying the most demand while maximizing profitability, but they assume unlimited product inventory.  In previous research, Emcien built a prototype simulation model to determine how well these optimal stockers would perform in practice. The prototype simulation model was used successfully by two of Emcien's clients. The Phase II project will turn this prototype into production quality software that will become a part of Emcien's suite of products that address product variety.  More manufacturers are moving in the direction of \"mass customization\", which means allowing each customer to choose the features and options they want. Mass production of a uniform product, or one with a small number of variants, is evolving into flexible production as more and more choices are offered to the customer. But customers not only want to customize their product, they also want to get it quickly. Pure build-to-order systems can result in unacceptably long customer lead times, especially when demand has seasonal ups and downs. This forces manufacturers to build partially finished or fully finished units for inventory, in order to smooth production and reduce customer lead time. This requires a delicate balance between the extra revenue and the extra costs of offering more variety. Emcien's mission is to help manufacturers profit from product variety as a competitive advantage, rather than being overwhelmed by the extra costs of supporting too much variety.",

More importantly, the results clearly established that this sensor can answer the need for the long-term and continuous monitoring of mobile mice, particularly those animals whose state of health is so precarious as a result of genetic intervention and age that invasive monitoring means are not an option.         As part of the Phase II effort the system will be miniaturized so that the entire sensing assembly can be moved onto the mouse and a miniature wireless transmission system will be integrated into the sensor system. The real-time signal processing algorithms will be optimized and a computer-based graphical user interface (GUI) completed. In order to validate the performance of the sensing system, two studies will be performed at the University of Virginia on mouse populations whose fragile state of health does not permit invasive monitoring. One study will involve mice with inducible myotonic dystrophy, while the other will study asthmatic mice.         An alliance has been formed with a well-known manufacturer of physiological monitoring equipment to commercialize the product.         The need for the long-term monitoring of cardiopulmonary rhythms in mice is growing along with an increasing population of mice strains that are being used to test drug responses, genetic engineering attempts, and other factors that can affect these biological rhythms.

        "abstract": "Fresh water is growing scarcer and costlier.  Power production is the second largest user of fresh water, consuming about 25 gallons per kilowatt-hour in coal-fired plants.  In particular, steam power plants, which use air-cooling to reduce water usage, suffer large economic and efficiency penalties, due to the deep vacuum at which steam condensers operate.  This project will develop a new power cycle (Steam-Ammonia Power Cycle) that markedly reduces water usage without increasing fuel consumption or cost.  The approach involves a hybrid cycle, in which the vacuum portion of a conventional steam cycle is replaced with a tandem ammonia Rankine cycle.  The condensing pressure is thereby raised to 150 psig, which makes possible very compact and economical air-cooled condensers.  High cycle efficiency is achieved by superheating the ammonia vapor.  In Phase I, the new cycle was thermodynamically analyzed in three different important applications:  state-of-art combined cycle plant (600 MW), mid-size gas turbine bottoming cycle (12 MW), and reciprocating engine bottoming cycle (2 MW).  The results validated the high cycle efficiency at all size ranges for both the air-cooled and water-cooled variants of the cycle.  In Phase II, the new cycle will be developed and field-demonstrated at the smallest scale.  Waste heat from an 840 kW reciprocating engine will be used to generate 130 kW of additional power, with minimal water consumption.  The cycle is expected to be at least 50% more efficient than any existing reciprocating engine bottoming cycle, due to the ability of the cycle to use the cylinder jacket heat as well as the exhaust heat.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The improved power cycle should be applicable to virtually all types of existing thermoelectric power plants.  Due to the temperature glide of the heat rejection, this new cycle requires 5% less cooling water than current cycles when it is water cooled, equating to a fresh water savings of 6.2 billion gallons per day nationwide.  Power plants with this modification also would achieve a reduction in fuel consumption.  The multi-turbine variant of this cycle would apply to steam-based power plants, including coal gasification combined cycle plants, while the single-turbine variant would apply to small-scale plants powered by waste heat",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Due to advances in fetal echocardiography, fetal cardiac surgery is an increasingly viable strategy to prevent simple cardiac lesions from progressing into serious defects requiring multiple corrective surgeries after birth. A significant obstacle to successful fetal cardiac bypass is placental dysfunction; hypothesized causes include blood contact with extracorporeal surfaces, priming fluids, and increased placental vascular resistance. The overall goal of this Phase II proposal is to complete development of a novel fetal cardiac bypass circuit designed to minimize placental dysfunction by minimizing priming volume, delivering pulsatile flow, and providing adequate gas exchange when the placenta is excluded from the fetal circulation. We believe this fetal perfusion system will serve as key ?enabling technology? to facilitate wider adoption of in utero cardiac surgery. The specific aims of this Phase II proposal include: 1) utilizing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques to optimize and subsequently freeze the designs of the fetal blood pump and miniature oxygenator developed during our Phase I work, 2) fabricating a sufficient number of prototype pumps and oxygenators for in vitro and in vivo testing and producing final Phase II componentry using plastic injection molding, 3) moving from the LabView-based controller used in Phase I to a hardware-based stand-alone control unit capable of operating the pump in both continuous and pulsatile flow modes and containing the alarms and other functionality needed for clinical use, 4) performing in vitro testing of circuit with lamb blood to evaluate hemodynamic, gas transfer, and biocompatibility performance, and 5) performing acute and chronic in vivo testing of circuit in a pregnant ewe model. Ultimately, we anticipate that our Phase II fetal perfusion system will advance the field of in utero surgery by allowing clinicians to more safely perform fetal cardiac surgery by avoiding placental dysfunction and, as a result, reduce if not eliminate the multiple, complicated post-birth surgical corrections currently required by these patients.

The liquid-phase cyclohexane process, which operates at only 4-10% cyclohexane conversion, is the \u00bfleast efficient\u00bf industrial process, and wastes trillions of Btu of energy in the repeated recycling of 90-96% of the 3.5 billion pounds of unreacted cyclohexane.  This project will develop an effective metal-oxide-based catalyst for the efficient conversion of cyclohexane to KA-oil in a gas-phase process.  A gas-phase catalytic process would greatly enhance KA-oil productivity while capturing ~7 trillion Btu/yr of energy released in the exothermic reaction.  Phase I proved the feasibility of producing cyclohexanone via cyclohexane gas-phase oxidation with air as the oxidant.  Several lead catalysts were discovered that met and exceeded the targets of 20% cyclohexane conversion and 20% cyclohexanone selectivity.  Phase II will seek to achieve one-pass 30% cyclohexane conversion and 50-60 % KA-oil selectivity by:  (1) conducting studies to understand and minimize the undesirable cyclohexane oxidation pathways, and to enhance KA-oil production; (2) enhancing the catalytic performance of the lead catalysts through the optimization of catalyst composition and preparation methods; and (3) conducting an economic analysis to compare the new process to existing commercial processes.   Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The gas-phase cyclohexane catalytic oxidation process should replace current conventional cyclohexane liquid-phase processes for the production of KA-oil, the key intermediates for the production of 4.6 billion lb/yr of nylon in the U.S.  The advantages of the gas-phase process include:  (1) improved productivity, (2) significant reduction of energy consumption, (3) the capture for use of at least 7 trillion Btu/yr of energy from the exothermic high temperature gas-phase process; (4) the elimination of the need to use and recycle billions lb/yr of boric acid; and (5) the elimination of massive amounts of acidic aqueous waste streams.",

The rationale for this project derives from our work demonstrating that inhibiting LDL modification with GLY-022 is reno-protective in db/db mice and from results of the Phase I SBIR feasibility studies to evaluate if GLY-022 confers added protection on a background of chronic treatment with a inhibitor of the RAS (renin angiotensin system). These data support the hypothesis that GLY-022 is a viable clinical candidate for further protection against decline in renal filtration function in patients with diabetes being treated with RAS inhibitors. Additionally, and not anticipated as part of the Phase I studies, we obtained preliminary data suggesting that GLY-022 may be of benefit in diabetic retinopathy. The Phase I goals of this project were to examine effects of GLY-022 and an ACEI (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor), alone and in combination, on designated therapeutic targets and renal structure/function parameters, with the anticipation that positive results from these feasibility studies would provide strong impetus to pursue a Phase II project and clinical development of this compound. Based on achievement of the Phase I project milestones, we propose proceeding to the Phase II project which encompasses further studies for nephropathy and retinopathy indications, bioavailability, pharmacokinetic and lethality studies, and formal animal toxicology, safety and genotoxicity studies conducted with a fully validated GMP-lot of GLY-022.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Immune cells use signals to coordinate their attack on an infectious agent or to downgrade their attack after danger has past. The signals that they use are proteins called cytokines, of which there are about 25. During immunological disorders, cytokines can either signal or control a self-directed attack on the body, and therefore much attention has been paid to cytokines during autoimmune conditions. Yet there are few ways to query individual cells for cytokine expression and until now there have been no ways to do so on the small samples of immune cells isolated from skin and other inflamed tissues.    Trellis' approach to measuring single cell cytokine expression is to capture the cytokines produced by single cells while they lie on a flat plastic surface. These cell \"footprints\" can then be probed by multihued nanoscale beads, each bead type linked to a different anti-cytokine antibody. This method has already revealed that the language of immune cells is not as simple as it is sometimes portrayed. The high level of diversity of immune cells in normal samples may be much diminished in disease or cell types that are rare in normal tissue may become significantly amplified. This is one question that can be explored with Trellis' CellSpot-CK technology. Other questions relate to staging disease based on direct exploration of the cellular profiles that underlie disease manifestation. Such information should be very useful in selecting treatment regimens for these chronic, progressive diseases as well as for monitoring patient responses.    Before introducing CellSpot-CK to cellular immunologists throughout the world, Trellis will need to make the instrument used to read CellSpots more robust, easier to use, and faster. This is one Specific Aim in this Phase II proposal. The other Specific Aims relate to characterizing the cytokine language of immune cells in both health and disease.    The successful development of CellSpot-CK will make available to researchers a new tool for understanding the role of the immune system in many chronic conditions like eczema, psoriasis, arthritis, and asthma. It will also provide a tool to learn how immune cells respond to drugs under development as cures for these diseases. Longer term, it may provide an important clinical \"theranostic\" assay (therapy selection based on a diagnostic procedure).",

        "abstract": "Generation-IV reactor plants have the potential to drastically reduce our dependence on foreign oil and to reduce emission of greenhouse gasses.  These plants will require reliable, high-temperature physical sensors that can operate at temperatures of 800\u00b0C to 1000\u00b0C and pressures up to 1000psi, while undergoing heavy irradiation.  Conventional temperature and pressure sensors in nuclear and non-nuclear power plants rely on semi-conductor technology that will not withstand the high temperatures and neutron flux levels \u00bf the highest-temperature pressure sensors, commercially available, fail below 500\u00b0C without liquid or other cooling.   This project will develop a fiber optic, hybrid pressure-temperature sensor system that is capable of reliable operation in a high-temperature (to 1400\u00b0C) and high-radiation environment (>1x1019 n/cm2). During Phase I, a new sensor design, which eliminated those materials that limited the maximum operational temperature of previous designs to about 900\u00b0C, was developed.  The new design was prototyped, and several component construction procedures were optimized.  A pressure sensor prototype measured pressure at temperatures up to 800\u00b0C.  In Phase II, the sensor and packaging design will be optimized for inclusion in DOE Gen-IV development experiments.  Prototype sensors will be characterized in a laboratory environment at temperatures up to 1400\u00b0C.  A new, lower-cost demodulation system will be developed and prototyped to complete the sensor system.  Finally, automatic health monitoring algorithms will be developed for the demodulation system.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The improved fiber optic sensor should increase the safety and security of Gen-IV reactors, providing plant staff the capability to contain minor incidents before they develop into more serious accidents.   In addition, the sensor system should have applicability to:  (1) instrumentation for existing power generation reactors and power generation gas turbines, improving power generation efficiency and life extension; (2) instrumentation and control of space-based nuclear power reactors; (3) DOD applications for military nuclear power systems; and (4) DOD gas turbines engines to improve performance.",

In Phase I of this SBIR program, Luna Innovations developed magnetite nanoparticles and stabilizing particle surface coatings and suspension chemistries that offer advantages over conventional zero-valent iron (ZVI) and bimetallic nanoparticles approaches including low-cost, long-term particle stability, and reduced aggregation.  Phase I studies demonstrated that the nano-scale Fe3O4 particles had higher reductive dechlorination capacity than that of an equal mass of larger micron-sized particles and were also effective in adsorptive removal of ArsenicIII from solution.  Luna is partnering with an existing manufacturer of magnetite for near-term penetration of the $8-10 Billion USD a year global environmental remediation market.  End users in this regulation-driven and growing field are continuously seeking advanced tools to cost-efficiently expedite remediation of recalcitrant environmental contaminants and Luna\u00bfs technology addresses their needs.                                                      \n\nMagnetite nanoparticles may impart a significant cost advantage over popular nano- and micron-scale ZVI and bimetallic particles used for environmental remediation, while retaining comparable or even enhanced capability for contaminant removal or degradation.  In Phase I, we identified nanoparticles production processes that can be controlled of \u00bftuned\u00bf to reduce, or perhaps eliminate entirely the formation of toxic intermediated compounds such as chloroform, which may form during the reductive dechlorination of parent chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds.  Planned Phase II studies will include optimizing the nanoparticles manufacturing process for more controlled and reproducible particles, refining compatible surface coating and particle stabilization and delivery techniques, expanding the number of contaminants degraded or other wise removed, incorporating the technology with appropriate nanoparticles delivery methods, conducting a field-scale technology verification, and conducting a thorough cost-benefit analysis.                                                                                                                            \n\nDue to their small size, high surface area, superparamagnetic properties, and various other attributes, the proposed nano-scale magnetite particles will have numerous market applications beyond environmental remediation.

However, the poor crystalline quality of the nitride epilayers, resulting from severely lattice-mismatched and crystal-structure-differed substrates, prevents higher-light-output efficiency from being achieved.  Native aluminum-nitride single crystal has been shown to have the same crystal structure and a close lattice match to group III-nitride epilayers, and it can be grown in bulk single crystal form.  Therefore, this project will develop aluminum nitride substrates suitable for the growth of high quality nitride epitaxial layers, leading to the fabrication of high brightness light emitting diodes for general lighting applications.  In Phase I, aluminum nitride crystal boules larger than 20mm in diameter were demonstrated by using a novel, sublimation, physical-vapor-transport growth technique, and aluminum nitride crystal wafers of about 20mm in diameter were fabricated.  Phase II will continue to develop and improve the sublimation physical-vapor-transport technique so that single crystal aluminum nitride boules of 2-inch in diameter can be produced.  Aluminum nitride wafers and epi-ready aluminum nitride substrates will be fabricated from the aluminum nitride crystal boules.  To demonstrate the suitability of the aluminum nitride substrates for high quality nitride epitaxy, III-nitride epi-layers will be grown on aluminum nitride substrates, using a metal-organic chemical vapor deposition technique.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The aluminum nitride substrates should be suitable for volume production of high brightness light emitting diodes, with high-light-output efficacies adequate for general illumination applications.  In addition, the high-quality aluminum-nitride substrates should find use in the fabrication of other types of nitride-based devices, such as blue laser diodes for optical recording, high frequency devices for telecommunications, and UV detectors for analytical applications (e.g., for the detection of chemical and biological agents for homeland security).",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to develop an imaging system to allow visualization of small cancerous tumors and guide biopsy of the prostate. In the course of the Phase l R43CA96153 project and subsequent development sponsored by private funds, we defined the parameters for a commercially viable laser optoacoustic imaging system (LOIS-P) for detection of prostate cancer and developed the first laboratory prototype suitable for phantom testing and experiments in dogs. Our initial test results encouraged the submission of a Phase ll proposal for development of a commercial prototype of LOIS-P and its extensive evaluation in the canine model of prostate cancer. This system will operate in real time and will be capable of imaging the prostate gland and guiding a biopsy procedure. Current methods of medical imaging are only marginally successful in differentiating between cancerous and normal prostate tissue. As a result, biopsies are typically performed with random sampling of tissue throughout the prostate (yielding about a 30% false negative rate). Optoacoustic imaging utilizes the highest known physical or chemical contrast of cancerous tissues relative to normal or benign tissue based on absorption of blood in the tumor microvessels and provides images with excellent resolution of 0.5 mm typical of ultra wide-band ultrasonic imaging. Based on imaging results from 25 breast cancer patients, LOIS has already demonstrated clinical feasibility in diagnostic imaging of malignant tumors in the breast. We will utilize experience gained in the continuing Phase-ll project for development of a clinical breast imaging system to develop a more advanced system for guiding biopsy of the prostate. The focus of the 1st year project will be on development and fabrication of (1) a transrectal probe incorporating a fiberoptic light delivery system with an array of 128 ultrawide-band ultrasonic transducers and charge preamplifiers, and (2) a beam forming and data acquisition and processing circuit board with firmware capable of dual imaging with conventional ultrasound and optoacoustics. The 2nd year will be dedicated to extensive evaluation of transrectal LOIS-P in a canine model of prostate cancer and iterative optimization of the developing system in preparation for clinical testing in humans. Successful accomplishment of the proposed project will make the optoacoustic imaging system available for clinical evaluation as a feature of a transrectal ultrasound system.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The main objective of this project is to develop a contrast agent to allow noninvasive imaging and monitoring of breast cancer with molecular specificity. The basis of the proposed method is a combination of optoacoustic imaging, nanotechnology and molecular biology of cancer. Laser Optoacoustic Imaging System (LOIS) uses near-infrared laser pulses to generate acoustic sources in tumors and the time-resolved detection of resulting transient ultrasonic waves. Clinical studies on breast cancer patients demonstrated that the combination of pulsed laser excitation (which provides high optical contrast between normal and malignant tissue) with the time-resolved detection of ultrasonic waves (which provides undistorted tomographic information from significant depths of tissue), yields a breast imaging system with capability to detect small tumors in situ. On the other hand, one can predict that some breast tumors may possess materially reduced optoacoustic contrast relative to that currently observed in patients with advanced cancer. These cases include: (1) early cancer stages (tumors with dimensions of 1-3 mm) that do not possess dense microvascular network, and (2) tumors treated with anti-angiogenesis chemotherapy. Therefore, we propose to develop and test a Nanoparticulate Optoacoustic Contrast Agent (NOCA) based on gold nanorods (NR) conjugated to antibodies against breast cancer receptors. Recently we demonstrated that gold nanorods represent a unique optoacoustic contrast agent. The optical absorption in gold nanorods is over 10(8)1/cm, i.e. >1000 times stronger than that of any organic molecules. Average near-IR absorption of cancerous tissue loaded with nanorods in concentration of only 10 nanorods per cell will provide additional noticeable contrast of delta-mu about 0.5 cm(-1) relative to normal tissue. Furthermore, the laser-induced acoustic signal from gold nanorods was found an order of magnitude stronger than an optoacoustic signal from dye-solution with equal absorbance. We propose to develop NOCA to utilize the full diagnostic power of LOIS, expanding its imaging capabilities to early carcinoma in situ and other breast tumors with underdeveloped microvasculature. The Phase-I project should result in the proof of feasibility in animals with simultaneous demonstration of our capability to control bioeffects of laser - nanorod interactions.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although 30,000 bone marrow transplants occur each year in attempts to cure diseases such as leukemia, thalassemia and sickle cell disease, approximately 60,000 patients eligible for transplant die every year without finding the nearly identical donor match required for a successful transplant. There is growing demand for high quality umbilical cord blood as a source of hematopoietic progenitor cells for transplantation. No dedicated device, however, exists to safely, quickly, and conveniently collect cord blood. NHLBI previously awarded SBIR phase I and II grants to Fallbrook Engineering, Inc. and CHORI (Children's Hospital, Oakland Research Institute) to develop a self-contained unit that closes around the umbilical cord, cuts the cord in a safe manner, and collects the cord blood in an anticoagulant-containing vessel. This application seeks additional funding to continue the process of assessing and improving the cord blood collection device and to conduct preclinical studies required by the FDA as part of a 510(k) application for marketing clearance to sell the device. Our hypothesis is that our new device will collect the same or greater volume of cord blood than the conventional systems without exposing the healthcare workers to needle-stick injuries. Our proposal consists of four specific aims: 1). Finalize Design of the Prototype Cord Blood Collection Device; 2) Conduct Pre- Clinical testing at three sites; 3) Request FDA Regulatory Approval for our device (the UCB 1000); and 4) Form Cord Cell Technologies, Inc, and obtain financing for production and marketing of the UCB devices. Pre-clinical testing and product evaluations will be conducted at three test sites that will follow the same procedures and protocols: Carolinas Cord Blood Bank, Duke University, Durham, NC; MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and Alta Bates Summit Medical Center, Berkeley, CA. We will collect 50 samples of cord blood at each site and ship to the CHORI laboratory. In addition to measuring total collected blood volume and evaluating sterility for each unit, we will perform cell counts, diff, with NRBC, Viability (Trypan blue), Flow cytometry for CD3 and CD34 and CFU assays following the collection, processing, freezing and thawing of the blood. Qualitative and subjective data will be collected to evaluate the ease of use of UCB 1000 by health care professionals. Our five criteria of success in these trials are 1) equivalent or better collection of cord blood volume compared to conventional methods; 2) equivalent or better level of cell viability; 3) equivalent or better level of sterility; 4) safe operation without exposure of personnel to sharp edges that penetrate the skin; and 5) rapid and easy collection without significant interference with obstetric practice. The UCB 1000 Cord Blood Collection Device will substantially reduce the level of expertise required to collect cord blood, eliminate the risk of blood splashing and needle sticks while increasing the percentage of cord blood units collected that are free of contamination and sufficient in volume. We believe this device will become the industry standard. Because there are not sufficient inventories of cord blood stem cells to assure a quality match for all transplant patients in a timely manner, many patients today die while waiting for a match. Improved methods for the safe and effective collection of cord blood are needed to ensure that adequate inventories of stem cells are available for transplantation in children and adults. The product described in this grant application is easy to use and will both increase the number of units collected and maximize the cord blood volume per collection while protecting healthcare workers from exposure to needle sticks and any contaminated blood during the collection process.",

This project will develop an improved manufacturing process to deposit thermal barrier coating materials to enable operation at higher temperatures in natural gas and synthesis gas environments, while maintaining the necessary durability and reliability required to sustain the engine life expectancy.  Specifically, an electrically-mediated electrophoretic process for the deposition of thermal barrier systems will be developed.  The process will be easier to control and more cost efficient compared to the more conventional techniques of plasma spray and electron beam physical vapor deposition.  In Phase I, an electrically mediated electrophoretic deposition (EPD) process was used to apply thermal barrier coating materials to Inconel 718 substrates.  It was demonstrated that electrically mediated EPD could uniformly deposit thermal barrier material sets, including yttria stabilized zirconia and rare-earth-doped yttria stabilized zirconia, and could increase deposition rates compared to conventional industrial processes.  Phase II will:  (1) optimize and validate the process to permit the introduction of appropriate microstructures, in order to prevent coating failure during standard and accelerated turbine engine operation; (2) develop and validate a post-deposition thermal treatment for the EPD coatings, in order to preserve the microstructure needed to maintain coating durability and reliability during operation; and (3) conduct tests (thermal stability, thermal cycling, thermal conductivity) to determine coating durability and reliability.

The semantic web is intended to allow data to be shared and used by software applications. Unfortunately, in the present world, data on the Web is generally inaccessible to most applications because it is presented in a format intended to be usable by humans, as opposed to computers. The goal of this project is to create a relational view of data on the Web, so that applications can access Web data based on entities and their relations. The approach uses unsupervised machine learning to extract data from web sites for conversion into relational form. This project will result in a new generation of Web harvesting technology that has clear commercial value. Web harvesting is an area of growing commercial interest for a variety of vertical markets, including Sales Intelligence, Market Intelligence, News Aggregation, and Background Search. However, web harvesting technology is limited today, since the collection of rich, detailed data must be done on a site-by-site basis. The approach described here, if successful, will enable a new generation of intelligent web harvesting technology that can scale to the entire Web. Ultimately, our approach will enable applications to query the entire Web as if it were a relational database. This has tremendous commercial value, and will enable many new types of web applications to be developed. In addition to the commercial value, the technical approach is novel and has significant merits on its own. If it is successful, the proposed method should generalize to other complex domains (such as scene understanding and natural language processing) where multiple heterogeneous types of structure must be analyzed to discover underlying meaning.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Beta-hemoglobinopathies are diseases characterized by defective or insufficient expression of the beta-chain of adult hemoglobin, and lead to the anemia associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia. One approach to treat beta-hemoglobinopathies, and in particular SCD, involves the elevation of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression in patients. The rationale for this approach came from observations that patients with SCD that also harbor secondary genetic mutations for persistent HbF expression into adulthood exhibit reduced pathophysiological symptoms associated with SCD. Hydroxyurea (HU) is currently the only FDA-approved therapy for SCD and reduces the number of clinical crisis and incidence of episodic pain. However, the use of HU therapy is hindered by dose-limiting toxicity and poor response rate of many patients with SCD, highlighting an unmet medical need for better therapeutic options to treat this disease. The work proposed within this application leverages FibroGen's technology platform aimed at therapeutic HIF stabilization, and in our anemia program we have developed a series of orally bioavailable HIF prolyl hydroxylases inhibitors (PHI) that elevate circulating, endogenous EPO levels and potently stimulate erythropoiesis with repeated intermittent dosing. In the phase I SBIR program, we demonstrated that erythropoietic PHI are also capable of inducing HbF in human bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells undergoing erythroid expansion ex vivo. The primary goal of the proposed phase 2 SBIR plan is to obtain proof-of- concept that orally bioavailable, erythropoietic PHI can elevate HbF protein expression in anemic non-human primates, either alone or in combination with HU. Enhancing HbF expression is long recognized as an important protective mechanism against SCD. The ability to activate the HbF expression program by PHI may prove to be a powerful approach in the therapeutic treatment of SCD and beta-hemoglobinopathies.",

Based on these results, the possibility of storing a petabyte of data in a relatively small volume was confirmed.  During Phase II, a continuous roll-to-roll pilot fabrication process, capable of manufacturing consistent 6-in wide quantities of TLO media, will be demonstrated.  In addition, a media formatter/reader/writer will be developed to address several specific sub-features of any ultimate system.   Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new data storage technology should address the explosive growth in digital data that is being driven by the internet and other factors.  Areas of application include satellite weather imaging, digital and motion picture imaging, surveillance, and security, to name a few.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project embodies an innovative approach to machine translation. The proposed model aims to overcome two important bottlenecks in the development of a high quality statistical machine translation (SMT) system: (1) inability to handle structural problems and (2) dependence on huge amounts of parallel texts. The inability of statistics to sufficiently handle grammatical problems such as word order becomes more evident when the language pair is very different in structure and morphology, such as with English and Korean. The dependence on a huge amount of parallel texts is a great challenge especially to speech translation. Based on successful tests in the Phase I project, this project proposes a method to learn linguistic knowledge crucial to handling word order and non-local dependencies automatically from input and incorporate it into SMT along with simple transformations, maximizing the strength of both knowledge-based approaches and statistical approaches, and minimizing the need for ever-increasing amounts of bilingual data. The proposed approach aims to build a syntactic-phrase-based statistical machine translation engine that not only is more accurate than the existing word-based ones, but also can decrease the need for large data sources.  The primary impact of the proposed project is the potential for achieving automatic translation quality as high as the quality of the best knowledge-based machine translation engines; but with a minimum of handcrafting of knowledge and therefore at a much lower cost in terms of development time and human resources. While the research is specifically concerned with MT between English and Korean, the resulting translation models would potentially be usable for translation between any pair of languages. The result of the research will be used to develop a speech translation device, in particular to overcome language barriers in communication with patients in hospitals. It will provide a key technology that will accelerate development of speech translation applications in order to reduce costs of healthcare providers and to enhance the quality of healthcare. Additionally, the proposed method of learning linguistic features will have an impact on many different applications including speech recognition, search engines, genre and topic detection, and document search and query. Finally, the proposed research will have beneficial impacts nationally and globally by helping to solve the 'automatic translation' problem, an area of paramount importance to the economic welfare and security of the United States and the rest of the world.",

Low frequency amplifiers (200 MHz is desired) at high power (10 to 30 Megawatt), with a power gradient of 5 MW/m, are required to ameliorate this problem   This program will develop a low frequency, high power amplifier that meets these requirements.  By modulating the current of an electron gun, the extracted radio frequency (RF) power from the system will be capable of producing a large range of output frequencies suitable for muon accelerator applications.  In Phase I, a theoretical/simulation study with electron gun modulation experiments was conducted to develop a prototype design.  The results demonstrated feasibility for the frequency range of interest (88-300 Megahertz).  Phase II will build, test and develop a nominal 200 Megahertz, 13 Megawatt, compact, RF amplifier suitable for muon accelerators.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  An RF amplifier that operates the 20-1000 MHz range should find use in high-energy physics and microwave applications.  In addition to muon accelerators, potential applications include UHF and television broadcasting; low-resolution long-range radar, ground-penetrating radar, and land-mine detection.  The compact packaging of high RF power would allow for the insertion of these amplifiers into portable systems (including ground based, shipboard, and airborne), leading to broad market penetration, as replacements for current lower power systems become necessary",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary. This project will investigate and develop effective information technologies for comparative analysis and visualization of complex data generated by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC). GCxGC is an emerging technology that provides an order-of-magnitude greater separation capacity, significantly better signal-to-noise ratio, and higher dimensional retention-structure relations than traditional GC. The principal challenge for utilization of GCxGC, in a wide range of public-health and other applications, is the difficulty of analyzing and interpreting the large, complex data it generates. The quantity and complexity of GCxGC data necessitates the investigation and development of new information technologies. This project will develop and demonstrate innovative methods and tools for comparative analysis of GCxGC datasets. The expected results of this research and development include a PCA-based method for chemical fingerprinting, decision trees with chemical constraints for sample classification, genetic programming for template and constraint-based matching and classification, and visualization methods for comparative GCxGC analyses. These methods will be implemented in commercial software that will support researchers and laboratory analysts in a wide range of commercial applications, including health care, environmental monitoring, and chemical processing. The power of GCxGC, supported by effective information technologies, will enable better understanding of chemical compositions and processes, a foundation for future scientific advances and discoveries. Relevance to Public Health. Today, a few advanced laboratories are pioneering GCxGC for a variety of applications such as environmental monitoring of exposure profiles in air, soil, food, and water; identification and quantification of toxic products in blood, urine, milk, and breath samples; and qualitative and quantitative metabolomics to provide a holistic view of the biochemical status or biochemical phenotype of an organism. Many analyses in these applications require detailed chemical comparisons of samples, e.g..monitoring changes, comparison to reference standards, chemical matching or \"fingerprinting\", and classification. GCxGC is a powerful new technology for such comparative analyses. This proposal will provide innovative information technologies to support users in these applications.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atherosclerotic vascular disease, in the form of coronary artery and peripheral vascular disease, is the leading cause of mortality in the United States. Despite vast improvements in the field of biomaterials, a useful biocompatible material is still not available for the production of small vascular grafts largely because of blood clotting/thrombosis. To overcome this problem, Dr. David B. Masters, Gel-Del Technologies, Inc., has developed a patented fabrication process that uses purified proteins, water, and other biochemicals to produce biomimetic material in the shape of tubes that can mimic the wall structure of blood vessels (Gel-Del VasoGraft(tm)). Type I collagen and elastin proteins, along with the anti-clotting factor, heparin, are processed together and coated onto a cotton mesh scaffolding to create a tubular conduit (VasoGraft(tm)). Completed SBIR Phase I studies demonstrate excellent bio- and hemocompatibility, anti-clotting, and host tissue integration and in vivo patency out to at least 32 days in a porcine femoral artery model. While the lumen within the graft itself remained open, significant intimal hyperplasia occurred at the anastomosis sites, suggesting that the surgical injury created an adverse repair response. Because the graft itself functioned well, it is hypothesized that reduction of the anastomotic intimal hyperplasia will allow greater long term function and patency. The studies proposed within this Phase II application will utilize the proven Bravo(tm) Drug Delivery Polymer system from Surmodics, Inc., currently utilized in the Cypher(tm) drug (Sirolimus)- eluting stent (produced by Cordis, Inc.), to release Sirolimus, an inhibitor of smooth muscle cell proliferation, from the ends of the VasoGraft, creating VasoGraft-S(tm). In vitro studies will analyze the release kinetics and bioactivity of Sirolimus released from these VasoGraft-S(tm) constructs, and long-term porcine studies will test its function in vivo out to 300 days, with the ultimate goal of developing the VasoGraft-S(tm) for human trials. These studies will be executed as follows: Aim 1: Measure the release kinetics of different doses of Sirolimus(tm) from VasoGraft(tm) in vitro to determine optimal drug incorporation strategy; Aim 2: Assess optimal dose of Sirolimus(tm) for reducing stenosis in 30 and 60 day porcine femoral artery grafts; and Aim 3: Evaluate the patency rates of Gel-Del Vasograft(tm) with Sirolimus(tm) release in long term (i.e., 120 and 300 day) porcine femoral artery grafts.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this SBIR application is to develop a bead based array system for the specific detection and classification of microRNAs. The discovery of miRNAs representing a paradigm shift that suggested the existence of many unknown cellular function and regulation mechanisms. Already, miRNAs have been found implicated in different cancers and leukemia. MicroRNA has all the characteristics to become new class of biomarker for pharmaceutical applications. However, the existing methods for studying the expression of miRNA are labor intensive, time consuming, and also lacks the specificity and sensitivity. A more efficient and accurate research and development tool is much in demand. We have developed a bead array based method that integrated the xMPA technology platform with the LNA (locked nucleic acid) technology. The method, called xMAP-MP for xMAP based miRNA profiling, used beads coupled capture oligo and a biotin labeled detecting oligo to quantitatively detect and classify miRNA. With this method, multiple miRNAs can be studied together in one reaction. Preliminary studies have shown that the assay is highly specific and sensitive: miRNAs can be detected using only 100ng of total RNA. It detects mature miRNAs preferentially over precursor miRNAs. It could also provide more accurate quantitative measurement of miRNA levels. Phase I study allowed us identified unique miRNA distributions in 10 normal tissues as well as in 10 solid tumor tissues. A \"signature\" expression profile was identified for breast cancer. The xMAP-MP is also very efficient: samples do not need to be labeled; hybridization takes only 30 minutes; and detection and data acquisition takes only a minute. The entire procedure can be finished within an hour. Furthermore, the multiplex capability of the xMAP technology platform allows the study of up to 100 miRNAs in one assay. The proposed study has three specific aims: (1)Further develop and increase the coverage of detectable microRNAs. The current panels can detect 115 microRNA targets. We would like to expand the panels so that they can detect approximately 250 known microRNAs. (2)Use clinical samples and cancer cell lines to develop and evaluate \"signature\" panels for four malignancies, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, lymphoma, and glioma. (3) Prepare for commercialization by developing assay-specific software, and establishing GMP manufacture and quality control protocols.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major problem in gene therapy and transfection technologies in general, is the occurrence of random integration/recombination of DNA into the nuclear genome which may disrupt key biological processes. The diagnosis of leukemia in two children involved in a gene therapy trial for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) highlights this risk. The nuclear genome contains the vast majority of human genes but is not the only repository of genetic information. The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) encodes 13 genes involved in electron transport and is located in the mitochondrial matrix, separated from the nucleus by both mitochondrial inner and outer membranes. A single cell can contain thousands of mitochondria, each with multiple copies of the replication, transcription, and translation-competent 16,569 base pair mtDNA. If it were possible to utilize the mitochondrial machinery to produce therapeutic proteins, scientists and physicians would possess a method to circumvent manipulation of the nuclear genome and reduce the inherent associated risk. In a Phase I SBIR, Gencia Corporation successfully utilized a method for mitochondrial expression of genes cloned into full length mtDNA. These gene products could be specifically targeted to extra-mitochondrial locations, such as the nucleus. Using this novel mitochondrial transfection technology, Protofection(tm) (Protein Mediated Transfection), additional data beyond the aims of the Phase I study showed that protofection could deliver and express a full-length mtDNA engineered to express a nuclear targeted reporter protein (GFP, Green Fluorescent Protein), in vivo. Furthermore, the mechanism by which the mitochondrial transfection technology delivers mtDNA to mitochondria implicates mitochondrial lipid rafts. To address the therapeutic potential of this technology in this Phase II SBIR proposal, Gencia Corporation will target Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), an autosomal recessive disease caused by a triplet expansion in frataxin, a gene which codes for a protein localized to mitochondria. By expressing frataxin in the mitochondria of an animal model of FRDA, Gencia Corporation believes the problems inherent in therapies targeting the nucleus can be overcome. The Specific Aims sought in this proposal would enable the first non-nuclear gene therapy for an autosomal disease and provide necessary data for an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA/Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As indicated by draft guidance ICH STB, two major unsolved problems for the FDA and pharmaceutical companies are how to identify effective indices for proarrhythmic activity of new therapeutics and how to integrate available data to determine the mechanism by which these drugs might contribute to risk of arrhythmia. Gene Network Sciences (GNS) will address these problems through the development of the VisualHeart, a software platform that allows ion current and action potential (AP) data to be incorporated into a mechanistic simulation of cardiac electrical activity. This platform will connect data on a drug's effect at the molecular/ion channel level to tissue-level properties to determine: 1) Proarrhythmic markers. The platform will generate proarrhythmic markers by quantifying a drug's effect on ion channels, on the AP, and on wave propagation in the ventricle. 2) Mechanism of action. The platform will help identify specific, quantitative hypotheses for the mechanism of action by which a drug may alter the cardiac AP and electrocardiogram (ECG). The platform will determine these deliverables by using ion current data to generate data-driven models of cardiac ion currents. These models will be incorporated into myocyte models that can predict the drug's effect on the cardiac AP. AP data can also be used to validate and refine the models. Finally, the myocyte models will be embedded into a model of electrical wave propagation in the ventricle that can predict a drug's effect on the ECG. This platform could resolve potential discrepancies in data, for example, a drug that exhibits HERG activity but results in little to no QT prolongation. Thus, the simulations will not replace the role of experiments in safety testing; rather, they will help to direct the collection of preclinical and clinical data and to improve the interpretation of these assays. GNS will commercialize this platform through the establishment of alliances with pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations. The structure of these alliances will parallel alliances that GNS has established around a technology platform for oncology drug discovery and development. Phase I of the project focused on developing a software tool for exploring models of the cardiac AP. Phase II aims will focus on improving the power, flexibility, and ease of use of the single cell simulation tools in the platform, and on incorporating algorithms for studying spatially extended models and relating simulation results to cardiac risk assessment. A set of validation experiments will be used to test each step of technology development. By contributing to a better understanding of how compounds affect cardiac electrical activity, this project is relevant to the mission of the NHLBI. This research is relevant to public health because a software platform for simulating computer models of the electrical activity of the heart will help scientists and drug companies to better understand how drugs affect the heart. This improved understanding will help lead to safer and better treatments for patients.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will complete the identification and immunogenicity analyses of all proteins encoded by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) genome, yielding a pool of protective antigens that will immediately enter development as subunit vaccines for tuberculosis. In our prior SBIR Phase I grant (R43 AI053636-01), we developed a platform technology for high throughput, proteome-based identification of antigens that have a high probability of inducing protective cellular immunity when formulated and administered as a vaccine. The high throughput process that was developed combines efficient gene amplification and protein expression methods with serum- and splenocyte-based assays to determine the level of antibody- and T-cell specific reactivity against each individualprotein. Using funding provided by our Phase I award, and in collaboration with recognized Mtb vaccine leaders, we have validated this proprietary antigen discovery system, and have successfully completed immunogenicity analysis of 384 genes (-10%) of the Mtb genome. We now seek support to apply this process to the remaining ~90% of the Mtb genome to generate a portfolio of candidate antigens for use in vaccine (and diagnostics where appropriate) development, and to complete initial development, production and pre-clinical testing of tuberculosis vaccine candidates based on the identified antigens by our collaborators at Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation. Central to our rapid antigen discovery process is our patented gene amplification technology, called Transciptionally Active PCR (TAPR), a cloning-free method developed under a Phase I SBIR grant (R43 AI47641-01) that generates transcriptionally active PCR fragments that can 1) be used to express proteins in cultured cells, 2) be used to directly vaccinate animals (genetic vaccination), and 3) serve as templates to direct cell-free in vitro transcription and translation reactions that yield large amounts of proteins for use in immunoassays. Because it is cloning-free, TAP is a powerful tool for rapid synthesis and amplification of both genomes and the corresponding proteomes, and coupled with B- and T-cell immunoassays serve as a high-throughput antigen discovery platform called Vaccinomics(tm)/SM. To date, VaccinomicsTM/SM has been used to rapidly amplify, express, and analyze the immunogenicity of approximately 10% of the Mtb proteome. We now propose to complete this process for the entire Mtb proteome by 1) applying bioinformatic analyses to predict the immunogenicity of each open reading frame (ORF) and rank the genome accordingly, then 2) synthesizing and purifying the proteins to create protein arrays for subsequent immunological screening using material from M >-infected mice, guinea pigs, and human TB patients to select vaccine antigen candidates: Vaccine candidates identified by the T cell assays will be systematically evaluated for their immunogenicity and protective immunity in animal models including MfMnfected mice and guinea pigs. First, C57BL/6 mice will be immunized by vaccine candidates to examine their immunogenicity. Second, the antigens will be further examined for their protective immunity against aerosol TB infection of mice. The leading vaccine candidates identified in mouse studies will be further examined in the more stringent guinea pig model with a prime and boost strategy, and the protective efficacy is directly compared to that of Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG). Finally, a selected number of highly promising vaccine candidates will be expressed by recombinant BCG vectors and tested for their protective immunity in guinea pigs under conditions in compliance with clinical study requirements. Based on these studies, promising candidate vaccines will enter advanced development at Aeras in anticipation of expedited clinical testing. We also suggest that this approach will likely be useful for the development of rational vaccines and diagnostics against other naturally emerging and genetically engineered organisms, and may also be particularly useful when rapid responses to novel infectious diseases (ID) and drug-resistant IDs including TB are required.",

We used this method to sub-divide two published datasets onto biologically and clinically meaningful clusters and to identify novel descriptor gene group characteristics for clusters. Both the techniques and the results are essentially different from what was published earlier. The second method was designed for functional comparison of a series of microarray expression experiments on close genetic backgrounds such as cancer cell lines or inbred animal strains. Also, we analyzed the published prognostic \"gene signatures\" using networks and pathway tools. In phase II, we propose to 1) validate sequential clustering techniques, expression of bi-modality, and the identified sets of descriptor genes in a novel study on microarray gene expression in invasive breast cancers; 2) complete functional analysis of all published processed data (gene signatures & sets); 3) build an integrated data mining environment for breast cancer research dubbed MetaMinerBC.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): At Genomatica, we have developed a novel technology platform, called SimPheny that enables the efficient development of genome-scale models of metabolism and their simulation using a constraint-based modeling approach. In the Phase I of this SBIR program, we demonstrated the scientific and technical feasibility of extending our modeling approach from single-cell microbial networks to multi-cellular human metabolism using an integrated two-cell model of human adipocyte (fatty cell) and myocyte (muscle cell). Using the reconstructed multi-cellular model, we computed the integrated function of the two cell types in SimPheny and formulated hypotheses that may be verified experimentally and increase our understanding of human metabolism and physiology. Based on our initial success with modeling multi-cellular human metabolism in SimPheny and the growing market demand for in silico modeling and data integration platform, we have initiated a 3-5 year plan to develop a computational platform for modeling higher eukaryotes and to construct cell-, tissue-, and disease-specific models for human metabolism. As a part of this long-term plan, we seek to develop a computational infrastructure and biological content for reconstructing and modeling integrated multi-cellular human networks in this Phase II SBIR program. The overall goal of this Phase II proposal is to develop a data-integration and computational software platform and a comprehensive database for human metabolism that accounts for the annotated human genes, proteins, and metabolic pathways. Upon the successful completion of this Phase II proposal, we will have a complete infrastructure for content management, data analysis, and visualization of high throughput data within SimPheny software platform and a comprehensive compendium of network information for human metabolism, as well as an expanded genome based integrated multi-cellular model for adipocyte-myocyte metabolism. The infrastructure and content developed in this proposal will enable us to develop tissue- and disease-specific models in collaboration with academic, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical research groups in the future.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current technology for HLA typing does not have rapid field response capability because it too expensive and is too complicated to be implemented in the context of a population-scale emergency. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop a simple, accurate, low cost method to perform complex HLA typing through development of an \"HLA Chip\" which will enable population-scale analysis of a large set of the most important HLA alleles. Genomics USA (GUSA) has developed a unique \"self-assembling\" microarray technology and bioinformatics to enable the mass production of medium density microarrays at very low cost. In Phase I of this SBIR, the following major objectives were accomplished: 1) An enabling variant of the original self-assembling GUSA microarray platform was discovered which allows high sequence specificity and a 10-fold increase in hybridization signal relative to the technology described in the original application. The observed result of this major improvement is direct, biochemically-unaided SNP detection with the simplicity, accuracy and reproducibility required for low cost, population scale HLA typing. 2) Bioinformatics tools were developed to create large sets of SNP- selective hybridization probes that are consistent with the physical requirements imposed by \"self- assembling\" attachment of probes to the microarray surface and 3) It was demonstrated that a buccal swab is an excellent source of DNA for miniaturized HLA typing on the HLA Chip and a simple approach to collect buccal swabs in the field and to store them for centralized HLA processing in the dry state was also developed. In Phase II of this SBIR, the HLA Chip development process will be extended to the entire HLA locus and validated as a beta field test to document accurate HLA genotyping at a rate of 1000 individuals per day per portable laboratory site. The beta test will demonstrate, via, simple extrapolation, the ability to HLA type a large exposed population (100,000 individuals per week) using as few as 10 low cost, portable field laboratories. Such HLA data could then be used in \"real time\" to anticipate, at the HLA level, individual risk of infection by a biological weapon or personalized response to vaccination against the same infectious agent. Variants of this low cost, portable HLA Chip technology could be ?spun off? for a variety of other applications: civilian ID in a disaster or personalized medicine, especially for autoimmune diseases. Those other applications are technically similar, but will be explored and funded independently. The project focus is the development of a low-cost population-scale HLA Chip technology that can be implemented in a rapid-response environment that would allow rapid HLA typing of a large exposed population (100,000 individuals per week) in order to identify high risk individuals and to predict, on an individual level, their personalized response to vaccination.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this Phase II project, GenTel BioSurfaces proposes to create and validate a biochip-based test for the rapid and inexpensive diagnosis of common respiratory allergies. The proposed device requires approximately 10 microliters of blood, easily obtained from a simple finger stick, which will significantly reduce patient discomfort associated with standard skin prick tests. In Phase I, optimized surface and blocking chemistries allowed the detection and quantification of 1ng/uL of allergen specific IgE in human serum. The test required approximately one hour to complete and used integrated microfluidics on a standard microscope slide format. Phase II support will allow the creation of a biochip capable of detecting and quantifying IgE antibodies to 22 common respiratory allergies (based on the University of Wisconsin's skin prick panel) from a minute volume of whole blood. The prototype devices will be delivered to collaborating physicians for testing and comparison with results using conventional techniques.    Type I allergy is an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity disease affecting more than 25% of the population, of which more than 17 million are tested annually. Because many patients are uncomfortable with venipuncture or multiple needle sticks required for in vitro or in vivo tests, a simple diagnostic test requiring only a small amount of blood (from a simple finger stick) is highly desirable. Current clinical methods for in vitro allergy testing such as RAST require patients to provide a sizeable amount of blood, require a skilled technician to complete and have a slow turnaround time for results. In vivo techniques, such as skin prick tests require multiple needle sticks which many patients find uncomfortable, particularly if an allergic reaction results. Furthermore, primary care physicians routinely refer patients to allergy specialists for these in vivo skin sensitivity tests, which add significant expense and difficulty to both patients and doctors. The goal of the Phase II project is to develop a allergy biochip that is capable of providing accurate results rapidly with little patient discomfort.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed effort focuses on the final development of a high-frequency (100 MHz), broadband ultrasound microsystem designed to image cellular structure/tissue along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The unit fits within a standard GI endoscope. It consists of a paraboloid transmitter, a 16 x 16 ultrasound receiver array, a read-out integrated circuit (ROIC), and an interposer layer that links the latter two items. Fourteen-bit digitized data flow from the ROIC to an external computer where three-dimensional images are formed. The nominal sampled volume extends below the GI tract surface to depths in the range 1-3 mm, depending on the proximity of the sensor to the GI wall. The diameter of the probed volume ranges from 0.6 mm to 0.9 mm. The main functions of the imager include: 1) the imaging of pre-cancerous dysplastic mucosa, polyps, and adenomas, 2) real-time grading of dysplasia (pre-cancerous tissue), 3) immediate viewing of cellular structure in tumors (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, benign growths), 4) as required, guidance for directing fine-needle aspiration biopsies to regions that pose the greatest threat, and 5) the system serves as a patient friendly, pre-cancer diagnostic for severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (Barrett's esophagus). Overall, the suggested imager provides a new opportunity for the detection of pre-cancerous tissue along the GI tract, which at present is usually a chance finding and cannot be recognized endoscopically. The developmental prototype has a novel bistatic architecture aimed at increasing system sensitivity, reducing the time required to obtain an image, and simplifying the receiver system. A new sol-gel PZT (PbZr0.6Ti0.4O3) thick film, invented as part of the preceding NIH program, is used as the transducer material. It is much improved over previous efforts in this area. The PZT thick film density is 89-90% of the full thin film density and the thick film piezoelectric coefficients are very close to those of thin films. The advantage of the new thick film is 1) its patterning and fabrication process is well established and many methods are available, 2) it supports a very large etch selectivity of 15:1, 3) the fabrication/assembly process is straightforward and amenable to large-scale production, and 4) the fabrication process yields very inexpensive transducer arrays. The latter is very important because the transducer array/interposer/ROIC will be used only once and discarded.",

Several innovative technological advances in electrochemical sensing and engineering are proposed that will result in a novel transdermal alcohol sensing system to measure blood alcohol concentration. The proposed sensing system will go beyond the current Giner patented technology and constitute new, innovative, and potentially patentable technology. The new sensor system in the Giner WrisJAS(tm) (Wristworn Transdermal Alcohol Sensor) family will require low maintenance, be more comfortable to wear, allow transfer of data from the home, be more resistant to tampering and be less expensive to manufacture. It detects blood alcohol transdermally (10- >400 mg/dl). The commercial goal is to sell the complete alcohol monitoring system for under $ 1100.        The proposed Phase II program will continue and extend the successful research and development in the Phase I program. The Phase II objectives are to: 1) Complete Additional Refinements to Enhance Performance and Economy of Sensor Features 2) Develop Second Generation of Wireless Data Transmittal and Automated Data Analysis. 3) Design WrisTAS(tm) 7 Enclosures (sensor module, electronics module and wristband/cable) 4) Evaluate the New WrisTAS(tm) Products in Clinical Settings.    Commercial Potential: There are a number of markets for a continuous, nohinvasive alcohol monitor including:  1) Research and clinical treatment programs. 2) Emergency room setting for individuals that are unconscious, incapacitated, or unable to exhale forcibly. 3) Monitoring of professionals with or without known alcohol problems in positions involving public safety (aviation, nuclear, medical). 4) Monitoring drivers with prior DWI/DUI convictions. 5) Criminal justice system, where the court needs to monitor alcohol abstinence of convicted criminals on parole, probation or house arrest.",

        "abstract": "SITUATION: Ethylene is a natural plant hormone that plays a crucial role in the complex processes of ripening and senescence (decay) of fruit, vegetable and floral crops. Improvements in apple harvest and storage practices can be achieved by convenient and reliable methods of measuring ethylene in the field. The current method of measuring ethylene (gas chromatography) is expensive, laboratory-based and requires a highly trained operator. The measurement of ethylene has gained added significance in apple harvest and storage practices since the introduction in 2002 of an ethylene inhibitory agent to preserve apple crops in storage. The inhibitor needs to be applied when the apple is at a particular stage of ripeness as determined, in part, by ethylene levels. PURPOSE: The Phase II focus is on developing a portable ethylene monitor for the apple industry, where improved agricultural practices resulting from use of the ethylene monitor could have a large technical and economic impact. (The U.S. apple crop in 2004 had cash receipts of $1.7 billion.) The anticipated result of the Phase II program would be a low-cost electrochemical ethylene monitor which has been tailored for and tested in the apple crop industry. A convenient, inexpensive monitor could be used to improve agricultural harvest, ripening and storage practices resulting in improved quality and cost of product. In potential future commercial development, the monitor could also be used for basic research and monitoring other fruit, vegetable and floral products.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed technology is a convenient and flexible system to control the gas atmosphere in cell culture incubators without the use of pressurized gas cylinders. The product would be an auxiliary unit/accessory to a cell culture incubator for laboratories that want the convenience and safety of no gas cylinder operation and the flexibility of dial-in oxygen and carbon dioxide set points over a wide range. Mammalian cell culture plays an important role in basic medical research, transplantation, tissue engineering, stem cell production, vaccine production, antibody production and cellular assays. Standard incubators for mammalian cell culture are typically operated at 142 mm Hg (18.6%) oxygen and 38 mm Hg (5%) carbon dioxide using pressured gas mixes. As the role of oxygen concentration in cellular physiology becomes more well understood, the need for adjustable oxygen incubators (1%-60%) for both research and production is becoming apparent. Lower concentrations of oxygen are required for research on stem cells, embryonic cells and tumor cells; higher concentrations may be advantageous for the culture of multilayer tissue such as skin, pancreatic islets and tissue engineering products. Giner, Inc.'s overall product goal is an auxiliary unit to commercial incubators to supply controlled gas atmospheres (oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, humidity) using electrochemical processes to generate all the gases required. In Phase I, feasibility was successfully demonstrated by providing gas generation and control to a small incubator with a prototype system. In Phase II, the technology will be sized for a range of commercial incubators, be packaged with an integrated electronic display and terminal and be more full- featured in preparation for commercialization. The Phase II prototype will be evaluated and utilized in a biomedical research laboratory at a medical school. Commercial Potential: The cell culture incubator market is substantial and growing with over 16,000 carbon dioxide incubators sold in 2005 with $112 million in sales worldwide. The proposed technology would be a premium auxiliary/accessory unit for laboratories that want the convenience and safety of no gas cylinder operation and the flexibility of dial-in oxygen and carbon dioxide set points over a wide range. Giner will be partnering with a manufacturer and a distributor to commercialize the technology. R+R Other #7 Project Narrative RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: The proposed technology is a system to control the gas atmosphere in cell culture incubators. This will enhance basic research and commercial production that involves cell culture such as cancer research, transplantation, tissue engineering, stem cells, vaccine production, antibody production and cellular assays where specialized gas atmosphere control is required.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is to develop the PEPD technology to survey the mutation status of hundreds of DMA markers in a vast excess of wild-type DNA for cancer screening. Specifically, we will develop a fecal DMA testing assay for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. Fecal DNA testing is emerging as a novel method for CRC screening. However, fecal DNA testing is a technical challenge, as no single marker can indicate all CRCs and thus a large panel of markers must be utilized to increase sensitivity. As a result, existing fecal DNA methods are not suitable for screening because of either poor sensitivity or high-cost. In Phase I, we demonstrated that a novel technology called PEPD could survey a number of mutations in a 10,000 folds more excess of normal DNA by a single assay, making it possible to detect mutations in a sensitive and cost effective manner. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first demonstration of surveying the status of a large number of DNA markers with such high sensitivity by a single assay. The PEPD method is simple, but very powerful and thus it can be a universal mutation detection technology platform. Hence, success of this project will have a profound impact on mutation analysis and thus cancer screening. The PEPD-based assay developed in Phase II can detect 80-85% of CRCs in a cost-effective manner. Success of this work is of great significance in CRC screening, as it can transform fecal DNA testing. Eventually, it allows physicians to detect the majority of CRC simply by taking a piece of stool for DNA analysis to save thousands of life each year from CRC. In addition, this assay can be used to monitor CRC patients and risk assessment after treatment.",

        "abstract": "The DOE needs improved superconductors to support the high-field-magnet requirements of high energy particle accelerators.  The immediate focus is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) luminosity upgrade in the form of interaction-region quadrupole magnets, which require an evolutionary increase in field-at-windings to more than 15 T.  To address this need, this project will develop a high-performance Nb3Sn strand with improved stability.  The strand will combine high critical current density (Jc) and high upper critical field (Bc2) with manageable levels of magnetization and stability.  Ti and Ta additions to the binary Nb3Sn will serve to increase Bc2 and hence the high-field Jc.  The Ti addition will flatten the Jc vs B curve, leading to strands with reduced low-field Jc and hence improved stability during ramp-up to high field.   In Phase I, two internal-Sn type billets were designed and processed:  one with added Ti only and one with both Ti and Ta.  Jc values of 1000 A/mm2 were obtained at 15T, 4.2K.  Phase II will optimize the production process, leading to one 7\" OD billet of selected design.  The development will be accompanied by detailed characterization studies, followed by the production of many kilometers of strand suitable for cabling and coil winding.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new superconducting strand should be applicable to the large market for accelerator and fusion magnets.

Through synthesis and study of compounds containing inhibitors of two validated drug targets, we have created a novel family of potent antibacterials that are rapidly bactericidal to all classes of Gram-positive bacteria. The results of phase II have provided development candidates of this new class of \"hybrid\" antibiotic compounds active against drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. The class consists of a DNA polymerase IIIC inhibitor (anilinouracil, AU) covalently attached to a topoisomerase/gyrase inhibitor (fluoroquinolone, FQ). These new \"AU-FQ\" hybrid compounds are tenfold more potent than conventional pol IIIC inhibitors, and have broader activity against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria than the fluoroquinolones, both in vitro and in vivo. The development candidates are racemic 3-{4-[1-(1-cyclopropyl-3-carboxy-4-oxo-6,8-difluoro-7-quinolyl)-4-(2-methylpiperazinyl)]butyl}-6-(3-ethyl-4-methylanilino)uracil, and its S and R enantiomers. The rational selection of one compound as the candidate for development (CD) and its preclinical development for treatment of antibiotic-resistant staphylococcal and enterococcal infections are the subjects of the competing continuation application of this phase II SBIR grant. The goals of this project are, broadly, to: 1. optimize the process for synthesis of the development candidates, both to prepare material for preclinical studies and to provide methods for outsourcing cGMP production, and develop analytical methods to support drug product purity assays and pharmacokinetic analyses; 2. designate the CD based on IV pharmacokinetics in rats, toxicity evaluation in rats after continuous IV infusion, and efficacy evaluation in rat endocarditis models after continuous IV infusion; 3. carry out IND-enabling preclinical studies, including standard FDA required toxicology, pathology and toxicokinetic assays under GLP standards, and; 4. submit a Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to enter human clinical trials.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In our program to develop non-sedating ketotifen analogs, we found that norketotifen (NORK) and N-hydroxyethyl-norketotifen (HENK) had significant antiasthmatic and anti-inflammatory activity but less sedation and antimuscarinic activity than ketotifen. These compounds are chiral as a result of atropisomerism. We, therefore, prepared the individual atropisomers, and showed that S-NORK and S-HENK had greater therapeutic activity than the racemates, and that the R-atropisomers had greater sedative and antimuscarinic side effects. In phase I we evaluated the preparation methods, and chemical and metabolic stability of atropisomers of the candidate compounds in order to decide if further development of this class of isomers was warranted. In addition, we have compared the biological stability and began to study pharmacokinetic properties of the atropisomers for the same purpose. We conclude that the atropisomers of NORK and HENK are stable in the solid state, less stable in aqueous solution, but in a temperature-dependent manner, and chirally stable in biological milieus. For phase II we have chosen as \"ultimate lead compound\" the S-isomer of norketotifen (\"SNORK\"), and S-hydroxyethyl-norketotifen (SHENK) as a backup compound. The specific aims for this phase II project are: 1. To improve synthetic methods to manufacture SNORK in high chemical yield and in high enantiomeric excess. 2. To develop and validate analytical methods suitable for analysis of intermediates and drug substance. 3. To perform metabolism studies of SNORK in vitro, using human microsomes and hepatocytes, and in vivo, in relevant animals. 4. To prepare ca. one kilogram of GMP-grade SNORK for first in man studies. 5. To perform additional pharmacological studies and safety pharmacological studies, using methodology described in this application. 6. To perform toxicological studies necessary for regulatory approval of an IND. 7. To write an IND application for SNORK, to conduct a pre-IND meeting with the FDA, and to file the IND with the FDA. The aim is to license this project to a company with experience in drug development and regulatory approval, and the ability to commercialize the drug in the U.S. and worldwide.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to design and develop a challenging and critically important layer of communications' software that enables K-12 educational software developers to incorporate explicit support for collaborative learning activities into their existing applications quickly and at low-cost. The Elmer Software Development Kit (SDK) will enable students to collaborate using a broad range of handheld (or even desktop/laptop) computer platforms (Windows CE & XP, Linux, Mac OS X) since classrooms, as they are already beginning to experience, will be using non-homogenous computers side-by-side. The Intellectual Merit of this proposed effort stems from the need  to construct new algorithms to automatically detect other devices, to reformat communications' messages to enable cross-platform (and cross-operating system) communication on a range of platforms. The outcome of this effort should be a software development kit that engenders the incorporation of collaborative learning strategies. K-12 education is the cornerstone of America's democracy. As No Child Left Behind (NCLB) act acknowledges, America has some serious work to do in reinventing how we educate our children in order for America to continue to provide its people with the standard of living that is the American Promise. Technology is today's generation's tool of choice outside of school; we need to make technology an integral tool inside of school, too. Advocating for technology is the easy part - making the technology accessible, useful, and enjoyable remains the challenge. Our SBIR project goes directly to the core of helping K-12 realize the vision of technology positively impacting teaching and learning. In particular, the proposed research will enable educational software developers to create, quickly and at low cost, collaboration-enabled applications that teachers demand and that students find enjoyable and productive.",

As critical infrastructure increases its dependence on networked information systems, the potential damage from malicious becomes more acute. Identifying and neutralising such code is especially difficult when executables are defended against reverse engineering for legitimate purposes such as digital rights management and protecting other intellectual property. We will develop a runtime process monitor that enforces custom security policies on executables protected against reverse-engineering.

High protein OmegaMeal(TM) will have a major impact on Montana agricultural income, by providing a quality protein source to supplement Montana barley and distillers grains, encouraging livestock feeding in Montana. Camelina oil can be refined into an economical biodiesel or utilized in omega3 health food, cosmetics and animal feeds. Wax esters, mucilage, tocopherol, glucosinolate, super omega3, offer interesting industrial and nutraceutical uses.

In Montana, net wheat income averages $23.50/acre and does not offer potential for added farmgate value. Revenue from a single acre of processed camelina (1500 lbs/acre) could generate between $150-300 net revenue.

        "abstract": "Sub irrigation combats the waste of water and fertilizer in traditional overhead watering systems used in greenhouses for production of potted ornamental plants. However, current ebb and flow watering systems achieve nearly complete saturation of the root medium for each watering cycle. There is no ability to restrict the water provided to the plants. This may decrease plant quality and facilitate spread of disease. Geremia Greenhouse has developed a method to achieve partial saturation with ebb and flow watering of the root medium for production of potted ornamental plants. The water or fertilizer solution is delivered and removed rapidly, resulting in less water absorbed by the pots, and little leaked back out of the pots. This research will determine the benefits of partial saturation ebb and flow watering when applied on flooded floors, in terms of improved quality and shelf life of potted flowering plants, and reduced spread of disease. In-line filtration and sterilization methods will be tested to prevent spread of disease. Once the system is optimized, Geremia Greenhouse will apply this method on a scale of several acres. The improved plant quality and shelf life will benefit growers and consumers, and this watering system will protect natural resources and the environment.",

This project will develop a cost-effective technology to produce PV-grade silicon wafers.  In Phase I, a non-oxide-based reuseable crucible was developed for the production of high purity, low oxygen content crystalline silicon ingots.  The approach was based on a reusable thermal-expansion-coefficient-matched graphite crucible and a high purity, multilayered release coating.  The crucible was used to develop a rapid, single-crystal growth technique for photovoltaic-grade silicon.  Silicon ingots grown with this technique resulted in better yield and higher throughput.  Phase II will:  (1) scale-up the reusable crucible to grow 270 kg ingots, using a state-of-the-art directional solidification system; (2) optimize the rapid crystal growth process using the reusable crucible; and (3) develop a high-throughput, continuous, in-line, silicon brick casting system using the reusable crucible.   Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new silicon wafer production technique should reduce the cost of solar wafers, which is the bottleneck for the healthy growth of the photovoltaic industry.

CD137 (also called 4-1BB) is a membrane glycoprotein that is inducibly expressed on human leukocytes. Stimulation of CD137 by its natural ligand or by agonistic antibodies potentiates an antitumor response that causes regression of established mouse tumors in various models. Anti-CD137 offers great promise as a potential therapeutic agent against certain solid tumors. In Phase I, we generated transgenic goats expressing anti-human CD137 at commercially feasible levels and provided preliminary evidence of bioactivity in a human tumor xenograft model in SCID mice. This antibody is a chimeric protein that contains: 1) the antigen binding regions from a well-characterized agonistic mouse anti-human CD137 mAb (Clone GW); and 2) human CH and CL sequences that are designed to minimize reactions against murine proteins in therapeutic regimens that require repeated administrations. The next steps in the clinical translation of anti-CD137 for human cancer therapy are to: 1) qualify the transgenic goats as founder animals; 2) optimize and scale up a commercially feasible process to purify chimeric anti-human CD137 from goat milk; 3) biochemically characterize the purified anti-human CD137; and 4) test the efficacy of purified anti-human CD137 against human tumors in mice. The long-term goal of this research program is to produce a novel anti-cancer drug, chimeric anti-human CD137 monoclonal antibody, in the milk of transgenic goats and to test purified preparations in appropriate experimental models in preparation for future clinical trials in melanoma cancer patients. Successful completion of this project will lead to final preclinical safety analysis and then to human clinical trials to test the efficacy of anti-human CD137 against solid tumors.",

Ultra-high bandwidth will be needed to achieve this transfer.  While the bandwidth is available in network link technology, transport architectural inefficiencies severely limit the throughput attainable over such links.  This project will develop an innovative network transport mechanism, Transport Control Protocol-Fiber (TCPF) technology, that allows networking at full link speed over an ultra high-speed network.  The approach deals with network data transport inefficiencies by providing intelligent, fast, and accurate network measurement, and employs a hardware-assisted approach for congestion control adjustment.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility and potential of the TCPF technology by using a real-world 10 Gigabit network testbed.  For file transfers, network utilization improved by a factor of nine.  Phase II will focus on optimization of the TCPF design, development/experimentation of the ultra high speed advanced network measurements, development of full-scale TCPF software, development of the TCPF Network Interface Card hardware, integration/testing/evaluation of the system prototype, and evaluation of commercial scenarios.   Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The Transport Control Protocol-Fiber should enable large-scale distributed scientific applications such as environmental monitoring, energy physics, nuclear energy, computational genomics, climate modeling.  It also should have significant commercial value in inter-networking applications such as private enterprise networks, distributed multimedia networks, and entertainment network applications.

However, much work still needs to be done to fully prove the LymPro's capabilities and define its limitation before the Test can be useful in a clinical environment. In this proposed effort, GW Medical seeks the answers to those residual questions and prepares the Test for FDA applicable studies, through a series of non-clinical and clinical studies. Non-Clinical Studies include time and dose response, intra-subject longitudinal variability, sample stability and Test repeatability. In its clinical study, the company will expand the test's application to a broader variety of other, chronic, progressive, non-Alzheimer's dementia and validate the Test's performance by making Alzheimer's disease status determinations while blinded to the clinical diagnosis.     The proposed Phase II effort aims to optimize, expand and validate the LymPro Test's performance as a diagnostic test for Alzheimer's disease and prepare the Test for FDA applicable studies. If proven, an easily administered test for Alzheimer's disease can improve the quality of life for the 400,000 plus Americans who are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease each year and help reduce the $100 billion in annual costs associated with the disease by providing a more accurate and timely diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) represents an enormous clinical problem demanding effective therapeutic approaches. Despite advances in traditional approaches to its treatment, including pharmacological management, myocardial revascularization, mechanical assist devices, and transplantation, heart failure remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Therefore, a novel therapy aimed at decreasing the morbidity and mortality of heart failure and at improving the quality of life for millions of patients is particularly attractive.         Deficient calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum during relaxation in failing hearts from humans has been associated with a decrease in the expression and activity of SR Ca2+ATPase (SERCA2a) and contractility of the heart. We have previously demonstrated that: 1) adenoviral gene transfer is an effective means of introducing the SERCA2a gene into myocytes in vitro and in vivo in rodents and now in pigs, 2) that increasing the expression of SERCA2a restores contractility and normalizes intracellular calcium cycling in a rodent model of pressure-overload hypertrophy and 3) that adenoviral gene transfer to cardiac myocytes isolated from failing human hearts results in restoration of contraction and relaxation properties.         In order to develop SERCA2a as a therapeutic target the following remains to be accomplished: 1) the proper vector and promoter must be selected, and 2) efficacy, safety, and toxicity studies must be performed in two species. We have addressed in part the selection of the proper vector, developed a delivery method as well as demonstrated early proof of concept studies showing efficacy during our Phase 1 application. Two species (one rodent and one non-rodent) must be studied for FDA approval. It is hoped that by examining this novel therapy for molecular inotropy, the company will be able to validate SERCA2a as a therapeutic target. Here, we propose to perform needed studies that will position us for any additional studies requested by the FDA which would be required to file a successful Investigational New Drug application at the end of Phase 3 funding.",

Moreover, an extensive 11.4 gigahertz test program, using copper structures, has established that, for reliable long term operation, the upper limit of the accelerating gradient is 70 to 75 megavolts/meter.  Attempts to operate accelerator structures at higher gradients, in order to satisfy the 100 to 200 megavolt/meter requirement of future linear colliders, have resulted in microwave breakdown of the cavities and the coupling irises; in several instances, permanent phase changes have occurred due to erosion of the copper cavity surfaces.  This project will design, fabricate, and test a gradient-hardened accelerating structure that features high-temperature brazed and machined stainless steel inserts in the high stress regions of the cavity and coupler irises.  Phase I investigated the microwave characteristics of accelerator cavities and dual-feed racetrack-shaped couplers, modified with stainless steel (and molybdenum) inserts.  Brazed cavity test data was obtained, the microwave design parameters of a gradient-hardened 17 gigahertz accelerator structure were established, and overall system and component layout drawings were developed.  In Phase II, a prototype accelerating structure will be engineered, fabricated, and tested at high gradients.   Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new accelerating structures should avoid radio-frequency breakdown in traveling-wave-linear-accelerator mixed-metal structures, as well as the high-gradient structure, reducing the lifetime foreshortening caused by surface erosion detuning",

Targeted personnel include nursing assistants, health aides, home health workers, and adult day care workers. Dementia care settings include nursing facilities, assisted living, home care, day care, retirement communities, board and care, skilled nursing facilities, etc. The entire course will consist of ten modules, each covering a specific aspect of dementia care. Each module will be designed to be complete in itself, and each may be used independently of the others, depending upon each student's and each facility's needs. A certificate of completion will be provided, and continuing education units will be accredited by the Alzheimer's Association (National). This training will address the care issues of 4.5 million Americans who currently suffer from Alzheimer's disease, a number expected to grow to16 million by 2050. It also addresses the problem that few non-degreed health care providers get the knowledge and skills training they need to treat patients suffering from dementia. According to the Alzheimer's Association and others, the single most important determinant of quality dementia care across all care settings is staff training for caregivers. With nearly half of all elder care patients having some form of dementia, it is imperative that staff understand the symptoms, behaviors, and treatments associated with the disease in order to meet the needs of individuals in their care. There are two major innovations addressed through this project: 1) providing accredited Web-based training for supervised nursing personnel, and 2) disseminating the course through the Alzheimer's Association Website, and 81 Chapters and 300 area offices as part of their multi-year Campaign for Quality Residential Care. Specific Phase II Objectives are: 1) complete development and qualitative evaluation of the dementia care Web- based course; 2) evaluate effects of the Web-based course through a quantitative randomized trial study to analyze knowledge gain and applied decision making skill changes, pretest to posttest to follow-up posttest, in a Web-based intervention group, a print-based intervention group, and a non-intervention comparison group; 3) prepare for dissemination of the Web-based course by developing a user's manual, developing an optional-use blended learning curriculum, and translating into other languages.",

The Alzheimer's Association (2003) reports people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias in nursing homes and assisted living centers require better quality care than they now receive. Quality care is also affected by turnover in U.S. workers providing direct, long-term care, for which cost estimates equal approximately $3,500 per employee-more than $4 billion a year (Seavey, 2004). The long- term goal of this Phase II is therefore to complete a series often interactive, online training and intervention modules utilizing the applicants' trademarked total-approach CARES-protocol, a step-by-step process designed to improve the quality of residential dementia care. Phase I accomplishments provide the foundation for the proposed three-year Phase II. Phase II aims are to complete the development of the four- module Phase I training prototype; produce and test six new training modules; conduct a nationwide pilot study of all ten training modules in anticipation of a follow-on study to investigate the effects of CARES training interventions on CMS quality care indicators; and analyze and report the data collected in the pilot study about knowledge gain, caregiving behavior, and staff turnover rates pre/post training. Project applicants hypothesize a significant increase in CNA knowledge as measured by pre- and post-tests. The evaluation design also enables exploratory research to examine the extent and nature of changes in CNA clinical behavior with dementia residents, the impact of CARES implementation on facilities' CMS quality care indicator scores, and the effect on rates of staff turnover among CNAs involved in the pilot study as measured by individual facility analysis. The project is highly relevant to the mission of the National Institute on Aging as well as to public health in general, because it has far-reaching implications for the training of nursing assistants and improvement of quality care as measured by the Centers for Medicare Services (CMS) quality care indicators. Additionally, implementation of the CARES protocol could significantly improve care for residents with dementia or AD by training CNAs in an intervention approach appropriate for any caregiving situation.",

By adding a sensor interface, we provide the device with ability to appropriately react to the conditions prevailing in the body and optimize treatment outcome.",

        "abstract": "Huge renewable heat sources are continuously being generated but are not being used.  For cars and trucks, two thirds of the gasoline consumed is converted to waste heat and thrown away. Within the basic materials industries (aluminum plants, steel mills, oil refineries, etc.), about the same amount of waste heat also is being generated and lost.  Combined, the amount of waste heat is equivalent to 300-1,000 million barrels of oil/year.  This project will develop a waste heat recovery technique, based on new, more efficient thermoelectric materials, in which quantum well (QW) layers, 100 \u00c5 thick, are deposited on a substrate.  The research will focus on overcoming a parasitic heat leak problem associated with the substrate.  In Phase I, the heat leak problem was separated into temperatures above and below 300oC, the temperature at which organic materials (such as Kapton) can no longer be used.  Below 300oC, N and P type Si/SiGe QW films were deposited on Kapton.  The N and P films were joined with the metal molybdenum, producing very low resistance contacts, and the power produced was very close to the anticipated values.  Above 300oC, the Si/SiGe QW films were successfully deposited on a 25 \u00b5m thick SiGe substrate.  The a, \u00bf, and \u00bf parameters for the film show that QW behavior was obtained in the films, and a  figure of merit (ZT) of 3 to 5 was obtained at room temperature.  The plans for Phase II also differ for the two temperature regimes.  Below 300oC, the deposition of the Si buffer coat and the QW films on Kapton will be improved, so that it can be scaled up to yield 15 \u00bf 20% at ~ 300oC.  Above 300oC, the promising SiGe buffer coat, deposited on mica or glass, will be evaluated with Si/SiGe, as well as with the high temperature QW films Si/SiC and B4C/B9C, for use up to 1000oC.  At 800oC, an efficiency of ~ 40% is expected.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:   Vehicles fitted with the new waste heat recovery device should expect an increase in mileage by ~10%.  In addition, the high temperature, basic materials industries should be able to recover appreciable waste heat when their processes are fitted with the QW thermoelectric generators.  Other applications include geothermal wells.  The total market could be in the range of a billion dollars per year",

The software and input database are for household and consumption forecasting at national, state and small area levels. The output archive contains the outcome of household forecasts for the nation, each of the 50 states and DC, and small areas that subscribe to the forecasts products. The ProFamy approach has substantial merits as compared to the classic headship-rate method, which is not linked to demographic rates, projects only a few household types without size information, and deals with household \"heads\" but not other household members. ProFamy uses demographic rates as input and forecasts much more detailed household types and sizes, and living arrangements of all members, including the elderly, adults, and children. Serious attention will be given and substantial work is planned to ensure that (1) a business or policy analyst who is not an expert in family demography can use the ProFamy software to conveniently perform household and consumption forecasting at national, state and small area levels; (2) an administrator, planner or policymaker can easily view, search, and analyze the forecast output; (3) we summarize our business applications of household and consumption (elderly care needs/cost, housing, energy, vehicles) forecasting as illustrative cases in the final product of the ProFamy package; (4) we develop consulting services programs for household and consumption forecasting for the nation, states and small areas. In our Phase III follow-up work, we will commercialize the ProFamy package including the software, input database, output archive, technical support and consulting services. The ProFamy package is useful for business and health policy analysis/management on elderly long-term care needs/costs, housing, energy, vehicles, durable goods and other home-related products and services for the federal, state, county, community governmental offices and private businesses. It is also valuable for faculty and students as a research/teaching tool. Thus, the products of this project are of high significance in public health.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the Phase 2 application entitled \"Discovery and Development of Antidiabetic Drugs.\" The goal is to identify new molecular entities that promote the IRS2-branch of the insulin/IGF signaling system. The NIH support will be used to identify compounds that promote IRS2 signaling in test cells. Myloid cells will be used as the test cell for high throughput screening; survival of these cells in tissue culture is the assay endpoint. The ability of these compounds to promote pancreatic (3-cell growth, function and survival will be validated in rodent b-cells lines and rodent islets. Since diabetes is a major chronic disease of epidemic proportions, pharmaceutical products developed at HPRL will have opportunities for clinical testing worldwide. Dysregulated insulin signaling is a complex molecular problem that is associated with various metabolic diseases that progress to diabetes in more than 16 million people in the United States alone. Basic scientific investigation conducted over the past several years reveals that the insulin receptor substrate-2 protein is an essential component of the insulin signaling network in peripheral tissues and pancreatic (3-cells. The identification of new chemical entities that enhance the function of IRS2 might lead to fundamental improvements in the treatment or prevention type 2 diabetes. During Phase 1, we obtained a license from the Joslin Diabetes Center to use patented technology required to accomplish the proposed project. Moreover, we identified a chemical library in excess of 100,000 compounds of high complexity and low toxicity for high throughput screening. Finally, we established a prototype automated high throughput cell- based screen to identify compounds that promote IRS2 signaling. This Phase 2 SBIR application is focused upon 3 Specific Aims: 1. Use the validated HTP 32Dlrs2 cell-based assay to identify compounds that promote IRS2 signaling. 2. Validate the selectivity and specificity of the identified compounds toward the IRS2 signaling cascade. 3. Establish the physiological function of the validated compounds as NME's that promote IRS2 signaling in cell lines derived from transgenic mouse models of type 2 diabetes as well as in cellular metabolic assays in adipocytes. The NME's that emerge from this Phase 2 proposal can provide a new class of compounds that modulate protein-protein interactions upon the IRS2 scaffold. Some of these NME's could display the ability to promote central and peripheral insulin action and pancreatic (3-cell function, which can treat or cure diabetes. Since diabetes is a major chronic disease of epidemic proportions, validated compounds identified by this Phase 2 Award can have a worldwide market potential.",

        "abstract": "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is the primary methodology for characterizing the internal structure of materials at the nanometer to sub-Angstrom scale.  In the TEM, image formation results from the scattering of an incident electron wave by the atoms inside the crystal, and results in the formation of an image via either amplitude or phase contrast.  In each case, the details of the scattering processes are highly dependent on the precise angle between the incident beam and the sample.  However, the currently available mechanisms for in situ sample tilting is limited in resolution and accuracy by the frictional interfaces in the mechanism and the presence of large amounts of backlash.  These mechanisms also have limited goniometer tilt range because of the width and thickness of the mechanism.  This project will develop a specimen holder that will provide microscopists with unprecedented access to the crystallographic planes of their specimen, making it easy to achieve precise orientations.  In Phase I, we developed and tested new hardware that provided both high resolution and high range in pole pieces suitable for materials science work.  In Phase II, we will refine and extensively test this design, as well as improve the interface to the microscope.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  By providing high resolution, range, and stability, the new specimen holder should allow researchers in nanotechnology and materials science to fully exploit recent gains in resolution in advanced electron microscopes.  The images produced by these microscopes are used routinely to guide discoveries in nanoscience and materials development, and form a critical component in the semiconductor failure analysis market.",

This project will develop technology to increase the in-field Jc, filling factor, filament count, and stability, the most relevant improvements for near term accelerator-related applications.  Phase I successfully fabricated a 54 + 7 filament strand with good properties, extruded a 19 filament strand, fabricated multifilament strands with more conductive outer sheaths, improved fill factor by 50%, and increased mid-field performance of MgB2 strands using SiC additives.

This will enable a lower cost MRI and a lower per patient cost to do a MRI analysis. The MRI system cost is the largest cost driver in the per-patient cost to do a MRI for a patient especially with open MRIs. By lowering the cost of MRI systems the cost to patients will be lower. Lowering the cost of the MRI system can be significant if the superconducting operating temperature can be raised from 4 K to 20 K. The goal of this proposed Phase II is to demonstrate that MgB2 superconductor wires can be fabricated in coils that function in the 10-30 K range for open and enclosed MRI systems. In the SBIR Phase 1 Hyper Tech Research demonstrated small coils with fields high enough to be useful for open and enclosed MRI systems. In this Phase II we intend to demonstrate improved wire properties in longer length and in coil form so larger open MRI systems can be developed.

Magnesium diboride, a light-weight superconductor wire, is the ideal candidate coil material for ADRs in the 10-30 K range.  During the Phase I we demonstrated that drawing magnesium diboride wires to the needed diameter range could be achieved.

Materials are required that are capable of sustaining temperatures approaching 1000\u00b0C and also are stable in a high radiation environment.  One such application is the outer containment of the control rod material, where the sheath material is subjected to large thermal gradients and thermal cycling in addition to the high-temperature high-radiative-flux environment.  This project will develop a silicon-carbide-fiber/reinforced-silicon-carbide matrix composite that is stable under these high neutron fluxes and addresses the requirements for control rod sheaths.  In Phase I, a nuclear grade SiC/SiC composite was made by using braided preform architectures, which are well suited for the fabrication of axisymmetric control rod sheath tubes.  Preliminary mechanical and thermal testing was performed, and a preferred braid architecture was identified.  In Phase II, material property data, including mechanical and thermal properties, will be acquired.

In order to operate in the highest temperature and density regimes, angular momentum must be injected into the plasma without permitting the plasma to come into contact with a material surface.  To accomplish this, the plasma must be injected at high velocity tangential to the direction of plasma rotation.  In this project, angular momentum will be injected into a large centrifugally confined mirror plasma, using a two stage coaxial plasma accelerator with shaped electrodes.  This process will allow the high velocity jets to efficiently couple to the target plasma.  In Phase I, a prototype accelerator was designed and fabricated, and test-fired in the laboratory in preparation for injection experiments on a mirror machine plasma experiment.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases involving the urea cycle are clinically manifest by symptoms diverse as neonatal hyperammonemic coma to postpartum psychosis. Hyperammonemia is the primary phenotype of urea cycle defects but differentiating individual gene deficiencies within the urea cycle involves a complex series of biochemical tests. Products of the following genes are required for ureagenesis: N-acetylglutamate synthetase carbamyl phosphate synthetase 1 , ornithine transcarbamylase , argininosuccinate synthetase , argininosuccinate lyase , arginase, mitochondrial ornithine transporter and mitochondrial glutamate/aspartate transporter. Gene- based analysis is an established part of the diagnostic regimen for urea cycle defects but availability of testing is limited. Using 2 innovative technologies, melt profiling and freeze-dried preservation of PCR reaction mixtures, a simplified means to assess genes of the urea cycle is developed. Mutations in urea cycle gene are rare or private, necessitating comprehensive gene analysis, which is a complex and labor-intensive process. PCR reagents (buffer, MgCl2, primers, LCGreen dye, taq polymerase) to fully analyze urea cycle genes are freeze-dried into plates. Using these reagents requires they be resuspended with water containing the DNA sample being evaluated which bypasses the painstaking, error prone, and costly process of formulating and distributing the numerous reactions required for comprehensive gene analysis. The reagents are designed for PCR using a common condition. After amplification and without any post-PCR manipulation, the plate is analyzed by high resolution melt profiling. Melt profiling identifies regions containing sequence variants such that DNA sequence analysis is selectively targeted. As melt profiling is non-destructive to the amplification product, the product identified as producing an aberrant melting profile is recovered to serve as DNA sequencing template. Assay panels are prepared for the 8 genes of the urea cycle. Analyzing the genes of the urea cycle has been the purview of specialized reference labs and research protocols. Combining freeze-dried reagents and melt profiling will enable this complex analysis to be performed by any molecular pathology laboratory. As urea cycle deficiencies can be rapidly fatal in the neonatal period, fast turn around time is critical to patient survival and the proposed assay panels will expedite diagnosis of affected patients. These assay panels will have application to research assessing the cause of hyperammonemia observed in common disease states such as organ transplant or liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. Newborn screening by mass spectrometry identifies metabolites suggesting urea cycle defects and these assays can assess these patients. Rapidly identifying urea cycle defects is critical to patient survival when neonatal hyperammonemia is observed and the proposed assay panels will facilitate diagnosis. Hyperammonemia is observed in several common disease states (hepatitis, liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, organ or bone marrow transplant patients, patients undergoing chemotherapy, patients receiving valproic acid, and patients who for various reasons are catabolic) and gene of the urea cycle must be suspect as a means by which this is manifest. The proposed assay panels provide a means to readily assess gene that are well established to contribute to hyperammonemia.",

It requires strength and stamina and may be impacted by degree of mobility, weight-bearing status, balance, range of motion, and poor vision. Many older adults, in settings ranging from homes in the community to senior apartments and HUD housing to assisted living and nursing homes require, or at least receive, assistance with dressing. In Phase I, a prototype assistive wardrobe unit was developed and tested with 26 elders living in a range of housing settings. The unit was designed to specifically address physical and safety concerns experienced by these residents. Results from Phase I strongly indicate that the prototype assistive wardrobe unit increased residents' ability to access their clothing, with greater ease and safety (p< .003). In Phase II, the assistive wardrobe unit will be refined to include supports for people with cognitive impairment. A repeated measure design with two interventions (wardrobe alone, and wardrobe with restorative training program) will assess the impact of the assistive wardrobe system on the normal daily dressing routine of 45-50 elders with a range of physical and cognitive deficits. There are 4 hypotheses: #1 The assistive wardrobe system will enhance independence and safety in accessing clothes; #2 Residents will complete more of the dressing process independently when using the assistive wardrobe system than when using their traditional wardrobe; #3 Staff will spend less time and provide less assistance to residents in getting their clothes out and getting dressed when using the assistive wardrobe; #4 Results will be stronger after residents participate in a six-day restorative dressing program using the wardrobe. The expected outcomes will be positive both for residents and facilities. Loss of functional abilities, such as dressing independence, is linked to decreases in self worth and well-being, therefore maintenance or improvements in dressing independence may increase sense of self-worth. Further, given the current and expected future shortages in staffing, especially at the CNA/STNA level, environmental prostheses that increase efficiency without compromising resident safety will be increasingly important.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will achieve higher retrieval accuracy for shape-based search for both the web and the enterprise. The proposed work in Phase II is to achieve higher retrieval accuracy supported by three key components: 1) pose determination for 3D models: bridging the space gap between 2D and 3D shapes by finding three intuitive and robust orthogonal orientations for 3D models; 2) 2D orthogonal view generation: representing a three orthogonal views along the pose orientations; 3) similarity measurement between 2D shapes: finding 2D and 3D shapes based on the user's query. A framework will be developed by focusing on three important modules: 1) 2D constraint detection and use of implied constraints with initial application in 2D and 3D views; (2) Enhanced multiple level-of-details in 3D representations, and (3) Human assisted system classification of large datasets. Traditional options of finding part suppliers using catalogs, trade shows and prior business relationship limit the choice of suppliers. Current text-based search to find suppliers face challenges, such as context and language sensitivity, and is inadequate in overcoming the technological challenges posed by variations in how product or part information is specified across a global supply chain. The current effort proposes to use shape, which is the lowest common denominator, to link the OEMs and suppliers. This technology can also aid the current trend among companies in aerospace, automotive, medical equipments and other industries towards 3Ddata standards for fast retrieval, as it can provide a significant leap in terms of accuracy, speed and relevance in the search and retrieval of information. If successful, this technology can contribute significantly to research in areas where shape is important, such as bio-technology and pharmaceutical sectors, where rapid identification of molecules and their docking features help reduce time and cost involved in drug development. For the medical industry due to increased usage of CT scans and 3D imaging technologies, 3D shape search can be used for local feature identification in colonoscopy or other exploratory procedures, brain angiography, reconstruction, projection of malformation or location of polyps and ensure better and rapid diagnosis of disease. Development of methods for automatically parsing human sketches and determining constraints will enable many other research activities and broadly help in a more natural human machine interaction.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Addressing a major transfusion safety issue, as of March 2004, AABB statute 5.1.5.1 mandates testing of all platelet units for bacterial contamination. The only commercially available tests for this purpose in the U.S. are culture-based tests which require 48-72 hours to deliver a result. Such tests are useful only for apheresis platelet testing, but not for random donor platelets. Under prior Phase I and Phase II SBIR grants, applicants developed a 50-minute test for bacterial contamination of platelets capable of detecting both gram-positive and gram-negative species at concentrations down to 103 CFU/ml. The test has been converted into kit form. Its simple procedure and pre-measured single dose reagents are aimed at the needs of transfusion services and blood banks which constitute the principal market.         Compared with culture tests performed in the blood bank at the time of platelet collection, from which results must be extrapolated at later times, the proposed test is intended for application to platelet units at the point of release. Current point-of-release test methods rely on pH or glucose reagent strips, which have been shown to be inaccurate and insensitive. This new, fast and accurate test will increase the safety of transfused platelets and reduce the risk of transfusion-associated sepsis due to bacterial contamination, the number one cause of morbidity and mortality in transfusions today. It is the first test of its kind which can be applied to both apheresis and random donor platelet units.         The BacTxTM test is based on the detection of peptidoglycan as a universal component of bacterial cell walls in both gram-positive and gram-negative species. The principle technological innovations underlying the BacTxTM test include (1) the application of an ultrasensitive enzymatic detection chemistry which is triggered by peptidoglycan, (2) the development of a sensitive colorimetric indicator to facilitate visualization and measurement of assay results, and (3) means for capturing bacteria from platelet concentrates for detection while avoiding interference and inhibition from platelets or other blood components.         The main purpose of this project is to carry out a clinical trial of the diagnostic test kit developed under the previous Phase II program, to be submitted for FDA approval. As a device intended for screening blood products used in transfusion, this kit requires clearance by the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) before it can be marketed with clinical claims as an in vitro diagnostic device. The clinical trial design will validate the sensitivity of the test in detecting bacteria spiked at various levels into platelet units, the specificity of the test in control units, and its reproducibility and stability. Its performance will be compared against culture as gold standard.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Summary The pork tapeworm Taenia solium is now increasingly recognized as a parasite with international health implications and the capability of spreading to non-endemic areas. The growing attention to this helminth species relates primarily to the severity of health problems associated with infection of the central nervous system with the larval stage, which causes neurocysticercosis currently classified as the most important neurologic disease of parasitic origin. In spite of the theoretical possibility for eradication of T. solium cysticercosis global eradication of this infection is still unlikely in the near future. The overall goal of the current Phase II application will be to finish the development, validate through clinical trials, and launch the manufacture of serological tests for detection of specific antibodies to circulating antigens of the larval stage of Taenia solium. The tests will utilize standardized antigenic material such as synthetic peptides, recombinant proteins and combinations thereof selected from antigens identified recently in diagnostic bands of Western blots (WB) prepared from cyst material of naturally infected pigs. Two types of tests will be developed: one will be in a standard microwell ELISA format, and the second will be a rapid non-instrumental format utilizing lateral flow principles. An innovative but already proven immune-capture assay technology will be applied in both new tests, which will emphasize the advantage of using pure synthetic and recombinant antigens. The quick and simple ELISA test will ideally meet the requirements for laboratory testing of multiple samples in sero-epidemiological surveys and community-based studies, as well as for diagnosis of cysticercosis infection in individuals. The lateral flow format with capability for whole blood testing will provide a convenient and more cost-effective alternative to the current WB test, and will be suitable for small batch or individual testing in labs or field conditions. Methodological innovations that will be implemented in the lateral flow test will make its sensitivity equal to or even higher than the sensitivity of the microplate ELISA version. Both ELISA and lateral flow tests will be able to detect antibodies in samples from two hosts of T. solium, humans and pigs. Phase II of this project includes finalizing the analysis of synthetic and recombinant antigens in order to select combination(s) with a minimal number of antigens providing equal or better sensitivity than the current WB test for detection of antibodies in patients with various stages of disease, with comparably high specificity. The second major goal will be validation of technology for preparation of antigenic material and diagnostic reagents including launching the manufacture of pilot lots of the new tests. Significant efforts at this stage will be directed towards optimization and manufacture of highly sensitive lateral flow versions of the serological tests. The objective of the present project is the development of the two types of a commercial serological tests for diagnosis of infection caused by larva stage of pork tapeworm Taenia solium in human and pigs utilizing standardized antigenic material such as synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins. The first test will be in simple microwell ELISA format well suited for testing of any number of samples, using semi-automated or automated equipment in clinical labs and equipped facilities. The second test will be in rapid non-instrumental format utilizing lateral flow principles for application in field conditions or in laboratories for testing relatively small batches of samples. The new tests will replace the expensive WB technique that requires specially trained personnel, and will make possible a level of standardization and accuracy in clinical and reference laboratories that is currently unattainable. The primary application of these tests will be the diagnosis of neurocysticercosis in humans, pig cysticercosis, seroepidemiological surveys and community-based studies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing continuation application of our SBIR Phase II project entitled \"Effective and Non-Toxic Antagonist to Heparin and LMWH\". Extremely promising results and outstanding productivity have been attained from the previous Phase II research, as reflected by the publication of 12 peer-reviewed manuscripts and 2 US patents. Both in vitro and animal testing demonstrated that the low molecular weight protamine (LMWP) under development not only completely neutralized the activities of both heparin and LMWH, but also did not elicit any adverse responses. In addition, the chain-shortened LMWP was shown to be deprived of both antigenicity and immunogenicity; two primary toxic effects of protamine. Furthermore, preliminary studies in diabetic rats indicated that LMWP could be formulated with insulin to yield a long-lasting blood glucose control without displaying the commonly observed protamine reactions that masquerade as insulin allergy. The main objective of this competing continuation application is to carry out the pre-clinical safety studies, required by FDA for Investigational New Drug (IND), to develop LMWP as a non-toxic clinical substitute for protamine in all of its possible applications (e.g. heparin reversal, insulin formulations), for all patients, without any concern of protamine-associated toxic effects. The six highly integrated specific aims are to: [1] design a packed-bed reactor (PBR) flow system that allows for GMP-guided manufacturing of LMWP with the highest purity and yield; [2] assess the toxic and pharmacologic effects of LMWP via in vitro and in vivo animal testing; [3] determine the acute toxicity of the LMWP product in both rats and rabbits; [4] establish the safety pharmacology profile of LMWP (Note: Aim [2] through Aim [4] will be conducted by following the FDA Guidelines for IND); [5] evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of LMWP in protamine/LMWP-sensitized rats; and [6] evaluate the efficacy and toxicity LMWP/insulin formulations in a diabetic rats. Success of these aims will lead to LMWP becoming a whole-sale clinical protamine substitute. The annual consumption of protamine involved in heparin reversal is estimated to be over 10 metric tons. The quantity of protamine used in insulin formulations is believed to be even several folds higher. Therefore, the predicted market for LMWP is very significant, and the impact and true value of the proposed LMWP technology is far-reaching.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is one of the most common reasons for a woman to visit her gynecologist, resulting in 3 million visits per year. We propose the development of a minimally invasive Endometrial Imaging Probe (EIP) to facilitate the evaluation of these patients. This device would enable creation of high- resolution visual maps of the endometrium. The procedure would involve a simple office-based procedure requiring about one minute, and not involve distention of the uterus as is required by hysteroscopy. During Phase I we developed a prototype probe with an outer diameter of 3.25mm, a novel omni-directional tip, and a servomotor. Specialized dewarping and collaging software combines several hundred image frames into a single high-resolution map of an axial segment of the endometrial cavity (from the fundus to the cervix). We successfully obtained proof-of-concept by imaging ex vivo human uteri. We now propose the development of advanced two-dimensional visual motion tracking. This will enable free-hand motion of the probe and allow it to be manipulated in a fashion similar to a uterine sound or an endometrial biopsy Pipelle. Most importantly, it will enable imaging of endometrium away from the primary axis of the fundus to the cervix. Thus, the cornua will be imaged and a visual map of the entire endometrial cavity will be produced. The system will then be tested in a pilot clinical study. Using a Semi-quantitative endometrial cavity evaluation system (SECES), we will determine the accuracy of EIP image relative to gross and histopathological evaluation of the endometrial cavity at the time of hysterectomy. It is our long term goal to produce a simple device to investigate patients with abnormal bleeding in the office setting.",

Geared toward primary and secondary prevention, MSB-Drugs will promote motivation to prevention initiation of, or reduce, drug use and associated risk behaviors. Compared to alcohol, drug use prevention is neglected on campuses, despite the prevalence of use and significant consequences. Marijuana is the most widely used illicit drug, followed by non-medical use of prescription drugs, including stimulants (dextroamphetamine, methyphenidate) and opioids (oxycodone, hydrocodone). In 2003, roughly 10 percent of high school seniors reported non- medical use of hydrocodone, making it the third most abused substance for this group, after marijuana and amphetamines. From 2002 to 2003, abuse of oxycodone increased by nearly 40 percent among college- aged youth. Mixing prescription drugs with other drugs, such as alcohol, further increases risk for drug interactions and overdose. The public health need for easily accessible and effective drug prevention for college students is clear. Recent NIDA initiatives recognize this need (Prescription Drug Abuse, PA-01-110; Volkow, 2005). MSB-Drugs will use technology and rich media to incorporate key evidence-based prevention features, including personal risk assessments with tailored feedback to promote motivation, relevant education about different drugs and addiction to foster accurate risk appraisals, and skill-building activities to promote refusal and coping skills and self-efficacy.

HouseCalls Latino will be integrated with an English version of HouseCalls. Both versions utilize the latest Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology so that patients can indicate pain and symptom levels in between office visits, as well as receive critical educational and self-care information for common cancer-related problems. An administrative application also allows clinicians, researchers, and support staff to access customizable reports depicting patients' pain and symptom levels over time. The system is designed to address the increasing treatment of cancer on an outpatient basis, while also helping healthcare providers meet emerging guidelines that call for the \"routinization\" of pain and symptom assessments. The development of the HouseCalls Latino system will make these goals possible even when Hispanic/Latino patients are working with non-Spanish speaking providers. Phase I involved development of Alpha versions of the system's core assessment modules and proof of concept research to demonstrate product acceptability. Phase II will involve confirmation of the psychometric properties of all assessment modules proposed for HouseCalls Latino, as well as production and testing of completed educational and other patient support services. Even though pain and other distressing symptoms are extremely widespread among cancer patients, numerous studies have shown that these symptoms, significantly affecting quality of life, are insufficiently recognized and poorly documented by providers. Although new guidelines by JCAHO and other regulatory agencies requiring the 'routinization' of pain have been implemented, providers are becoming overwhelmed by the multitude of disease management guidelines that are surfacing. This need for improved pain management and palliative care is even more urgent among Hispanic cancer patients, who often face cultural and linguistic barriers. By bridging the physical, cultural, and linguistic gaps between health care providers and Latino cancer patients and simultaneously making pain assessments more accurate and cost-effective, the HouseCalls Latino system is designed to help address this important problem.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project entails developing a decision support system for the train schedule design problem, one of the freight railroad transportation's most significant optimization problems. Train scheduling is an important part of a railroad's operating plan that enables efficient movement of railcars. Designing such an operating plan is a very large-scale and very complex multi-objective optimization problem that, to date, has defied solution. Consequently, operating plan development at railroads is a lengthy, manual, and cumbersome process that may involve five to ten persons for a period of three to six months. Using cutting-edge operations research techniques, Innovative Scheduling, is developing a software product that can obtain a new operating plan within two weeks using two-three employees and can save a typical Class I US railroad over $50M annually. The train schedule design problem determines: how many trains to run; the origin, destination, and route of each train; the train arrival and departure times for each station at which it stops; the weekly operating schedule for each train; and the assignment of blocks of cars to trains. The train schedule must satisfy numerous practical constraints and business rules and achieve the minimum cost of transportation. This problem is a very large-scale multi-objective integer-programming problem containing trillions of decision variables. The proposed research will develop decomposition-based customized algorithms using state-of-the-art network optimization and heuristic techniques so that this problem can be solved within two hours of computer time on a workstation. These algorithms will be packaged into a web-based decision support system with attractive and friendly graphical and geographical interfaces, which will allow sufficient user control. The proposed research and development requires significant advances in modeling, algorithmic, and implementation technologies and will provide much needed software to schedule freight trains worldwide. This research will further be extended to develop a decision support system for passenger train scheduling. BNSF Railway, a Class I US Railroad, which is a Development Partner in this project and is providing supplementary funds, data and manpower. The train scheduling decision support system is likely to be used by all freight railroads in their operating plan development process. A computerized method for train scheduling will make a railroad more responsive to traffic changes and enable it to change its schedule frequently. Optimal and timely train schedule will introduce greater efficiency in the system and significantly lower costs. Further, optimal train schedules require significantly less train miles, crew hours, locomotive hours, and railcar hours to transport the same set of shipments, thereby increasing our nation's energy efficiency and reducing pollution. The success of this product will lead to a greater acceptance of models and operations research techniques in railroad planning and scheduling. Railroads are then anticipated to embrace operations research models and introduce decision support systems in a variety of business processes including tactical operations and commercial strategy. The railroad industry will then be in a position to achieve a new level of productivity, resulting in lower freight charges for end users, and making America's products more competitive on the world market.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to provide clustering software for very large databases and for categorical data. Investigators in virtually all areas of research seek to discover patterns and relationships in data. Computer intensive exploratory analysis, or data mining, is having a huge impact in science and industry (e.g. Berkhin 2002, Maitra 2002). However, the availability of software for obtaining partitions and for their visualization lags far behind the proliferation of proposed methods and the growth in size of available databases. We believe that implementing new algorithms for clustering of large datasets that may include non-numeric attributes, and visualizing cluster properties will open new opportunities for data analysis.         In Phase I, we developed scalable implementations of clustering methods, including k-means and its extensions to categorical and mixed mode data, and demonstrated that we could discover things about data through a combination of clustering and visualization that neither alone could provide. Our ultimate goal in Phases II and III is to develop a modular addition to the S-PLUS language called S+CLUSTER that provides the following key features:          - A suite of clustering algorithms suitable for large and possibly high-dimensional datasets that may include categorical attributes;     - Extensive capabilities for visual data exploration of the results of clustering; and     - Tools for validation and diagnostics facilitating objective assessment of clustering results.         We intend to create software that is flexible and easy to use, and which should enable the analysis and understanding of data from a wide range of applications. Clustering or unsupervised classification has been used in genetics research, protein classification, psychiatric research, analysis of biomedical signals, segmentation of medical images, etc. The software will be part of an integrated environment for data analysis, and it will permit the customization of the clustering process, which will extend the ability of biomedical researchers to understand complex data. New insights into microarrays, epidemiological data and protein database may have high potential in drug discovery, disease diagnosis, and treatment.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This SBIR project aims to produce superior methods and software for classification and regression when there are many potential predictor variables to choose from. The methods should (1) produce stable results, where small changes in the data do not produce major changes in the variables selected or in model predictions; (2) produce accurate predictions; (3) facilitate scientific interpretation, by selecting a smaller subset of predictors which provide the best predictions; (4) allow continuous and categorical variables; and (5) support linear regression, logistic regression (predicting a binary outcome), survival analysis, and other types of regression. This project is based on least angle regression, which uni?es and provides a fast implementation for a number of modern regression techniques. Least angle regression has great potential, but currently- available software is limited in scope and robustness. The outcome of this project should be software which is more robust and widely applicable. This software would apply broadly, including to medical diagnosis, detecting cancer, feature selection in microarrays, and modeling patient characteristics like blood pressure. Phase I work demonstrates feasibility by extending least angle work in three key directions-categorical predictors, logistic regression, and a numerically-accurate implementation. Phase II goals include extensions to other types of explanatory variables (e.g. polynomial or spline functions, and interactions between variables), to survival and other additional regression models, and to handle missing data and massive data sets. This proposed software will enable medical researchers to obtain high prediction accuracy, and obtain stable and interpretable results, in high-dimensional situations. Predicting outcomes based on covariates, determining which covariates most affect outcomes, and ad- justing treatment effects estimates for covariates, are among the most important problems in biostatistics. Prediction and feature selection are particularly difficult when there are more possible features than samples; gene microarrays and protein mass spectrometry are extreme examples of this, producing thousands to millions of measurements per sample. LARS excels at feature selection; the proposed software should enable medical researchers to obtain stable and interpretable models with better prediction accuracy in high-dimensional situations.",

        "abstract": "Silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) are being used to break barriers with respect to the design and fabrication of high-temperature high-power transistors, but capacitors remain the weak link in achieving higher temperature electronics.  In particular, the use of SiC should allow future power devices to operate safely at temperatures up to 400\u00b0C, but at these temperatures, the capacitors have been shown to severely degrade.  Therefore, high-temperature-capable capacitors will be needed for SiC power components such as device gate drive circuits and RF power transistors.  This project will fabricate long-life boron nitride (BN) capacitors for advanced SiC power electronics, using a physical vapor deposition (PVD) process.  The BN capacitor will match the silicon carbide device operating at temperatures above 300\u00b0C.  In Phase I, layers for the BN capacitors were first grown on a silicon substrate using an ion-source-assisted PVD technique.  The use of vapor deposition provided for precise control and quality material formation.  The capacitors were subjected to electrical and thermal characterization.  The BN material exhibited high thermal stability, high thermal conductivity, and high breakdown voltage, and met the SiC power requirements.  Phase II will further develop the advanced BN capacitors by fabricating and testing different capacitor structures, and by fabricating pre-commercial capacitor prototypes.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  High-energy density capacitors that can operate at hige temperatures should find use in ballistic missiles, electric guns, and high power microwave sources; microwave systems for communications such as cellular telephony and data transmission; satellite communications systems; high power pulsed amplifiers for ground, airborne and space-based radar; and high frequency switching power supplies.",

Number Concepts and Automaticity proposes to isolate predictable factors in mathematical failure and provide the right guidance and practice to overcome the deficiencies. Toward this end, the project will focus on developing mathematical models for children, bringing those models into working memory, and building automaticity with math problems. We propose to research and develop a supplemental math software program for students in grades 1 - 3. The primary purpose of this program will be to provide foundational support for students who struggle in math, although we expect that all students in general education classrooms, and most students in special education, will derive benefit. We will research this program in the Springfield, Ore., schools, where we will work with all students, including those students in key subgroups: special education and English language learners. Our project will focus on software development, implementation strategies, and scientific research. Number Concepts and Automaticity will yield important breakthrough results. It will empower students to form the conceptual models they need, and it will provide differentiated instruction by providing a choice of mathematical models for conceptual development. Students will build fluency as the software employs timing systems that will adjust to individual abilities, including breakthrough accommodations for students with physical impairments that slow their response rate. The software will include built-in universal design features, support for assistive technology, and support for students who are English language learners. The project will be implemented in close coordination with the Springfield schools. We will align our work to district goals, train and support teachers throughout the year-long process, and work with the district to integrate the technology into the elementary math curriculum. A significant experimental study will be conducted by the Pacific Institutes for Research. As a result, the mathematical concept modeling, accuracy analysis, and fluency measures all will be consistent with the expectations of the academic community. The completed project will feature three main components. IntelliTools will develop a rich, elementary mathematics software program that will be sold in the school marketplace. IntelliTools will employ an implementation method that will be fully documented and sold as a product to school districts. Finally, IntelliTools and PIR will conduct an extensive experimental research study that will validate the software and implementation and will elevate the state of the art in elementary mathematics education research.

Our technique, MHS, provides core capabilities to automate warpage and other problems that were impractical until now. MHS extends a multi-representation approach the PI first conceived at Georgia Tech for CAD-CAE interoperability. This method defines and combines key ingredients in a novel way: rich product models based on open standards, idealization capture, advanced analytical modeling and finite element meshing, and a modular architecture based on knowledge patterns. Phase 2 accelerates this work towards commercialization by exploring effective meshing and idealization refinements, completing validation vs. physical measurements, and benchmarking performance with challenge problems: dual-sided PCAs with 20+ complex devices. COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Evaluating and correcting PCA/B warpage during design offers major improvements in electronics manufacturing yield and reliability. Integrating warpage analysis tools with established ECAD and MCAE tools benefits product development speed and efficiency. Our new warpage tools will provide significant advantages to U.S. manufacturers (PCB fabricators, package assembly and test houses, and contract manufacturers), potentially saving $100M/year. This effort will provide highly automated warpage simulation tools initially aimed at PCBs, PCAs, and chip packages. We will offer these innovative capabilities both as rich applications and as turnkey engineering web services for small or low frequency users.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this Phase II Research Proposal is to continue the successfully completed work of the Phase I Research project by further developing affinity-based mass spectrometry assays for the detection/characterization of Biodefense agents, specifically the family of Staphylococcal Enterotoxins (SE). The assays will utilize affinity capture in pipette-fitted microcolumns modified with anti-SE antibodies to selectively retrieve SE from buffer, tap water, and milk samples. Detection will be achieved by measuring the molecular weight of the eluted SE via MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The assay platform is unique as it offers dual specificity: the first comes from the use of a capturing antibody, and the second comes from the observation of a specific m/z value, characteristic of the analyzed toxin, in the resulting mass spectra. The use of polyclonal antibodies in combination with MS enables capture and detection of protein toxins and related variants in a single assay, and in the process significantly reduces the cost and time of analysis. In addition, multiple capture antibodies can be used on a single device, providing a multiplexed assay array able to screen for multiple biodefense agents in a single analysis, with each species differentiated in the mass spectrum by their unique m/z. In such, the proposed assay offers significant advantages over existing and commercially available sandwich-based assays.         Under the four specific aims of this proposal, assays for the detection of the SE will be developed and their reproducibility and sensitivities demonstrated. Quantitative approaches for the detection of the SE via the proposed affinity-based mass spectrometric assay will be developed and applied. Upon successfully developing individual assays for the SE, a comprehensive multiplexed assay will be developed to provide the means to simultaneously detect multiple enterotoxins in a single analysis. In addition, routines will be developed, of which when used in combination with data evaluation software, will guide workflow in depicting samples containing SE. Additionally, secondary analyses that are able to assist in the characterization of variant forms of the enterotoxins will also be developed. The successful completion of these Phase II Specific Aims will result in fully-functional SE-MSIA assays/multiplexed assay capable of detecting/characterizing a family of toxins and a proteomics-based platform for the detection of SE to be offered to a network of laboratories (e.g., members of the CDC's Laboratory Response Network).         We view the most direct social benefit, with respect to public health, to be the ability to detect Biodefense Agents present in water/milk/food supplies on a routine basis. In the event of no-detection, there is a corresponding \"peace of mind\" that accompanies the knowledge that such routine assays are in place - akin to periodic medical exams revealing an individual is healthy. In the event of detection, the social benefit stems from the ability to take corrective measures to retard the spread of contaminated sources, which clearly has the ability to save human lives.",

While this access method is reasonably reliable for people with typical speech, people with motor speech disorders (dysarthria) are presently not able to use this technology reliably. The purpose of this research is to provide these people with a unique assistive-device access method that utilizes their speech. We will accomplish this by continuing to develop a Speech Supplemented Word Prediction Program (SSWPP) that enables people with dysarthria to use their speech capabilities to interact with personal computers, with an emphasis on assisted writing. The central element of the SSWPP is custom speech-recognition software used in conjunction with word prediction. The feasibility results for the SSWPP developed during Phase 1 are exciting. The average keystroke savings achieved by people with dysarthria on typical sentences was 68%. Commercially available word prediction programs achieved no better than 47% keystroke savings on the same text. Phase 2 design activities include improving the speech recognition engine, developing an optimized microphone interface, integrating the SSWPP into Microsoft Word, and developing a speech-to-text display for use in face-to-face communication.

The World Bank has calculated an annual loss due to Chagas disease to the endemic countries of Latin America equivalent to over US$6.5 billion per year. Control of Chagas disease is now given high priority by Latin American governments. The primary future research requirements for control of vectors of Chagas disease are: 1) Better control techniques, 2) Better vector sampling techniques, 3) Better organization of epidemiological surveillance. This proposal aims to provide the improved vector surveillance technology and new vector control techniques that are imperative to long term management of Chagas disease. The primary goals of this Phase II SBIR are: to develop known kissing bug attractants into a functional lure system for three important Chagas disease vectors, interface lures with improved triatomine traps to form baited traps, develop lure and kill technology around attractants, demonstrate the efficacy of attractant- baited traps compared to existing passive traps and the efficacy of lure and kill in Latin America. The acute research need for vector control has been identified as improved surveillance. In Phase I research IPM Development Company discovered effective bug attractants and shown that bug attractants greatly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the present inadequate survey traps. The introduction of attractants may also enhance the ability to introduce transgenic lethal symbiotic bacteria [genetically modified symbiotic bacteria which produce a product that kills the trypanosome causative agent of Chagas disease] into the environment. Attractant-baited kill stations will directly reduce bug populations. Research and development in this area presents commercial opportunities for both surveillance and control technology. The WHO Division of Control of Tropical Diseases control strategy for the elimination of Chagas Disease over the period 1996-2010 is based in part on the interruption of transmission. Robust surveillance is essential to measure the true efficacy of this program. Continued monitoring programs are required to ensure early detection and elimination of reinfestation by the vectors. These factors provide a basis for a continued market for a good surveillance and vector suppression tool.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of research is to develop a rapid, point-of-care (POC), nucleic acid amplification based diagnostic test for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae using our innovative \"Lab-in-a-tube\" (LiatTM) technology. Chlamydia and gonorrhea are the first and second most frequently reported sexually transmitted diseases in the United States, and around the World. Three quarters of the women and half of the men infected with C. trachomatis are asymptomatic, and thus do not seek medical attention. Although systematic screening of high incidence groups is performed to find asymptomatic patients, a significant percentage of the individuals testing positive for an infection by these organisms do not return to the clinic after their test results. These individuals contribute to the further spread of these diseases in the population. Although rapid tests are available for near patient detection of these infectious agents, these tests lack the sensitivity to detect ~40% of cases. Therefore, a more sensitive point-of-care test is needed to reduce the transmission of these sexually transmitted diseases. In our Phase I research, IQuum has demonstrated the feasibility of rapidly detecting C. trachomatis nucleic acids in urine specimens with a sensitivity of detection of 30 elementary bodies (EB) (150 fg) in less than 1 hour, using our Liat system. This system consists of a Liat Analyzer, and disposable Liat Tubes, which can automate all of the processes involved in a nucleic acid amplification test, including reagent preparation, target enrichment, inhibitor removal, nucleic acid extraction, amplification and real-time detection, in one portable device. After the user introduces the biological sample into the tube, the tube remains closed during the test, thus preventing cross-contamination of reagents with samples. In Phase II, we propose to increase the sensitivity of our assays by developing a large volume sample processing device as well as developing assays targeting ribosomal ribonucleic acids. The performance of the IQuum tests will be compared to existing commercial tests by Roche and Gen-Probe and a clinical study plan will be submitted to the Food & Drug Administration (FDA). In Phase III a clinical study will be launched to obtain FDA clearance for sale of the test for human diagnostics. Chlamydia and gonorrhea are the first and second most frequently reported sexually transmitted diseases in the United States, and around the World. A more sensitive point-of-care test for the detection of chlamydia and gonorrhea will increase the percentage of patients receiving treatment for these sexually transmitted diseases and reduce the spread of these organisms in the population.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The tasks associated with parenthood can be overwhelming. Most parents have access to a wealth of written materials, media, and web-based resources to assist them. For parents who have cognitive limitations (CL), however, these resources are typically inaccessible or incomprehensible. Specialized training for parents who have CL remains scarce nationwide with no systemic support from state or federal governments. Professionals are ill-equipped to adequately support these families in three major ways: (1) uncertainty about how to identify parents who have CL, (2) limited knowledge and understanding about how to best support parents who have CL, and (3) the lack of training materials geared to the learning needs of this group. Without appropriate support, positive parent and child outcomes in families headed by parents who have CL are limited, seriously compromising the potential healthy development of over 120,000 babies are born in the United States each year to mothers with CL. Thus, there is a serious public health need for flexible, appropriate and engaging parent education training materials for parents who have CL and the professionals supporting them. In Phase I we: developed a parent training program, My Bedtime Routine, for professionals to use with parents who have CL, conducted a feasibility evaluation of the program and held a program review with a panel of social service professionals and at-risk parents. The results of the evaluation were encouraging. Parent participants established bedtime routines or improved their already-established routines, and experienced less stress and more fun with their children at bedtime. Use of My Bedtime Routine also led to improvement in the quantity and quality of professional-provided support. We believe these Phase I results justify expanding and completing the program. We propose to expand the program in Phase II and evaluate the program using a delayed, treatment-control group design with 80 pairs of parents and support professionals to assess the efficacy of the program in: 1) increasing professionals' knowledge, skills and confidence related to working with parents who have CL, 2) increasing the quantity of support offered by professionals to the targeted parents, 3) improving the quality of the relationship between professionals and targeted parents, and 4) improving parents' skills in the program topic areas.",

        "abstract": "The International Linear Collider (ILC) will require hundreds of klystron pulsed-power modulators that must operate in the very long pulse-width range (1 to 2 millisecond).  Long pulse width modulators typically require large capacitive energy storage banks to prevent voltage droop, and large, costly pulse transformers.   Marx-generator-based modulators have the potential to be effective for this application; however, little work has been done to tailor this type of modulator for long pulse widths.  This project will develop a Marx-based modulator that is tailored to meet the specific requirements of the ILC.  The approach will focus on a novel combination of Marx cells with unique control technology, which will dramatically reduce the modulator\u00bfs capacitive energy storage while still meeting the precision pulse regulation required.  In Phase I, circuit simulations and analyses were performed to optimize the configuration of the Marx-based modulator.  Key components were defined and evaluations of these components were made to determine their suitability for this application.  A conceptual design and a cost model were developed for the Marx cells, regulation circuits, and the entire modulator.  Emphasis was placed on compactness while maintaining serviceability.  In Phase II, a full sized Marx-based modulator, which meets the requirements of the ILC program, will be designed and constructed.  Subsystem tests will be conducted to verify key component performance prior to modulator system construction.  The modulator will be delivered to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) for evaluation, and comparison with other modulators.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new Marx-based modulator should provide a cost-effective solution for the International Linear Collider.  In addition, the modulator should have important commercial applications, including its use in radiation processing equipment for materials processing, disinfestation, food irradiation, and other electron beam processing industries where long-pulse, high-average-power sources are required.  The variable pulse width and high repetition rate also would make this modulator a valuable microwave source for cargo inspection systems.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) is an autoimmune disease that destroys insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. Type 1 DM affects an estimated one million Americans and usually finds its onset in the young. It is one of the leading causes of kidney disease, peripheral neurological diseases and also blindness. It shortens the lifespan primarily through premature cardiovascular mortality. It results in significant health care expenditures for patients, their families and society as a whole. Although blood glucose levels can be well controlled by insulin substitution therapy, some of the DM complications cannot. Therefore, reconstitution of normal pancreatic islet function has been an important DM treatment goal. This has included the transplantation of allogeneic pancreatic islets. Immune suppression protocols have been developed that allowed the successful transplantation of islets. Unfortunately, they are fraught with significant immediate and chronic side effects that make their use especially problematic for children. Presently, only patients suffering from unstable forms of DM are considered transplantation candidates. Isogenis' mission has been the development of innovative immune inhibitory agents that employ highly specific, yet effective immune suppression approaches. Isogenis based its technology on the natural veto immune inhibitory phenomenon. Isogenis uses viral vectors that transfer the CD8 a-chain and thus specific immune suppression to transplants. Isogenis already reached the crucial developmental milestone of proof-of-functional utility of its veto vector approach. Isogenis established that simple extracorporal veto vector transductions permanent protected pancreatic islets from rejection by fully allogeneic recipient animals. Isogenis now proposes to use a nonhuman primate model to test the functionality, pharmacology and toxicity of the clinical version of a veto vector and thus to complete the pre-clinical trial stage of veto vectors in pancreatic islet transplantation. In parallel, Isogenis will optimize protocols of veto vector production and purification and veto vector-based immune suppression regimens. These studies will allow Isogenis to collect data for the filing of an 'investigational new drug' (IND) with the 'Food and Drug Administration'.    Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) is an autoimmune disease that destroys insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. Type 1 DM affects an estimated one million Americans and is one of the leading causes of kidney disease, peripheral neurological diseases and also blindness. Transplantation of pancreatic islets can provide a permanent cure. However, present immune suppression regimens used for organ transplantation are fraught with significant immediate and chronic side effects that make their use especially problematic for children. Isogenis is developing novel immune suppressive compounds that are less toxic,a are used short-term; yet prevent the rejection of transplanted tissue with similar if not improved efficacy.",

Current off-the-shelf small PDMs are not designed for open hole drilling; rather, they are used primarily for scale removal and drill-out of cement inside tubing \u00bf short run operations at standard differential pressures.  This project will develop a highly durable, low cost, low maintenance, long life (in excess of 1000 hours), advanced Sealed Bearing Assembly (SBA) capable of operating under high differential pressures.  In Phase I, a three-dimensional Finite Element Analysis and a large matrix of laboratory tests were used to evaluate several concepts for next generation, micro-hole size, hydrodynamic rotary seals.  A hydrodynamic thrust-bearing concept was extended to bidirectional, low cost designs, which also were evaluated by laboratory testing.  The results confirmed the feasibility of a long-life high-differential-pressure SBA for micro-hole PDMs.  In Phase II, concepts for enhanced lubrication seals and \u00bfbi-directional floating\u00bf hydrodynamic thrust bearings will be further developed and implemented in different SBA for microhole PDMs.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The advanced Sealed Bearing Assembly, which will be designed to mate with any of the new PDMs being developed to meet DOE goals, should significantly reduce the cost of drilling and exploration.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Conventional pulse oximetry has significant limitations because it works on the assumption that there are only two species of hemoglobin present in arterial blood, oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb) and reduced hemoglobin (RHb). In reality, two other hemoglobin species -- carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) and methemoglobin (metHb), collectively termed dyshemoglobins -- are present at all times. These two species of hemoglobin are formed endogenously at very low levels, but their quantities can increase to dangerous levels when carbon monoxide is present in inspired air or as a reaction to certain drugs or chemicals in the environment. All pulse oximeters used in medicine today, representing over 1,000,000 units worldwide, read oxygenation levels that are too high when there are elevated levels of dyshemoglobins in the blood. The alternative to pulse oximetry is to analyze arterial blood with a laboratory CO-oximeter. This procedure involves several different health care workers, potentially exposes personnel to blood borne pathogens, takes minutes or even hours to get results, and provides only a single data point in time. All of this adds cost, increases risks to health care workers, and delays appropriate treatment. Previous attempts by various companies to develop a noninvasive method of CO-oximetry have not succeeded. The limiting factors have been the correct selection of optical emitter wavelengths, spectral bandwidth of the emitters, and troublesome power instabilities of the requisite laser light sources. Kestrel Labs is developing a new oximeter that can use laser light sources for accurate photoplethysmographic measurements. This makes possible the world's first noninvasive and continuous four-analyte Pulse CO-Oximeter. It will provide clinicians with a powerful new tool for patient diagnosis and care. Kestrel Labs is addressing a major deficiency in pulse oximetry technology by developing a new type of oximeter that can simultaneously measure the four primary species of hemoglobin, including those that indicate whether a patient is suffering from carbon monoxide or certain forms of chemical poisoning. The only currently available option is to draw an arterial blood sample, send it to the hospital's blood lab, test it on an expensive blood analyzer, and wait until results are returned to the physician responsible for the patient's care. Kestrel Labs' new Pulse CO-Oximeter will provide accurate, continuous, and noninvasive measurements of these hemoglobin species, thereby avoiding additional costs, risks to health care workers, and delays to appropriate treatment. .",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the lack of visualization technology for hierarchical structured grids created through an advanced simulation process known as Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR). Although the AMR structure makes possible simulations that are too computationally expensive using a uniform grid approach, it leaves the scientist with a lack of visualization tools to properly render the resulting volumetric data. With the successful completion of this Phase II effort, Kitware will meet this need by developing visualization tools that are focused on efficiently and effectively rendering the large, multivariate, time-varying data produced using the AMR technique. The primary technical accomplishment of the Phase II effort will be the development of a high performance volume rendering strategy for AMR data that runs across a variety of platforms from a standard desktop system to a large cluster of high-end workstations. Advanced transfer function techniques will aid scientific discovery by allowing scientists to visualize relationships in their data. Packaging these visualization tools into a user-friendly application will make this complex technology accessible to researchers. In addition, Kitware will adapt this technology to the clinical medical visualization market, where large, multivariate, hierarchical data will become commonplace in the near future. The state-of-the-art AMR visualization technology developed during this Phase II project will be donated to the scientific community as part of two open-source packages. This technology will be available to software developers through the Visualization Toolkit (VTK), a C++ class library of visualization, graphics, and image processing algorithms. This technology will also be incorporated into the end-user scientific visualization application ParaView, which can run on a desktop computer or across a high performance cluster. Through the use of extreme programming principles, these open source packages are developed, tested, and released daily, allowing Kitware to deliver the latest technology for immediate use by the scientific community. In return, this provides Kitware with continual feedback from users and developers that will help the firm to improve not only the open source software, also the firm's commercial products that are built on top of this code base. Kitware intends to leverage the Research Opportunities for Undergraduates (REU) and Research Opportunities for Teachers (RET) programs to build a team of students and teachers who will generate educational material from the software including lesson plans, presentation materials, animations, and suggested projects.

This instrument will be the first of its kind that can measure both blood flows and segmental compartment volumes. It will also be the only instrument that can be used to measure interstitial fluid volumes in addition to intra/extracellular volumes. In Phase I, LDM completed the design and fabrication of four prototype units and conducted a series of preliminary tests that demonstrated the feasibility of our proposed system and provided valuable information that was needed to refine the computer control data acquisition and analysis software that is an integral part of our instrumentation. In Phase II, LDM will further develop and optimize an IPG/EIS system to include a multi-segment interface, a bedside monitoring configuration, and advanced control/display software. In Phase II, a series animal and human studies will be performed to validate the instrumentation using \"gold standard\" compartment volume monitoring techniques. Additional human studies will be performed at New York Medical College and George Washington University to verify and demonstrate the use of the instrumentation to monitor segmental volume changes of end stage renal disease patients during dialysis. LDM will also finalize current preliminary arrangements for the intellectual protection, manufacture, marketing, and customer support of our instrumentation. This inexpensive, easy to use device will provide vital information in the treatment of diverse pathophysiologic fluid volume and hemodynamic states including, for example, the management of increased intracranial pressure following trauma, the treatment of disequilibrium and hypotension during renal dialysis, the monitoring of hydration state of premature infants, and the investigation and diagnosis of orthostatic intolerance associated with dysautonomia and space flight.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medication is a relatively inexpensive and efficient therapeutic strategy for treating a number of illnesses. However, the average rate of compliance for patients on chronic therapies is about 50% after one year and declines over time. Approximately 10% of hospital admissions are related to medication issues, and 23% of nursing home admissions are related to medication problems. Medication noncompliance is estimated to cost the US healthcare system an estimated $76.6 billion a year. The elderly represent an important population among those receiving drug therapy. They receive 30% of all prescriptions and buy 40% of all over-the-counter drugs. In 2003, there were an estimated 36 million people age 65 or older in the United States, accounting for almost 13% of the total population. The inability to manage medications is one of the leading reasons why seniors need additional, often more expensive care. Understanding the causes of noncompliance and identifying methods to help patients follow their regimens may improve health outcomes and reduce related costs. Such a methodology would facilitate aging in place and may delay the need for admission to assisted living facilities. The health decision model suggests that noncompliant behavior is multi-factorial. By modifying general and specific health beliefs, enhancing social interaction factors, and optimizing administration, compliance can be improved. In Phase II, we propose to determine whether the eMedonline medication management system improves compliance among elderly patients being treated for hypertension. We will evaluate effects on medication compliance, perceived social support, and feelings of control over health destiny in a sample of patients. We will also evaluate the acceptability of the system in a sample of healthcare providers, pharmacists, and caregivers.",

Such analyzers are needed to achieve a better understanding of the global budget of these trace gases and to quantify their exchanges between the atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere.  This project will develop a tunable diode laser-based open-path methane analyzer using newly-developed laser technology.  The new analyzer will be suitable for deployment over a wide range of ecosystems to understand methane exchange between the atmosphere and the surface.  In Phase I, an open-path methane analyzer, with a newly available vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) and wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS), was developed.  The resolution of the analyzer was shown to be better than 10 ppb at a 10-Hz sampling rate, exceeding the required specifications for methane flux measurement; therefore, even low methane fluxes can be measured using eddy covariance with this instrument.   Phase II will further develop the open-path methane analyzer by adding a multiple-pass Herriott optical cell to the VCSEL and WMS.  Instrument-embedded software and application software also will be developed.  The analyzer will be capable of field deployment for methane flux measurement over various ecosystems and other surface contexts (e.g. landfills and animal husbandry lots).   Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The lack of robust and reliable methane analyzers has limited observations of methane exchange, between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere, to short-time intervals only.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As more proteins are identified from the genome-sequencing projects, there is an increasing need for reliable and cost efficient means for expression and purification of proteins of academic and clinical importance. LifeSensors has developed a novel SUMO-fusion system to enhance expression, and solubility of a wide variety of proteins in E. coli, and to facilitate the downstream purification of the protein via an affinity tag attached to SUMO. An important feature of the system is the protease that cleaves the SUMO-fusion from expressed proteins. The removal of the fusion leaves no N-terminal overhang, so that any desired amino acid can be cloned at the N-terminus of the expressed protein. Several research or therapeutically important proteins either are not expressed well in bacteria or are inefficiently secreted. Recent data from the Protein Structure Initiative suggest that production of correctly folded protein is a bottleneck for success in our quest for Structural Genomics. In phase I, we proposed to exploit the chaperoning properties of SUMO to enhance expression and secretion of proteins in E. coli. Recognizing the well-known protein secretion properties of Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis we also proposed to test the role of N-terminal of SUMO in secretion of protein in these gram-positive organisms. Lactococcus lactis is well known for its secretory properties and widely used in the food industry, and yet this bacteria has not been well exploited for protein secretion in the biopharmaceutical industry. Our phase I data suggest that while E. coli is good for intracellular expression, it is not the best host for protein secretion. Lactococus lactis has emerged as the most suitable host for secretion and production of large quantities of proteins. In this phase II, LifeSensors proposes a plan to build on its success with L. lactis to test a wide variety of difficult to express protein and further validate the usefulness and role of SUMO and L. lactis as a host for protein secretion. Development of an efficient secretory system in L. lactis that allows production of correctly folded, difficult to express protein will open the bottleneck for Structural Genomics. It will also create an inexpensive platform for endotoxin free protein production that will help the biopharmaceutical industry in the post-genomic era.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is designed to develop and optimize a prototype environmentally friendly isocyanate-free solvent-free UV curable hybrid resin system demonstrated in EPA SBIR Phase I research to have properties suitable for commercial industrial applications such as automobile refinishing, floor coatings, and aircraft coatings.  Properties of the proprietary hybrid resin system are significantly improved over those of conventional UV systems.  UV cure provides an immediate track-free surface and significant property development, allowing materials to be handled for secondary operations.  Hybrid cure continues at ambient conditions following UV exposure for reduced molecular stress and the unusual combination of improved adhesion, flexibility, and hardness.  This dual cure system is user-friendly and allows for the convenient sanding of primer coatings before surface hardness increases to an extent that makes sanding operations unmanageable.  Light Curable Coatings is a technology leader for solvent-free environmentally compliant coating systems, with proprietary technology to rapidly cure heavily pigmented coatings with UV light, including low gloss camouflage color UV coating systems.  Phase II research will optimize fully formulated isocyanate-free solvent-free UV curable hybrid resin systems incorporating pigments and chrome-free corrosion inhibitors, with testing according to military aerospace primer and topcoat specifications MIL-PRF-23377 and MIL-PRF-85285.                                                                   \n\nThis hybrid technology is more efficient and less costly for end-users while significantly reducing exposure of workers and communities to isocyanates, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and hazardous air pollutant (HAP) materials.  Benefits of this approach include dramatically improved environmental friendliness and productive capabilities.  Since these hybrid resins do not contain isocyanates or solvents, application in confined spaces and occupied spaces should be possible without the hazards presented by conventional materials.  Opportunity costs, including the application of coatings during regular shifts instead of weekends or overtime shifts, can be a tremendous advantage.  The fast curing nature of these products allows coated parts to be put back into service or production quickly without the need for painting at a location remote from a manufacturing line since there is no need to allow room for drying ovens and excessive ventilation.  Environmental savings apply not only in production, but also throughout and beyond the operational lifecycle of vehicles by reducing environmental risks associated with maintenance, storage, and disposal.  This research offers a significant positive societal impact in terms of a better quality of life for workers in the automotive and aircraft industries and for all citizens through safer workplaces and a cleaner environment.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The scientific and commercial objective of the proposed research is to improve the medical prevention of kidney stones in children by developing new clinical assays that can predict the development of stones in children with nephrolithiasis and the syndrome of hematuria due to hypercalciuria. Currently available technology, consisting of routine urine chemistry measurements, is a poor predictor of a patient's risk for developing stones. Early diagnosis and treatment of stones, or conditions such as hypercalciuria that predispose children to stones, is important because of the high life-long risk of recurrence and potential morbidity of the disease. We have found three proteins that are known inhibitors of calcium oxalate crystal growth to be significantly altered in the urine of adult stone formers. Preliminary studies of adult family members of calcium stone formers have shown that measurements of these proteins vastly improved the discrimination of stone formers from non stone formers compared to standard urine chemistries alone. Our hypothesis is that alterations in these proteins in the urine of kidney stone patients may serve as markers of stone disease activity or vulnerability to recurrence. Children have a lower prevalence of nephrolithiasis than adults, and urine from children has a greater ability to inhibit crystallization than that of adults. We propose to investigate whether variations in urine crystallization properties or in specific inhibitor proteins are associated with stone disease in children as they are in adults. Likewise, we plan to examine whether variations in any of these factors are linked with hematuria due to hypercalciuria. We wish to identify the assay(s) that best discriminate non stone forming children from those with stones or hypercalciuria with hematuria, and to ask whether they can be used along with or instead of conventional risk factors to improve the management of these disease states.",

        "abstract": "The commercial opportunities for products based on delicate biomolecules, such as enzymes and therapeutic proteins, are growing at a strong pace.  However, many proteins of great commercial value, including enzymes, undergo loss of function on encapsulation, when approaches based on high-shear liquid-phase processes, or on immobilization inside a porous matrix, are used.  This project will develop a gentle method, based on a nano-engineering approach, for encapsulating proteins and protein complexes.  The resulting product would allow, for example, enzyme catalysis to be carried out at room temperature, providing significant energy savings over competing products.  Phase I demonstrated that protein solutions could be encapsulated into true core-shell structures and that the technology would facilitate:  (1) the reuse of enzyme catalysts for energy-efficient processes, and (2) the design of efficient protein drug delivery systems.  In Phase II, pilot-scale quantities of encapsulated enzyme catalysts and one protein-based drug \u00bf namely, Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-a) \u00bf will be produced, and further testing will be conducted.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  There are two primary applications for the technology.  The first involves enzyme catalyst recovery, which is essential for the commercialization of certain chemical reaction processes.  Some enzymes cannot be immobilized onto the surface of a carrier particle without loss of catalytic function.  The encapsulation of  enzymes within  a porous shell would overcomes this obstacle.  The second application involves the use of proteins for the treatment of certain types of cancer.  Some of these proteins are toxic when administered systemically in therapeutic amounts.  However, by encapsulating the proteins in submicron vesicles, the toxicity problem can be avoided and the proteins can  remain undetected by the immune system",

Complete genomic sequencing and comparative genomics reveal new information about metabolic pathways in normal tissue as well as diseased states, such as cancer, diabetes, aging, AIDS, and others. Genomic sequencing also provides critical information about horizontal gene transfer, evolution of protein families, and the genetic repertoire and evolution of species. However, current methods of constructing libraries and cloning individual genes are often extremely challenging, time consuming, and costly. Importantly, they also leave many uncloned gaps. These obstacles obscure important information about specific genes and genomic regions (e.g., centromeres) and limit the scope of genomes studied. The objectives of this proposal are to provide new vectors and streamlined methods to create clone libraries that surpass current standards of fidelity, complexity, lack of cloning bias, and ease of analysis. These techniques will provide access to existing clone gaps in the human genome and allow cloning of other recalcitrant genes and genomes. Specific aims include development of a novel linear cloning vector and demonstration of its capacity for stable maintenance of otherwise \"unclonable\" sequences, such as inverted repeats, microsatellite repeats, and large clones of genomic DNA (>8 kb) from AT-rich pathogens, such as Pneumocystis carinii. The aims also include developing new methods of PCR amplification and rapid production of sequencing template from single bacterial colonies. These methods will be optimized for bench-scale and high-throughput amplification and sequencing. The advances proposed by this research will increase the accuracy and lower the costs of cloning and sequencing single genes or entire genomic or cDNA libraries. These advances will allow researchers to readily analyze DNA regions that are currently difficult or impossible to study. Improved sequence information will accelerate the advances in biotechnology and increase the potential of individual and comparative genomic analyses.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a major step in the development of an optical-maskless lithography technology that is capable of high resolution, high throughput, flexibility, low cost, and extendibility. Current lithography technologies suffer from the problems of high tool costs, high mask costs, and inflexibility in the case of optical-projection lithography, and high tool costs, very low throughputs, and high complexity in the case of scanning electron- beam lithography. The company's Zone-Plate-Array-Lithography (ZPAL) technology will mitigate these issues, while providing unprecedented flexibility in nanopatterning. This project covers two major thrusts: one the manufacture of zone-plate arrays containing over 1000 zone plates, each with a numerical-aperture (NA) greater than 0.85, second the development of a high-accuracy alignment sub-system that can achieve overlay accuracy of 20nm with potential extendibility below 5nm. A successful completion of the first thrust of this project will result in large arrays of high-NA zone plates installed in the prototype lithography system, enabling high resolution and high throughput. A successful implementation of the alignment sub-system in the prototype tool will meet specifications of accuracy unmatched by alternate technologies.  It is widely recognized that nanostructures of complex geometries are indispensable to create functionality and enable a nanotechnology revolution. At present, the tools that are available for the creation of such nanostructures are highly limited in flexibility, resolution, cost and throughput. The tools based on ZPAL have the potential to create a new paradigm in the development and manufacture of nanostructures by sharply reducing the development-cycle time and manufacturing costs. Being maskless, this technology provides flexibility by enabling the designers of nanostructures to quickly realize their designs in hardware for prototyping and even low-volume manufacturing. The company's tools have the potential to enable industries in a wide spectrum of industries such as micro-electro-mechanical devices (MEMs), nano-electro-mechanical devices (NEMs), nano-electronics, nano-magnetics, integrated optics, photonics, biochips, microfluidics, to name a few. Initial target customers are manufacturers of application-specific-integrated circuits (ASICs), compound semiconductors and photomasks. In the ASIC industry alone, the tools have the potential to enable savings of over $3B per year. Furthermore, this technology can provide the cost-effective, flexible solution required to revive and grow this important segment of the semiconductor industry.",

The functionalized microparticles for binding and releasing nucleic acids utilize a proprietary chemistry which enables them to spontaneously and rapidly lyse cells and capture the exposed DNA in situ under virtually any biological conditions. As a result DNA can be isolated from whole blood without any lysis step. The unique surface phosphonium group chemistry causes nucleic acids to bind with exceptional strength until released by a unique cleavage mechanism where a linker group is selectively broken by a simple chemical reaction in order to free DNA from the solid surface. Release by chemical cleavage rather than traditional elution prevents premature, uncontrolled release of material and yields pure nucleic acid. Isolated DNA is compatible with downstream applications such as PCR. Additional linking groups and cleavage methods are being explored. Phase II will develop the expertise to perform the complete synthesis including preparing the magnetic cores, coating the cores, and functionalizing with linker and head groups.

The fundamental aim is to produce a new tool for microscopists. This innovation 's unobstructed TEM sample substrates with millimeter-scale apertures and no intervening grid bars - will be highly useful for TEM scientists and technicians. Significantly, the unobstructed open aperture will provide dramatic scientific advantage for those working in the cellular tomography, cryoelectron microscopy, and structural biology fields that are returning important information and images of cells and subcellular components in their native state. The 2003 NIH Roadmap initiative, New Pathways to Discovery, recognizes the need for better tools for biomedical research and cites structural biology as one field presenting today's major research challenges. The Phase I project demonstrated that nano-thin polyimide membranes are strong and stable over unobstructed millimeter-scale apertures (and long beam exposure) thus demonstrating the feasibility of gridless TEM supports. In addition, the sample supports proved robust to cryogenic processing and typical electron microscopy specimen preparation protocols. The Phase II project will focus on full product and manufacturing process development, guided by four technical objectives: 1) reproduce polyimide TEM supports developed during Phase I as a baseline for the Phase II studies, 2) characterize the supports in terms of physical properties and application performance in cooperation with researchers in the field, 3) continue development of large scale production techniques, and 4) evaluate results from all testing and manufacturing efforts and apply these insights to optimize the product and production methods. A successful Phase II effort will result in two types of specialized sample supports for microscopy: 1) the gridless support with large (2mm) unobstructed apertures and ease of use similar to conventional metal grids, and 2) a composite support blending the strength of nano-thin polyimide membranes and custom-designed small cross-section grid wires specifically for the high-tilt imaging requirements of cryoelectron microscopy of vitrified sections (CEMOVIS). In both cases, the reliability of these sample supports will be a particular benefit where loss of irreplaceable or high-value samples must be avoided.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular diagnostics is the fastest-growing segment of the in-vitro diagnostics market. Nearly all molecular diagnostics assays use various amplification techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify specific sequence segments to easily detectable quantities. However, instead of being performed as a point-of-care format as originally envisioned, many of these nucleic acid technology based (NAT) tests are still performed at a centralized location. The time required for sample shipping and waiting for enough samples to start a high throughput system for cost-effective usage diminishes the power of these NAT techniques. One of the biggest problems of commercializing NAT for non-centralized laboratory is the cost of the device used to detect the target from PCR amplification. Over the past few years, many nucleic acid sensors have been invented with a variety of optical, acoustic, and electronic detection approaches. Fluorescent detection has been the dominating method, however it requires sophisticated optical detection systems, plus they have high cost/mass/power requirements. There is a genuine need to couple amplification-based methods with a simple and cost-effective method for molecular diagnostics in non-laboratory scenarios. Various approaches to exploit advances in nanotechnology for bioanalysis have also been recently reported. Several companies including Lynntech are investigating the use of noble metal nanoparticles and nanostructures as optical transducers of biomolecular binding events. Using our innovative gold nanoparticles based nucleic acid detection technology, Lynntech aims to design and develop a multiplexed, sensitive, and affordable in-vitro diagnostic system for use in non-laboratory settings with minimum labor intensity. The Phase I study successfully demonstrated the use of gold nanoparticles in a novel assay for the detection of DNA. The new method is unique in its simplicity, facilitating its use in a low-cost automated PCR-assay. The method has the potential to be low cost because it uses a simple optical detector and is significantly faster than conventional microbiology based methods. The Phase I study also included assembly and testing of initial engineering designs of the hardware to be used in conjunction with a nanoparticle DNA detection (NDD) assay. In this Phase II proposal, Lynntech will expand our understanding of complexes that form between DNA and gold nanoparticles and incorporate this knowledge to further optimize the rapid assay. Coupled with an innovative highly multiplexed PCR amplification technology from our alliance partner, Genaco Biomedical Products, Inc., the system will provide molecular differential diagnostics of infectious diseases. When successfully developed, the NDD assay will expand the range of applications for amplification based molecular assays, facilitating its use in food safety, detection of biological weapons, rapid analysis of blood products and environmental monitoring, etc. Highly infectious diseases such as SARS and bird flu are global health threats. Having a non-laboratory set up to test the patients and animals and to provide immediate results on location can help stopping the spread of the diseases a great deal. Molecular diagnostics is the fastest-growing segment of the in-vitro diagnostics market. By 2010, a U.S. market of $3.7 billion is expected, representing a significant opportunity for commercialization.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this SBIR project is the development of an improved inorganic ion exchanger with an extremely high selectivity for Sr2+. This ion exchanger will improve the extraction of 90Sr from groundwater at the sites around the US and the world that have become contaminated through mishap or poor handling of nuclear materials, some of which are in contact with aquifers and bodies of water used as drinking water supplies. 90Sr is a ?-emitting isotope with an extremely low maximum safe exposure limit. (The drinking water limit is 8 pCi/L.) Development of this material will make a significant contribution to safer drinking water. In Phase I of this project we demonstrated that the substitution of SnlV and SilV for part of the SbV in the pyrochlore-structured antimonic acid (Sb2O5 4 H2O) increased both the compound's affinity for Sr+2 and its selectivity for strontium over calcium by a factor of nearly four. (A strong preference for Sr+2 is important, because the strontium is always found with a large excess of calcium.) The resulting material has a capacity for 90Sr over 200 times that of the clinoptilotile currently used to collect strontium in pump-and-treat systems. In Phase II we will refine the composition of the exchanger and scale-up the synthesis. The material will be evaluated in complete detail for use as a column material for extracting 90Sr from ground water out of the ground or as the active component in a permeable reactive barrier to block the motion of 90Sr in ground water in the ground. In plain language: Adding tin or silicon to antimonic acid greatly improves its ability to remove strontium from aqueous solutions in the presence of the very similar calcium. This makes it an excellent choice for removing radioactive strontium-90 from ground water either at the surface, or while still in the ground.",

The light-weight, rugged, simple to recharge, and environmentally friendly system is fabricated to deliver over 1.2kW of peakpower and optimize for an average power use of 430 W, weigh 20 kg, and deliver 12,000 Watt hours of energy, equivalent to over 28 hours of continuous run-time without recharging.  The resulting power supply permits a powered mobility aide to operate under typical usage for up to two weeks between recharging.  This equates to a ten-fold increase in range for high power systems such as TEFTEC's OmegaTrac wheelchair. Lightweight, compact, low power versions of the system have commercial application in pushrim activated power-assisted wheelcharirs.  Initial production expects to focus on systems that can be retrofitted to existing wheelchairs and scooters.",

        "abstract": "Pervaporation (PV) and vapor permeation (VP) membranes have been touted as highly effective for a wide array of liquid and vapor separations, particularly for dehydration of aggressive chemicals; yet, they have been limited to a relatively small number of niche applications.  The barriers to further penetration include cost, reliability, and performance stability.  This project will develop molecular sieving nanoporous inorganic membranes to overcome the limitations of current PV/VP membrane technology.  These low-cost high-performance membranes will deliver outstanding thermal, mechanical, and hydrothermal stability at temperatures in excess of 200\u00baC.  Further, they offer the potential to deliver very high fluxes and selectivities in a range of PV/VP applications, reducing system costs and improving separation efficiency, in comparison to the current generation of polymeric and other inorganic based PV/VP membranes.  An experimental study in Phase I demonstrated the technical viability of the membrane as a universal dehdyration membrane.  An economic analysis confirmed the commercial viability.  Phase II will involve membrane product optimization, process development, and an extended bench-scale stability test.  Then, a pilot field test, using a slip stream, will be conducted to confirm the performance and material stability.  Finally, a full-scale membrane module will be designed, constructed, and tested, and prepared for a full field demonstration in Phase III.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new composite membrane should permit widespread applications of this promising technology.

Although a unique membrane-based process was demonstrated to be technically feasible in the past, several product- and process-related barriers have prevented its field implementation.  This project will develop a nanoporous carbon molecular sieve membrane that can overcome the product-related barriers.  An in-line regeneration technique will be employed to solve the process-related barriers.  Hydrogen recovery efficiency will be improved through a membrane structure tailored for these applications.  Phase I demonstrated significant hydrogen recovery from binary streams \u00bf containing hydrogen/hydrocarbons or CO \u00bf selected to simulate refinery waste streams and pressure swing adsorption (PSA) purge streams.  After aging/fouling, the membranes were restored via in situ regeneration.  An economic analysis demonstrated the feasibility of a payback period less than one year.  Phase II will focus on product optimization and process development, in order to demonstrate the proposed hydrogen enrichment process.  Then, the optimized process will be demonstrated in a bench-top experiment and verified with a mathematical simulation.  Long term performance stability will be confirmed by testing the prototype in a slip stream in the field.  Finally, a full-scale module will be fabricated for field testing in Phase III.

A thin Pd film supported on tubular porous SS substrate provides a commercially viable avenue for the use of palladium membranes for hydrogen production/recovery, particularly for large-scale applications.  During Phase II the diffusion barrier will be developed to a commercial scale membrane unit for performing field tests. Pd membranes due to their excellent hydrogen permeability and selectivity can streamline existing hydrogen separation and purification processes dramatically for fuel cell and hydrogen separation applications. The projected worldwide market size when fully matured is in the range of $1 billion/yr. Refineries' demand for hydrogen is expected to post annual growth in excess of 10% as refiners use more hydrogen to meet clean fuel regulations. A Pd-base hydrogen selective membrane suitable for large scale operations will play a major role in meeting this demand, particularly for the retrofit market, such as hydrogen recovery from waste refinery streams, as an add-on stage for existing steam reformer for incremental capacity, etc. In summary the proposed diffusion barrier could offer a practically viable Pd-based hydrogen separation device, which can benefit fuel cell and industrial hydrogen applications, and greenhouse gas reduction.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The BROAD OBJECTIVE of this project is to produce a family of urgently needed quality controls for use in molecular Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) diagnostic tests. Quality controls are required by good laboratory practice and federal regulations to assure accuracy of all medical laboratory tests. The SPECIFIC AIMS are to 1) Produce E. Coli cells that parallel the properties of M. tuberculosis in DNA based molecular testing, 2) Clone gene sequences used to identify drug resistance in M. tuberculosis tests, and 3) Produce and evaluate prototype products. This Phase II work will develop a novel method to produce cloned E. coli with toughened, chemically crosslinked membranes containing synthetic M. tuberculosis DNA sequences for use as quality controls in molecular M. tuberculosis tests. Materials of this type are a necessary part of the infrastructure for the implementation of the new and rapid molecular technologies for M. tuberculosis testing. Efficient and accurate diagnoses, which are the promise of this new technology, are key to treatment and prevention of the major global health threat presented by M. tuberculosis. Enhancing the diagnostic tools and infrastructure enabling improved diagnostic testing is an important part of the NIAID mission. Further, in the \"FOCUS on TB\" agency mission: \"NIAID supports a robust portfolio of research to develop new drugs and diagnostics----\". The quality controls to be produced are a key element in developing and implementing new molecular diagnostic M. tuberculosis tests.         In the RESEARCH DESIGN, molecular methods are used to produce clones that contain DNA sequences utilized in M. tuberculosis diagnosis. Mutant and wild type clones are constructed with sequences used in testing for drug resistance mutations. Methods traditionally used to fix membranes for electron microscopy studies are adapted to harden the membranes of the clone cells and to deactivate cellular nucleases. The fixing time, fixative adjuncts, and fixative concentrations are varied until the cell structure is hardened to a point where its release of nucleic acid during the clinical testing process is very similar to that of M. tuberculosis bacilli. The products will be evaluated in clinical laboratory molecular M. tuberculosis tests and fixing parameters adjusted to produce a material that is optimal for monitoring common molecular M. tuberculosis test.",

The bales are impervious to moisture which prevents leaching of the nutrients into the soil; they can be stored indefinitely on-site until they are needed; they are easily transported on standard flatbed trailers, and the litter is now transformed into an asset which can be sold into the market place.",

When the clouds in a region have a strong linear profile of satellite-retrieved effective radius over virtually their entire depths and when glaciation occurs in these clouds at the temperature of homogenous freezing (i.e., ~-38oC), there is a much increased risk of tornadoes, especially when CAPE, helicity and wind shear are concurrently large.  The next step under SBIR Phase II will be the development of an operational system that will lead to improved severe storm watches and warnings.  Phase I did not provide nearly enough time for full method development.  Consequently, Phase II must involve the development and use of an automated algorithm, adapted to real-time imagery, which will quantify the tornado risk of the clouds in each image.  Analysis of the much larger sample will be made in order to quantify the probability of severe weather in each cloud system as a function of time.  Logistic regression will again be used for this quantification.  The third task of SBIR Phase II will involve an operational real-time test of the methodology during the tornado season of 2008 in conjunction with personnel with the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) and the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL). The real-time data stream for this effort will be provided by NASA Langley\u00bfs Cloud and Radiation Research Program.  Maps of tornado probability will be generated in real time using the specialized methodology to quantify cloud properties, the logistic regression coefficients and the probability of tornadoes.  An objective assessment of the value of the products will be sought on a continuing basis from their users.

Drug manufacturers seek new chiral stationary phases with high throughput, extended chiral selectivity, high loading capacity, with the ability to tolerate a wide range of mobile phases. To meet this need, artificial saccharides will be synthesized and polymerized into a 100% stereo specific chiral stationary phase for liquid chromatography of enantiomers. These polymers have remarkable propertie such as stereo specificity, five asymmetric centers, functionality for tailoring phase/ligand recognition, extensive crosslinking capability, and ether bonding. This chemistry was demonstrated in Phase I and in Phase II will lead to a new family of chiral polymers to speed drug discovery and reduce the cost of drug manufacture.  The broader impact of this research will be to provide artificial polysaccharides to provide novel activities versus the natural products currently sold. Polysaccharides have multiple, chiral centers, unparalleled optical integrity; and the highest density of functional groups of all known molecules.  Artificial polysaccharides are most readily functionalized and tailored to form desired chiral selectors. This project will molecularly design chiral selectors.

However, lightweight materials in automobile structures have been problematic for two reasons:  (1) the high cost of carbon fiber materials themselves, and (2) the high processing costs of these materials.  Although programs exist to reduce the cost of carbon fibers (from $12-$14/pound today to $5-$7/pound in the near future), current manufacturing processes are neither fast nor cost-effective enough to meet the demands of high volume production.  This project will develop an innovative, high-volume molding process for complex-shaped carbon-fiber performs, which will allow cost effective carbon composite components to be incorporated into commercial passenger vehicles.  In Phase I,  a carbon fiber slurry was developed and molded into an automotive complex shape (B-pillar).

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by Investigator): This proposed Phase II work is aimed at continuing the research and development of a new and greatly improved long-term extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO) for patients afflicted with severe respiratory and/or cardiac failure. In Phase I we demonstrated that our proprietary silicone membrane hollow fiber coupled with our proposed oxygenator design enabled the development of a significantly improved ECMO oxygenator sized for newborn babies. The only oxygenator currently approved and used for this purpose in the US was developed in 1963. MedArray's new silicone hollow fibers and oxygenator design have enabled the development of a compact device with significantly improved gas transfer, lower priming volume, less surface area to minimize inflammatory response, improved blood flow dynamics, reduced blood resistance, and lower cost. Since ECMO oxygenators are used for long term (more than 1 day), the membrane cannot be microporous because of plasma leakage and membrane fowling. Therefore these oxygenators must use dense membranes which have no pores for plasma to leak through. Silicone is a dense membrane material with extremely high permeability to oxygen and CO2 and is therefore used in ECMO oxygenators. Silicone membranes have been commercially produced in sheet configuration but, because of production challenges and associated cost, they have not been produced in the more efficient hollow fiber configuration. Thus current ECMO oxygenators use spiral wound silicone sheet membranes which are not as efficient and compact as hollow fiber membranes. MedArray has developed a proprietary (patented) method for fabricating silicone membrane hollow fibers in a cost effective and commercially feasible way that will enable the development of a long due improved ECMO oxygenator. In Phase II we will expand our Phase I work to the pediatric and adult size ECMO oxygenators. The proposed work also includes improved device design using computational fluid dynamics, bench, and in-vivo testing to compare performance with the current ECMO oxygenators. The relevance of this research project is that it will result in a significantly improved long term extracorporeal oxygenator for newborn babies and older patients afflicted with severe respiratory and/or cardiac failure. The only oxygenator currently used and approved for this purpose in the US was developed in the early 1960s, and is long due for improvements currently available. This research will enable the development of a compact oxygenator with greatly improved gas transfer, lower priming volume, improved flow dynamics, lower blood resistance, and lower cost.",

There are increasing numbers of cancer therapeutics that are linked to immunohistochemical diagnostic tests. Patient therapy is directly affected by the quantitative results of such testing. The absence of quantitative controls and calibrators seriously hampers the ability of laboratories to achieve consistent and standardized test results. Laboratories currently use pathologic discard tissue biopsies as controls, an inherently unstandardized source.      In order to address this need, we developed the Analyte Controls technology. It provides an inexpensive, reproducible, and quantitative test material for detecting errors in staining procedure. This program aims to validate the clinical utility of this technology. In addition, this Phase I/Il Fast Track program is expected to lead to an FDA submission. For Phase I, we will address three technical aspects of the technology before launching into clinical trials. The Specific Aims of the Phase I grant are: (1) to create Analyte Controls for three new ER & PR antibodies. With these three, our Analyte Controls Slide will test for all of the commonly used ER and PR antibody clones, which is important prior to initiating clinical trials. (2) Identify Analyte Control peptides for ER and PR testing that distinguish pre-analytic sources of error (i.e., antigen retrieval) from analytic types of error, and (3) to demonstrate feasibility of a clinical laboratory slide densitometer that laboratories can use to quantify optical density of Analyte Controls on microscope slides. A method for precise quantification is required for clinical trials.      The Analyte Controls for ER & PR will be the first quantitative control and calibrator for quantitative immunohistochemical testing that can be manufactured in inexhaustible amounts, relatively inexpensively, and in a reproducible fashion.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoarthritis and articular cartilage injuries are very common, typically causing pain, swelling and reduced mobility leading to functional impairment. The treatment cost for patients suffering from these conditions are massive with an estimated annual economic cost of $65 billion in the US alone. Magnetic resonance imaging facilitates non-invasive imaging of articular cartilage in vivo. However, manual analysis is tedious, inaccurate, and irreproducible and no computer- aided tool is commercially available to analyze high-resolution 3-D MR cartilage image data. This proposal is for development of quantitative analysis of articular cartilage morphology and tissue composition in highly congruent joints (knee, ankle) from anatomical and multi-contrast 3-D magnetic resonance images. The main innovation of the proposed approach is that the multiple surfaces of adjoining bones and cartilages in the entire joint will be segmented simultaneously in 3-D rather than independently border-by-border and slice-by-slice in 2-D, thus taking advantage of 3-D contextual information with an expected improvement in 3-D segmentation performance. Multi-contrast MR tissue characterization will identify 6 cartilage tissue types in a volumetric fashion. The specific aims of this Phase-I proposal are to: 1) Develop a method for comprehensive morphometric analysis of articular cartilage over the complete joint surface from volumetric high-resolution MR images. 2) Develop a method for cartilage tissue characterization from volumetric multi-contrast MR images. 3) Develop a prototype Cartilage Analyzer software suite and assess its performance in human cadaver and in vivo ankles and knees. The overarching goal of the Phase II research is to build and validate a prototype system for quantitative cartilage analysis that will be utilized by orthopedic clinicians treating osteoarthritis, orthopedic surgeons, musculoskeletal radiologists, and researchers for epidemiologic and pharmacologic studies, as well as by MR scanner manufacturers. Following cardiovascular diseases, cartilage diseases are the second most frequent cause of illness. When measured in days of illness, cartilage diseases actually exceed the impact of cardiovascular diseases. The treatment cost for patients suffering from these conditions are massive with an estimated economic cost in the USA of $65 billion annually. As a result, articular cartilage research is a highly topical field with very significant practical implications and applications for future patient management and care.",

However, research suggests that the majority of physicians do not follow established practice guidelines or use evidence-based practices when assessing or treating their ADHD patients. A community intervention model has been developed by the Duke University Medical Center ADHD Program which promotes the implementation of evidence-based practice procedures among community pediatricians. Research results from this program suggest that a program such as this can be very effective at improving pediatricians' practice behaviors and child outcomes. However, the model's use as it is currently implemented is limited in scope because of its paper-based methods. In-person training, paper-and-pencil rating forms, faxed reports, phone-call reminders, etc. inhibit the geographic generalization of this model and increase treatment delivery costs. This application supports the development of an innovative Internet-based software program that provides evidence-based ADHD assessment and treatment methodology to community physicians. Its features provide physician education about ADHD assessment and treatment; web-based rating scales for parents and teachers; web-based access to rating scales results for physicians; and remote consultation with ADHD specialists. During Phase I, a prototype was developed, tested out in a small field trial, and feedback was obtained from the various end-users. In Phase II, we plan to 1) complete programming and software development of the full product; 2) accomplish a widespread, geographically-diverse rollout of the full product; 3) predict adoption of the software among community pediatricians; and 4) establish marketing of the final product. This program has strong commercial potential as it will have wide applicability for psychiatrists, pediatricians, family physicians and other healthcare practitioners who care for ADHD children.",

This project will develop a new class of nanoporous polymer membranes that have exceptional permeation characteristics for hydrocarbon/hydrogen and hydrocarbon/methane separation in refinery and natural gas applications.  In Phase I, a nanoporous, polydioxane-based polymer was synthesized, and its gas sorption, diffusion, and permeability properties were evaluated using thick dense films.  Defect-free, thin-film composite membranes were made, and their pure- and mixed-gas permeation properties were determined.  The permeation data obtained showed that these membranes would allow membrane technology to be competitive with other more-conventional technologies in a number of important separations.  In Phase II, the membranes produced in Phase I will be scaled up and packaged into bench- and pilot-scale membrane modules.  These modules will be used to demonstrate membrane performance for hydrocarbon/hydrogen and hydrocarbon/methane natural gas separations.  The modules will be tested in the laboratory and at field sites.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Currently, membrane separation holds only a small share of the total hydrocarbon/hydrogen and hydrocarbon/methane separation market in refinery and natural gas applications.  Membranes with improved permeability and selectivity should lower the cost of membrane processes and substantially increase the market share held by membranes",

The limited quality and number of reagents available for the construction of antibody micro arrays makes them costly to produce and unreliable to use. Polyclonal and hybridoma derived monoclonal antibodies, frequently don't have the characteristics suitable for use in these micro arrays nor are amenable to molecular evolution for higher affinity and the ability to capture native proteins from solution whilst conjugated to the surface of the micro array. This proposal utilizes yeast display technology to identify, develop, and optimize production of antibody molecules that function under the conditions of the micro array assay, incorporate these into micro arrays and further validate these by using solid tumor samples. The first targets we have selected are a series of receptor tyrosine kinases and their cognate ligands that are known to be involved in multiple types of cancer and for which therapeutics are currently either marketed or in development. The development of high quality antibody reagents for use in the construction of micro arrays will have broad implications in making diagnostic and research tools.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vitamin B12 deficiency is a common problem that affects the general US population and the elderly in particular. The elderly are at risk for preclinical vitamin B12 deficiency due to the increased presence of B12 malabsorption and atrophic gastritis as a consequence of aging. The deficiency of vitamin B12 in the elderly has potentially serious complications including dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. Current approaches to diagnosing B12 deficiency are inadequate because they lack specificity, have poorly defined reference ranges or are expensive. Our proposed test, known as the B12 Breath Test (BBT), will have the advantage of being non-invasive, be easy to administer and have a long shelf life. The BBT will allow physicians to accurately test for B12 deficiency at a much lower cost than current diagnostic tests. Our goal is to identify vitamin B12 deficiency in a preclinical stage when treatment can avert complications. Diagnosing this deficiency is meaningful because once identified as a problem, it can be effectively and inexpensively treated with appropriate vitamin B12 supplementation. This will lead to lower overall medical costs as this condition is quickly identified and appropriately treated. The underlying scientific principle of the test is that the metabolism of propionate is limited by the availability of vitamin B12. Thus, after orally administering a tracer dose of 13 C (non-radioactive) labeled propionate, the amount of 13 CO2 is reduced in the breath of vitamin B12 deficient individuals compared to those individuals with normal B12 status. The phase I grant demonstrated the feasibility of this concept. In Phase II we will refine the testing procedure with the goal to reduce test costs and simplify the test. Specifically, we will examine a smaller dose of propionate, a single 20-minute breath collection and eliminate the need to be in a fasted state for greater than 1 hour. The final product developed after Phase III will be an FDA approved diagnostic kit. This kit will be sold to our current clinical laboratory customers, to other independent clinical labs and to the more than 1,000 physician laboratories that have point-of-care breath testing equipment.         Project Narrative: Vitamin B12 deficiency is a common problem found in the elderly that is difficult to identify early because there isn't an accurate and low cost diagnostic test. The deficiency of vitamin B12 has potentially serious complications including dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. The proposed test will address this diagnostic need and lead to better quality of life for these patients because vitamin B12 deficiency can be easily and inexpensively treated with vitamin supplements.",

        "abstract": "Next generation, high-efficiency photovoltaic systems are expected to play a significant role in addressing the global need for renewable energy sources.  To be effective, these systems must maximize absorption across the solar spectrum, while minimizing fundamental heat losses.  In order to achieve this goal, several new approaches are currently being explored, which predominantly focus on the use of multiple band-gaps.  A more universal approach is provided by the conversion of heat into electricity, since this process is suitable to non-solar energy conversion as well.  This project will use a luminescence upconversion process to efficiently convert heat into electricity.  Phase I performed an experimental and theoretical analysis of the optical properties of several semiconductor materials under relevant operating conditions.  The analysis showed that an efficiency in the range of 10-20% could be obtained at operating temperatures of several hundred degrees centigrade, indicating performances comparable or higher than other small-scale, direct heat-to-electricity conversion methods.  Phase II will:  (1) refine the system model to determine the optical bandgap energy, operating temperature, and bias voltage; design a multible emiter with enhanced extraction efficiency; design and construct a prototype system using a surrogate heat source; and determine the efficiency of the prototype system.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The luminescence upconversion approach should provide an added value to existing and future photovoltaic systems, by converting the waste heat generated by those systems.  In addition, the approach should provide a higher Carnot efficiency than other available thermal energy converters; as such, it could provide renewable energy in situations where other photovoltaic approaches cannot \u00bf e.g. in industrial plant heat exchangers, geothermal sources, and power plants.",

Susceptible and resistant strains of MTB, exposed to anti-MTB antibiotics, exhibit pronounced differences in mycolic acid content. Initial research will focus on adapting the HPLC-based susceptibility testing to current commercially available growth/susceptibility systems. The MIDI Sherlock(r) Mycobacteria Identification System is an HPLC-based system that has FDA 510(k) clearance for identification of MTB. The MIDI Sherlock software will be modified to allow for automated calculation of ratios of mycolic acid content of MTB strains from \"control\" or from antibiotic-containing media. Although isoniazid causes 35-40% loss of mycolic acids, in susceptible strains, with as little as 20 minutes exposure to the inhibitor, rifampin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide may require up to 72 h for optimal determination. This is in contrast to the typical 6-9 days required for other automated susceptibility test systems. As the highly specific pattern of mycolic acids of MTB is seen in the analysis, contamination by non-mycobacterial species do not cause false resistance evaluations, thus solving a serious problem in other automated systems. A \"mixed culture\" algorithm will be evaluated for effectiveness in identifying contamination by non-TB mycobacteria. Initial research will use commercially available media and anti-MTB antibiotics to determine resistance or susceptibility by mycolic acid content analysis. This will facilitate adoption of the mycolic acid test by laboratories having the growth-based systems. Although not crucial to the success of the project, direct-from-sputum analysis for MTB identification and susceptibility testing will also be evaluated.",

The overall goal of this proposal is the development of new drugs against this organism. In Phase I, the high sequence similarity between 8. pseudomallei and its less virulent relative Pseudomonas aeruginosa was exploited to build innovative screens for rapid, safe discovery of effective therapeutic agents. Three key discoveries of the Phase I research established the feasibility of this approach: (a) cross-species complementation is efficient enough between these two species to permit construction of P. aeruginosa deletions surviving by virtue of expression of the 6. pseudomallei ortholog in almost 50% of cases attempted; (b) lac regulation is adequate to deplete targets to the point of limiting cell growth in about 33% of cases tested; (c) expression profiling by microarray hybridization revealed genes specifically up-regulated for 4 of 5 depleted target strains tested. Promoters from target depletion-responsive genes were fused to the P. luminescens luxCDABE operon to generate luciferase reporter assays in P. aeruginosa for inhibition of B. pseudomallei targets. Construction and implementation of a model whole cell luciferase reporter screen for inhibitors of GyrA established the feasibility of such screens for antibacterial drug discovery. In Phase II, three new reporter assays for inhibitors of validated B. pseudomallei targets will be used to screen two diverse chemical libraries representing over 150,000 compounds. Confirmed hits will be subjected to a panel of secondary assays for validation as target specific, potent on B. pseudomallei cells, and non- cytotoxic to mammalian cells in culture. Validated hits will be prioritized by potency and drug-like features and optimized by rational drug design aided by structural information for several inhibitor-target co-crystals. Lead compounds will be tested in mice to determine the maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetic properties, and efficacy in a B. pseudomallei infection mouse model. In addition, utilizing the expertise gained in Phase I studies, P. aeruginosa whole cell reporter assays will be developed and screened for inhibitors of at least three additional B. pseudomallei targets. In Phase III, a potent, safe, orally active B. pseudomallei inhibitor will be advanced into IND enabling toxicology and safety pharmacology studies and file an IND.",

This proposal identifies and innovative and versatile approach for detection/identification of pathogens based on an integrated optical chip sensor system with improved on-chip signal processing enabled by the incorporation of magnetic nanopowders.  This technology employs a multi-channel interferometer design that offers tract level detection sensitivities, rapid response, and multiple agent detection/identification capabilities in a compact package that can be used by unskilled personnel.\n\nThe proposed Phase II research will build upon and expand the success achieved in Phase I, where suitable magnetic nanoparticles were synthesized and attached to an optical chip and magnetic field modulation of the phase of a guided optical wave was demonstrated.  The basis of the research is to enable an advanced signal processing scheme to enhance optical biosensor detection sensitivity (sub-ppb) through magnetic field induced nanoscale displacements of tethered magnetic particles immobilized on the waveguide surface.  The nanoparticles displacement will induce a phase shift in the output of a waveguide interferometer that could be utilized to discriminate noise from the collected signal through signal processing.  The technology will build on the base optical sensor technology and be ultimately capable of real-time, direct detection (no labeling, additional chemical steps or reagents) of multiple biomolecules (proteins, toxins, nucleic acids) in the femtomolar concentration range and pathogens (bacteria, viruses) at concentration of ",

        "abstract": "The DOE is developing delivery technologies that will enable the introduction and long-term viability of hydrogen as an energy carrier for transportation and stationary power.  To be successful, approaches must address hydrogen\u00bfs relatively low volumetric energy density and its difficulties with respect to transportation, storage, and final delivery to the point of use. In particular, existing hydrogen compressor designs can not meet the need for a reliable, efficient and cost competitive transportation infrastructure.  Therefore, this project will develop an oil-free bearing technology that will enable oil-free centrifugal hydrogen gas compressors to boost in-line pressures by approximately 700 psig and deliver 300 kg/min of hydrogen gas.  In Phase I, a number of oil-free centrifugal compressor configurations were identified that could meet the stated boost pressure and flow requirements.  However, the high operating speeds and sealing requirements indicated that very low power loss bearings and low leakage seals would be needed to make the compressor system viable.  Therefore, Phase II will involve the design and fabrication  of full-scale, oil-free compliant foil bearings.  The bearings will be tested at design speeds of 50,000 to 60,000 rpm, while realistic loads are to be applied to the bearings.  (The development of very low leakage seals and has been proposed under a separate program.)  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The bearing technology developed for hydrogen compressors should allow higher efficiency natural gas pipeline compressors to be built and operated, making large-scale, hydrogen gas delivery viable.  Today, almost 50 million horsepower is used to service natural gas pipeline compression needs; an estimated savings of 33,000 MW-hours of energy savings per year would be possible if advanced oil-free bearings and seals were employed.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase 2 SBIR is for the development of a drug product identified and demonstrated in the Phase 1 SBIR award (R43CA15120-01). The ultimate goal is to produce, sell and deliver doses of high specific activity iobenguane I 131 for radiotherapy in adults and children with neuroendocrine tumors. These are rare tumors with only about 800 cases a year in the US but with poor outcome and no approved effective treatment. The innovation in this proposal is that it uses a solid phase synthetic process to make a proven diagnostic agent in a radio-therapeutic quantity (1 Curie) without the pharmacologically active carrier compound. A type B pre-IND development was held with the FDA where they definitively stated that USP test methods are insufficient to permit human testing of iobenguane I 131 produced by a new method. However, the FDA concluded that literature reports indicate iobenguane I 131 therapy is efficient for treating neuroendocrine tumors and granted Orphan Drug and Fast Tract status for the development of high specific activity drug product. To meet the required quality control of components of the chemistry, manufacturing and controls component of a IND application, the polymer supported drug precursor will be produced according to current good manufacturing practices and analytical tests developed and validated to confirm the identity, purity, performance and impurity profile of the critical component drug precursor. We will also develop a Drug Master File and execute batch records for the production process of the radioactive drug substance. Finally batches of the final drug product will be made and tested for stability and bio-equivalence in transporter expressing cells and in animals.",

The ability of HIV to rapidly evolve drug resistance to approved PR, RT and entry inhibitors, together with toxicity problems of current antiretroviral regimens, requires the development of additional classes of antiviral drugs. As an essential enzyme for HIV-1 replication, integrase (IN) is an attractive antiviral target. Clinical evaluation (phase 1 and 2) of several IN inhibitors (INIs) is underway, with at least one phase 3 trial expected to begin in 2006. The ultimate goal of this project is to validate for clinical use rapid, sensitive phenotypic and genotypic assays to evaluate the susceptibility of HIV-1 isolates to inhibitors of all HIV-1 viral enzymes, with particular emphasis on IN inhibitors (INIs). Assay development will involve evaluation of two alternative vector systems (pol or RHIN) that produce virus particles containing HIV-1 pol proteins derived from patient isolates. These assays will be based on the technology underlying PhenoSense HIVTM, an existing cell-based antiviral drug susceptibility assay that evaluates inhibitors of protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT). Specific aims for this project are: Aim 1: Select assay format for Clinical Validation (YEAR 1) A. Refine the RT-PCR amplification steps of the pol assay, with the objective being to replicate as closely as possible the performance characteristics of the existing, CLIA validated PhenoSense and GeneSeq assays for PIs and RTIs, and the RUO validated RHIN assays for INIs. B. Compare phenotypic and genotypic results from the single pol assay to those from the currently validated PhenoSense assay (susceptibility to PIs and RTIs, Replication Capacity), and from the RHIN assay developed during Phase I (susceptibility to INIs) C. Select either the pol or RHIN assays for pre-validation and eventual CLIA validation. Aim 2: Perform pre-validation studies (including RUO validation for pol assay if selected) for RHIN or pol phenotypic and genotypic assay (YEAR 2). Aim 3: Validate the performance of the RHIN or pol assay format in a commercial clinical laboratory (YEAR 3) A. Clinically validate the performance of the RHIN or pol phenotypic assay B. Clinically validate the performance of the RHIN or pol genotypic assay C. Obtain CLIA certification for validated genotypic and phenotypic assays The ability of HIV-1 to rapidly evolve resistance to approved drugs, together with toxicity problems of current antiretroviral regimens, requires the development of additional classes of antiviral drugs.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reaction Biology Corporation (RBC) has developed an extremely low cost nanoliter reaction microarray to serve various drug discovery needs for high throughput screening (HTS) and compound selectivity profiling. These microarrays can hold more than 6000 individual reactions. Each reaction is 1000 to 10,000-fold smaller than those used in typical well plate formats. Kinases play a pivotal role in signal transduction and regulation of processes in cancer, inflammation, diabetes etc. However, finding selective kinase inhibitors remains a challenge. In Phase I, RBC optimized over 10 tyrosine kinase assays and 5 serine/threonine kinase assays using microarray HTS. The microarrays have been validated for kinase HTS by screening against the LOPAC library. Additionally, several phosphatase assay methodologies developed during Phase I are ready for large scale HTS campaigns. In Phase II, we propose to expand this technology to add an additional 30 kinases (Aim 1). IC50 profiling against these targets will be evaluated in both well plate and microarray format with known compounds from the LOPAC library and commercial vendors. In Aim 2, RBC will develop a universal radioisotope 33P-based kinase assay to achieve 100,000 reactions per 10 ug of purified kinase. In Aim 3, HTS campaigns using a 79,000 compound library of diverse structures against the RBC panel of kinases and phosphatases will establish a database to drive structure-activity relationship (SAR) models. Through Phase II funding, RBC will validate this kinase/phosphatase HTS platform to serve customers seeking to rapidly profile large libraries or lead series against numerous kinases chosen from the RBC assay set. Rapid HTS implementation for proprietary customer kinases using small amounts of purified protein is also a significant opportunity.",

Raw wool, called greasy, is shipped out of the region, and more often out of the country for further processing. Rarely does this Wyoming product ever return to its state of origin. Value is added outside of the state. During Phase II, we will operate a localized experimental facility, using existing technology proving the concept that locally adding value to wool will increase producer wool income. Through a local processing facility, ranchers will be able to implement management practices in wool preparation which will improve their profitability and the efficiency of the marketing system.

        "abstract": "One of the most widely used geophysical methods for monitoring flow within the shallow subsurface is Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT).  The latest generation of ERT systems can monitor data to a precision of around 1%, allowing in situ changes to be interpreted within a few percent.  In turn, subsurface temperature changes can be monitored to within a few degrees Centigrade, low levels of tracers \u00bf only slightly higher than background variations \u00bf can be tracked, and fracture propagation on a site of several thousand square meters can be watched.  This project will make improvements to hardware and data collection procedures that will raise ERT precision by an order of magnitude.  In Phase I, modifications were made to a number of interdependent hardware and software systems, resulting in reductions in both random and systematic noise sources.  Random noise was reduced by implementing longer data averaging periods and by improving stacking algorithms.  Systematic noise was reduced by improving hardware design, including the isolation of transmitter and receiver paths in the multiplexer and the use of temperature-stabilized higher-precision components to improve calibration.  Electrode and cable effects also were found to be larger sources of noise than anticipated.  Phase II will investigate the use of alternative materials for the electrode and cable, in order to mitigate the noise from these sources.  Alternative data collection strategies will be investigated.  Improvements to hardware and software will focus on calibration.  Field trials will be held in difficult environments, such as the Idaho National Laboratory, Box Canyon fractured rock study area, and Vadose Zone Research Park.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:   An improved ERT technology should increase measurement precision, increase resolution, and enhance effectiveness in existing monitoring applications without significantly increasing costs.  These improvements should broaden the range of applications for the method, particularly in monitoring flow in the shallow subsurface.

Fully implement the Jackknife, BRR and bootstrap variance estimators for PML and PWLS. (2) Complex sample modeling capabilities using the PWLS estimator for two-level multivariate latent variable models and using the PML estimator for three-level multivariate latent variable models.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is to continue development of a commercial, electromagnetic, stereotaxic accessory for inducing precise and measurable impacts to selectable locations on the head or exposed cortex of a mouse or rat. The device will be used in the study of traumatic brain injury. Our design objectives are to: (1) control precisely the location and direction of impact; (2) control the velocity and displacement of the impact; and (3) measure these parameters, as well as force and energy, to confirm and characterize the trauma. Health-relatedness: Improved understanding of trauma mechanics will increase our understanding of injury, allow validation of numerical models, and improve management of brain injury and the design of head protection. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) caused by impact to the intact skull is the most prevalent form of head injury. There are unresolved questions about long-term effects of severe, concussive and sub-concussive events. The degree of neuronal strain at impact, and its relationship to subsequent impairment are not well understood. Rodent models of brain injury are common, but injury devices are limited in function, widely variable in effect, and the parameters of impact remain poorly defined. These deficiencies limit the ability of researchers to duplicate the work of others and to define the etiology of neuronal injury. Results from Phase I: AIM 1: Construct a prototype stereotaxic accessory to deliver impact neurotrauma to rat or mouse. The device is compatible with most commercially available stereotaxic instruments. A compact electromagnetic actuator is used to provide a specified indentation depth and speed to the skull or brain. The linear and angular positioning capabilities of the stereotaxic device control the location and direction of impact. Head-holding components were modified to support the head firmly while distributing reaction forces. AIM 2: Confirm the ability of the device to produce a repeatable injury in a rodent model using novel location and direction of impact. A focused study was performed to investigate the effect of impact location and direction on neuronal degeneration in the infant rat. The new device was used to generate an impact equivalent in terms of displacement and energy to weight drop injury, but with a lateral location and direction. Patterns of cell death 24 hours post-trauma were determined and compared. Specific Aims for Phase //: Aim 1 - Technological: Incorporate force, velocity, acceleration, and touch sensors into the basic device. The impacter will be instrumented to characterize each event in real time. Aim 2- Validation: Perform rigorous and complete validation of histological and behavioral changes in the adult C57BU6 mouse after electromagnetically controlled cortical injury (ECI) with this device. The \"controlled cortical impact\" (CCI) model has been widely used in mice; injuries have been produced with a variety of pneumatic devices. Before our ECI device can be widely accepted we must show that it can be used to duplicate behavioral changes seen in prior studies.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on designing, prototyping, and fully qualifying a proprietary manufacturing apparatus capable of applying a range of next-generation coronary stent coatings. First generation drug-eluting coronary stents have significantly improved clinical outcomes for heart patients, while concurrently highlighting the potential for substantial improvements. Next-generation methods are needed for improving the way drugs and other biologics are applied to the stent, as well as for active-agent release from the stent. The company successfully demonstrated in Phase I that its proprietary ElectroNanospray process could reproducibly apply nanocomposite drug/polymer coatings onto the intricate architecture of a coronary stent and could consistently meet preliminary specifications provided by a potential commercial partner. This Phase II project will extend that R&D by producing a manufacturing Apparatus designed to significantly improve process control features and throughput. Rigorous step-wise hardware-qualification experiments will generate test lots of coated stents for further characterization and validation by the same partner. Feedback will guide design iterations needed to optimize this unique manufacturing capability, with the goal of producing an apparatus that coats stents with a broad range of novel nanocomposite coatings and drug-release properties for preclinical testing and meets the stringent performance requirements for commercial manufacturing in a regulated environment. Commercially, sales of drug-eluting coronary stents will exceed $6 billion in 2006. With the first products entering the market in 2003, this represents the fastest market introduction in medical device history. The drug-eluting stent showed that the body's inflammatory and scarring response to the implanted bare metal stent, which resulted in re-blockage of the artery, could be overcome by applying thin layers of drug-releasing polymers to the stent surface. The broader implications are that coatings that enable site-specific delivery of biologically active compounds could improve the clinical performance of a wide variety of medical device implants, not only for cardiovascular indications, but also for use in orthopedic, neurology and tissue engineering applications. In addition, using the drug-eluting stent as an example, they offer the possibility of bringing about the same or improved clinical outcomes as existing therapies, while reducing cost, hospital length of stay, and loss of productivity by the patient. The novel manufacturing apparatus proposed in this research will have the ability to create and apply engineered nanocomposite coatings to device implants that incorporate novel active agents and controlled-release properties not possible with today's conventional coating processes, thereby offering the possibility of improved clinical outcomes for a wide variety of diseases.",

Agentase will adapt its proven enzyme-based chemistries for nerve, blood, and blister agent detection into forms that are compatible with continuous monitoring in the proposed Phase II effort. After optimizing individual sensors for sensitivity to agents and response time, a battery of experiments will be conducted to ensure that sensors have sufficient shelf life, operational lifetimes, and resistance to environmental interference. Custom built hardware will also be constructed to house the sensors and ensure their proper implementation. The work plan concludes with a series of operational assessments that serve as a true test of product feasibility prior to use in studies with warfare grade chemical agents. Successful completion of the effort will provide an inexpensive tool for monitoring air quality for the presence of hazardous chemicals.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop novel, biologically functional nanostructures that dramatically enhance the reproducibility, sensitivity, and spatial density of chip based assays. These nanostructures will improve applications ranging from point-of-care diagnosis to genomic arrays used in basic research by enabling the development of next generation screening technologies that are faster, more sensitive, more reliable, and possibly more cost effective than those presently available in the life sciences market. To accomplish the stated goals, Nanolnk will develop a patterning methodology based on Dip Pen Nanolithography (tm)(DPN(tm)) technology to generate sub-micron sized features on solid surfaces. The DPN method, built upon the technique of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), allows one to deposit materials uniformly in a direct-write fashion on surfaces with nanoscale spatial precision. This strategy offers significant advantages over current microarray printing technologies that suffer from poor spot to spot reproducibility in terms of size, shape, and oligonucleotide density, as well as reproducibility across microarray slides. In Phase I, Nanolnk demonstrated the feasibility of an approach based on DPN technology by generating sub-micron scale DNA nanostructures on glass surfaces. The resulting nanostructures were analyzed using existing fluorescence probe technology to provide benchmarking standards for comparison to conventional microarray assays. Concurrent with ink development and patterning optimization, microfabricated parallel multipen arrays were developed as a means for faster, simultaneous writing of multiple DNA inks. In Phase II, Nanolnk will develop a nanoarray fabrication platform consisting of a nanoarrayer instrument, parallel multipen arrays with integrated microfluidic inking systems and appropriate pen and surface modification chemistry to allow patterning with a variety of biomolecules. The Phase II effort will build on our success in Phase I and yield a flexible, nanoarray fabrication \"system\" with both near term and long term commercial potential. A commercialization partner has been identified for Phase III. This research project will develop a system for fabricating biochip microarrays that will offer more sensitive and reliable tools for medical research groups helping them to better understand the role of genes and proteins in human health. Improved methods of diagnosing and treating disease will result.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This SBIR Phase II program intends to develop the second generation of semiconductor nanocrystals (q-dots) based bio-medical labels to eliminate the usage of toxic cadmium element, to be physically permeable, and to not possess any self-quenching of the photoluminescence. This will be realized by a new invention, bright nanocrystal emitters based on doped non- cadmium semiconductor nanocrystals (d-dots), and the dendron-nanocrystal technology developed in the Phase I. NN-Labs has the exclusive patent rights for both key technologies. To accomplish this Phase II program, a balanced team in technology and business is assembled, with the original inventors, the scientists at NN-Labs and Professor Xiaogang Peng's group at the University of Arkansas (subcontractor), as the R&D team, Professor Shawn Chen at Stanford School of Medicine as the Medical Partner, Sigma-Aldrich as the Marketing Partner, and ImmunoVision (a subsidiary at Arkansas of IVAX diagnostics) as the Strategic Partner. D-dot labels possess nearly all advantages of q-dot labels in comparison to traditional fluorescent labels. Q-dot labels are currently developed for diagnostics and other types of bio- medical detection worldwide. However, the workhorse, cadmium selenide and related q-dots, is problematic. For example, European Union will start to ban any new products containing intentionally added in this summer. This major challenge will be nicely solved by d-dots technology, which relies on tunable emissions of doping centers in zinc based semiconductor nanocrystals. This unique fluorescence mechanism makes d-dots have zero self-quenching and thermally stable, which is an intrinsic problem for both organic dyes and q-dot labels. The unique emission mechanism and the dendron-nanocrystal technology reduce the total size of d- dot labels to that of a typical protein (a few nanometers), which is substantially smaller than the current standard products of q-dots labels, several tens of nanometers in size. Although q-dot technologies are currently pursued by companies worldwide, the unique patent position of NN-Labs on d-dot dendron-nanocrystals will likely place United States in front of other competitors in this promising industry field. Such opportunities are needed for the State of Arkansas to meet its long term mission, to develop this traditionally rural state to a knowledge- based and environmentally benign industry harbor.         This SBIR Phase II project will commercialize low intrinsically toxic, low cost, biocompatible, and permeable doped semiconductor nanocrystals (d-dots) as standard biomedical reagents, which exclude the usage of very toxic cadmium and other heavy metals.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main goals of this SBIR Phase II project are to design, fabricate and commercialize a scalable 'turn-key' deposition system- NanoBioCoatTM (suitable for dry powder and liquid dispersion) for applying active or passive nanoparticle-based functionally graded coatings on implants for biomedical applications. To develop and prototype the system, three major tasks will be performed: (1) systematic design, development, and prototyping of the NanoBioCoatTM system; (2) demonstration of the system in depositing a nanoparticle-based functionally graded coating (using TiO2,HAp, and ZnO) on hip implants; and (3) extensive testing of the coating system and coated components for physical, chemical, and biomedical properties. The challenge facing current state-of-the-art nanoparticle deposition systems is the difficulty in retaining the functional signatures of nanoparticles due to particle size growth caused by agglomeration and consolidation. To address these challenges, NanoMech proposes to develop the NanoBioCoatTM system, which features innovative methods for nanoparticle spray deposition, namely an electrostatic spray coating (ESC) process combined with a nanoparticle fluidization technique, and a transient sintering process. A key feature of the deposition system is the capability to start with nanoparticles and retain their nano-characteristics in the resulting coating. The system will be able to produce coatings using any of a number of different materials including titania, hydroxyapatite (HAp), and zinc oxide, singly or in combination. The system can apply coatings to biomedical devices such as implants, providing bioactive functions such as promoting bone growth and/or reducing bacteria. In addition, other important features related to ESC for biomedical implant coatings include the ability to: (1) deposit different types of nanoparticles individually and in combination; (2) produce structurally and compositionally graded coatings; (3) provide uniform deposition on complex 3D geometries; (4) deposit multi-functional composite coatings using different types of materials for innovative applications; (5) functionalize the coatings through deposition of bioactive materials, during deposition or in post processing (e.g., by adding proteins); and (6) provide high productivity and cost effectiveness. If successful, the proposed system will help to realize nanoparticle based bioactive coatings on implants to significantly shorten the fixation time, reduce the chance of bacteria infection, and extend the implant life for tissue engineering. In addition, the system has potential for coatings for drug delivery, environmental decontamination, and protective clothing.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Propofol is the largest selling, intravenous general anesthetic with domestic annual sales in excess of $500 million due to several favorable characteristics of this anesthetic and has an expected annual growth rate of 19%. However, a primary drawback of propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) revolves around this drug's extreme lipophilicity that necessitates dispersion in a soybean macroemulsion (i.e., Intralipid 10%). This requirement causes several possible adverse drug outcomes (e.g., rapid bacterial growth, severe stinging pain on injection). In SBIR Phase I activities, NanoMedex proposed that these adverse reactions caused by the Intralipid formulation could be prevented by using an alternative formulation of microemulsion-based nanoparticles to construct clear, thermodynamically stable formulations of propofol. To that end, NanoMedex demonstrated in SBIR Phase I the physical boundary parameters to synthesize these formulations, that these formulations had differential release rates in response to dilution, that these NanoMedex propofol formulations had differential anesthetic kinetics in rat, and that one NanoMedex formulation and Diprivan (the commercial formulation) were bioequivalent to cause anesthesia in dog. In SBIR Phase II, NanoMedex seeks to expand on these findings to demonstrate the following Specific Aims leading to an US Food and Drug Administration Investigational New Drug application and GMP-grade propofol formulations. Specific Aim 1. Determine the propensity of propofol microemulsions (NMDX) and a macroemulsion (Diprivan) to cause stinging on injection into a rat tail vein. Specific Aim 2. Characterize the ability of microbes to survive and grow in different anesthetic solutions (NMDX formulations, Diprivan, Intralipid, and Baxter PPI). Specific Aim 3. In swine, determine the pharmacokinetics of a propofol bolus and infusion as well as and dose-response relationship to cause hemolytic and/or thrombotic changes due to propofol microemulsions (NMDX) and macroemulsion (Diprivan). Specific Aim 4. Determine the stability of a GMP-manufactured, NanoMedex propofol microemulsion and macroemulsion (Diprivan) to changes in time, light, temperature, oxygen, and vibration. GMP-grade propofol formulations will be custom-synthesized in an FDA-approved plant with appropriate regulatory oversight using external contractors. At the conclusion of SBIR Phase II, NanoMedex, Inc. will have applied for an FDA IND, secured external financing via private investors to conduct FDA Phase I studies, and begun planning for an abbreviated new drug application. Successful conclusion of the propofol project will allow NanoMedex, Inc. to present this propofol microemulsion to large Pharma for additional Phase ll/lll studies and commercialization.",

Physically, gold is a better contrast element than iodine for both microCT and clinical CT because, for microCT the beam's energy spectrum can tailored to be above its 12-14-keV L-edge (e.g. 50 kVp), while for clinical CT it can be tuned to be above gold's 80.7-keV K-edge (e.g., 150 kVp with Cu filtration), thus optimizing the image contrast-to-noise ratio for both applications. Phase 1 work has succeeded in imaging 20 fm blood vessels and obtaining vascular casts in live animals with this approach, never before achieved. Small, orthotopic colon tumors were also detected in vivo using gold nanoparticles. Phamacokinetics and toxicity were also shown to be acceptable. Gold-antibody conjugates were found to be specifically targeted to colon tumor cells in vitro. In Phase II, targeted molecular imaging will be extended to animals. Anti-CEA antibody-gold nanoparticles will be optimized to detect small human colon tumors in a mouse model by microCT. Additionally, vascular molecular markers in tumors will also be targeted. Further toxicity testing will be done and used to demonstrate or refine production of non-toxic gold contrast agents. R&D effort will result in products offered that other investigators can use. The benefits of this work will be: a) the enabling of high resolution in vivo CT contrasted detection and study of colon tumors and their vasculature, b) the introduction of contrast agent products that will then be available to other researchers using microCTs that will enable vascular and targeted imaging, c) to address and overcome the remaining obstacles to make these agents acceptable for human use. If successful, this effort will produce superior blood pool agents and the first targeted CT contrast agent, goals that have been difficult to achieve by other approaches.",

        "abstract": "This project will develop a new class of nanocomposites containing isolated, individual, nano-scaled graphene plates (NGPs).  Like carbon nano-tubes, NGP materials exhibit attractive properties like carbon nano-tubes, but can be readily mass-produced and are expected to become available at much lower costs and in larger quantities.  When incorporated as a nano filler in a matrix, isolated NGPs are expected to impart exceptional mechanical (strength and stiffness), electrical (conductivity and dielectric), thermal (conductivity), and gas barrier properties to the matrix polymer.  Phase I experimentally demonstrated the superior mechanical and electrical properties of the NGP nanocomposite.  The feasibility of incorporating a high percentage of NGPs in a polymer matrix, to produce highly conductive bipolar plates on a continuous basis, has been demonstrated.  Processes for preparing continuous filaments containing highly oriented NGPs, and for converting these filaments into a high-strength nanocomposite, also were developed.  Phase II will develop the mass production capability of NGP nanocomposites for fuel cell bipolar plates, supercapacitor electrodes, and thin films or coatings for electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and electrostatic charge dissipation (ESD) applications.  The resultant material will be characterized with respect to strength, stiffness, gas permeation resistance (barrier properties), electrical conductivity, and dielectric properties (permittivity and loss factor).  Modeling and computational work will be undertaken to theorize the experimental data.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  NGP-based nanocomposites, with unique and tailorable electric conductivity and dielectric constants, could find use as functional coatings (EMI shields, electrostatic paintable plastics, ESD films or coatings, and corrosion-resistant coatings), lithium-ion battery negative electrodes, fuel cell bi-polar plates, supercapacitor electrodes, and dielectric elements in telecommunication devices.  Future applications could include automotive friction plates, solid lubricants, and micron- or nano-scaled bearings, springs, sensors, and switch contacts.  The market for conductive polymers alone (primarily filler-resin composites, but not including fuel cell bipolar plates) has been estimated at 128.5 million pounds at a value of $205.3 million in 2003.

Improper handling of e-waste results in vast amounts of toxic waste being sent to landfill and leaching into the water supply.  Due to these concerns e-waste recycling is a rapidly growing industry.  Unfortunately, most current e-waste recycling processes rely on either manual hand sorting or differental density sorting methods.  Manual hand sorting is expensive in the U.S. and has been associated with major environmental damage overseas.  Differential density sorting is expensive and is not very effective for sorting e-waste plastics by polymer type.  Developing plastics sorting technologies are incompatible with differential density sorting technology.                 When properly sorted there are a significant amount of valuable recyclable materials in e-waste.  Recycling rates for e-waste are currently low in part because e-waste recyclers charge a fee for recycling in order to make a profit.  Legislative action in many states may increase this rate, but the long term viabilty of e-waste recycling depends upon economical approaches to recovering these valuable materials.

This automated sorting system would allow recyclers of e-wastes to more efficiently process these PWBs and to obtian a pure plastics steam which could then be more efficiently sorted into pure polymer streams which can then be sold for a premium to plastics manufactures.                                                         A significant increase in the anticipated amount of e-waste has been observed over the last few years and is expectd to continue as the time between introduction and obsolescence becomes continually smaller.  Because most electronic devices contain a significant number of plastic parts and PWBs, separation and recovery of these materials is crucial for the long-term viability of environmentally friendly recyclig of e-wastes.  It is anticipated that upon the successful completion of Phase I and Phase II research that the application of the technology will improve the costs of recycling e-wastes, improving the rate at which e-wastes are recycled.                                                                                                                         The proposing firm is a major manufacturer of recycling equipment for the post-consumer plastics recycling industry and has recived considerable interest in the development of a sorting system for sorting printed wiring boad materials from e-waste plastics.  Due to this interest the proposed technology is expected to have a strong market in the e-wate recycling industry.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA vaccines and gene medicines, derived from bacterial plasmids, are emerging as an important new class of pharmaceuticals. DNA molecules made strictly by rational design allows the manufacturer to bypass years of development for the production of efficacious vaccines, and literally create new vaccine entities in days and mass produce vaccines in 2-3 weeks for rapid deployment against new biological agents. However, existing fermentation and purification production technologies are inefficient, difficult to scale, and require sophisticated production equipment and methodology. This limits their utility to meet cost and capacity needs for existing plasmid applications, or to rapidly produce kilograms of plasmid DNA for pandemic vaccination. Phase I addressed these problems directly and successfully by proving feasibility of a cost effective dramatically streamlined and simple purification process that eliminates specialized and costly alkaline or heat lysis steps and the associated toxic waste streams. In Phase II, we will make and evaluate designer strains and associated fermentation and purification methodology. These strains will utilize novel chimeric nucleases and autolytic bacterial strains developed in Phase I. Four prototypes are envisioned. Prototype I is a rapid deployment plasmid production system linking autolytic plasmid purification to Nature Technology Corporation's (NTC) existing fermentation platform to facilitate immediate production of a variety of plasmid DNAs for pandemic applications. The key drivers for this platform are speed of production, safety, simplicity, scalability and transferability to existing manufacturing facilities in developed and emerging countries. Autolytic strains with an integrated chimeric nuclease will be created, and fermentation, autolysis, and plasmid purification methodologies developed. The system will be integrated into NTC's existing rapid deployment DNA vaccine platform (RapidVACC) for response to influenza H5N1 pandemic. Prototypes II-IV are aimed at facilitating the commercialization of gene medicines for a variety of applications. The key drivers for these prototypes are purity, yield, cost (reagents, equipment, volumes, and time), scalability and safety. Prototype IV links high yield defined media fermentation with new simplified lysis and purification methodologies. This technology will be licensed to plasmid DNA manufacturers; one such commercialization channel has already been identified.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the field of cortical control signal acquisition, the recording system is a critical bottleneck for the passage of internal signals to external applications. It is agreed in this field that there are cortical control signals that can be used to control prosthetic devices and restore movement to paralyzed limbs, but these signals must be recorded and transmitted rapidly and intact. It is our goal to complete the development of a wireless, scalable 128-channel recording system, suitable for long-term human use. Applications range from communication for locked-in patients, to environmental control for the disabled, to motion restoration for the spinal cord injury population. Using two recently completed Phase I grants, Neural Signals has the necessary experience to meet this goal. The first Phase I effort (1 R43 NS-42478-01) designed and built an 8-channel, flexible, surface mount assembly, including a wireless inductive power supply, internal calibration, eight recording amplifiers, and eight FM transmitters. The hybrid circuit developed during this grant resulted in a four-fold reduction in the recording system's volume, compared to our previous implantable recording system. The second Phase I grant (1 R43 NS048706-01) has just been completed. During this grant, a 16-channel integrated circuit (1C) was fabricated to amplify signals from cortical electrodes and multiplex the signals using an analog scanner. Specific aims in Phase II are: A: Continue development of the integrated circuit device, (1) by incorporating voltage regulation and bias circuitry into the integrated circuit to minimize external semiconductor components; (2) by improving the floating gate recording amplifier and scanner based on knowledge gained during the Phase I development; (3) by continuing to develop (a) the power induction system and (b) a unique synchronous scanner transmission system that will replace the present FM system. B: Miniaturize the Neurotrophic Electrode connections for reliable connection with the 1C device. C: Choose and implement new coatings and perform soak testing and stress testing of the implantable recording device consisting of the recording amplifiers, power supply, wireless signal transmission and attached electrodes.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To achieve accurate localization of electrical sources of the human EEG and evoked potentials, the field on the scalp must be sampled at much higher spatial frequency than the 19 positions defined by the standard \"10- 20\" locations. \"High resolution\" (64-256 channel) EEG (hrEEG) not only provides greater localization of source generators for experimental purposes but can substantially improve diagnostic and monitoring capability for diseases such as epilepsy and stroke. Despite the availability of biopotential amplifier systems with large numbers of channels, the process of transducing the microvolt level cerebral electrical signals at the scalp surface remains difficult, requiring low and balanced contact impedances to achieve acceptable levels of line frequency (60 Hz) noise. Manual preparation of scalp sites using solvents, abrasives or syringe needles to match amplifier system input requirements is very time consuming and a major impediment to hrEEG application due to the number of channels involved. High system acquisition cost has also substantially inhibited the development and utilization of hrEEG. A low cost, preparation-free, high resolution EEG system will be developed that will entirely eliminate scalp site preparation without the use of costly on-head electronics, shielded recording environment or excessive filtering that can compromise signal integrity. Setup time for clinical and experimental protocols will be reduced to the time required for physical application of electrodes and patient irritation and risk of infection from scalp puncture during abrasion will both be eliminated. The new hrEEG system will be designed to substantially lower system cost by a new type of modular hardware architecture that achieves a highly compact form factor. An open-source software package will feature object-oriented programmability, conferring unprecedented user control and flexibility. An advanced electrode cap system will feature disposable/reusable electrodes, user-serviceability and an associated ultrasonic cleaning system that will reduce operational costs. The proposed new system will lead to increased utilization of hrEEG for experimental and clinical applications. Following first year development, the hrEEG system will be evaluated in human subjects at an independent, university-based EEG laboratory.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accelerated neuronal cell death leading to dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the Nation's greatest medical, social and economic challenges. However, despite the urgency and abundance of research in the field there is still no cure for AD. While there is currently no consensus on the mechanism of AD, the majority of drug discovery efforts target the first of two defining neuropathological features of AD,amyloid-beta (A?) containing plaques, whereas far fewer studies target the neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of polymerized tau protein. However, recent studies strongly correlate NFT formation to the degree of dementia in AD and have ignited interest in furthering our understanding of tau pathology. Based on preliminary studies in animal and fish models, small molecules that inhibit or reverse the formation of NFTs caused by tau polymerization could provide the basis for a new class of AD therapeutics. Neuronautics Inc. (NNI) is developing AD therapeutics that act by inhibiting or reversing NFT formation. We have screened 35,000 compounds and identified eight classes that inhibit tau polymerization in vitro with IC-5Os in the nanomolar range. Our extensive research on two compounds and their analogs - NNI3 and NNI5 belonging to a class of benzothiazole derivatives looks very promising. They have IC-50's below 100 nM. In vivo treatment of the sea lamprey neuronal cell model of neurofibrillary pathology expressing human tau isoforms- htau23 and rttau40 with NNI3 and its analogs significantly reduced neurodegeneration. We also have favorable preliminary indications of brain penetration in mice. In addition, we have confirmed that these drugs do not interfere with normal tau function even at drug concentrations as high as 100 ?M in vitro. There have also been preliminary indications that NNI3 and NNI5 may be inhibiting tau filament formation by two different mechanisms. In this study we propose to perform pharmacokinetic studies and in vivo testing of the eight NNI lead drug candidates in animal and cell models of tauopathy. RELEVANCE: With this work we hope to prove the hypothesis that neurodegeneration seen in AD can be cured by inhibiting or reversing the formation of tau tangles. This project will enable NNI to complete studies showing biological activities and the safety profile of its lead compounds in vivo. We hope that by the end of this study we will have at least two compounds ready for Phase-l clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ischemic injury of the brain is a major cause of death and morbidity, and often causes long term disability. NMDA receptor (NMDAR) blockers, particularly targeting the NR2B-subunit are neuroprotective in ischemic disease animal models. Unfortunately, most NMDAR antagonists have failed in clinical development as a result of unacceptable side effects such as memory impairment, ataxia, hypertension and psychotic behavior. We have identified a potential strategy for overcoming NMDA receptor-mediated toxicities, namely to discover compounds that are more effective NMDAR blockers at the acidic pH characteristic of neuropathologies involving focal ischemia. We envision developing a drug that is virtually inactive at normal brain pH but rapidly blocks NMDAR in ischemic brain tissue as soon as the pH drops, in the phase I SBIR we established proof of concept that the pH drop during transient focal ischemia in mice is deep enough to substantially enhance the effectiveness of our best NMDAR blockers as neuroprotectants. We also found that the typical adverse effects of NMDAR blockers are not present at doses well above therapeutic levels for NeurOp compounds with the largest pH-boost in potency. We have selected ischemic injury following vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage as our initial clinical indication. The key next steps are to identify a clinical candidate molecule and its backup for formal preclinical development. This requires lead optimization of our compounds along non-efficacy (i.e., ADMET) lines, together with determination of the safety margin for a series of compounds in animal models related to the clinical indication. These efforts are expected to yield strong therapeutic candidates which will merit formal preclinical studies using GLP/GMP grade materials required to support the submission of an IND to the FDA. The Phase II goals are to; carry out lead optimization studies on NeurOp compounds, identify compounds with the best safety margin for ischemia-related clinical indications and select a clinical candidate and its backup based upon information obtained from performing aims 1 and 2. The human suffering and economic costs resulting from ischemic injury is enormous. The total cost of stroke alone is $56.8 billion per year in the United States (American Heart Association, Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics-2005 Update). The goal of this project is to develop a safe and effective drug to prevent and treat CNS damage caused by ischemia.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical trials of new medications often rely on subjective, observer-based ratings of side effects in the form of movement abnormalities to evaluate safety and tolerance of medication dosage. Imprecise ratings of adverse side effects have led to inconsistent results from these trials. Well-known adverse effects are extrapyramidal motor side effects (EPS), which can emerge within days of beginning treatment of antipsychotic drugs to treat schizophrenia, especially in the elderly. EPS symptoms include abnormalities in velocity scaling (VS) and motor steadiness or smoothness. We have shown in Phase I of this programmatic research that a system can be developed to reliably quantify these motor impairments during handwriting. In Phase II, we plan to expand the research started in Phase I toward developing an easy-to-use, quantitative system for monitoring drug-induced EPS. Specifically, the primary goals of Phase II are to conduct large- scale studies across several laboratories and clinics to examine generalizability of the measuring procedure and to examine the influence of treatment- and subject-related factors on outcome variables. The Phase II research plan consists of four experiments: (1) to examine effects of treatment-related variables on fine motor control during handwriting; (2) to examine effects of subject-related variables, such as demographics, and psychopathology on fine motor control during handwriting; (3) to examine the effects of task complexity on fine motor control during handwriting; and (4) to examine the generalizability of our findings across sites. Our long-term goal is to develop a general-purpose system for large-scale clinical trials that can readily be adopted in multi-center, clinical trials evaluating new drug safety and tolerance. From the perspective of the clinician, our handwriting movement analysis system will be a practical tool for screening and monitoring medication side effects in a variety of inpatient and outpatient neuropsychiatric settings. From an industry and governmental perspective, drug development will benefit from reliable and valid tools for assessing medication-induced side effects. The pharmaceutical industry would be able to reduce research and development costs if adverse effects of new medications could be measured quicker and more reliably than conventional methods.",

Approximately $600 million is spent each year on drugs to treat nematode infections in animals. These drugs are not completely effective so the discovery of new therapies and drug targets is of paramount importance. Recently we employed a novel bioinformatics approach to identify valid drug targets in nematodes that are absent from mammals. A particularly promising enzyme target has been discovered and validated which merits further development. Phase I of this project led to the successful development of a target-based screening system and assays to measure enzyme activity and inhibition. Pilot screening of various libraries has commenced and hits have been obtained which are being characterized further. With Phase II funding, we will perform more extensive screening with the goal of identifying potent inhibitors of enzyme activity. The hits will be evaluated further for broad-spectrum enzyme inhibitory activity by measuring their effects on the target isolated from other nematodes. To determine target specificity, hits will be tested in other assays involving distantly related enzymes. Non-specific cytotoxicity will be determined using mammalian cell lines. The most promising inhibitors will be evaluated for nematocidal and anti-bacterial activity in various in vitro and in vivo systems. Active compounds may also be tested for their effects on other organisms that possess the target. This will provide the basis for discovering a new class of drugs that may be used in veterinary and human medicine.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and scale-up a new group of light-weight, high-strength and fire-resistant polymeric foams by using innovative nanotechnology. The project explores the synthesis of nanocomposites using both plate-like and fiber-like nanoparticles with high carbon dioxide (CO2) affinity. Polymer blends including a minor phase with high CO2 solubility are used as the matrix material. To improve fire-resistance, surfactant-free and water-expandable polymer/clay nanocomposites are also prepared by suspension polymerization of inverse emulsion. Since low molecular weight surfactants are not needed, there is no fire hazard problem. These polymer blend nanocomposites are then used to produce high performance foam products aimed at both insulation and structural applications. The presence of nanoparticles in polymer blends allows better control of cell morphology and foam density in the manufacturing processes. Ultra-low-density foams with thermal insulation properties better than the existing insulation materials and high-density microcellular foams with mechanical properties close to those of solid polymers are achieved. The materials and processing conditions will be optimized to obtain better foamability and mechanical properties of these novel nanocomposites foams. Commercially, nanocomposite reinforced foams have the potential in structural applications to replace solid polymers.  The U.S. market for polymer foams was more than 7.4 billion pounds in 2001. Currently, their applications are limited by poor mechanical strength, surface quality, thermal stability and fire retardance. Furthermore, traditional chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) blowing agents cause ozone depletion and will be banned by 2010. As environmentally benign blowing agent CO2 is used to replace CFCs, the success of this project will be extremely valuable for environmental protection. A successful implementation of this novel technology can lead to significant impact on energy saving, material saving, and environmental protection that are critical to our nation's economy and societal health.",

Phase 1 efforts demonstrated spatial resolutions of 15 \u00c2\u00b5m with high detection efficiency and moderate counting rates. The Phase 2 proposed program will carry out further detector enhancements with construction of neutron-sensitive 40 mm MCPs having 5 \u00c2\u00b5m pores on 6 \u00c2\u00b5m centers and a specialized bias angle to enhance detection efficiency.

Simulated-use testing with a range of organisms in organic soils (OS) have confirmed the effectiveness of the technology in performing a validated cycle with reduction factor (RF) > 5 and OS removal > 99.9%; thus, the technology can be considered equivalent to or better than manual pre-cleaning.

This model provides a rigorous basis for the cleaning and rinsing of narrow channels and led to the discovery of a new means for generating the droplets critical to contaminant removal and their transport from channels. The current Competing Continuation Phase II application is aimed at designing, building and validating a Beta-prototype AER that has a validated cleaning protocol that will ensure 99.9% OS removal, a bioburden RF of > 5 and a sterilization assurance of 10-6. The two-phase flow (TPF) process will be compared to manual cleaning with the objective of showing that it achieves equivalent or better performance compared to manual cleaning. The AER developed will provide sample ports and validated protocols to allow users to monitor the final rinse water to ensure it does not contain unacceptable bioburden levels. The objectives of the study are to complete the development of the technology and to build the Beta NovaScope device to satisfy FDA requirements for 510K approval. The Specific Aims are to: Aim 1: Finalize and define design requirements (including leak, blockage and obstruction testing), performance specifications and standards of the NovaScope device (hardware and software) according to the FDA process; Aim 2: Validate, assess and refine (VAR) the NovaScope's systems: mechanical, electrical, and chemical, following the GMP process according to FDA requirements for preclinical and clinical trials; Aim 3: Validate the performance and functionality of the Beta NovaScope using radionuclide imaging testing according to the prEN 15883 International Standard; Aim 4: Validate the performance and functionality of the Beta NovaScope using biofilm testing in accordance with the new International Standard EN/ISO 15883; Aim 5: Validate cleaning efficacy of Beta prototype two-phase flow system using RO water rinse; Aim 6: Validate process monitoring for TPF-NovaScope AER; Aim 7: Prepare, submit and receive approval for FDA-IDE and IRB needed for the clinical evaluation; Aim 8: Demonstrate cleaning and sterilization efficacy in-use - clinical in-use validation; Aim 9: Conduct post-clinical final validation and assessment, and refine the NovaScope device; Aim 10: Perform final audit for FDA approval process; Aim 11: Prepare interim and final reports and publications; Aim 12: Hold periodic meetings with the FDA regarding requirements and process for submitting an application.",

Solving the 3-dimensional structure of CB2R would enable the design of better CB2R-selective drugs. Although 30-50% of all current therapeutic drugs on the market modulate the action of different G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), rhodopsin is the only GPCR for which the crystal structure is known. The bottleneck for GPCR crystallization has been the difficulty to generate large quantities of high-quality receptor sample needed for crystallography. The aim of this project is the crystallization and structural elucidation of CB2R by taking advantage of a novel, proprietary expression system to generate large amounts of homogeneous CB2R. If successful, the CB2R structure would dramatically empower our current cannabinoid receptor drug discovery effort. Moreover, this structure would represent the first non-rhodopsin template for molecular modeling of Family 1 GPCRs. And, in particular, it would be an excellent template for the modeling of the closely related CB1R, involved in many therapeutic areas including drug abuse, immune disorders, and obesity.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NovaSpeech proposes to develop an innovative perceptually-oriented hybrid approach to unconstrained speech synthesis for generating individualized, customized voices of either gender and any age. The system will provide human-sounding, intelligible, and mimetic speech, yet have small storage requirements, be able to support the cost-efficient addition of new voices, and be suitable for implementation on virtually any hardware platform. As a result, the technology will be well-suited to virtually any unlimited vocabulary synthesis application, but be of special benefit to speech-impaired individuals, who have a particularly great need for natural-sounding, individualized voices on a broad range of devices. With the hybrid system, individuals who know they will lose their voice due to illness or surgery will be able to cost-efficiently capture and utilize their pre-injury voice in a voice output communication aid; and all speech-impaired users will be able to obtain reliable, appropriate, individualized voices that can grow with them as they mature and age. No existing synthesis approach meets these needs, with each type of technology trading off one desirable property for another, be it low storage requirements for natural voice quality, or human voice quality for flexibility. The hybrid approach overcomes these limitations by integrating, in a novel and principled way, the best features of two well-known synthesis techniques: corpus-based waveform concatenation and rule-based formant synthesis. Capitalizing on a number of important perceptual principles, the system will prestore only a small number of intrinsic units, such as stressed vowels, from the target speaker, and synthesize other, adaptable units by rule. Thus with only a small prestored speech corpus, and a common set of rules across voices, it will produce speech that sounds like the intended speaker. In its proposed Phase II project, NovaSpeech will develop a complete hybrid prototype text-to-speech (TTS) system for eight voices in General American English, including male and female children, adults, and elderly adults (the base speakers), as well as for two speakers who know they will lose their ability to speak naturally as a result of future laryngectomies. Year 1 will be focused on exploring possible system architectures; implementing rules for adaptable units; and exploring through perceptual experiments possible strategies for storing and selecting intrinsic units. Year 2 will be focused on implementing a fully functional hybrid TTS prototype for the six base voices. By month six of year 2 at the latest, the company will verify the ability to quickly add new voices by implementing the voices of the laryngectomy patients, providing them with functional systems for their voices, and obtaining feedback from them and those who know them about the quality of the voices and system features. The ultimate objective of the hybrid project is to improve the naturalness and mimetic quality of speech synthesized from unrestricted symbolic input, with the particular goal of enhancing the utility and flexibility of voice output communication aids for speech-impaired individuals.",

Biomechanical testing of sterilized born revealed that our supercritical CO2 process maintains all of the essential characteristics of the allograft. This is the first demonstration of a technology that can achieve this level of sterility while maintaining the overall strength of the graft as rigorously tested by 3 point bending. The development of this technology will facilitate continued innovation in orthopedic technologies that are currently limited by a lack of viable sterilization options. Indeed continued innovation will be required to meet the needs of the over 36 million Americans with musculoskeletal conditions that limit their ability to function, with cost to society of over 100 billion dollars annually. Supercritical CO2 sterilization will be an enabling technology by offering a sterilization alternative that is more compatible with biological molecules and cutting edge polymers. This sterilization technology will result in a wider diversity of orthopedic technologies that are both more functional and safer. Phase II funding will address the two questions that remain before the successful commercialization of the process for use in tissue banks. First is the comprehensive testing of the impact of our process on the ability of bone allografts to generate osteoinductive responses. Second, is the ability of the process to achieve viral inactivation? With these two questions answered the way will be cleared to immediately provide for safer allografts than current technology allows for, potentially impacting the lives of millions of allograft recipients.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current therapeutic approaches for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are not adequate to prevent the devastating inflammation and joint destruction. Complement activation contributes significantly to the inflammatory process in arthritic joints. While complement activation is vital to the body's defenses in fighting infections, unregulated complement activation significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases, including RA. With complement activation, the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a are released at sites of inflammation and are potent chemoattractants and activators of neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, leukocytes, monocytes and macrophages that orchestrate and perpetuate the inflammatory response by producing pro-inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines. Recently developed humanized anti- 5 antibodies for inhibiting the downstream events of the complement cascade have highlighted the complement fragment C5a as a therapeutic target, but have neglected the essential role of C3a. Based on our preliminary data, therapeutic approaches that inhibit production of C3a, C5a and thus the final complement protein, the membrane attack complex (MAC) will completely inhibit the amplification loop of the alternative pathway (AP) and prevent its augmenting effect on activation of the classical complement pathway (CP). Such inhibitors should have greater potency than those that target only C5a in preventing cellular infiltration of cells, which direct the joint inflammation and destruction and to inhibit their activation and release of inflammatory mediators, such as TNF and IL-1. Consistent with this, C3a is known to regulate TNF and IL-1 production. The objective of this Phase II application is to further evaluate the efficacy of NM001(a blocking monoclonal antibody against factor B) and NM3014 (synthetic low molecular weight inhibitor of properdin function) in two well established models of RA; AIA rabbit model and CIA rat model. Similar to anti-properdin monoclonal antibodies both NM001 and NM3014 target the C3 convertase and prevent C3a, C5a and C5b-9 formation. We expect that such inhibitors will dramatically inhibit inflammation and joint destruction and will be an effective therapeutic approach for treating RA. NovelMed's approach appears to be more promising than current therapies because our approach is expected to inhibit the production of TNF and IL-1 instead of targeting each one separately. NovelMed has filed a patent on such inhibitors and additional patents are in preparation.",

The potential use of engineered, multi-drug-resistant strains as agents of bioterrorism necessitates the development of new anti-Y. pestis therapies. This is a challenging goal, since the last novel class of broad-spectrum antibiotics was introduced over 20 years ago. NovoBiotic has a proprietary technology capable of meeting this challenge. We will obtain new antimicrobials from a previously inaccessible source - unculturable microorganisms that make up 99% of the total microbial diversity. In Phase I, our goal was to develop an industrial-scale technology to grow and screen previously unculturable microorganisms for antimicrobial production. The main milestone was to \"domesticate\" unculturable organisms to enable scale-up under conventional growth conditions; and developing a screen capable of detecting antimicrobial activity at a rate of equal to or >10(exp5) isolates/year. We achieved these milestones ahead of schedule, and have in place a robust technology that will enable us to discover new antibiotics in this Phase II project. Our preliminary results indicate that unculturable microorganisms produce novel, broad- spectrum antimicrobial compounds. The anti-infectives we develop will target a global $24 billion market. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are the top earners, with several drugs having sales in excess of $1 billion. Phase II Specific Aims are: 1. Large-scale isolation of lead antimicrobial compounds from unculturable bacteria. Milestone: obtain 200 purified, potentially novel lead compounds. 2. In vitro validation and structure of lead compounds. a. Structure determination. All compounds derived from the bioassay guided fractionation will have their structures elucidated. We will define the basic molecular architecture using advanced MS and NMR. b. Biological validation. We will determine the following properties of the purified early leads: potency (MIC) against a panel of test organisms; MBC; activity in the presence of serum; toxicity against animal cells; resistance development; specificity of action. Milestone: obtain 50 leads with novel structure. 3. In vivo validation. The lead compounds that pass preliminary validation will be subjected to a detailed evaluation in an animal model. Milestone: obtain 3-5 advanced validated leads for drug development. Relevance to human health: There is an acute need for new antibiotics to combat conventional and biowarfare drug-resistant pathogens. The compounds we discover in this project will lead to new, broad- spectrum antibiotics.",

        "abstract": "Electronics for pulsed front-end devices at pulsed particle accelerators are typically accessed through up to 4 networks, which carry timing information, pulse-to-pulse sequencing, real-time streaming data, and configuration information, respectively.  Although modern commercial networks offer a rich variety of features, they are not well optimized to the needs of pulsed accelerators for clocking, pulse-by-pulse control, or reliable real-time data acquisition with sub-millisecond timeouts in an electrically noisy environment.  In this project, circuit switching will be used to provide preferential delivery of real-time data streams, with error correction adding noise immunity.  The accelerator clock frequency will be carried by synchronizing the data link byte clock to the accelerator clock.  Clock phase and fiducial timing data will be sent by custom extensions to the circuit switching protocols.  In Phase I, a previously-developed approach for circuit switching both real-time and non-real-time data onto a single network physical link, via additional hardware inserted between the media access and serializer-deserializer layers, was extended to carry accelerator clock and fiducial timing data.  A method for coupling multiple power PC processors embedded within a single field programmable gate array via shared memory was developed.  In Phase II, the hardware design will be completed and two prototype circuit boards will be constructed and debugged.  A large volume of real-time operating system and application-level software will be developed.  End-to-end testing will demonstrate simultaneous real-time data streaming and Internet-accessible, non-real-time, data acquisition control and data analysis.

An active pulse compressor would enable this development by multiplying the power of Ka-band microwave pulses to obtain peak power levels that are unattainable from a single source.   This active pulse compression can be achieved by rapidly switching the coupling between delay lines and a load, so as to discharge energy stored in the lines into the load.  This project will develop an active switch based on the use of ferroelectric elements, for which the dielectric constant changes rapidly upon application of a voltage pulse.  The switch will be used with the 34-GHz magnicon to constitute a test facility for high-gradient accelerator R&D.   In Phase I, design studies, involving detailed simulations on realistic structures, were carried out for an active Ka-band switch to be used with delay lines.  In these studies, the switch produced compressed pulses with peak powers in the range of 200 MW, as required for the development of high-gradient accelerator structures for a future multi-TeV collider.  In Phase II, engineering designs for a high-power prototype of the ferroelectric switch will be fabricated and tested using a 34-GHz magnicon test facility.  A pair of low-loss delay lines and a quasi-optical hybrid coupler will be assembled to test the overall concept.

        "abstract": "A future multi-TeV collider requires the development of new technology to achieve its high acceleration gradient.  An accelerator structure that embodies a dielectric-lined waveguide, which offers the promise of sustaining a high acceleration gradient, is currently under development.  However, the all-metal structures used to achieve the high acceleration gradient have encountered limits from microwave breakdown.  Recent evidence has suggested that selected dielectrics, such as diamond, have higher breakdown thresholds than metals.  Therefore, this project will design and test dielectric-lined structures and determine their breakdown thresholds under conditions similar to those in an accelerator.   In Phase I, both theoretical and computational design studies were carried out for dielectric-lined rectangular waveguides that could be suitable for a future high-gradient linear accelerator.  A test cell was designed to determine breakdown thresholds for hydrogenated and dehydrogenated artificial diamond coatings (produced by chemical vapor deposition (CVD)) at 34 GHz, using about 10 MW of available magnicon power.  Cold tests, using a mock-up of the high-power test cell, were carried out to confirm the design criteria.  In Phase II, engineering designs for the high-power high-gradient test cell will be completed, and the cell will be fabricated and tested using a 34-GHz magnicon test facility.  Tests will be conducted on diamond samples that are hydrogenated (as is usual) as well as dehydrogenated, the latter so as to greatly reduce the secondary electron emission coefficient and to raise the breakdown threshold.  The results of these tests will be used to extend our understanding of microwave breakdown, thereby enabling the design of high-gradient accelerators for a future multi-TeV collider.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  High-gradient structures for a future multi-TeV collider, based on use of dielectric-lined waveguides, could create demand for thousands of accelerator structures, as well as for the artificial CVD diamond liners.  This is a potential market of hundreds of millions of dollars",

        "abstract": "The overall goal of this proposed program (through Phase III) is to provide the municipal water authorities and the EPA with a chemical sensor that can be multiplexed into water distribution systems to provide early warning of poisoned water supplies.  This will be accomplished by developing surface-enhanced Raman (SER) sensors that can be integrated into water supply systems and coupled to a central Raman analyzer via fiber optics.     \n\n All of the test chemical, the pesticides, the chemical agent hydrolysis products, and cyanide were measured at the Phase I detection goal of 1 ppm (1 mg/L) within 5 minutes! And the estimated limits-of-detection suggest that the Phase II detection goal of 10 ppb (0.01 mg/L or 0.01ppm) can be obtained.  Furthermore, in the case of cyanide a 10 ppb flowing sample was detected in 1-min!                                                                                                                                                    \n\nThe overall goal of Phase II will be to fully develop the proposed analyzer and improve sensitivity to allow detection at 10 microg/L in 10 min (meets or exceeds the requirements for drinking water).  This will include ruggidizing the SER-active sol-gel capillaries, developing a universal sampling system with a fiber optic probe interface, and developing comprehensive analysis that includes rapid chemical identification.  Capabilities will be developed using real-world samples from a drinking water distribution system and performing two field tests.  One field test will involve the analysis to a food dye artificially added to a water supply, while the other field test, performed at the US Army\u00c2\u00bfs Edgewood Chem Bio Research Center, will involve the analysis of HD and VX added to a close-loop water test system.                                              \n\nPotential applications:                                                                                                                         In addition to the proposed application of monitoring water supplies to ensure safe drinking water, the proposed analyzer could be used by the military to ensure water safety of local supplies, and by first responders to assess safety of any water supply.  While not detecting poisons, the analyzer will perform dual-use duty by monitoring traditional contaminants of concern (e.g., chlorinated organics generated by disinfection operations, cyanide of leaching operations, and chromium by plating operations).",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Phase II SBIR research program is to continue development of a high-repetition-rate tunable IR laser system for high-throughput and high-sensitivity IR MALDI applications. The program goals are to generate a compact prototype laser system and to demonstrate novel high repetition-rate IR-MALDI applications. The specific program tasks of the project are: Develop and test the second-generation compact high repetition-rate OPO based on a commercially available pump laser system; Demonstrate the second-generation OPO on a MALDI time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer; Interface and demonstrate the second-generation OPO with an orthogonal extraction MALDI ion source hybrid quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer; and develop scanning IR MALDI and LDI mass spectrometry for spatially resolved gel and tissue analysis.         Traditional MALDI has utilized low-repetition-rate laser systems, which can yield lengthy measurement times when large numbers of samples must be analyzed, or in cutting-edge scanning/mapping applications such as blot, direct gel or tissue analysis. Reducing analysis times is important for commercial high-volume laboratories in several areas including functional proteomics and drug discovery. Recent research has focused on utilizing high-repetition-rate (1 kHz) UV laser systems for both improved throughput and increased sensitivity in UV-MALDI and AP-MALDI experiments. However due to lack of suitable laser systems, there has been no research in the area of high repetition- rate IR MALDI, which has several advantages over UV MALDI including analysis of high-mass DNA and other high molecular weight biomolecules, analysis of biopolymers from gel blots or directly from cell or tissue samples, and the analysis of pharmaceuticals and other low molecular weight molecules (200 - 1500 Da).     This program will address the need for a high-repetition rate mid-IR laser system for MALDI applications by developing and testing a prototype compact laser system, and demonstrating its capabilities in a number of key applications which will benefit from the increase in data collection rate and ion flux.     Mass spectrometry of biological molecules is a key bioanalytical technology, and plays an important part in public health both directly as a component of clinical diagnostics and as a key tool in biochemical research, enhancing our understanding of the basic biochemical processes of proteins and genes and their interrelation among their environment. Key techniques such as MALDI mass spectrometry have provided a wealth of proteomics data which has greatly enhanced our knowledge of the various proteins and their distribution and function in living systems. The proposed work will further enhance MALDI performance by providing a high-repletion-rate IR laser capable of improving both the speed of data collection but also the quality of the data in a variety of applications.",

These enhancements serve to improve throughputs at the airports, but the resulting increases in surface traffic and airport complexity would lead to taxi delays and surface traffic congestion that offset some of the expected benefits. New operational concepts are needed to preserve the envisioned benefits. A Surface Operation Automation Research (SOAR) project has been exploring a concept of collaborative automation between surface traffic management and the flight deck. The Phase I research represents a major step towards the concept of a Flight-deck Automation for Reliable Ground Operation (FARGO) system, with results that demonstrate the feasibility of guidance and control technologies to deliver high-precision taxi performance, and interface technologies capable of conveying guidance and control information to the flight crew to achieve the precise taxi control. The proposed Phase II effort focuses on the development of a complete FARGO system, including operational procedures, aircraft guidance and control reference and monitor displays, and traffic monitor display and alert systems. Efforts beyond Phase II should target the transition of the FARGO technologies to the avionics community.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most final diagnoses of cancer today are still made using the same histopathologic techniques that have been in use for the past 50 years. In-vivo optical cancer detection (\"optical biopsy\") holds tremendous potential as an additional tool for cancer screening, diagnosis and management. Over 15 years of study has shown that optical spectra reveal differences between normal, pre-cancerous, and malignant tissues. This proposal addresses the need for practical, cost-effective, and commercially-viable fiberoptic probes and opto-electronics that can be used to detect a wide variety of cancers in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro. Principal targets are epithelial carcinomas of the lungs, skin, esophagus, Gl tract, cervix, and bladder. The successful implementation of probes for optical biopsy will allow physicians to perform biopsies at more sites on a screening basis, help guide surgical biopsy for improved sensitivity, and help establish surgical margins when resecting malignant tissues. Results of biopsies taken with these user-friendly probes will be immediate, allowing the practitioner to perform additional measurements if needed, and to minimize patient stress caused by delayed results. Once optical biopsies are proven clinically, they may eventually replace excisional biopsies and eliminate laboratory errors. Screening rates should go up, and cancer diagnosis and treatment costs down. More than half of the 2 million cancer cases in the US each year involve carcinomas accessible to fiberoptic probes. If the probes can be shown to work in mixed tissue types as well as epithelial tissues, needle mediated probes may also detect cancers percutaneously, for indications such as breast lumps and prostate lesions. The proposed probes use Polarized Elastic Scattering Spectroscopy (PESS) to measure differences in cellular microstructure that indicate pre-malignant or malignant growth. The technique uses low level visible light that is safe, non-ionizing, non-invasive, and painless. In Phase I, probes were developed that incorporated polarized detection. In comparison to non-polarized versions, in testing on tissue phantoms the probes were shown to strongly enhance the measurement of weak signals from a thin \"epithelial\" layer in the presence of a strong background signal from a \"sub-mucosal\" layer. In Phase II, the design of the probe system will be refined, probe production methods will be developed, and ex vivo and in vivo studies in the esophagus will be conducted. This proposal is highly symbiotic with grant C54 CA104677 awarded by the Network for Translational Research for Optical Imaging (NTROI) at the National Cancer Institute. The applicant is an industrial partner in the NTROI and is participating in activities under grant C54 CA104677.",

The approach we are promoting is to label Herceptin, a therapeutic mono-clonal antibody, with an infraredabsorbing dye, and then to detect the presence of the anitbody/dye conjugate with thermoacoustic computed tomography (TCT) using multi-spectral infrared stimulation. In Phase I we will validate a muIti-spectral decomposition technique for quantifying the presence of an infrared-absorbing dye in the presence of varying amounts of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. We will also quantify the minimum detectable concentration of dye within a 1-ml volume through a series of tissue-mimicking phantom studies.  In Phase II we will collaborate with researchers at Indiana University Medical Center to develop the molecular probe and quantify its binding to HER2 expressing cells.  We will also modify our imaging instrumentation to allow us to acquire ultrasound and thermoacoustic CT images, which will be in perfect spatjal registration. Mice will be used to validate our approach in several tumor models with the data collected and equipment developed used to build the foundation for transferring the technology to humans.

A low-cost Braille display will dramatically improve the quality of life of more than 1.3 million blind Americans. Refreshable Braille displays are the technology of choice for the blind since it provides tactile output of electronic information (e.g. e-mails, word documents, spread sheets, books, magazines, etc.). Yet current Braille displays are prohibitively expensive (e.g. $4,000 - $16,000 per display) and represent a serious accessibility barrier for blind individuals. Alternatively, Orbital Research's MEMS based Braille technology has been recognized as the enabler of the next generation and low-cost refreshable Braille displays. The uniqueness of Orbital Research's approach is in the use of MEMS technology to develop robust and low-cost microvalves which are used to modulate air pressure applied to an inflatable flexible polymer surface in order to raise and lower individual tactile dots. The goal of this Phase II program is to bring Orbital Research's MEMS microvalve Braille display technology to the next and final level toward commercialization and therefore support the completion of a multi-line refreshable Braille display system, and more specifically a portable Braille display with 4 lines of 32 Braille characters (total 128 Braille characters) for under $2,000.

It seriously impacts role functioning and typically takes a recurrent or chronic course. Because most depressed youth never receive treatment, there is a critical need to develop effective prevention programs that can be easily implemented and widely disseminated. The proposed project will complete development of an interactive multimedia (IMM) cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program for preventing clinical depression and ameliorating depressive symptomatology in young adolescents aged 12 to 15 years old. The program will be accessible via the Internet or CD-ROM. Adapted from an empirically validated intervention, the program will include six CBT weekly sessions, additional browser modules related to youth depression, and an online support system. The six CBT sessions will include: education about moods and depression; mood and activity monitoring; increasing positive thinking; scheduling and engaging pleasant activities; relating mood, activities, and thoughts; and planning for the future. The competency-based instructional design will be structured for repeat sessions using self-paced tutorials, supportive peer testimonials, and behavior modeling vignettes. Additional browser modules include depression self-screening, learning to relax, enhancing social skills, and improving communication and problem solving. The online support system will include an electronic bulletin board, personal weekly conferences with an intervention coach, and an ask-an-expert forum. The program will include four target populations: adolescent boys and girls in school/community settings and in juvenile justice settings. The basic structure of the program will be the same for each target population, but specific content will be customized to each user group. The Phase I prototype provided training on understanding depression, tracking mood and activity levels, and engaging in pleasant activities. The Phase I program was targeted to female and male youth in juvenile justice settings. Compared to an information-only control group, the results showed significant pre-post changes in knowledge, self-efficacy, and intentions to use the skills taught, with a large multivariate effect size. At one-week follow-up, youth reported significant increases for the engagement in pleasant activities over the past week. In Phase II, the scope of the program will be expanded to included additional skills training, with targeted versions for each of the four user groups. The Phase II product will be designed for use on the Internet/CD-ROM. The fully developed program will be evaluated in large a randomized trial (n = 300) on the Internet with a six-month follow-up period to compare change in depressive symptoms and incidence rates of depression between intervention and control conditions.",

The Phase I proof of concept included modules on caregiving skills, important medical/legal decisions, and finding resources, as well as initial development of the DAT. During the randomized program evaluation, users showed significant improvement in: a) self-efficacy to positively influence appraisals of stress and coping strategies, and b) behavioral intentions to adopt the strategies. Subjects found the program easy to use and gave it high satisfaction scores. Phase II development will add modules on: a) emotional/spiritual issues, b) balancing work with caregiving, c) the impact of serious illness on a care receiver, d) expectations at time of death, e) bereavement, f) a revised and expanded DAT, and f) a Personal Program Guide which will help users find contents relevant to their interests and needs. The Phase II program will also include video based skill building modules on medical advocacy and caregiver-family communication.

The common perception is that women in this age range are no longer sexually active, or are past the menopause transition, but in reality, sexual activity remains stable through mid-life and into the post-menopausal years. Additionally, physiological (e.g., perimenopause) and relationship status changes (e.g. divorce or death of a partner) put these women at increased risk for both unintended pregnancy and STI's. The proposed Phase II project will develop and evaluate a theoretically-based multimedia intervention designed to assist mid-life women in protecting themselves from sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy. The Phase I project successfully created a CD-ROM intervention for a subpopulation of African American women, providing information on pregnancy and STI prevention, partner communication and perimenopause.

Extensive formative processes will inform and shape the intervention design to increase knowledge about: 1) pregnancy risk in mid-life; 2) STI risk in mid-life; 3) strategies to prevent STIs and unintended pregnancy in mid-life and 4) influences of sexual partners on risk reduction decisions and behaviors; and 5) partner communication techniques. The final product will be created in Internet/Intranet, CD-ROM, and DVD formats. The program will be evaluated in a randomized control trial, conducted entirely on the Internet. The outcome measures will include: knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, normative expectations, self-efficacy and behavioral intentions regarding prevention of STI's and unintended pregnancy.",

Existing therapies for OCD show limited efficacy, can possess troubling side effects, and often require long-term treatment. Discovery of a new treatment for OCD would have considerable scientific and commercial value. One approach to pharmacotherapy for OCD is the development of selective 5-HT2C receptor agonists, which was the focus of our Phase One work. In Phase Two, we propose to optimize and further develop these leads through a Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) program of synthesis and biological evaluation. From this project we specifically aim to discover one or more indole analogs showing efficacy in our animal model for OCD that is comparable to approved medications. Such leads will also display favorable drug-like properties. The long term goal of this project is to discover a new, improved pharmaceutical agent for treatment of OCD that can be licensed and developed for ultimate market approval.",

To achieve this aim the chicken Origen needs the capability to insert and modify the chicken genome and to transmit these genomic modifications through the germline. Origen's platform centers around a cell based system that allows integration of large pieces of DNA and allows precise deletions in the genome. To this end Origen has identified a cell population that has the potential to enter the germline. This application focuses on transfecting this cell population with large (150 kb) constructs and to knock-out specific genes within the chicken genome.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major objective of this application is to develop clinical tests for the assessment of olfactory function which are not only sensitive and economical, but can also be administered via the World Wide Web (WWW). The tests will incorporate state-of-the-art Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) microvalves, which are small, inexpensive, discrete devices produced using techniques analogous to those used in manufacturing integrated circuits. The microvalves will form the basis of the MEMS olfactometer, a small, relatively inexpensive device capable of producing up to 64 discrete odor stimuli. Moreover, the MEMS olfactometer will have the capacity for generating the stimuli for a large number of trials (>100), and will be able to replenish this capability by replacing inexpensive odor cartridges. The tests selected for development are: 1) an odor identification test; and 2) a detection threshold test. The tests will be called the OLFACT (Olfactory Function Assessment by Computerized Testing) and OLFACT-RL, respectively. A single MEMS olfactometer can generate the stimuli for both tests. Additional tests, e.g., discrimination and odor memory tests, will be developed in the future, employing the same olfactometer. The presentation of the test items, along with scoring of the test and recording of all pertinent data, will be totally computerized. To facilitate the design and programming of the tests, stand-alone versions, i.e., controlled by a local computer, will be constructed first. Once this has been accomplished, standardized norms for the tests will be developed and compared with norms already available for other commercial tests. Finally, the tests will be enhanced to run on the WWW as Web applications. Once a MEMS olfactometer has been purchased and connected to a computer, all transactions, including the purchase (authorization) of tests as well as payment, can then be conducted over the WWW. The development of the OLFACT tests will provide the clinician/researcher with tests that are more economical than current tests, while offering far greater utility.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Ischemia/hypoxia is a significant contributor to neurodegeneration. A typical case is ischemic stroke. Currently, more than 4 million people in the U.S are living with the consequences of stroke. Stroke has become the third leading cause of death in this country, a major cause of long-term disability, and a significant burden on public health worldwide. The clinical significance of cerebral ischemia is compounded by the lack of effective neuroprotective treatments that directly inhibit ischemic neuronal death. Therefore development of novel neuroprotectants is a top priority for the prevention and treatment of ischemic diseases. In phase I of this work we identified a novel class of neuroprotective compounds, the the alpha(N)- heterocyclic carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazones (HCTs), including PAN-811. Panacea Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has licensed the used of this compound and maintains intellectual property rights for its use in neuroprotective therapy. PAN-811 fully blocks hypoxic and ischemic neuronal cell death at a dose of 1 uM in vitro, and reduces infarct volume by up to 59% in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) rat model of stroke. It manifests dual mechanistic functions including both Ca2+ -chelation and free radical-scavenging. Our goal is the development of PAN-811 as a clinically available neuroprotective drug, thus, this phase II grant proposal is aimed at the completion of the requisite preclinical studies. A further pharmacologic study of PAN-811 focusing on its neuroprotective mechanism in reference to necrotic and/or apoptotic cell death is proposed. We will also extend our studies with the MCAo model to optimize the route of administration, compare bolus delivery with infusion, further study dosing effects, and determine the window of therapeutic opportunity. Outcomes will initially be measured by evaluating total infarct volume but will include behavioral testing after more complete establishment of these parameters. PAN-811 is currently in phase II clinical trials for another indication, cancer, by Vion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. As such, much is already known about the human toxicology and pharmacokinetics of PAN-811. If the administration route changes to gain maximum efficacy, the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of PAN-811 will be re-evaluated prior to clinical trial. At the end of the phase II period, we expect to submit an IND application to the FDA to use PAN-811 for the treatment of transient ischemic stroke and initiate phase Ib clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this application is to perform necessary studies in preparation for conducting clinical trials in cancer of an immunoadhesin that neutralizes hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Previously, a Met-Fc immunoadhesion was developed that inhibits the ability HGF to bind to its receptor Met, to induce proliferation of normal and cancer cells, and to induce angiogenesis. Moreover, Met-Fc inhibits growth of a glioma tumor cell line in a mouse xenograft model. The current goal is to conduct additional in vivo studies of Met-Fc in mouse cancer models as well as evaluate potential toxicities, pharmacokinetics, and in vivo tumor localization of Met-Fc. The information gained will pave the way to clinical trials and identify the most promising types of cancer to treat with Met-Fc. The first aim is to produce sufficient Met-Fc protein for preclinical in vivo studies. This material can be made in a Wave Bioreactor, but other methods for more efficient production will be explored, including development of a smaller version of Met-Fc and use of a fungal expression system. The second aim is to demonstrate that Met-Fc inhibits in vivo growth of tumor cells that both secrete HGF and express Met (HGF+/Met+) by using xenograft models in mice. Glioma tumors will also be tested in an intracranial mouse model to show that Met-Fc can cross the blood-brain barrier. The third aim is to demonstrate that Met-Fc inhibits in vivo growth of tumor cells that express Met but do not secrete HGF (HGF-/Met+), which may therefore utilize HGF secreted by stromal cells in a paracrine manner. Such tumors will be tested by co- injecting them into mice together with human MRC-5 fibroblast cells to provide a source of human HGF. The fourth aim is to demonstrate that Met-Fc inhibits tumor metastasis, which will be done by determining whether luciferase-labeled tumor cells from xenografted tumors migrate to other organs in mice treated with Met-Fc or control. The fifth aim is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, tumor localization and possible toxic effects of Met-Fc in mice. Despite recent scientific advances, cancer remains a major medical problem, and brain tumors are a particularly deadly form of cancer. The objective of this program is develop an immunoadhesion (fusion protein) suitable for testing in human patients, which will have the potential to be an effective drug for the treatment of various cancers including glioma brain tumors.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is an urgent need, worldwide, for improved contraceptives, especially prophylactic contraceptives. Barrier methods are the only class of contraceptives that protects users against sexually transmitted diseases. However, currently available spermicidal contraceptives suffer from poor efficacy and/or have undesirable toxicity. In a systematic effort to identify non-toxic spermicides potentially capable of performing better and without the drawbacks of detergent-type spermicides, we have rationally designed and synthesized several disubstituted metallocene derivatives. We discovered bis-cyclopentadienyl complexes of vanadium(IV) or vanadocenes to have rapid, potent, and selective spermicidal activity. Under Phase I funding, we demonstrated: (i) in vivo contraceptive activity of VDDTC via a gel-microemulsion in rabbits and porcine models; (ii) confirmed the lack of mucosal inflammatory potential of VDDTC in mice, rabbits, and pigs; (iii) developed a physiologically relevant and sensitive porcine model for vaginal irritation; and (iv) discovered that VDDTC significantly enhanced the microbicide efficacy of the antiretroviral spermicide WHI- 07 in the feline immunodeficiency virus/cat model of AIDS. Under SBIR Phase II support, we will expand the utility of the porcine and rabbit models to test the in vivo contraceptive efficacy, mucosal safety as well as developmental toxicity studies of VDDTC. We will perform these efficacy and safety studies of VDDTC in combination with WHI-07. We hypothesize that the combination of these two active agents with different mechanisms of action will potentially improve efficacy and duration of dual-protection when compared with VDDTC alone while maintaining an adequate safety profile. The goals of Phase II study are (i) to expand the utility of porcine model for the in vivo contraceptive efficacy of VDDTC versus VDDTC plus WHI-07 gel microemulsion; (ii) to expand the utility of porcine vaginal irritation model for the preclinical evaluation of VDDTC and VDDTC plus WHI-07 by characterizing the extracellular, cellular, molecular and histological endpoints; and (iii) to assess the developmental toxicity potential of VDDTC in rabbits. The proposed Phase II work will complement and enhance the discovery and preclinical development of safe and effective prophylactic contraceptives at Paradigm Pharmaceuticals that may provide the basis for a new strategy to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV while providing fertility control for women.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central hypothesis of the Phase I effort was that if a material could be synthesized that could emit millions of unique, resolvable optical signatures, and biomolecules such as DNA could be firmly attached to them, that this deeply multiplexed bead set could form the basis of a \"suspension array\" where the optical designator of each encoded particle uniquely identifies a given bead. Once each bead is identifiable via its optical code, then highly parallel reactions, like hybridization of millions of samples at once, become possible. The hexanary emitter Y1-x[DyaErbEucHodSmeTmf]xVO4, which has six narrow emission peaks in the 450-700nm range, displays millions of unique optical signatures based on the relative integrated intensities of the six emitters when the YVO4 host is excited at 325nm (He-Cd laser). The statistical analysis of a large number of samples showed that ~2 x 109 unique optical codes could be resolved, because one of the six emitters is \"sacrificed\" as an internal standard allowing very accurate and precise ratiometric measurements to be performed. Experiments have shown that cy3-labeled DNA could be firmly attached to either encoded Controlled Pore Glass (CPG) or pure YVO4 and the signals from the organic hybridization dye reporters and the inorganic optical code can be read independently from one another within a single particle. The Phase II effort will produce the optically encoded materials in a new super high throughput bead fabrication method based on thermal wax transfer printing where it is estimated that 5-50 million encoded particles per hour can be produced. After appropriate derivitization and attachment of DNA or proteins to the beads, a variety of hybridization and protein binding experiments will be performed en masse in a flask. Subsequent decoding using Parallel's hyperspectral imaging system, after placement of the encoded particles onto a special substrate which prevents overlap of the particles, will produce a visible emission spectrum from each pixel in the acquired image providing a very high throughput means of spatially measuring the multicolor emission. The accuracy, throughput and cost estimated for this technology indicate that it could be very competitive with the current high density chip-based assays for genotyping and gene expression.     The technology under development will allow a unique optical code to be attached to biomolecules thereby allowing them to be analyzed millions at time. The accurate optical analysis of very large numbers of small samples in parallel will reduce the cost, and increase the number of samples that can be examined, for many types of medical samples.",

The general approach to be followed in the continued evaluation of 552-02 during the early phases of clinical development will focus on evaluating the safety and potential efficacy of the investigational agent when administered as an inhalation aerosol to normal healthy adult volunteers, and to adolescents and adults with the symptoms of mild to moderate cystic fibrosis (CF). In this Phase 1 portion of a Fast Track application, we propose to conduct Study 552-102, a study of the effect of inhalation of 552-02 on mucociliary clearance in healthy volunteers. As a continuation of the clinical development of 552-02, three clinical studies are proposed in Phase II of this Fast Track application. These three studies are Study 552-201, a single-dose safety and pharmacokinetic study in CF patients; Study 552-202, a single-dose study of the mucociliary clearance of 552-02 in CF patients; and Study 552-103, a study of repeated administration of 552-02 over 7 days in healthy volunteers. We will interpret data concerning the effect of treatment with a single dose of 552-02 on mucociliary clearance rates as a surrogate marker of efficacy in CF. Identification of a safe dose that stimulates mucociliary clearance (measured over the 0- to 2-hour interval following treatment) will validate our research approach and will provide the rationale for performing a second series of clearance studies in patients with CF. Demonstration of a durable effect of 552-02 on mucociliary clearance will provide the rationale for further clinical studies evaluating the safety profile of the investigational agent over a 28-day period in the target population. In Phase I of this Fast Track application, we propose to examine the effect of 552-02 administered via inhalation on mucociliary clearance in healthy volunteers. The specific aims for this Phase I proposal are as follows:   Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of 552-02 when given as a single aerosolized dose in healthy adult volunteers.   Specific Aim 2: Assess the effect of treatment of 552-02 on mucociliary clearance rates when given as a single aerosolized dose in healthy adult volunteers. The proposed clinical study is a key component of the overall development program for 552-02. Results of this study will provide the basis for conducting further clinical studies in healthy volunteers and CF patients proposed in the Phase II portion of this Fast Track application. Ultimately, our goal is the full clinical development of 552-02 as a first line therapy for patients suffering from CF airways disease",

In this proposal we propose to create an open architecture/closed source system for image-guide procedures. Such a system would allow organizations, technology companies and other more agile innovators to prototype new systems without having to expend considerable effort outside of their expertise.

DPOAE measurements have been shown to be an effective and efficient method for screening infant, child, and adult hearing. Environmental noise, however, can adversely affect the ability to successfully obtain DPOAE measurements. We are working to achieve our aim by developing a narrow-band, adaptive active noise reduction system that seamlessly augments existing DPOAE measurement protocols. Our innovation will supplement existing DPOAE measurement systems with both low-cost acoustic hardware and advanced signal processing techniques. By reducing background noise levels in a narrow frequency band near the DPOAE test frequencies, we enable higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) DPOAE measurements. The increased SNR results in the ability to obtain DPOAE measurements in relatively high noise environments such as the newborn intensive care unit and nursery, offices of pediatricians, field hospitals, and remote or mobile clinics. Our Phase I results clearly demonstrated our innovation.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aim of this project is to develop and demonstrate a low-cost, liquid oxygen (LOX) generation system to support ambulatory patients using Home Oxygen Therapy (HOT). Currently in the United States, yearly expenditures on HOT are nearly two billion dollars. These expenditures will increase dramatically over the next ten years due to the aging baby-boomer generation. The increase in use of LOX- based HOT systems is expected to continue due to demographics, patient and clinician preferences, and the general success of HOT as a treatment regimen. The primary drawback of LOX-based systems is the high-operational cost, because the storage reservoir for these systems must be frequently refilled with LOX. Creare's innovation is a Miniaturized LOX Generation System (MLGS). This novel device is a small, low-power, low-cost system that generates liquid oxygen from atmospheric air. The basis of the innovation is the miniaturization of the liquid oxygen systems we have developed for the military and NASA. Our novel system will directly refill the portable LOX unit, eliminating the need for the storage reservoir and the LOX re-supply infrastructure. Thus, our innovation will substantially reduce the cost of LOX-based HOT, while improving convenience, safety, and compliance. During Phase I, we clearly demonstrated the feasibility of our innovation and exceeded our technical objectives by designing, demonstrating, and optimizing a highly compact proof-of-concept system for the production of high-purity (>99%) LOX in excess of the original design flow rate. We also completed the preliminary design of a prototype that will be used for the refilling of a commercially available portable LOX unit. We have reached an agreement with a leading supplier of LOX- based HOT systems for the sales and marketing of our innovation. During Phase II, we will design, fabricate, and test the MLGS prototype and transition our innovation to our partner for commercialization.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become the gold standard for the quantitative assessment of cardiac structure and function. The key to imaging the moving myocardium is a reliable and robust electrocardiogram signal which, used as a \"trigger,\" can provide images at specified phases throughout the cardiac cycle. Stronger field strength magnets, greater magnetic gradient slew rates, and an ever increasing number of magnetic gradient pulse sequences such as those that provide cardiac perfusion have significantly increased the difficulties of triggering. In addition, individuals with sick hearts may have abnormal ECGs. The focus of this Phase II project is to research, develop and clinically evaluate our innovative real-time, reliable and robust system for ECG triggering during cardiac MR imaging. The project has four specific aims. The first three, aimed at developing an effective MR ECG triggering system, are: 1) to optimize the Phase I prototype MRI ECG data acquisition, fiberoptic transmission system; 2) to optimize, evaluate and test our adaptive noise cancellation methods to remove the RF and magnetic gradient artifacts that overwhelm ECG detection, and 3) to develop a \"real-time\" embedded computer ECG trigger system and integrate it into a cardiovascular MR imaging system. Our last specific aim is to clinically analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of our MRI ECG trigger system. Our preliminary results illustrate the effectiveness of our methods in reliably detecting the ECG during MR imaging. Our methods include generating a novel optimal ECG vector for detection, and applying effective adaptive noise cancellation methods to extract the ECG R-wave from RF and gradient artifacts. Additional preliminary data demonstrates the capability of our optical telemetry system to transmit the ECG from the magnet and mitigate against the MR artifacts which corrupt the ECG signal. During Phase II, we will evaluate the performance of our triggering system using normal human subjects and a recorded data base of ECG arrhythmias and other defects.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary The purpose of this project is to further develop and evaluate an interactive multimedia program designed to provide young women with training and practice in negotiating sexual interactions. This product presents users with simulated scenarios of sexual interactions in a comic strip format and allows the user to make choices to determine the outcomes of the scenarios. For Phase I, we conducted qualitative interviews (n = 18) with young women between the ages of 18 and 24 to explore the common sexual situations experienced by these women. We then developed the fully functional program and built one scenario. The content for this scenario was developed based on constructs from cognitive theories applied to HIV prevention as well as the qualitative interviews. We assessed the usability and feasibility of the prototype in a small trial (n = 53). The response to the program was very positive and we met all usability and feasibility criteria. Specific aims for this Phase II project are as follows: 1) Expand and further develop the SafeSexGirl prototype based on Phase I results; 2) Collaborate on design and content with a group of HIV prevention experts; 3) Develop the full program: \"SafeSexGirl: Version for Women ages 18-24\" which will include four scenarios and four main user-characters as well as additional features; 4) Perform iterative program testing and debugging of the program; 5) Recruit 300 women ages 18-24 to conduct a randomized control trial to compare outcomes between a treatment group and a comparison group; Relevance- Young women are at increasing risk of contracting the HIV virus due to their physiological makeup as well as their lack of knowledge and skills regarding initiating and negotiating safer sex practices. This product will be designed to provide the knowledge and skills for young women to safely and effectively negotiate their sexual interactions to reduce their risk of HIV/STD transmission as well as unintended pregnancies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PharmaSeq provides ultra-small micro transponders and a fluidics-based, bench-top flow reader as tools to perform complex bioassays. A micro transponder is an integrated circuit with an electronically stored ID (64 bits) and the capability to transmit the ID by radio frequency. Each chip is composed of photocells, electronic memory and antenna. In its memory, the chip stores information that identifies the sequence of the genetic material attached to the chip. The transmission of information occurs upon illumination by laser light, which powers the chip. PharmaSeq developed two versions of micro transponders, namely 500x500 and 250x250 microns in size. The assay involves three phases: conjugation or synthesis of probe molecules on the micro transponder surface, reaction with target molecules labeled with a fluorescent dye, and readout of the micro transponders by a flow reader. The flow reader has two functions: to read each micro transponder's ID and to measure fluorescence from the reporter molecules bound on the micro transponder's surface. The fluidics system directs micro transponders one-by-one to the flow chamber, where the chips are illuminated by light, the micro transponder ID read, and fluorescence measured. The main goal of the present project is to build a two-color instrument for reading micro transponders to permit quantitative bioassays. The instrument will be capable of simultaneously reading fluorescence from micro transponders at two wavelengths, 570 nm (Cy3 dye) and 670 nm (Cy5 dye). The project will involve significant changes to the existing instrument, in particular, addition of a automated sample loader, redesign of the optical system, as well as a rewrite of the instrument and data analysis software. The major benefit is to provide a reference and to provide accurate comparison between two samples. The instrument will enable, in particular, a two-color expression profiling experiments as well as many other types of assays currently done on micro arrays or flow hyetometers. The flow reader can be used for diagnostics in vitro and drug discovery projects.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are an increasing number of protein drugs in the pipeline, whose cost of production is very high compared to synthetic, small molecule drugs. Further, a number of protein drugs are coming off patent in the next few years, which will create an opening for a market for generic version of these drugs, if they can be produced at significantly lower cost and demonstrate bioequivalence. The Phase I results clearly indicated that a powerful and commercially important application of the deltaPhase System is in the recombinant production of proteins, some of which are difficult to express at high levels as soluble proteins. Motivated by the increasing importance of recombinant protein drugs, and the clear need for low-cost expression and easy purification of proteins, the goal of the Phase II research will be to advance the technology for the expression and purification of recombinant proteins that will be eligible for biogenerics within the next three years, with high expression and at high purity levels. The enabling technology that will allow Phase Bioscience to achieve this objective is the deltaPhaseTM System, a novel platform technology for high-level expression and simple, non-chromatographic purification using a class of polypeptide tags, termed elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs). The fundamental basis of this technology is the discovery that proteins and peptides fused to an ELP retain the environmentally triggered (temperature, salt) soluble-insoluble phase transition behavior of ELPs, and that this reversible phase transition can be carried out in cell lysate to separate ELP fusions from other cellular proteins to homogeneity by a few phase transition cycles. The impact of the technology will be to provide the protein industry with the ability to produce proteins, especially biogeneric proteins, at significantly lower cost by removing chromatography from the purification process. This will make these drugs more competitive with small molecule drugs, and reduce the cost of drugs to patients. The Specific Aims of the project include: 1. Express six pharmaceutically-relevant, biogeneric candidate recombinant fusion proteins in E. coli and CHO; 2. Purify the proteins to at least 90% purity, as measured by LC-MS; and 3. Demonstrate their bioactivity compared to the commercially produced proteins.",

        "abstract": "Segmented germanium detector arrays are needed by the DOE for the characterization of low-level radioactive samples.  In addition, the same detector arrays could perform important fundamental physics measurements, including the search for rare-events like neutrinoless double-beta decay.  However, because of their complexity, these segmented coaxial detectors are expensive and available only after relatively long lead times.  Improved fabrication techniques would greatly reduce costs and improve the availability of these segmented detectors for the low-level counting community.  Therefore, this project will experimentally investigate alternative techniques for making segmented contacts on p-type coaxial germanium detectors, which would be a much cheaper alternative to the segmented n-type coaxial detectors currently proposed.  However, the difficulties associated with the segmentation of conventional thick lithium-diffused contacts must be addressed.  Phase I experimentally evaluated detector fabrication techniques appropriate for segmented p-\u00c2\u00adtype coaxial detectors, and a fabrication recipe was established.  In Phase II, the viability of alternative segmented detector contacts, as a competitive solution to the contacts established during Phase I, will be established.  The best overall technique will be used to fabricate a large segmented p-\u00c2\u00adtype coaxial detector as a demonstration.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new germanium detector technology should provide better detector performance at lower cost for the measurement of low-activity radioactive sources.  Applications of interest include national security (nuclear nonproliferation, nuclear explosion monitoring), areas of scientific importance (e.g., new levels of sensitivity in the Majorana search for neutrinoless double\u00c2\u00adbeta decay), medical imaging, and x-ray detection",

        "abstract": "Concerns about the high cost of energy, dwindling natural resources, and environmental pollution are pressuring the country to explore energy production technologies that offer greater efficiency and cleanliness.  Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) systems are one such technology.  In order to operate SOFC systems at their best efficiency, the anode fuel mixture require recirculation.  In turn, a hot anode recycle blower will be needed.  However, the extreme temperature of the anode gas (850C) necessitates a very unusual blower.  Additionally, the cost of this blower must be low enough to not appreciably increase the cost of the overall system.  This project will develop a low-cost, high-temperature recycle blower for SOFC systems.  In Phase I, a pumping concept was designed, built, and demonstrated at nearly 600C..  Test station inadequacies prevented testing at full temperature, but the results indicated that the design should be adequate for the desired temperature.  In Phase II, the pump\u00c2\u00bfs thermal management technology will be demonstrated at full temperature.  For cost reduction, the design will be modified to include the use of a high-volume low-cost motor and controller, and a reduced-size pump head.  For performance improvement, the regenerative pump head will be adjusted to use improved aerodynamics.  Finally, the cost-reduced version of the pump will be demonstrated for 5000 hours.

Agitation, sadness, depression, anxiety, isolation, discomfort, confusion, and other negative factors impose diminished quality of life for AD patients and significant burden for caregivers. Our project goals are: (1) to enhance the quality of life of AD patients and their families/caregivers with the new TOM-VC intervention (Therapeutic Old Memories-Video Channels) based on the novel LifeZig system; (2) to develop the easy-to-use self-contained LifeZig system, allowing family/caregivers to create/display personalized video channels with old photographs of AD patients, music, and narration; as a reminiscence therapy for Alzheimer's. Our innovative TOM-VC therapy uses preserved memory clusters from AD patients and novel technology application to create a personalized environment with pleasant moments. Reminiscence therapeutic multimedia is presented to patients via individualized video channels on television, rich in positive emotions, based upon important lifetime events, family, and other cherished memories. Phase I demonstrated the feasibility: LifeZig was considered easy-to-use by families/caregivers, who reported AD patients' improved well-being and reduced agitation. AD patients also showed a significant level of pleasure and interest (strong indicators of enhanced quality of life). In Phase II, we will finalize LifeZig and perform a randomized longitudinal study to assess the therapy effectiveness (control groups: placebo video channels and usual care). Measures: [quality of life]: Observed Emotion Rating Scale, Multidimensional Observation Scale for Elderly Subjects, and NPI; [cognitive and functional]: Mini-Mental State Exam, ADL, and IADL; and [burden]: NPI, Caregiver Burden Scale, and Revised Memory & Behavior Problems Checklist. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: LifeZig products will provide a rich individualized therapy to improve the well-being of a growing number of AD patients, and decrease the caregiver burden, which is expected to lower the cost of care by delaying institutionalization and increasing nursing staff retention. Relevance: The Lifezig system and TOM-VC intervention will provide new activities and therapy tools for Alzheimer's, bringing benefits to two growing populations (AD patients and caregivers), by significantly enhancing AD patient's quality of life, and decreasing caregiver's burden of care.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research supports the development and commercialization of a more effective low temperature gas plasma sterilizer (GPS). The GPS represents a true gas plasma technology with the ability to sterilize critical medical devices without the toxicities associated with surface residuals or atmospheric emissions. This sterilization method can provide a faster, more reliable, more economical sterilizer for in-hospital use and broaden the sterilization options available to the medical devices industry. The GPS will positively impact healthcare providers, healthcare consumers, and medical device manufacturers. The GPS will reduce the device turnaround time for reprocessing centers, enabling tighter scheduling of procedures, reduction of device inventories and potentially reduce the morbidity and mortality from nosocomial infections. This GPS will provide medical device manufacturers greater flexibility in device design, allowing more use of heat and moisture sensitive materials, less restrictive device configurations, and reduce their dependence on off-site sterilization providers. Sterilization of critical medical devices, such as surgical instruments, biopsy forceps, cardiac and urinary catheters, implants and needles, is a major issue of responsibility and liability for health care institutions. Sterilization processes help assure prevention of patient morbidity and mortality. Increased use of internal probes such as endoscopes and bronchoscopes is broadening the need for effective in-hospital sterilization methods. Critical medical devices that are heat and moisture sensitive require low temperature sterilization. Unlike currently available low temperature gas plasma sterilizers, the Plasmedix GPS system relies mainly on the discharge plasma field, rather than chemical vapor (i.e. H2O2), for sterilization activity. This significant advancement is the result of a more effective means of generating the plasma field, which is patented by Phygen. To function the GPS requires only a standard AC receptacle and several milliliters of peroxide. Building on the successes of Phase I research, Phase II goals will include identifying and developing features necessary for a commercially viable GPS, continuing with sterilization studies comparing the GPS to currently available sterilization/disinfection methods, and building, validating and evaluating three new production equivalent GPS prototypes in preparation for hospital evaluation and FDA approval. The research design and methods for achieving these goals will include: 1) establishing clear user requirements and specifications, 2) designing a larger capacity GPS that provides thorough plasma and hydrogen peroxide distribution, 3) assuring effective sterilization in accordance with AAMI, ISO and FDA guidelines; and, 4) validating that medical instruments sterilized are safe for use. Appropriate statistical techniques consistent with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) will be used to verify and validate all test methods. This innovative and flexible Plaxmedix sterilization technology has been recognized by the Department of Defense as being an acceptable replacement for steam sterilization in field and base hospitals. Phygen has been awarded a contract by the US Army to develop and produce transportable sterilization devices.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This SBIR aims to develop a quantitative in vivo zebrafish hair cell assay that can be used to identify potential otoprotective agents. Zebrafish is a useful animal model for identifying otoprotectants since neuromast hair cells, which are located in stereotypical positions in the head and trunk region, are structurally and functionally similar to the inner ear hair cells in mammals. Human hair cells can be damaged by infection, aging, genetic disease, noise or treatment with drugs, including anti-cancer drugs and antibiotics. Drug-induced ototoxicity can ultimately lead to sensory hair cell death, causing hearing loss and vestibular disorders. Although hearing aids are useful for some patients with hearing loss, there is no effective therapy. Current therapeutic strategies include application of growth factors and other agents to promote cell survival, and systemic application of drugs to prevent activation of programmed cell death. The proposed zebrafish assay will facilitate development of protective treatments to minimize ototoxic side effects and increase the clinical utility of current medications. Hearing loss from ototoxic therapies, aging, environmental and genetic factors, represents a significant market with unmet medical needs. In the United States, the market for hearing loss is currently at $30 billion and is expected to increase rapidly in the next several decades.",

The proposed microchannel \u00c2\u00bflobster eye\u00c2\u00bf lens will focus neutrons into an approximately 0.1 millimeter spot, with much greater efficiency than conventional neutron lenses.  In Phase I, the lens design was optimized, based on a lobster eye assembly of flat metal-plated silicon wafers; a functional lens prototype was fabricated; and proof-of-concept was demonstrated by focusing hard x-rays (30 kiloelectronvolt peak) to a less than 1 millimeter focal spot.

This project will design and demonstrate a new sensor for high precision measurement of ambient CO2.  The sensor will combine advances in diode laser technology with cavity enhanced absorption methods, resulting in a measurement precision on the order of 1 in 3000.

        "abstract": "Battery packs for hybrid electric vehicles need to be low cost and have a 15-year lifetime.  However, the cycle life of lithium-ions cells, which are configured in series, is reduced by the overcharging of individual cells.  The current method of overcharge control, which uses external control circuitry, has a gravimetric and cost burden, and is ineffective at eliminating all of the cell damage during overcharge.  This project addresses the overcharging issue by developing an alternative separator that becomes temporarily conductive when a cell reaches an over-voltage condition, shunting electrons between the electrodes.  This separator/shunt will keep the cell voltage below the value at which deleterious reactions occur.  When the charging current is no longer applied to the cell at higher voltages, the separator will switch to an insulator and allows normal battery operation.  The process will be fully reversible and will not limit the number of charging cycles that can be applied to the cell.  In Phase I, the fabricated separator demonstrated the technical feasibility for controlling overcharge.  At over-voltage conditions (> 3.9V), the electroactive polymer separator functioned as a current shunt at current densities up to 10 mA/cm2.  At cell operating voltages, the separator performed as an ion shuttle as the cell charged and discharged, maintaining cell capacity at typical C-rates.  In Phase II, the polymer blend components that make up the separator will be modified to enable 10 mA/cm2 current on overcharge and to allow performance as a typical separator with a fully charged open circuit voltage of 4.2 volts.  The selected polymer blend will be scaled-up via film production on continuous process, solvent casting equipment.  Experimental and control separators will be tested in 240 mAh pouch cells for overcharge and cycle life.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new separator technology should be appropriate for lithium ion battery stacks that require greater cycle life than what is available currently.  The electroactive separator is a cost-effective and gravimetrically-effective means of protecting the electrodes locally for improved cycle life.  In addition to the HEV and electric vehicle markets for this separator, other potential consumer applications include laptop computer batteries.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The zebrafish, Danio rerio, has become widely accepted as a useful model for vertebrate development. There is strong interest in developing zebrafish as a model organism for use in high throughput drug discovery assays. Thus far, true high throughput screening in zebrafish has been limited to embryos and very early larvae. This is because many of the organs that are most interesting to researchers are best viewed from the side of the animal. Once the swim bladder inflates and the larvae generally float upright it is difficult to generate a clear image of the side of the animal. This is especially true in multiwell microplate format. Efforts to resolve this important problem have centered on use of confocal imaging techniques or powerful image deconvolution software to assemble 3-D reconstructions of the animal. These efforts have not achieved the desired spatial resolution and typically require 1 to 2 minutes to image a single well. Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) has invented a novel technology that will be adaptable to standard image analysis systems that are already in use in drug discovery laboratories. PSI's technology will allow researchers to generate clear side-views of older zebrafish larvae in microwell arrays. The technology does not require confocal microscopy techniques or sophisticated image deconvolution algorithms and will therefore generate quality images in seconds per well versus minutes per well for those other techniques. In Phase I we used the Z-Lipotrack assay under development at Zygogen Corp to demonstrate the feasibility of our technology. The Lipotrack assay was chosen because it is typically performed on older larvae and requires collection of images of the gall bladder and intestine. In Phase II we will further develop PSI's innovative imaging technology and integrate that technology into a fully integrated, automated discovery system for zebrafish larvae. PSI's technology will enable high throughput discovery using the Z-Lipotrack assay of bioactive compounds that reduce cholesterol and lipid levels. Those drugs meet an important health care need. Relevance to public health: This research will develop technologies that will enable the use of zebrafish models of human disease in high-throughput screens for active pharmaceutical compounds. The specific assay under development is expected to accelerate discovery of cholesterol-lowering drugs. We anticipate that assays utilizing the imaging technology will also accelerate discovery of new Pharmaceuticals to treat a broad range of human illness such as cardiovascular disease and acute renal failure.",

        "abstract": "Lasers based on quantum cascade (QC) gain media represent a powerful new tool for optical detection in the infrared spectral region, needed to help detect the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  They have been demonstrated to be reliable, compact, efficient, bright sources of spectrally narrow radiation in midwave-, longwave-, and far-infrared.  The ultimate utility of QC lasers, however, will be greatly enhanced if their tuning range can be increased.  In this project, the quantum cascade gain medium will be incorporated into an external optical cavity, in order to increase the tuning range by over an order of magnitude.  In addition to designing the external optical cavity, the quantum cascade medium will be modified to suppress the intrinsic optical cavity formed by its front and back facets.  Phase I demonstrated that continuous-mode/hop-free tuning, with both cryogenic and room temperature quantum cascade lasers operating near 8 microns, could be achieved when the lasers were built into an external optical cavity.  In order to reduce the facet reflectance, a number of approaches \u00c2\u00bf including horizontal angling, vertical angling, and anti-reflection (AR) coating \u00c2\u00bf were evaluated.  The room temperature, anti-reflection coated laser performed best, tuning stably and consistently in a single external cavity longitudinal mode for more than 78 nanometers.  In Phase II, a commercial, prototype, external-cavity quantum cascade laser system, emitting in the 8 to 14 micron spectral region, will be developed.  This external cavity system will have a tuning range over 350 nm, which would be more that an order of magnitude greater than its inherent tuning range.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The broadly-tunable, longwave-infrared, external-cavity quantum cascade laser should meet an unfilled need for narrow linewidth spectroscopic systems in the 8 to 14 micron spectral region.  Such systems should find use in the high-precision spectroscopy of gas molecules related to national defense, homeland security, treaty verification, and industrial safety.

It has enabled researchers to assess human energy requirements in health and in disease, to study the etiology of obesity, and to validate tools for the assessment of dietary intake. Picarro proposes to develop novel instruments that will measure oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios in water with high precision by cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS). Currently DLW analysis is performed by only 3 or 4 laboratories in the US, and DLW researchers must send their samples to one of these facilities for analysis. As compared with existing mass spectrometry techniques, the proposed instruments will reduce the cost and difficulty of DLW studies, thus enabling many researchers to perform DLW analysis in their own laboratories. They will be able to perform more research, more quickly, conveniently, and at lower cost. In addition, a field-ready instrument not requiring extensive sample preparation would greatly extend the application's reach of energy expenditure methodology.

The system will be designed both for clinical and non-clinical settings, including home-based monitoring, ambulatory follow-up, First Aid in emergency and mass casualty situations. For all these settings, a system that provides a real-time, on-the-scene ECG examination, analysis, and wireless transmission is urgently needed. Analysis of ECG changes in existing devices is limited, so that only a few parameters are compared to normal values or to the previous ECG recording. The completed system (Phase I and II) will include: 1) complete, in-depth analysis of ECG changes over time, 2) detection of subtle abnormalities that are hard to identify by visual inspection, 3) individually tailored analysis, 4) fast and efficient wireless communication between individual patient recorders, central computers, and health-care providers, 5) optimized collection, storage, and retrieval of serial data, and 6) comprehensive presentation of analyzed data to the health-care provider and appropriate feedback to the patient.         During Phase I, we have developed an Alpha prototype system and demonstrated its feasibility in the laboratory and clinical settings. The system has been enthusiastically received by cardiologists and spurred a strong interest from the device industry leaders. PELEX is the first all-in-one miniature (2x1x0.3 inch) wireless system that allows virtually any type of ECG testing, including gold-standard 12-lead ECG recording, stress-testing, 3/12 lead telemetry, ambulatory (Holter), event, and loop monitoring. PELEX has automatic bidirectional communication with central computer server, which performs complete analysis of ECG waveforms and an automatic, remote adjustment (individual tailoring) of monitored parameters.         In Phase II, we will refine and further improve the system to develop a Beta-prototype and conduct a larger-scale clinical trial both in a hospital and ambulatory setting to validate its performance against the best currently available systems and to receive feedback from medical professionals and patients. Safety and regulatory testing will be completed, and a 51O K application will be submitted to the FDA.",

Specific aims of this proposal include: complete development and testing of 180 urn-diameter glutamate biosensors for low oxygen environments and 76 um-diameter for normal oxygen environments and manufacture for sale; develop and test a 76 um-diameter, low pO2 glutamate biosensor; develop a software-configurable, 2-channel, head-mounted, wireless potentiostat that can perform the simultaneous measurement of oxygen and glutamate under ischemic conditions, in freely moving rats; introduce automation at key points in the manufacturing process and investigate electrodeposition techniques to increase sensor manufacturing yield and facilitate the development of smaller sensors. To reach these objectives Pinnacle Technology and the University of Kansas are building on past successes in the design of glutamate biosensors and wireless potentiostats for rats. These products were developed in separate collaborations and are currently being commercialized. Products to be introduced as a result of this Phase II proposal include a 76 urn glutamate biosensor and 180 urn glutamate biosensor for use under ischemic conditions, a 76 um glutamate sensor for use under normal pO2 conditions, and the wireless potentiostat system. Commercial applications include stroke research, disease research and drug discovery. Technological innovations include biosensor, and biosensor membrane design, turnkey head mount design, and advanced electronics design. Each year about 700,000 people in the United States have a stroke, over 80 percent of which are ischemic. An excess of glutamate is believed to be responsible for much of the damage done to brain cells during cerebral ischemia events (stroke), but the interdependent physiological processes surrounding glutamate release/transport/uptake during ischemia are poorly understood. In order to study these events, a new system needed to be developed which would measure glutamate under the ischemic, low oxygen conditions",

We aim to be the manufacturer of an antibody or antibody mixture, derived form transgenic plants; that win effectively neutralize botulinum toxin and will supplant the current antitoxin, which is available only in limited supply. We believe that transgenic plants offer the best system for producing high-quality antitoxin at the lowest possible cost. Botulinum toxins (BoNT) are extremely potent neurotoxins produced by anaerobic bacteria of the genus Clostridium. Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) is the deadliest biological substance known, with an LD50 between 1-5 ng/kg. Due to their potency and ease of production using unsophisticated techniques, BoNTs have been intentionally produced for use as biological warfare agents and weapons of terror. In Phase I we produced three high-affinity humanized plantibodies against botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) using transgenic tobacco plants and showed that they are physically very similar to their CHO-cell produced counterparts, that they bind to BoNT/A with similar affinity, and that they protect mice from thousands of LD50s of BoNT/A. We have five aims for Phase II: 1. Produce, in transgenic tobacco, three anti-botox IgG plantibodies with modified Fc sequences to enhance binding to Fc receptors; 2. Examine efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of Fc-modified IgG in a mouse model of toxin neutralization; 3. Produce cGMP grade plantibodies for animal and human studies; 4. Examine pharmacokinetics/toxicology of anti-botox IgG plantibodies, and efficacy of toxin neutralization, in a non-human primate model. 5. Examine safety of plant- made antibody in human Phase I clinical trials. Botulinum toxin is the deadliest substance known, and would be easy for a terrorist to produce and use to cause large numbers of casualties. This makes developing an effective and economical countermeasure to protect the public a public health priority. The research supported by this application will lay the groundwork for using plants to produce a highly protective, safe and economical antitoxin therapy.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have shown that a plant-produced recombinant protein derived from a human anthrax toxin receptor protein and human IgG (an immunoadhesin), neutralizes anthrax lethal toxin in cell culture assays.  In this project we will show the effectiveness of this immunoadhesin in vivo, both against purified toxin and in an animal model of pulmonary anthrax (infection with Ames spores). The immunoadhesin can be produced at low cost in plants in almost unlimited supply, defined specificity and reproducible titer.  Existing active vaccines against anthrax toxin require multiple administrations for effective, but delayed, immunization and are not therapeutic for B. anthracis infected patients.  An effective immunoadhesin-based anti-toxin strategy would provide three major benefits: (1) immediate, but temporary immunity to anthrax toxin for first responders, military personnel, and civilians under acute threat of exposure to the pathogen; (2) therapeutic effect, possibly in conjunction with antibiotics administration, to more effectively treat cases of anthrax infection; and (3) non-interference with subsequent, and possibly concurrent, immunization with an anthrax vaccine.  Planet Biotechnology has produced antibodies and immunoadhesins in transgenic plants and advanced them into clinical trials.  If we achieve the aims in this Phase II proposal, we will submit an Investigational New Drug application to the FDA for this protein.  The following aims support the overall goal: 1. Make improvements to the already active immunoadhesin to increase activity in a cell-based assay for Lethal Toxin neutralization and enhance yield in transgenic tobacco.  2. Determine antitoxin activity of the immunoadhesin in animal models of anthrax infection, and examine the effect of glycosylation.  3. Produce immunoadhesin for animal safety studies from greenhouse-grown tobacco lines under cGMP.  4. Examine the pharmacokinetics and toxicology of plant-produced immunoadhesin in rats and dogs.  Relevance of this research to public health: Spores of Bacillus anthracis, a Class I bioterror agent, are easy to produce using unsophisticated techniques.  Inhalation of these spores causes deadly pulmonary Anthrax.  This research may lead to an inexpensive, safe and effective treatment for Anthrax infection.",

Youth in child welfare are at an increased risk for juvenile delinquency, chemical dependency, and poor educational outcomes. The Child and Adolescent Welfare Outcome System (CA-WOS) will help address these risks, as well as screen for and monitor the factors that affect the likelihood of successful reunification with the family, contribute to treatment failures and lead to long-term child welfare involvement and eventual transitions to overextended adult treatment programs. CA-WOS is a computer-supported assessment system for child welfare agencies designed to improve long term youth and family functioning outcomes. The system enables interagency treatment team members (counselors, case managers, therapists) as well as youth and their families (birth/foster/caregivers) to provide and access information useful in monitoring mental health status and progress. Informants complete assessments using PCs or via the Internet. Through automated reports, child welfare and mental health professionals are able to easily identify problem and strength areas, to determine whether positive change is occurring as families learn the skills needed to establish safety and permanency. CA-WOS will predict the likelihood of successful reunification based on its assessment of youth and family characteristics such as symptomology, functioning, and strengths; impact of abuse and trauma; prior engagement/progress in therapeutic relationships and placements; self-neglectful attitudes/behavior and other factors.

The continuing emergence of drug resistance in clinically-important pathogens has now become a global problem and public health threat. In a 2003 Institute of Medicine report, antimicrobial resistance was described as a paramount microbial threat in the 21st Century. It has been estimated that infections caused by drug-resistant organisms double the duration of hospital stays by patients and economic costs for added medical care have been reported to total up to several billion dollars per year in the US. These alarming increases in the emergence of drug-resistant strains and the associated clinical and economic consequences signal the dire need for development of new antimicrobial agents with activity against these organisms. These agents should be novel and attack new targets to evade resistance issues which plague the success of new but structurally-related antibiotics. Furthermore, these agents should exert their antimicrobial activity via mechanisms that bacteria do not effectively resist. The goals of the Phase 2 research plan are to evaluate the suitability of PMX lead candidates in a drug development program leading to human clinical trials for an anti-infective indication. There is substantial information on preclinical in vivo efficacy of the PMX compounds and particular attention will be directed at in vitro screens, acute and repeat dose toxicity studies, safety pharmacology studies and manufacturing to rapidly determine if an IND can be opened to examine safety and tolerability in human subjects. In addition, medicinal chemistry will continue using the base structures of two preferred lead candidates to identify back-up compounds to substitute into the discovery program if problems are encountered with the lead candidates. The projected use for the developed product is as an iv injectable antibiotic to treat hospital-acquired infections.",

However, the broad-based introduction of bioethanol is limited by the high cost of separating and recovering fuel-grade ethanol from the fermentation solution, particularly when bioethanol is produced from distributed biomass.  This project will develop a more efficient ethanol production process, in which fermentation is combined with a membrane separation process, so that ethanol can be continuously extracted from the fermentor.  In Phase I, a nanoporous membrane, capable of selectively removing ethanol from the fermentation solution, was developed, and the production of concentrated ethanol was demonstrated in bench-scale tests, using a single step process.  The novel membrane exhibited an order-of-magnitude increase in ethanol/water separatation, compared to prior-art membranes.  An initial economic analysis showed that the membrane separation process would significantly reduce ethanol production costs and process energy consumption, compared to traditional distillation.  In Phase II, membrane performance will be optimized, a pilot scale membrane module will be constructed and tested, and a commercial-scale hollow-fiber membrane module will be developed.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new membrane technology should reduce the cost of producing bioethanol, a renewable energy source and fossil fuel substitute, and provide an energy efficient process that integrates fermentation with ethanol separation.  Increased bioethanol production would reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil, enhance national security, and reduce atmospheric emissions",

We have identified a direct-acting, reversible antagonist of P2Y12 called CT57537 that has high potency for this receptor and favorable pharmacokinetic properties (suitable half-life, low clearance, good oral bioavailability in multiple species). In this Phase I application, we will (1) determine whether CT57537 is antithrombotic in human and rodent ex vivo and in vivo models of thrombosis. To accomplish this, we will determine potency of CT57537 using (a) human and (b) mouse whole blood perfused through a collagen coated capillary under arterial shear and (c) in a mouse in vivo mesenteric artery FeCIS-induced injury model. Secondly, we will compare the antithrombotic/antihemostatic ratio for CT57537 to that of clopidogrel in a rat thrombosis model, and correlate in vivo antithrombotic efficacy with inhibition of ex vivo platelet aggregation at multiple drug doses. Successful completion of Phase I will allow us to proceed to Phase II studies where we will evaluate this compound in a canine model of thrombosis, evaluate the role of P2Y12 in platelet-mediated inflammatory events (plaque progression and neointimal proliferation), and complete the necessary toxicological studies with CT57537 necessary for filing an IND.",

To address this challenge, Praxis, Inc. has undertaken development of a suite of computer-based software products designed to establish the behavioral prerequisites for functional use of money by persons with intellectual disabilities. The first product of the suite, MERIT-1, is a money skills readiness product that assesses and teaches identification of all coins and bills up to $20. To do develop this essential product, Praxis, Inc. has taken advantage of its recent experience in developing other teaching programs for establishing basic discrimination performances and equivalence classes. The programs have been supported by an extensive body of scientifically-validated procedures, all of which have been developed in NICHD-supported projects aimed at improving instructional technology for persons with intellectual disabilities. In Phase 1 of the MERIT-1 project, the Company developed prototype software that implemented the essential features of the MERIT-1 readiness curriculum. The software and supporting items were successfully field-tested, and critical milestones were achieved. The Specific Aims of this Phase-2 project are to: (1) transform the prototype software into a high quality turn-key application for teaching money discrimination skills that are prerequisite for learning the values of coin, bills, and their combinations; and (2) field-test the application to verify its effectiveness with teachers and students who are representative of those who will be the ultimate consumers of the product. The objective of the MERIT suite is to offer a comprehensive curriculum that can potentially prepare all children who have the requisite cognitive capacity to use money independently.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Now that most persons with intellectual disabilities live in the community instead of in institutions, functional use of money has become an important special education priority. Lacking money skills, one does not have the means to purchase necessary goods and services independently of caretakers. To address this challenge, Praxis, Inc. has initiated an effort to develop a suite of software products designed to establish the behavioral prerequisites for independent functional use of money by persons with intellectual disabilities (e.g., autism, mental retardation, etc.). The first product, MERIT-1 (currently under development with SBIR sponsorship from NICHD) will establish readiness for instruction in money skills. The present application requests support to develop MERIT-2, the second (and most central) product of the suite -- the component that establishes equivalence relations among groups of coins and numerical values representing prices. To do so, Praxis, Inc. will take advantage of recent experience in developing computer programs for establishing equivalence classes and for combinatorial analysis of large, multi-component stimulus sets in applications with children with mental retardation, autism and other developmental disabilities. This fast-track application will address two aspects of computer-assisted instruction. In Phase 1, we will develop a product component for computer-managed instruction in which software will structure face-to-face interactions with a teacher; the software will generate the necessary teaching sequences, manage teaching sessions, structure data collection, and make certain data-based decisions regarding the content of subsequent teaching sessions. This Phase 1 activity will also set the stage for Phase 2, in which a true expert system will be developed for independent, computer-based money equivalence training and practice. In each phase of product development, field tests will evaluate product efficacy and ease-of-use by our intended consumers.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to develop a prototype of a new diagnostic imaging device for use by eye care practitioners. Specifically, the instrument we envision will detect, quantify, and report information obtained by multispectral imaging of the iris using visible and near-infrared transillumination (i.e., light directed through the skin, then reflected out through the iris from within the eye). Visible-light transillumination, with visual evaluation by the practitioner, is routinely used in clinical practice. However, this approach suffers from low sensitivity, especially when the subject has dark-colored irides and/or when the disease is in its early stages or is otherwise subtle. We propose that multispectral digital imaging, with automated image analysis, will be a major step forward for evaluation of diseases of the iris. The anticipated advantages of this approach lie not only in improved diagnostic performance, but also in the benefits offered by digital imaging, including automated image analysis, archiving and reporting of results, and longitudinal tracking of disease progression. The device is expected to have clinical importance for the following disorders: pigmentary dispersion syndrome and secondary glaucoma, Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis, ocular albinism in infants, and iridociliary cysts. Research in this Phase II SBIR project will focus on technical development of the imaging instrumentation and image processing/analysis approaches required. Duplicates of the prototype developed in this project will be deployed at the clinics of the Illinois Eye Institute, University of Illinois-Chicago, and University of Michigan for collection of patient data needed for training of automated detection methods. If successful, the proposed instrument will permit visualization of eye disease in cases where detection is difficult or impossible by currently available technology. This Phase II SBIR project will focus on development of a prototype device for imaging the iris (pigmented portion at the front of the eye). The device will acquire, store, and automatically analyze images to detect defects in the iris that are associated with glaucoma.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kidney failure due to end-stage renal disease is escalating at an alarming rate, motivating renal investigators and clinicians to identify research priorities in search for better ways to prevent and treat kidney disease. There is a crucial need for increases in resources and manpower in research in kidney disease. An impediment to renal research has been dwindling resources and loss of protected time to devote to research in the face of an ever-increasing demand for further exploration of research ideas. There is a significant need and market potential for readily available reagents and tissue products from established models and human cases of renal disease. To address this deficit, Probetex was founded as a \"Renal Research Resource Company\" to create a repository of ?off-the-shelf? tissue products to provide readily available samples and help investigators to quickly and efficiently explore their ideas on established and standardized models or identified cases of human disease. This Phase II application focuses on large-scale production of reagents and tissue products (tissue sections, protein lysates, purified RNA, and prefabricated Western and Northern blots) derived from the six models of kidney disease collectively representing the most common forms of renal disease presented clinically. These same products will be developed from normal and diseased human kidney. The models include 1. Mesangial Proliferative Glomeruonephritis (anti-Thy-1), 2. Immune-mediated Crescentic Glomerulonephritis and Interstitial Nephritis (anti-GBM), 3. Membranous Nephropathy (anti-Fx1A), 4. Lupus nephritis, 5. Type 1 and 6. Type 2 diabetic nephropathy. This grant will enable large-scale processing of existing lots of sheep antibodies developed to create reagents to induce three classical immune models of kidney disease (1-3 above). Also, manufacture of tissue products from the disease models will be processed for distribution as single units or in multiple arrays of tissue and prefabricated Western and Northern blots for comparison analysis of samples of different diseases or time points in the same application. Also, as part of Probetex?s mission, the company, will prepare for commercialization seven kidney cell lines (embryonic stem cells and glomerular mesangial, epithelial, and endothelial cells). A plan to expand the scope of products through licensing and out-sourcing strategies will be implemented as part of the company?s long-range goal. One of the main obstacles facing physician- and basic scientists today is dwindling resources and loss of protected time to devote to their research in the face of an ever increasing demand for further exploration of research ideas in kidney disease. Readily available samples derived from experimental models and clinical cases of renal disease are not commercially available. Probetex, Inc. was founded as a ?Renal Research Resource Company? and addresses the above research priorities by fostering research in kidney function and pathology by means of providing reagents, products, and services for the investigation of experimental and clinical renal disease. Probetex?s products will enable investigator-customers to quickly and efficiently explore their research ideas on established and standardized models and identified cases of human renal disease increasing awareness, resources and further research in kidney disease.",

To determine the molecular target of a bioactive compound, a pool of ~6,000 yeast deletion strains is grown in the presence vs. absence of compound. Identifying the strains that are hypersensitive to a drug provides valuable information about the drug's mechanism of action. The power of the highly multiplexed HIP assay is that it provides a comprehensive systems-level analysis of how a drug impacts the biology of a eukaryotic cell. This project aims to develop a high-throughput commercial system that is flexible, scalable, and seamlessly integrates hardware, software and assay methods for HaploInsufficiency Profiling. The system will incorporate innovations and improvements in all three areas. It will allow the HIP assay to be run accurately, reliably and inexpensively. The ability to screen many thousands of compounds efficiently will allow the generation of large, high-quality datasets. This will enable more comprehensive analysis of structure-function relationships, and aid the discovery of important interactions between small molecules and proteins. This information is invaluable for basic scientific research and early-stage drug development. The new system will also make the assay much more accessible to the scientific community and will allow powerful new variations of the assay to be developed and new applications to be explored. Traditional approaches to drug development are inefficient, and there is a pressing human health need for new information-rich technologies that can improve the process of identifying and validating targets and developing new drugs for important human diseases. This powerful and cost-effective chemical genomics technology has the potential to play a significant enabling role in basic research in systems biology and in drug development.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in every four deaths in the US is due to cancer. The overall cancer drug market exceeds $2 billion in the USA. There is significant need to identify novel and selective small molecule-based cancer therapies. This proposal seeks to undertake late preclinical development of a novel inhibitor of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase for the eventual use of the agent, PX-866, as a therapy against solid and hematologic cancers. There is strong evidence for the following: 1) The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3K)/Akt (protein kinase B) pathway is a survival signaling pathway that is activated in many types of human cancer. 2) PTEN, a lipid phosphatase that attenuates PI-3K signaling by dephosphorylating PI-3-phosphates, is lost in a large number of human tumors leading to constitutive activation of PI-3K/Akt survival signaling pathway. 3) ProlX Pharmaceuticals has identified several novel viridin analogues that show potent inhibition of PI-3K, with better biological stability and without the severe liver toxicity of wortmannin. 4) One of these viridin analogues shows good single agent antitumor activity against a number of human tumor xenografts in immunodeficient scid mice and potentiates the activity of both currently used cytotoxic and molecularly targeted (EGFR kinase) chemotherapeutic drugs. ProlX has selected PX-866 as the lead PI-3K inhibitor to develop as a novel cancer therapy. The objectives of this Phase 2 application to be conducted by ProlX Pharmaceuticals, are to further advance PX-866 toward a clinical trial by completing Exploratory IND enabling safety, formulation and biological endpoint studies. Specifically it is intended 1) to develop intravenous and oral formulations of PX-866 with corresponding stability studies; 2) to compare and initiate validation of surrogate molecular endpoint assays; and 3) to evaluate the safety of PX-866 in rat and dog species to identify a dose for an ensuing Phase 0 clinical trial. The results of this application will lead to the submission of an Exploratory IND application allowing the agent to be evaluated in the clinic through the newly developed guidelines for clinical pharmacokinetic studies. ProlX has the exclusive license to develop PX-866 agent as an anticancer drug.",

As a result, the system is being operated in a manner for which it was not designed; congestion, blackouts, equipment damage, and system disturbances are becoming widespread, and are occurring with ever increasing frequency, duration, and economic effect.  The low-cost monitoring of congested circuits would improve reliability and economic efficiency, increase transmission capacity, relieve congestion, reduce costs to consumers, and decrease operational risks.  However, existing real-time transmission line monitoring and dynamic rating systems have total installed costs significantly in excess of $45,000 and $120,000, respectively.  This project will develop a non-contact sensor system that will monitor sag, temperature, ampacity, and current in real-time.  The measurements will have high accuracy and be communicated wirelessly to end-users.   The system will be capable of rapid installation and calibration, with no required outages.  Phase I designed, developed, and field-tested prototype non-contact sensors that produced real-time conductor sag and phase current information.  Preliminary operating specifications, performance, and total manufactured cost of the device were established.  In Phase II, three complete system prototypes will be networked wirelessly at a utility test site, and extensive field tests will be conducted.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The sensor system should enable low-cost, networked, real-time monitoring (and alleviation) of congested paths, thereby maintaining the reliability of electric power delivery.  The sensor could help reduce the frequency, extent, and duration of system disturbances (including blackouts) that cause large annual productivity losses.  By enhancing transmission capacity and reducing congestion, the public will realize reduced electricity prices.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stress is a significant factor that can precipitate, exacerbate, and maintain psychopathology. Various neurotransmitter systems and intracellular transduction pathways have been implicated in mediating the stress response and linking it to psychopathology. The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system is among the most important systems that have been identified. Over-activity of the CRF system is implicated in depression, anxiety and other stress-related disorders, and novel treatments aimed at reducing activity of the CRF system may be very effective for these disorders. Furthermore, abundant preclinical evidence supports the likelihood that treatments targeting this system offer a promising approach for treating certain neuropsychiatric, as well as other stress-related illnesses. At this time, few new therapeutic agents for the treatment of depression, anxiety and other stress-related disorders are in the pipeline. Promoter Neurosciences (PNS) has developed a high throughput screen for the detection of compounds that alter expression of the CRF2(a) receptor through its promoter. Our previous studies have validated the assay and have demonstrated the ability to reliably identify compounds that alter expression from the CRF2(a) promoter in a dose-dependent manner. In this proposal, we plan to perform a series of experiments to develop lead compounds that decrease expression from the CRF2(a) promoter. We have screened a library of 59,330 small molecules and have discovered numerous novel compounds that alter expression from the CRF2(a) promoter. First, we will assess the specificity of these hits, selecting those that do not affect expression from several other promoters. Secondly, by collaborating with medicinal chemists we will perform \"hit to lead optimization.\" Thirdly, we will construct a cell line that expresses the CRF2(a) protein under control of the CRF2(a) promoter fragment used in the screening assay. This cell line will be used to demonstrate that the changes in transcription elicited by the identified compounds translate into changes in CRF2(a) protein levels. Furthermore, the ability of the compounds to alter function will be determined by examining changes in CRF2(a) receptor-induced increases in cAMP levels. Finally, we will administer the lead compounds to rats to assess changes in CRF2(a) receptor binding and the effects of the lead compounds on behavior using established models of anxiety.",

The markedly increased deliverable flux imposes extreme requirements on imaging detectors at many of the target stations.  This project will develop a new detector technology, based on the 10-boron thin-film conversion of neutrons and the detection of reaction products in the gas of a thin straw detector.  By using dense packed arrays of such straws, which can be as long as 1 meter, efficient high-resolution imaging can be achieved, with a quantum leap in integral and differential counting rate.  Phase I developed a 150-element sub-array of detectors with the full 1 meter length and the required depth for the SNS.  The sub-array was configured so that a 1 meter square detector can be constituted by replicating the single sub-array.  The sub-array was thoroughly tested in a thermal neutron beam to determine all operating specifications, including spatial resolution, differential and integral counting rate, gamma rejection, and neutron sensitivity.  Phase II will design and construct a complete, 1 square meter, neutron imaging detector, which will provide an integral rate capability approaching 2 x 107 cps, a differential rate capability of at least 2000 cps per pixel, spatial resolution of 7 mm x 4 mm x 4 mm (depth encoded), sensitivity of 70% for thermal neutrons, and a capability of operating in gamma radiation fields approaching 1 R/hr.  The device will be installed at an appropriate test site and thoroughly evaluated in an activity that simulates the demands of SNS operations.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The large area neutron detector for the SNS should benefit many fields, including, for example, the development of improved drug therapies and materials that are stronger, longer-lasting, and more impact-resistant.

This powerful methodology will expedite our understanding of the functional role and physiological significance of O-GlcNAc protein modifications and will expedite the identification of novel pharmacological targets. TAGTM technology consists of three steps: (1) the chemical synthesis of cell permeable GlcNAc azides and their incorporation into cells instead of GlcNAc, the natural substrate for the O-GlcNAc modification of proteins. (2) Selective in situ conjugation of the GlcNAc azide-modified proteins with a phosphine capture reagent resulting in a stable covalent bond. The conjugation or tagging reaction exploits the well precedented and facile Staudinger reaction between the azide group on the O-GlcNAc azide-modified protein and the phosphine of the capture reagent followed by intramolecular amidation. And (3) the detection, quantification, and/or isolation of the conjugated products. The phosphine capture reagent can be linked to, inter alia, (i) biotin or other affinity reagents; (ii) solid supports (e.g., glass or sepharose beads) with or without a photocleavable linker; and (iii) fluorescent, radiolabeled, or other analytical compounds. In preliminary studies and during Phase I research, we (a) completed the chemical syntheses of peracetylated N-(2-azidoacetyl)giucosamine (peracetylated GlcNAc azide) and a phosphine capture reagent; (b) prepared three chemically different biotinylated capture reagents, viz., triphenylphosphine, phosphinothioester, and terminal acetylenic capture reagents; (c) achieved the high yield conjugation reaction in vitro between synthetic GlcNAc azide and the biotinylated triphenylphosphine capture reagent; (d) demonstrated the incorporation of peracetylated GlcNAc azide into proteins utilizing cells in tissue culture; (e) compared the efficacy of the three types of capture reagents for conjugation to O-GlcNAc azide-modified proteins; and (f) exploited TAGTM for the isolation and identification of 110 O-GlcNAc azide-modified proteins from CHO-K1 cells via nano-HPLC/LCQ mass spectrometry and protein sequence database comparisons. During Phase II, we shall significantly extend and refine our initial progress to include improved chemical syntheses of variants of O-GlcNAc azide substrates and phosphine capture reagents with better enzymatic, physical and reactivity properties as well as validate these tools for proteomic and analytical problems of biomedical significance.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disorder characterized clinically by progressive loss of memory, cognition, reasoning, and judgment that gradually leads to profound mental deterioration and ultimately death. AD is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and is characterized by the brain accumulation of insoluble fibrillar amyloid deposits containing the beta-amyloid protein (Abeta). Abeta amyloid formation, deposition and persistence in brain is believed to play a central role in AD pathogenesis by contributing to neuronal loss and memory dysfunction, and therefore is a central target for the development of new therapeutics for the treatment of AD and related disorders. Our previous Phase I studies first identified a new and relevant Abeta binding site on laminin localized to the globular domain repeats on the laminin A chain. Over 300 overlapping 12-13mer peptides spanning the binding site area were synthesized and tested using a varietry of in vitro screening methods to determine the best 12-13mer peptides demonstrating the most potent anti-Abeta amyloid inhibitory/disruptive activity. In Phase II studies, we assessed the top six 12-13mer peptides and designed, synthesized, tested and identified smaller 6-9mer peptide analogs that served as lead pre-clinical candidates. These rigorous studies have now led to the identification of two novel small 7mer D-amino acid peptides that following peripheral administration in a relevant APP transgenic plaque producing animal model of AD cause a marked reduction and clearance of brain Abeta amyloid load (by 50-70%), and improved memory (by 28-44%). This Phase II SBIR continuation proposal project will now further develop these two novel 7mer pre- clinical candidate peptides in vitro and in vivo to determine their pharmakokinetic, blood-brain-barrier permeability, and toxicity profiles. Best route of administration (i.e. nasal, i.v. and/or s.c.), dosage and time- dependent efficacy for reduction and clearance of brain Abeta amyloid and improved memory will also be further determined in the APP transgenic plaque-producing mouse model that demonstrates memory deficits with increased Abeta burden. These studies will help us select a novel small peptide pre-clinical candidate (and its backup) that will be developed for human clinical trials and commercialization, and that has the promise to serve as an exciting new treatment for AD and related Abeta amyloidosis.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this Phase II proposal is a computer-based method called the Dynamic Assessment of Hearing Aids (DAHA). The method uses an intuitive graphical interface to record visual analogue ratings of a patient's satisfaction with various facets of his/her hearing aid(s). The results of each assessment are immediately available to the clinician. The hearing aid provider can select from a variety of normative data sets and different report formats to summarize the assessment for a single patient. The patient receives a written report summarizing the salient aspects of their hearing aids leading to satisfaction or dissatisfaction. These are available either in a default mode or as selections to meet the needs of individual patients or groups of patients. The software is available both in English and Spanish. Phase I of this project established the method's psychometric properties of concurrent validity and test-retest reliability, as well as patient acceptability. The main research objective of Phase II is to develop an initial normative database for DAHA and to integrate state-of-the art database management and data presentation tools into the DAHA system. The secondary objective is to field test the DAHA in a clinical setting, in order to determine its utility to providers and patients who are evaluating hearing aids. At present, questionnaires and interview techniques are commonly used to obtain patient ratings of their opinions about their hearing aids. The drawbacks of these methods include laboriousness for both the patient and the person who administers and scores the instrument, delayed availability of results, and difficulties in making comparisons with selected subpopulations. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The number of audiologists practicing in the US is approximately 7000 (source: American Academy of Audiology), and the number of people in the U.S. with hearing loss sufficient to affect daily living exceeds 25 million. Successful completion of the proposed project will fulfill an existing need by providing computer assessments of the perceived quality of hearing aids that can be used in a variety of clinical and research settings, including R&D and marketing for designers and manufacturers of hearing aid devices.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For patients with respiratory disease the symptom of breathlessness (dyspnea) is the most frequent reason for seeking medical attention. Current methods for measuring the impact of breathlessness on activities of daily living rely on face-to-face interviews conducted by health care providers. Two common measures are the Baseline Dyspnea Index representing the severity of dyspnea at a single point in time, and the Transition Dyspnea Index representing changes in dyspnea compared with the baseline level before treatment. Despite widespread acceptance of these measures, the interview technique has been criticized on three counts: (1) selection of severity of breathlessness is made by the interviewer, not the patient, and thereby can increase measurement error (2) the method cannot be applied consistently in different medical centers because the same interviewers are not employed at all test sites (3) the process is expensive due to the cost of training and employing health care providers to conduct interviews and enter data into the computer. There is a need for a less expensive, standardized approach to the measurement of dyspnea that could be applied consistently throughout the world. In Phase I of this project computerized versions of the Baseline Dyspnea Index and the Transitional Dyspnea Index were developed and tested for concurrent validity by comparison with interview versions, and for construct validity by comparison with pulmonary function tests. The aims of Phase II are to determine further psychometric and clinical properties of the standardized methods: test- retest reliability of both the Baseline and Transition Dyspnea Indices, responsiveness and the minimally important clinical difference of the Transition Dyspnea Index. Subjects employing the new, standardized computer methods will be 126 patients diagnosed with chronic lung disease. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS. There are excellent commercial prospects for computer software that allows the patient to rate their level of dyspnea associated with activities of daily living. Once the software package is implemented and tested, site licenses for acquiring the program will be sold to clinics, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies worldwide. The computer assessment instruments developed in this project will quantify the patient-reported outcomes of lung disease. The overall goal is to further our understanding about these diseases and to identify better clinical outcome measures.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding connectional deficits in mutant and transgenic mouse models is essential to a mechanistic understanding of how such deficits contribute to nervous and sensory system disorders. To achieve this requires neurotracing reagents that a) can delineate nerve fibers even in partially defunct cells and b) allow simultaneous tracing of multiple nerve tracts in embryos, juveniles and adults, with equivalent resolution for thick vs. thin and myelinated vs. unmyelinated fibers. Because all nerve cells have membranes, even when defects in critical genes cause aberrant development, lipophilic fluorescent dyes can provide information where other techniques may fail. Tracing with such dyes has been limited by time consuming and cumbersome methodology, largely due to poorly matched spectral and diffusional properties. The project?s long term goal is to build a family of lipophilic fluorescent dyes/reporter molecules to maximize the number of neuronal tracts which can be traced at the same time in individual fixed and/or live specimens. In Phase I, a novel set of lipophilic NeuroVue? dyes with well matched spectral and diffusion properties were developed and commercialized in a simple-to-use coated filter format. These new products enable up to 3- color studies on standard confocal systems and up to 5 color studies on enhanced systems with spectral detection/color unmixing capabilities. This SBIR Phase II proposal will add violet, near-infrared and time- resolved NeuroVue dyes to further increase the number of fibers that can be traced simultaneously, and creation of specialized probe sets for i) detection of developing neuronal connections and ii) long-term neurotracing studies in myelinated/adult tissue. Phase II specific aims are to:1) Expand the Phase I NeuroVue Standard dye set to enable simultaneous tracing of up to 5 neuronal tracts in tissues requiring diffusion periods of at least 4 weeks using standard confocal microscopy; 2) Create optimized dye pair enabling detection of neuronal proximity/connection formation in fixed tissue using standard confocal microscopes (NeuroVue Connections); 3) Expand the Phase I NeuroVue Enhanced set to enable simultaneous tracing of at least 8 neuronal tracts over a diffusion period of at least 4 weeks using enhanced confocal systems with spectral detection/color unmixing, 2-photon excitation and time-resolved fluorescence detection capabilities; 4) Create a dye set optimized for long-term (at least 6 week diffusion) studies of myelinated fibers (e.g. ,tissues from adult mice and, potentially, fixed human specimens), 5) Commercialize the best new dyes from Specific Aims 1-4. Completion of the workplan proposed will: a) Provide a family of well-matched neurotracing probes enabling at least 5-color neurotracing on standard confocal systems and 8-color studies on advanced confocal systems; b) Significantly reduce the cost and number of animals required to trace neuronal circuits, and c) Provide novel tools to study how development of cellular connections are affected by mutations, and are remodeled in the presence of disease, damage or aging. This work will provide novel tools for the study of how connections in the nervous system are altered by genetic defects, disease, trauma or aging. The new techniques will allow more information to be gained from fewer animals, leveraging existing NIH investments in the development of thousands of mutant mouse models with defined genetic defects. These tools and models are expected to provide the neuroscience community with critical insights into the developing brain and how to design more effective therapeutic interventions.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First principle (ab initio) quantum chemistry methods are widely used for computational studies in biology, chemistry and material science. Among the various quantum chemistry models, density functional theory (DFT) offers a good balance between computational cost and accuracy and accordingly is the most widely used method in many scientific fields, including biological research. However, despite the remarkable advances in DFT in the past decade, the application of DFT to treat large biological systems or molecular dynamics is still limited by computational cost. Accordingly, the goal of the research proposed here is to increase the efficiency of DFT calculations by several fold through the implementation of novel algorithms. There are two major time-consuming parts in a DFT calculation, namely computation of the Coulomb and the exchange-correlation (XC) contributions. In the Phase I of this project, we implemented the Fourier Transform Coulomb method for the evaluation of the Coulomb contribution, and developed a new algorithm called multiresolution XC (mrXC), for the evaluation of XC contribution to the DFT energy with local functionals. The results show that FTC accelerates Coulomb calculation by up to a factor of 4.5 over the most efficient Coulomb algorithms. The mrXC method speeds up the calculation of XC contribution by as much as a factor of 5. In the Phase II of the project, we will develop and implement FTC and mrXC for the most widely used components of DFT calculations, including energy and gradients with respect to nuclear motions for both ground and excited states. Efforts will also be made to further improve the efficiency. Formulism will also be developed at the level of general-gradient approximation, the mostly widely used type of DFT functional. In order to demonstrate the utility of DFT algorithms developed here, we will carry out a state-of-the-art computational study of the mechanism of light-induced structural change in bacteriorhodopsin. These improvements will significantly increase Q-Chem users? productivity and greatly extend the complexity of molecular systems that can be studied using DFT. Furthermore, it will bring DFT much closer to our goal of being able to replace the less accurate but computationally less demanding models currently used today in molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations of proteins and other large molecular systems. This project aims to improve the efficiency of the density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. DFT is at the core of molecular modeling and is applied widely in biological research/development and in drug discovery. The improved DFT will significantly increase researchers? productivity and extend its application scope.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to apply item response theory (IRT) and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) to achieve major advances in the standardization of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) health-related quality of life (HRQOL) metrics, in the efficiency of data collection and processing technologies, and in the usefulness of clinician and patient reports. In contrast to static instruments, which ask all respondents the same questions regardless of their answers and lack the precision to detect changes over a wide range of severity levels, we will use Dynamic Health Assessment (DYNHA ) software to match questions to each patient's score and to the requirements of each application to achieve more practical and more useful assessments. In our Phase I test among hemodialysis patients, a prototype CKD-CAT application achieved comparable CAT scores and equivalent or better precision with substantial reductions in respondent burden compared to three full-length static scales (Effects of Kidney Disease, Sleep Functioning, and Bodily Pain) including items from the Kidney Disease Quality Of Life Questionnaire (KDQOL). Shortcomings of our approach were also identified: (a) the need for additional questionnaire item development, (b) limitations of sampling only hemodialysis patients to represent a wide range of CKD severity levels, and (c) problems with the interface between patients and data collection technologies. To address these concerns as well as meet the needs for assessment tools and software that are applicable across a wider range of disease severity levels, we propose a Phase II effort that matches samples and intensity/expense of data collection to the distinct requirements of each of the following aims: (1) Expand the item pool and evaluate the appropriateness of new items for CKD-specific applications; (2) Identify the most useful and feasible domains and calibrate their items by collecting and analyzing responses from large samples of adults varying across stages of CKD (Stages 3-5); (3) Create a fully operational CKD-CAT system and evaluate its performance through \"real data\" simulation studies, to determine reliability and clinical validity and the potential for reductions in respondent burden, in comparison with full-length forms; and (4) Confirm the administrative feasibility, patient acceptance, reliability and validity of scores, and the usefulness of clinician and patient reports from actual CKD-CAT administrations to patients (CKD Stages 3-5) sampled and assessed in clinical and in non-clinical settings. By greatly shortening surveys and lowering the costs of administering them, it will be possible to monitor the quality of life effects of CKD more accurately for more patients and help clinicians and patients better understand and communicate about treatment success.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a tool for evaluating the functional impact of headaches that uses computerized adaptive testing (CAT) to achieve more practical and more precise assessments by matching the questions to each patient's headache severity level. In previous work, we developed a headache impact item bank that improved score precision and validity and provided measurement over a wider range, and we developed cross-calibration procedures that allowed us to directly compare results from CAT and existing headache scales. Items were administered using Dynamic Health Assessment (DYNHA ) software to reduce response burden. In Phase I, we developed and piloted a prototype assessment (HEADACHE-CAT) that combines a static generic health- related quality of life (HRQOL) tool with an enhanced headache impact CAT which draws upon an expanded item bank. Results from a pilot test of the HEADACHE-CAT showed that measurement precision and efficiency increased with the larger item bank. Patient participants provided positive feedback on the HEADACHE-CAT and a prototype patient report that guides interpretation of generic HRQOL and headache impact results. The aims for Phase II are to: (1) improve the content validity of the HEADACHE-CAT by enhanced item selection procedures; (2) improve practical usefulness of the HEADACHE-CAT by heuristic evaluation and usability testing; (3) evaluate the responsiveness of the HEADACHE-CAT to changes in the clinical condition over time; (4) develop and evaluate item administation with voice activation for greater accessibility to patients with visual or literacy impairments and evaluate the effects of survey length on patient satisfaction; and (5) finalize a single comprehensive HEADACHE-CAT assessment system that: a) uses item banks for generic HRQOL and headache impact domains, b) has a comprehensive user guide, c) can provide scores in the metric of traditional scales, d) can deliver individual patient and clinician reports, and aggregate-level reports for providers to improve group-level assessment and monitoring efforts. The HEADACHE-CAT assessment tool developed by this project will make screening and routine outcomes monitoring of HRQOL feasible for headache sufferers by greatly lowering data collection costs, respondent burden, and increasing the breadth and precision of measurement.",

SBIR Phase I research and additional work at Radix Pharmaceuticals have demonstrated that some novel febrifugine analogues are potent inhibitors of both sensitive and multi-drug resistant human malaria strains in vitro at low nanomolar concentrations. These compounds possess new mode of action by impairing haemazoin formation required for maturation of the parasite at the trophozoite stage. Synthesized compounds demonstrated low toxicity in human adult liver epithelial cells and freshly isolated rat hepatocytes. No in vitro cardiotoxicity or genotoxicity was observed. A scalable synthetic route to make radioactive [3H] compounds for PK studies has been established. FDA suggestions have been obtained regarding the necessary ongoing pre-clinical studies to warrant investigational new drug (IND) submission. Based on successful completion of the feasibility study, the overall goal of this Phase II project is to establish detailed pre-clinical profiles for the candidates. Under Phase II support, we will perform the scale up synthesis of these compounds and begin pre-clinical studies in animal models to obtain toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy data. The following interactive studies will be performed to obtain rodent pre-clinical profiles efficiently and effectively: (i) The six compounds identified in Phase I research will be synthesized in a larger scale (2-3 kg per compound) for efficacy and toxicity studies as well as in radioactive [3H] form (100 mg per compound) for pharmacokinetic studies. (ii) Test compounds will be tested in rodent models to obtain acute and sub-acute toxicity, fetotoxicity, anorectic toxicity, and neurotoxicity information. (iii) Test compounds will be administered intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, or orally to rats and mice and pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated. (iv) Antimalarial efficacy data will be obtained in immunocompromised BXN mice infected with human malaria strains and male Swiss albino mice infected with rodent malaria strain P. berghei. These pre-clinical studies would clearly validate the candidate's potential as an ideal new drug for the treatment of acute malaria. On completion of the Phase II studies, one or two compounds that are orally active and possess good bioavailability and therapeutic index will be selected for further development. The successful completion of rodent pre-clinical studies will enable Radix Pharmaceuticals to raise additional funding and attract a commercial partner to push the drug candidate to the market. Phase III follow up work would include pre-clinical data (PK, toxicity, and efficacy) in Rhesus monkey (having data from two species that were produced under the same laboratory conditions is required by FDA), followed by GMP manufacturing and GLP evaluation.

Yet, additional improvements are needed to reduce their capital and operating costs.

However, oxygen is expensive to produce.  Therefore, this project will develop a high-temperature sorbent-based system for air separation, so that the gasification process can be supplied with low cost oxygen.

        "abstract": "Current natural gas reforming plants that produce hydrogen are expensive because of the large capital cost associated with the reformers.  The heat required to drive the reforming reaction is transferred in a fired-furnace through heat exchanger tubes.  These tubes are extraordinarily expensive because they are high nickel alloys, which cost ten times as much as carbon steel, and have thick walls to run at high temperatures (up to 900 \u00c2\u00b0C) and high pressures (400-500 psi).  In addition, the efficiency of current reformers is limited by the temperature at which they operate, which is in turn limits the operating temperature of the reformer tubes.  This project will develop a steam reforming system for the production of hydrogen, which uses direct combustion to generate heat reforming, instead of using combustion in a fired-furnace reformer.  In Phase I, experimental research, system design, and cost analysis studies were used to show that the new  hydrogen-generation approach can reduce capital cost, increase methane conversion efficiency, and reduce the cost of hydrogen.  In Phase II, a new test apparatus will be built to demonstrate the performance of the entire system.  Also, a full system design and an economic analysis for a large-scale plant operation will be conducted.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The new process should reduce the cost of hydrogen from natural gas, while increasing efficiency and emitting far less carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.  U.S. demand for hydrogen is now about nine million tons per year, and growing rapidly.",

        "abstract": "TDA Research, Inc., (TDA) is developing a novel non-carbon sorbent to control mercury emissions from flue gas from hazardous waste incinerators and coal-fired power plants.  The sorbent could be easily injected into the flue gas and could be recovered in the Particulate Control Device (PCD) along with the fly ash, minimizing capital investment.  Unlike the carbon materials used to date, our sorbent does not alter the properties of the by-product fly ash and render it unsuitable as a cement additive.  Our materials combine an oxidation catalyst/oxidizing agent in the same particle.  The catalyst oxidizes the difficult-to-remove elemental mercury to the much easier to stabilize Hg+2.  The oxidized mercury then tightly binds to the sorbent.  As a result of this dual function, our sorbents have high capacity, good activity, and can work at much higher temperatures because the mercury is tightly bound to the surface.  In the Phase I project, we demonstrated the technical feasibility of using the non-carbon sorbent for mercury removal.  The sorbent achieved a higher mercury capacity than the Norti-FGD carbon, the benchmark sorbent in mercury emission control form flue gases, at 150\u00c2\u00b0C (over 2,000 \u00c2\u00b5g/g) in a fixed -bed  experimental setup under representative simulated flue gas.  Unlike the carbon sorbent, which do not work at higher temperature, our formulation also performed well at high temperature, absorbing 250 \u00c2\u00b5g/g at 245\u00c2\u00b0C.  The high temperature operation capability of the sorbent allows its use on the hot-side of an electrostatic precipitator (ESP).In Phase II, we will continue to optimize the sorbent formulation and scale-up its production.  In collaboration with Apogee Scientific, Inc. (Apogee) we will demonstrate its performance in a pilot-scale flow apparatus using actual flue gas generated by burning {powder Rive Basin (PRB) coal.  Our Commercial partners will assist us in our scale-up, evaluation and commercialization efforts to improve our chances of successful sorbent development.\n\nCommercial Applications\n\nThis technology may find immediate use for mercury abatement in hazardous waste incinerators.  In addition, the same technology would be applicable to the much smaller application of mercury abatement in municipal waste incinerators and waste-to-energy facilities.  These facilities are becoming more prevalent in the U.S., and are particularly common in Europe, where trouble-prone packed beds of carbon are currently used.  When regulated coal-fired power plants represents an even larger market, accounting for 60% of the electric power generated in the U.S.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Under current regulatory policies, chemicals that are believed to comprise both a significant exposure and health risk in the human population are selected to undergo testing for toxicity and carcinogenic potency.  The traditional method for evaluating carcinogenic activity and chronic toxicity of a specific chemical has been the two-year bioassay. Due to relatively large amounts of resources involved, each bioassay costs between 2 million and 4 million dollars and takes several years to complete. According to the National Toxicology Program (NTP), the number of chemicals currently tested stands at 505 in long-term studies and 66 in short-term tests, and only a single sub-chronic study. By comparing the number of completed bioassays with the 70,000 to 85,000 chemicals in commerce today it is impossible to apply the current testing system to all chemicals of concern. Alternative approaches must be developed in the interest of protecting human health and in saving economic resources. To develop an efficient and accurate assessment of the carcinogenic potential of an unknown chemical we propose to: (1) identify a set of genes that is predictive of chemically induced hepatocarcinogenesis in a standard rodent 2-year bioassay using a tissue-engineered rodent liver model; and (2) apply the diagnostic gene expression profile derived from the rodent studies to the equivalent tissue-engineered human liver model to evaluate cross-species scaling of the chemically-induced carcinogenic endpoint. To accomplish this, in vivo exposures and exposures of engineered three-dimensional liver co-cultures will be performed with a training set of compounds that include non-hepatocarcinogens and hepatocarcinogens of the following classes: genotoxic, non-genotoxic, sex-dependent and species-dependent. Microarray analysis will be performed on mRNA derived from the exposed animal and liver cultures and the results used to identify gene sets that are statistically predictive of hepatocarcinogenicity in the two-year animal bioassay. A commercial product derived from this research will enable prioritization of hepatocarcinogenic potential of untested chemicals and allow a significant savings of time, money and animals for both governmental agencies as well as private industry related to chemical manufacturing, food additives and pharmaceuticals.",

        "abstract": "Cupric chloride etchant is in wide use in the etching of copper, particularly in the manufacture of printed circuit boards.  Currently, hazardous oxidants such as chlorine are used to regenerate this etchant.  In addition, the hazardous waste generated must be hauled away and disposed of.  The device under development will electrolytically regenerate the etchant without the addition of oxidizing chemicals.  Additionally, it will recover copper metal and eliminate the formation of hazardous waste products.  An electrolytic system we have already developed for ferric chloride etchant will generate chlorine gas if utilized on cupric chloride etchant.  The Phase I program was intended to develop ways of modifying the existing device so that the chlorine gas could be utilized to regenerate the etchant, and would not escape into the environment.  We were ultimately successful in developing a sealed electrodeposition cell which accomplished this goal.  With no chlorine escape, we recovered at least 90% of the theoretical amount of copper, recovered 99.8% pure copper, and regenerated the etchant based on oxidation reduction potential (ORP) values.  We have a customer in the circuit board business who has offered to help us further evaluate the experimental cell developed during Phase I.  In order to accomplish this, we will modify the existing cell to increase its capacity for copper collection and throughput.  We will then evaluate the capabilities of the cell on the customer\u00c2\u00bfs production etching line.  Following this study, we will design and build a small prototype working unit.  The same customer has agreed to help us evaluate the small prototype unit, and will purchase the unit if all goes as planned.  VTO will be performed on this working model.  Test will include copper purity, copper collection efficiency, ORP rate of increase, thermal effects, reliability and robustness of the unit and economic considerations.  Following this investigation, a larger prototype unit will be designed, built, customer tested, evaluated, and sold.  An independent marketing survey indicates a large potential market and an acceptable selling price within our anticipated range of system cost.  The cost of electricity needed for our system is well below the current normal cost of chemicals for etching copper.  In addition, the recovered copper can be sold for more than the cost of etching.  The elimination of hazardous waste production and hauling is also a major benefit for our potential customers, and recognized as such by the customers contacted in the independent survey.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An increasing number of children survive life threatening emergencies, highly complex surgery, and acute respiratory failure and subsequently require a tracheostomy for months or sometimes years. Many of these children breathe through their tracheostomy tubes spontaneously and unassisted for hours each day when not attached to a ventilator. The major hazard for such children at home or in special care/sub-acute facilities are life threatening incidents due to occlusion and/or extubation, which may result in rapid hypoxia with devastating brain damage or death. Active, ambulatory children with tracheostomy tubes are at greatest risk since they are often not attached to any monitors and their only protection in the event of accidental decannulation is visual observation by a caregiver. The goal of the proposed project is the development of an innovative, piezoelectric-based flow system to continuously monitor pulmonary airflow in infants or children who require a tracheostomy tube and who are not connected to a ventilator. The system consists of a piezoelectric sensor that is sensitive to extremely small changes in airflow amplitude and direction. Changes in airflow are transmitted to the piezoelectric sensor via a thin lever attached to the piezoelectric crystal and positioned in the tracheostomy air stream. The motion of the lever stresses the crystal and generates an electrical signal that can be monitored. The sensor will be integrated with signal conditioning and short-range telemetry module that transmits the airflow signal to a remote receiver. An alarm will be triggered in the event of tube occlusion or accidental extubation. A prototype of the sensor and signal conditioning was constructed during Phase I of the project. Extensive bench testing demonstrated the feasibility of the concept for flow measurement and its potential for alerting the caregiver to cessation of breathing. The results of the tests also suggested the potential of the concept as a platform technology for other clinical applications. The first goal of Phase II is to increase the sensitivity of the sensor, optimize the system, integrate the sensor, signal conditioner and a telemetry unit and construct the receiver and alarm components. The second goal is to test the system clinically. The ultimate objective is to develop and prepare for commercialization a small, reliable and inexpensive system that enhances safety and mobility of the patient and is capable of monitoring multiple subjects simultaneously.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Antibiotic resistance is a growing and increasingly serious public health problem. Infectious diseases caused by Escherichia coli and other bacteria are responsible for millions of deaths each year, and much of this mortality is due to the rise of antibiotic resistant organisms. Because antibiotic-resistant infections double the duration of hospital stay, mortality, and morbidity as compared with drug-susceptible infections, economic costs of antibiotic resistance are estimated to be in the billions of dollars. The overall goal of this project is to develop new anti-infectives that are highly effective and refractory to antibiotic resistance using a Combinatorial Genetic Technology (CGT) that allows the identification of new rRNA target sites and the specific nucleotides that are essential for functionality and viability, and RNA Homology Modeling software that allows accurate prediction of mutant RNA structures. Phase I of this project was highly successful. A functional mutation library of E. coli 16S rRNA was constructed and ~5000 viable clones were sequenced. Using CGT, 67 regions of E. coli rRNA that contain nucleotides essential for viability were identified. The 67 functionally important regions include known binding sites for antibiotics, tRNAs, proteins, the large ribosomal subunit and initiation factors. Also included were a number of sites that are clearly essential for ribosome function, but for which no functional role has been identified to date. Some of the individual regions occur near each other in 30S subunit crystal structures and probably contribute to a single functional role. The Phase II specific aims are 1) to select one RNA subdomain as a prioritized target from the four potential targets chosen from the RNA \"regions of interest\" identified in Phase I; 2) to use CGT to identify every mutation of the target that could lead to drug resistance, and use multidimensional NMR spectroscopy and homology modeling to determine the essential structural components of the target; 3) to screen compound libraries against the wild type target and its viable mutants; and 4) to carry out structural studies of target/hit complexes to allow optimization of hit compounds, and validate the target/compound using in vitro and in vivo assays of antibacterial activity. RiboNovix will complete the work necessary to develop drug candidates from the leads, and will move qualified candidates into pre-clinical development. Anti-infectives developed against the target identified in this study will likely be highly effective against microbial pathogens and resistant to target site mutation, thus resulting in drugs refractory to antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance is a growing and increasingly serious public health problem. Infectious diseases caused by Escherichia coli and other bacteria are responsible for millions of deaths each year, and much of this mortality is due to the rise of antibiotic resistant organisms.

Use of impedance as a measure of contamination in bulk fluids is well established. However, applying it in micro-scale features is novel and has many promising applications. The proposed Electro-Chemical Residue Sensor (ECSR) technology is not aimed at developing yet another sensor to measure contaminants in fluids. It is rather aimed at the in-situ, real-time, and low-cost measurement of residual contamination inside and on the sidewalls of micro- and nano- features (the bottlenecks of cleaning, rinsing, and drying). The Phase II proposed plan is to design, fabricate, and test a prototype sensor assembly and develop its interface with process tools for cleaning, rinsing, and drying of micro-features. The first planned application, amounting to annual commercial market revenue of $9M to $30M, will be in rinsing and drying of patterned wafers and porous films in micro-electronics manufacturing. Currently, these operations are often run with no adequate real-time control. Insufficient cleaning and drying have significant negative impact on manufacturing yields and device performance. On the other hand, excessive cleaning and drying results in damage to the micro-structures, increase in cost, and wasting of chemicals, water, and energy. The application of the ECRS technology to wafer rinsing alone is expected to reduce water usage by 40-60%.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol abuse can degrade health, cause accidents, and. reduce productivity. Alcohol consumption can cause acute behavioral slowing and difficulties concentrating. Since the relation between blood alcohol and behavioral impairment differs across individuals, increased understanding of the functional impact of alcohol might be obtained through more direct assessment of the effect of alcohol on the human brain. At present there is no convenient way to gauge the effect of alcohol on brain activity, especially in individuals performing real world tasks or approximations thereof such as simulated driving or flight. Recent technological and scientific advances imply the feasibility of a breakthrough technology, the Neurolyzer, specifically designed for routine, automated measurement of the brain's response to alcohol during complex task performance. Like blood-breath alcohol meters that gauge the amount of alcohol consumed, the Neurolyzer will provide a measure of the effect of alcohol on the brain. It will be embodied in an economical, highly-automated system for recording and analyzing the impact of alcohol on neurophysiological brain function signals that outputs a frequently updated index of the neuromodulatory effects of alcohol. It will embody accumulated expertise about analysis of EEG signals into automated software that will reduce the labor required to extract such information by several orders of magnitude, making direct measurements of brain activity available to alcohol researchers conveniently and inexpensively. The Phase I work demonstrated the feasibility of automatically measuring the neurophysiologic effects of alcohol in subjects operating a flight simulator program, and evaluated other critical signal processing issues. In Phase II we will refine our analysis procedures, implement a prototype system, validate the methods in the context of laboratory studies of acute and post-acute- alcohol effects, and deploy a prototype Neurolyzer system in the laboratory of a collaborating scientist for independent evaluation during operation of driving simulators. Although it is targeted at a small but critical research niche, the Neurolyzer is also a member of a family of brain function monitoring devices that have broad application in areas beyond alcohol research; as a result the project has good prospects for commercial success.",

In a separate Phase II SBIR we are developing the prototype, a PfSPZ vaccine using NF54 isolate of Pf. Because of variability of Pf at B & T cell epitopes, optimal development will require, 1) Assessment of protection against multiple isolates of Pf in experimentally challenged volunteers and the field, and 2) Capacity to produce a universally effective vaccine by mixing different isolates of PfSPZ to reduce or eliminate potential negative effects of antigenic diversity on vaccine efficacy. Building on a Phase 1 SBIR this project will establish 3 new isolates of Pf to assess protection in volunteers immunized with NF54-based PfSPZ vaccine, and, if necessary, be included in a multi-strain PfSPZ vaccine. We will, 1) Produce infective PfSPZ from 3 isolates of Pf from different geographic origins than Pf NF54, 2) Establish and store Master (MCB) and Working (WCB) Cell Banks of the 3 Pf isolates and store them under current Good Manufacturing Practices, 3) Produce aseptic mosquitoes infected with PfSPZ derived from the WCB of each isolate, 4) Obtain aseptically dissected, extracted, purified, and cryopreserved PfSPZ from each isolate, 5) Establish that PfSPZ (from 3 above) from each isolate invade and develops normally in a human hepatocyte cell line clone, 6) Submit to FDA addenda to the Biologics Master File on the aseptic NF54 challenge system for each isolate, 7) Submit addenda for the 3 new Pf isolates to the investigational new drug application (IND) for the NF54 aseptic infected mosquito challenge NIAID is submitting in collaboration with Sanaria. In Phase III we will assess the NF54 PfSPZ vaccine in volunteers challenged by bite of mosquitoes infected with NF54 and the 3 new isolates and in Ghana. We will also develop a system of challenging volunteers by injection of aseptic, purified, vialed, cryopreserved PfSPZ of all 4 isolates, creating the capacity for investigators worldwide to conduct PfSPZ challenge studies. Establishing 3 new Pf isolates will decrease the time and cost to receive a license (BLA) from FDA for the PfSPZ vaccine.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 1. Project summary:  The broad, long-term objective is to develop a Scanning ocular Aberration Measurement (SAM) system that solves five shortcomings of current wavefront sensors. Most or all current systems: 1) are too expensive for deep market penetration, 2) do not monitor the pupil size and location as a function of illumination and accommodation, 3) are not designed to change the accommodative demand dynamically as exams are acquired, 4) do not allow spatial sampling density to be adjusted as required depending upon the severity of the aberration structure being measured, and 5) fit the wavefront aberration with a Zernike polynomial without evaluating the impact of the resulting smoothing error and do not provide an alternative fitting method. To achieve the goal of meeting these 5 shortcomings, the specific aims for Phase II will be to: develop the SAM hardware, develop the SAM system software, develop the SAM system calibration and test items, and integrate these SAM components and perform a system level test. The commercial applications for the SAM system include clinical measurements to support custom vision correction interventions such as cornea laser surgery, custom contact lens, and custom implantable lenses. The instrument will also be able to provide an extended range of measurements for clinically difficult cases such as keratoconus or cornea transplants. Health relatedness is achieved in that a cost effective instrument with improved utility capable of handling a broader range of patients quickens the transfer of proven laboratory technology to clinical care. Technological innovations include a variable spatial sampling dependent on need by scanning a micro-lenslet array and its micro-aperture array, a see-through design, and pupil location monitoring as a function of ambient illumination and accommodation.     2. Relevance:  The SAM system will provide a cost effective instrument capable of measuring a broader range of patient's ocular aberrations than is currently available. In addition, the ability to measure these aberrations dynamically while the eye is changing focus from a distant to a near object will be provided.",

The main feature of this technology is the use of a permanent magnet for generation of magnetic field in ICR part of the proposed instrument that will make it cost-efficient, compact in size, and affordable for many applications. The major emphasis is made on producing a homogeneous magnetic field in a maximum space volume that to a certain extent can compensate limitations imposed by the use of a lower magnetic field generated by a permanent magnet in the ICR cell (about 1-1.5 Tesla compared to 7-12 Tesla generated by superconductive magnets). A new permanent magnet design is suggested to achieve this goal. The new instrument is expected to have size, cost and MS/MS capabilities of commercial QIT-MS systems and the resolving power and mass accuracy exceeding that of a popular hybrid quadrupole/time-of-flight (QqTOF) MS.",

In Powers of Inquiry, students will use NI2K, AJEE, ImageJ, and Weblmage to display and enhance digital images from research being conducted by NIEHS-supported and other scientists. With these tools and the support provided by the Powers of Inquiry materials, students will strengthen their science and technology skills, become better consumers of scientific data, and develop an appreciation for the role that NIEHS plays in protecting the health of the nation. A \"powers of ten\" format will organize the lessons in Powers of Inquiry. Each lesson in the series will zoom in on environmental health issues, starting at the planetary level and moving through lessons about the stratosphere, coastal regions, communities, neighborhoods, homes, human organs, microscopic organisms, and human tissue cells to arrive at a lesson on the benefits and risks of molecule- sized nanotechnologies. The educational goal of the Powers of Inquiry materials will be to introduce environmental health science to middle and high school students with an engaging visual medium that involves them in inquiry-based activities supporting accomplishment of state and national standards for science, mathematics, technology, and reading education. The materials will be developed by Science Approach, a for-profit organization founded by staff from the Center for Image Processing in Education (CIPE).

Increases in the year-round consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables that are out of season in the United States, coupled with the relaxation of international trade restrictions, have resulted in significant increases in the importation of produce from developing countries where oversight of irrigation, washing, and handling practices may not be as stringent as in the U.S. Because this produce is generally not cooked prior to consumption, foodborne outbreaks can result from microbiological contamination of crops irrigated using substandard water, reclaimed water or wastewater. Because it may never be possible to test ready-to-eat food products directly for all possible microbial contaminants, the development and commercialization of rapid, simple and economical indirect testing methods for assessing fecal contamination is highly desirable. This proposal addresses the need to develop a robust, rapid and economical method for the determination of fecal contamination of ready-to-eat produce.",

In view of the enormous costs involved in addressing this problem, it is imperative that researchers have access to appropriate statistical tools to analyze their data. In terms of statistical methodology, there has been a growing interest in recent years in fitting models to data collected from longitudinal surveys using complex sample designs. This interest reflects the needs of policy makers and researchers for in-depth studies of social processes over time. Many of the longitudinal studies on alcohol abuse are characterized by the fact that each individual longitudinal record is short, while the number of records is large. Consequently, software for structural equation modeling (SEM) and multilevel modeling is used to analyze these longitudinal data sets. We propose to develop the existing LISREL program to provide researchers with an integrated platform for the analysis of longitudinal data from complex sampling designs.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Scripps has developed a proprietary technology for measuring percent hemoglobin A1c (A1c) that is uniquely suited for the development of simple, low cost test systems. Scripps? goal, through low cost systems, is to make testing more widespread in developed countries, and to make testing for diagnosis and monitoring widely available for the first time in developing countries. Diabetes is epidemic worldwide and places an increasingly heavy cost burden on health care systems. Though professional organizations in developed countries have long called for aggressive treatment of the disease using A1c as a measure of efficacy of treatment, it is still underutilized in part because current systems for decentralized testing of A1c are expensive and/or the cost per test is relatively high. Diabetes is largely undiagnosed and under treated in developing countries, and an A1c test, if inexpensive, could be used to diagnose and monitor diabetes. In Phase I Scripps Laboratories has shown the feasibility of an inexpensive, simple to use strip based \"glucometer\" type system that will lower testing costs and thus make measurement of A1c more widely available at the point of care in developed countries, and widely available in developing countries. In Phase II buffer and blood addition will be made convenient and technique independent, and the hand-held system brought to market readiness for sale in developing countries. The prototype meter used in Phase I is a mature OEM platform that can be customized for Scripps for a modest investment. The hand-held system, however, will not be competitive with systems currently marketed in developed countries which have more costly, more sophisticated meters. During Phase II Scripps will attempt to find a partner with the financial resources to develop a more sophisticated system that will be competitive, yet less expensive, than these current systems. The strip design and most areas of development for Scripps' hand-held system will apply to the more sophisticated system.         Project Narrative: Aggressive treatment of the epidemic of diabetes, monitored by measurement of A1c, is vital to avoid widespread incidence of complications and soaring healthcare costs. In developed countries, Scripps' inexpensive system will make measurement of A1c more widely available at the point of care. In developing countries its low cost would make it the most effective tool for diagnosing and monitoring diabetes.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an innovative modular oxygen enrichment system. It is accepted that the reduction of cycle time can lead to a concurrent decrease in the mass of a sorptive separation system. However, ultra-rapid-cycle systems invariably create mechanical and physical challenges. Specifically, limiting factors are the operational lifetime of the mechanical components, and the micro diffusion rate of the adsorbent system. This project will remove these limitations by replacing mechanical valves with electro-kinetic pumps, and by utilizing microscale adsorbent structures that radically improve diffusion rates. Conventional air separation units exhibit a poor mass/output ratio, which contributes to high cost. Oxy-air combustion offers the possibility of significant fuel savings and other environmental benefits. The broad impact of this research is not only fuel savings attainable from improved combustion efficiency, but also application to other processes where oxygen is the rate limiting factor. Fuel cells, aquaculture, biomass conversion, and water treatment will also profit from this exportable technology.",

This Phase II project will develop (1) an automated Open Assay Development Platform for rapid assay prototyping; (2) whole blood assays for canine immunity assessment and canine thyroid test (T4); and, (3) multiplexed, canine whole blood assays. The approach uses magnetic beads to label biomolecules captured onto a receptor-patterned microchip that contains an embedded array of magnetic microsensors. The magnetic microsensors are wire-like structures that display giant magnetoresistance (GMR). When coupled with controlled fluidic force discrimination - an innovation that greatly reduces unwanted background signal - rapid identification of biomolecules with high sensitivity and specificity is achieved. A prototype system has been developed for both immunoassays and nucleic acid assays, with immunoassays (1 ng/mL) saturating in less than 10 minutes and unmodified DNA detected at 10fm in less than 20 minutes.  Seahawk is responding to the clinical and financial challenges veterinarians face by developing a multi-use, multiplexed instrument and associated disposable cartridges. This technology platform offers veterinarians superior performance (faster, more accurate, easier to use) and greater profitability than existing products. Initially, the platform will include cartridges for two applications: (1) individualized immunity assessment and (2) disease diagnostics, both specifically for dogs and cats. The system provides an in-clinic, quick turnaround, cost-effective and accurate test of an animal's immune system to determine what, if any, vaccine boosters need to be administered at that time. This provides the veterinarians with three key benefits: (1) improving the quality of care - providing revaccinations only when needed and tailored to each animal; (2) generating additional or replacement revenue due to changes in revaccination protocols; and, (3) replacing annual revaccinations as the impetus for customer compliance with scheduling office visits for physical exams.",

However, there are two major obstacles to the efficacy of a manual toothbrush: (1) patient compliance in using a manual brush twice daily for a sufficient period of time (at least 2 minutes) to effectively remove plaque; and (2) inadequate plaque removal, as it only occurs on tooth surfaces directly contacted by the bristles. Power brushes, used by 30% of Americans, offer the potential for better oral health, because their rapid bristle motion can more effectively remove plaque within the reach of the bristles and weak fluid forces created by bristle motion may remove some of the plaque that is beyond the direct reach of their bristles. However, even the best power brushes require a minimum 2-minute brushing to achieve optimal results (while leaving significant interproximal and subgingival plaque). Therefore, the development of a power toothbrush capable of removing the majority of plaque both within reach of and beyond the reach of the bristles over a shorter brushing time (e.g. 1 minute) could provide a significant advance in oral health -which is the goal of this multi-phase SBIR project. Phase I results indicated the feasibility of a power toothbrush that incorporates a novel combination of sonic and ultrasound physical processes to rapidly and safely remove plaque at levels well beyond the capabilities of existing power toothbrushes. Phase I results were obtained with a suitably altered power toothbrush that has clear manufacturing potential. The purpose of the substantial Phase II work proposed here is to 1) finalize the choice of sonic and ultrasound conditions for optimal dental plaque removal and safety via in vitro assays, 2) optimize the design of the proposed toothbrush for acoustic efficiency, reliability and durability, and 3) investigate efficacy and safety of a finalized toothbrush in human clinical studies. The development of a power toothbrush capable of removing the majority of plaque both within reach of and beyond the reach of the bristles within a short period of brushing time would mark a significant advance in oral health. Success in Phase II will set the stage for a Phase III commercialization effort during which Second Act Partners will continue the pursuit of its business plan and will raise the private-sector capital required to begin manufacturing and marketing. This novel product will address a power toothbrush market that is currently over $1 billion in the US and over $2 billion worldwide - one that is growing at 11% per year.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The effective response to a medical crisis requires the participation and cooperation of many entities including emergency medical services, police and fire departments, hospitals, labs, and public health among others. To this day information discovery and sharing is a challenge because of stove-pipe IT systems and organizational structures that impede it. Our goal for this Phase II project is to develop an operational prototype of a Medical Emergency Disaster Response Network (MEDRN) that provides public health, first responders and crisis managers i) secure access to distributed sources of information (e.g logistic, hospital, lab, etc.), ii) a means to collaborate by sharing information horizontally, and iii) a mechanism to gain a global common operating picture across organizations and jurisdictions. MEDRN is based on the semantic distributed network technology developed by Semandex and successfully deployed by the Department of Defense. During Phase I we proved the feasibility of the technology to implement the MEDRN; for Phase II we plan to provide the mechanisms for large scale information sharing among first responder groups and public health. To that effect we plan to a) build a minimum common ontology (MCO) for medical disaster response that borrows from emergency response and public health terminologies to define the minimum set of concepts that are required to integrate heterogeneous information systems across those communities. In effect the MCO will provide the mediation language that allows a problem that requires NxN integration points to demand only N. In addition, we plan to b) incorporate public health and emergency response messaging standards such as CAP, HL7, PHIN-MS, LOINC, etc. to interconnect with existing health and bio- surveillance system, and c) to add a minimum set of privacy and security features that satisfy HIPAA standards for the transmission of protected health data. Finally, we will d) evaluate MEDRN by conducting a live trial in a community that connects their operational systems across functions. The long-term goal of this work is to implement an \"information mutual aid network\" for disaster response: user communities share their information and benefit from the information of others. Semandex profits by providing access and managing MEDRN for a fee. MEDRN's technology can help public health not only with crisis management and bio- surveillance, but also with implementing the National Healthcare Information Infrastructure.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The principal objective of this application is to establish a new methodology for the early detection of abnormal lesions, whether pre-cancerous or cancerous, in breast imaging. Early detection is crucial to identifying lesions while they are still contained when the cure rate is near 100%. Existing mammography often does not identify lesions until significant growth has occurred. Because of the importance of the problem, there is research in alternative methods, including MRI, ultrasound, scintigraphy, and other methods. We propose here, a novel approach using biomagnetic sensors and targeted superparamagnetic nanoparticles. The sensor will detect and image lesions in-vivo to which these particles have bound by antibodies or angiogenesis agents after injection into the subject. We have demonstrated in Phase I of this program, that Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUID) are capable of detecting sub- nanograms of these nanoparticles. This methodology has advantages over existing mammography in the flexibility of nanoparticle choices to increase specificity through antibodies targeting cancer types such as HER-2, and angiogenesis agents targeting tumor microvascular structure. Nanoparticles will also be used to image sentinel cells for metastases. We will use phantoms and tissue preparations to characterize nanoparticles for sensitivity and image capabilities and animal studies to verify the methodology. We will further affirm imaging accuracy through the use of these nanoparticles as contrast agents in MRI studies in our animal studies. We anticipate that the detection of lesions by magnetic sensors will provide a lower false positive rate than mammograms and, more importantly, a higher true positive rate.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in solid-state high power UV LED based lamps for use in water/air/food sterilization/purification, bio-aerosol detection, bio-medical instrumentation, and laboratory measurement systems. Currently there are no portable, rugged, long-lifetime, non-toxic sources of ultraviolet radiation for integration into increasingly important UV water and air purification (particularly residential), bio-aerosol detection, and food sterilization systems. The predominant sources of UV radiation are low-pressure, medium-pressure and amalgam Hg based lamps. These high voltage lamps are large, non-directional, ozone-producing sources of radiation with radial emission from a tube source. This restricts the design flexibility of purification systems because of the geometrical constraints imposed by the lamp. High power deep UV LEDs require packaging designed to dissipate several watts of power, be stable under UV illumination, reflect UV light, and enhance UV extraction. The team proposes to develop manufacturing innovations in the packaging of high power UV LEDs to extend the range of applications that UV LEDs are suitable for including high power package/LED design, and the manufacturing processes required to fabricate these packages. Deep UV LED based lamps with output powers ranging from 50-100 mW are expected from this developmental effort. If successful these Deep UV LED-based lamps will penetrate existing markets using UV radiation sources as the efficiency of the devices increases, as well as creating new markets previously unattainable due to the inherent limitations of current UV sources. The merits of UV radiation for sterilization/purification applications are beginning to be widely publicized. Several of the primary markets are: 1) Sterilization/Purification for Water, Air, and Food Preparation/Storage, 2) UV Spectroscopic Laboratory Analysis Equipment, 3) Bio-medical instrumentation, and 4) Biological weapons detection using UV fluorescence. This expertise will expand the technology base of the U.S. semiconductor manufacturing sector. In addition, low power point-of-use purification systems enabled by this technology will meet a crucial humanitarian need.",

Lassa fever virus in particular annually infects several hundred thousand individuals in West Africa, and the export of this pathogen outside of this region, either intentionally or unintentionally, presents a serious risk to the developed countries of the world. The CDC and NIAID have identified Lassa fever virus as a Category A priority pathogen, indicating the highest degree of threat to public health. The purpose of our biodefense program is to develop safe and effective drugs for preventing and treating diseases caused by Category A viruses. To that end, a large and diverse library of small molecule compounds was screened to identify inhibitors that target the essential Lassa surface glycoprotein and thus block viral entry into the host cell. A number of these potent antiviral compounds and their related analogs have exhibited informative chemical structure-biological activity relationships (SAR). The goal of the Phase II proposal is to advance these compounds toward clinical development, to submit an application for an Investigational New Drug (IND) for the strongest candidate, and to identify at least one additional preclinical candidate as a potential back-up compound if needed. Lead compounds will be optimized by criteria of potency, toxicity, metabolism, and pharmacokinetics. Compounds that demonstrate acceptable traits will be evaluated for efficacy in animal models of Lassa fever. These experiments will be performed initially in guinea pigs, with efficacious compounds further tested in nonhuman primates. In addition, the mechanism of antiviral action will be explored both directly and by examination of prospective viral escape mutants. Replication-deficient retroviruses that incorporate a heterologous envelope protein such as the Lassa fever virus glycoprotein (viral pseudotypes) will be used to assess compound potency and mechanism of action; these experiments can be performed using biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions. Results will be validated in BSL-4 facilities using authentic Lassa fever virus; animal studies using Lassa fever virus will also be conducted in BSL-4 facilities.",

Variola virus is highly transmissible and causes severe disease with high mortality rates. Currently, there is no FDA-approved drug for prevention or treatment of smallpox. The overall goal of this smallpox antiviral program is to advance through FDA approval a small molecule antiviral drug for treatment of smallpox. The final drug product will be a safe, effective, and orally administered antiviral compound taken three times or less daily to accommodate treatment, post-exposure prophylactic and prophylactic applications. Our current lead drug candidate, ST-246, is a novel orally bioavailable antiviral compound that is a potent and specific inhibitor of orthopoxvirus replication in vitro and in vivo. ST-246 was discovered during chemical optimization of an initial \"hit\" that came from a high throughput screen designed to identify inhibitors of vaccinia virus replication. ST-246 and related analogs inhibit vaccinia, cowpox, ectromelia (mousepox), monkeypox, camelpox and variola replication in cell culture but not other unrelated viruses. The compound is well tolerated and orally bioavailable in rodents and monkeys. Moreover, ST-246 protects mice from lethal challenge with vaccinia virus and ectromelia virus and inhibits orthopoxvirus induced disease in normal and immunodeficient mice. It is proposed in this application to advance ST-246 into clinical development by 1) optimizing dosing parameters for in vivo efficacy evaluations, 2) conducting scale up synthesis of ST-246 and initiating formulation studies for drug product manufacture in anticipation of initiating human safety and pharmacology clinical studies 3) completing IND-enabling toxicology assessments, and 4) conducting GLP animal efficacy experiments sufficient to meet animal efficacy rule requirements. These studies will support the investigational new drug (IND) application that will be submitted to the FDA to initiate human clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop interference-mitigating technology for wireless networks. The traditional 802.11 WLAN systems that have been used for data communications are becoming ubiquitous. The next generation of these systems will be relied upon for video distribution, metropolitan networking, as well as a host of other applications that are as yet undefined. They must achieve aggregate network throughput rates in excess of one Gbps while operating in the unlicensed ISM bands. This, however, must be done in the face of ever increasing interference in the bands that in turn pose a serious threat to continued market growth. The current effort will address the interference problem by successfully combining novel spectrum sensing and cognitive approaches (observe, learn, react) with a host of powerful PHY, MAC, and combined PHY-MAC protocols. This effort will look to heavily leverage a new tool in the arsenal, namely that of multiple antennae enabled nodes that are included in the major Wi-Fi and WiMax standards. The FCC revolutionized the wireless industry by opening up the unlicensed ISM bands. These bands reduce the barrier to entry for companies to introduce wireless services to niche markets without the expense and delays associated with obtaining a proprietary licensed band. The price paid for utilization of the ISM bands is interference. Traditionally these bands have been sparsely occupied, however, with ever increasing adoption of WLANs, and the emergence of WiMax and metropolitan networking in this band, interference is going to increase in significance.  If successful, the current effort will allow high utilization of the ISM bands for high throughput high fidelity applications, and will help ensure low price wireless access to the society at large.",

        "abstract": "The development of high-gradient accelerating structures is critical to reducing the cost of next generation particle colliders.  In order to develop any novel structure, such as a photo band gap structure, its responses to the drive pulse and to a beam bunch must be fully characterized.  This characterization includes the determination of wake-potentials and transient peak surface fields, and an analysis of potential field-emission in high-field regions.  Although modeling capabilities for these characterizations have recently been developed, they have yet to integrated and packaged for use by the accelerator community at large.  This project will create a specialized modeling toolkit that will be customized for high-gradient structure development, providing access to custom analysis sequences, postprocessing, and design optimization that are specific to advanced structures.  In Phase I, a prototype toolkit was created.  It contained specialized model templates for creating the complex geometry of photon band gap structures, and it also supported specialized analysis sequences for analyzing photon band gap lattices, cavities, power input couplers, and slow-wave structures.  Phase II will add time-domain modeling capabilities to the toolkit, which will greatly extend its utility for advanced structure development, enabling characterization of important effects that are very difficult to determine experimentally.   Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Accurate and sophisticated computer modeling should play a pivotal role if the development of novel structures for efficiently accelerating a charged particle beam.

        "abstract": "Strong radio-frequency electromagnetic fields in the high-power components used in colliders can induce a resonant cascade of particles near internal surfaces (called multipacting) \u00c2\u00bf which can lead to poor performance and device failure, in some cases limiting the power than can be handled to a fraction of the design requirement.  Existing tools for analyzing this phenomenon have limited accuracy, and are inefficient and difficult to use, particularly on complex three-dimensional structures.  This project will create a new capability that performs both the field solution and particle tracking on the same boundary-conforming finite-element mesh, thereby avoiding errors from inaccurate surface modeling and field interpolation, which plague existing tools.  The result will be a production-level capabilility for multipacting analysis in complex two- and three-dimensional structures.  In Phase I, a prototype capability was created that manages the calculations necessary for multipacting analysis, including the generation of radio-frequency electromagnetic field solutions, an automated search for resonant particle orbits using a new adaptive particle tracker, and the accumulation and presentation of multipacting statistics.  This capability was encapsulated within a new specialized environment hosted by a commercial analysis package and was benchmarked against established solutions for coaxial feed lines, a superconducting radio-frequency cavity, and a bunching cavity.  Phase II will improve particle tracking by adding support for higher-order curvilinear elements, interactive visualization of particle orbits, adaptive mesh refinement, and a calculation for verifying multi-particle multipacting.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new multipacting analysis tool should enable more rapid development, lower costs, and more robust device designs for a broad class of high-power radio-frequency systems used in commercial and government applications.  These systems include microwave tubes, radio-frequency \u00c2\u00bfplumbing\u00c2\u00bf for high power applications such as radar and microwave telecommunications links, commercial accelerators, and others.  In particular, DOE projects such as the International Linear Collider require high-power, radio-frequency accelerator components that are at risk of failure due to electron multipacting, yet existing analysis software has only limited utility in the quest for hardware designs that avoid this problem",

The current state of the art copper CMP process is complicated and requires multiple steps to meet the defect quality and planarity requirements. Furthermore, existing processes create high stresses during polishing, which may not be compatible with the fragile low dielectric constant materials are now being introduced by the semiconductor industry. To address these challenges the research team proposes to develop the \"soft polishing layer\" concept for gentle removal of copper that does not damage the fragile dielectric layer. The use compatible chemistries and nanoparticles in the slurry allows successful development of a flexible, defect-free, single step process to fabricate copper based interconnects that will result in substantial cost savings to the semiconductor chip manufacturers. During Phase II, the company will partner with the leading edge CMP companies and chip manufacturers to address industrial scale integration issues related to development and commercialization of the single step slurry.  With the impending introduction of new fragile ultra low k materials, CMP processes are expected to become more complicated and expensive, to achieve the necessary levels of performance. The successful implementation of the single step CMP process is expected to meet or exceed the technical performance levels of the 45 nm manufacturing node while decreasing the CMP manufacturing costs by up to 80% which translates to over $ 4 billion savings for the chip industry (10 X savings for the chip industry for every \"X\" dollar of slurry revenue). The reduction in costs is largely due to the simplification of the manufacturing process, higher throughput, increased yield, less use of capital equipment and manpower, and reduction in consumable costs. The successful completion of this project will help maintain and grow the country's leadership in nanotechnology, a key area for future health and vitality of the nation.

Unlike pump- and cell-based systems, Smartlnsulin is a \"smart\" hydrogel that self-assembles from two biomolecular building blocks: a glycosylated insulin-polymer conjugate (IPC) and a multimeric glucose-binding molecule (GBM). In SBIR Phase I of this grant, proof-of-concept efficacy and safety was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo using a diabetic Sprague-Dawley rat model. SmartCells seeks Phase II funds to rigorously optimize the in vivo safety profiles of Smartlnsulin in non-diabetic Sprague Dawley (SD) rat models as a precursor to beginning IND-enabling preclinical studies on Smartlnsulin. With Phase II funds, SmartCells seeks to: 1. Identify PEG-Con A GBM candidates with minimal serum half-life that are chemically stable, such that no immunoreactive, non-PEGylated Con A is exposed in vivo. 2. Identify formulations with minimal local and systemic single-dose toxicity as measured by custom ELISAs, histology, and spleenocyte phenotyping. 3. Develop a hyperglycemic clamp to investigate Smartlnsulin pharmacokinetics in non-diabetic rats. 4. Confirm minimal local and systemic toxicity of daily injections following Smartlnsulin release under hyperglycemic clamp conditions in non-diabetic rats. The impacts on public health as a result of this project are potentially significant. Poor glycemic control has been shown to cause a host of diabetic complications which result in over $54 billion annually in medical costs. The landmark Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), have clinically proven that tighter glycemic control, as measured by lower glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, significantly reduces the incidence of these complications.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further develop an advanced manufacturing method to both lower the cost and increase the performance of brominated carbon sorbents for power plant mercury emission control. Fine brominated carbon, a newly-commercial material, has been demonstrating a superior affinity in full-scale sorbent-injection trials for scavenging toxic mercury from power plant flue gases. In the Phase I project various production parameters were experimentally examined and the feasibility of an improved manufacturing process was preliminarily established. The Phase II project will concentrate on further developing and testing the innovative manufacturing technique.  Coal-fired power-plant mercury emissions are increasingly recognized as injurious to the environment and, ultimately, to human health. A leading retrofit technology for this application is the injection of a new material, brominated carbon, ahead of existing plant particulate controls. Consequently, successful efforts to lower the production cost and to increase the performance of these new materials will have high economic returns, potentially saving the nation tens or hundreds of millions of dollars each year.",

        "abstract": "Natural gas provides a clean and environmentally friendly fuel for electric power generation; however, the distribution network, and especially the storage system, is ill-suited for the projected gowth of natural gas for use in electical energy generation.  This project will develop a natural gas (methane) storage system based on an innovative, high-bulk-density activated carbon that is especially designed with high adsorption capacity for methane.  This adsorptive storage system would be well suited for small-scale residential and commercial users who currently use diesel generators as their backup, and for small- to mid-size electrical power generators that require some natural gas storage to meet peak electrical demands.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of using a high bulk density activated carbon, synthesized with an appropriate distribution of micropores, to adsorb natural gas (methane) at ambient temperature and relatively low pressures.  It was shown that a system based on this technology can store methane at a weight and volume that is comparable to a high-pressure cylinder, but at a fraction of the pressure.   Phase II will continue the development of methane storage materials, develop primary material packaging, fabricate a prototype adsorbed-natural-gas storage system, and perform a pilot test of the prototype device   Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The carbon-based natural gas storage system should allow residential, commercial, or small-scale power generators to store natural gas easily, without resorting to high-pressure designs.  The storage system could be filled (or refilled) from a pipeline supplied by a single-stage compressor.  Unlike liquefied natural gas storage systems, there would be no evaporative losses, and unlike liquefied natural gas and methane hydrate storage systems, the adsorptive storage does not require refrigeration, so there is no energy cost for storing the fuel.  A highly-distributed natural gas storage network would improve the security and reliability of the natural gas supply.  Finally, the room temperature and low-pressure system would provide inherent safety advantages",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To facilitate the study of causal dynamics of large-scale brain networks, we propose to develop, validate, and commercialize innovative software tools for measuring neurophysiological effective connectivity in humans. These tools potentially may be used to provide neurologists with a reliable diagnostic for locating epilepsy seizure foci, and to provide systems and cognitive neuroscientists with new techniques for assessing neural information transfer in the human brain. During Phase I, analysis methods were developed to estimate both stationary and time-varying effective connectivity among selected brain regions. These methods compute time-lagged causal information between time series which represent states of brain activity in selected regions of interest, estimated from scalp EEG. Causal information, as distinct from predictive information, is approximated by discounting identified non-causal confounds. We developed both linear and nonlinear measures, together with associated tests of statistical significance. The approach was applied successfully to (a) simulated data, (b) resting EEG, (c) cognitive event-related EEG data, and (d) ictal onset scalp EEG. In Phase II, we will design and develop an effective connectivity software toolset for research use by cognitive and clinical neurophysiologists. We will validate causal information analysis in two stages: first, by comparing the results of intracranial EEG analysis against known effective connectivities obtained via cortical electrostimulation recordings; and second, by comparing connectivity analyses of scalp versus intracranial EEG. Causal information analysis tools will be used to test connectivity hypotheses in a cognitive neuroscience application, and to evaluate potential clinical utility in epilepsy. Throughout, the new measures will be compared with traditional measures for assessing neurophysiological functional connectivity,",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Summary. Atherosclerosis is indicated by the American Heart Association as a primary factor in three fourths of deaths resulting from cardiovascular disease. It is now recognized that many coronary events and strokes are caused by atherosclerotic plaques that rupture - vulnerable plaques. It is important that the cardiologist be able to assess the risk of plaque rupture when diagnosing and treating persons with atherosclerosis. Currently available imaging tools (angioscopy, MRI, intravascular ultrasound) do not provide the high spatial resolution needed for this application. We propose to develop a rapid, high resolution optical imaging method for imaging of venous and arterial structures that will aid in the diagnosis of atherosclerosis, specifically in identifying vulnerable plaques. The new technique, which we call complex differential spectral interferometry (CDSI), will be an important improvement to optical coherence tomography (OCT). It will provide video-rate cross-sectional imaging and will have higher dynamic range than standard time domain OCT. It will be fully compatible with fiber optics allowing incorporation into endoscopes, catheters and similar devices for in vivo applications. In Phase I, we achieved a breakthrough in the development of CDSI (also known as complex Fourier domain OCT). The newly developed version resolves the problem of the complex conjugate ambiguity (one of the main drawbacks of Fourier domain OCT) in an elegant and exceptionally efficient way, which provides a two-fold increase of the maximum imaging depth. In Phase II, the new technique will be used with a novel detector, recently designed and built at Southwest Sciences. The proposed technology takes full advantage of parallel detection inherent in CDSI allowing the greater dynamic range and sensitivity of Fourier domain OCT to be realized. Relevance. Cardiovascular disease affects over 61 million Americans and is the leading cause of death in the US. The major risk is associated with atherosclerotic plaques that rupture - vulnerable plaques, - which are difficult to diagnose with currently available methods. The proposed technology will aid in the diagnosis of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques, thus providing important information for the cardiologist making risk assessments and choosing the best course of treatment, ultimately, saving lives.",

This project will develop automated software, which uses a time series of remote target observations from infrared hyperspectral imaging sensors, to dramatically improve the detection and identification of chemicals in effluent plumes.  In Phase I, optimal clutter suppression, based on co-registered multi-look images, yielded gains in plume detection sensitivity on the order of 100% for many industrial chemicals.  Multi-look methods of chemical identification realized an initial 10% improvement in false alarm reduction, and the potential for much greater improvement was indicated.

SpectraGenetics was founded to provide molecular diagnostics to impact cancer medicine. Peptide Mass Signature Genotyping (PMSG) will deliver sensitive, accurate, high throughput gene resequencing solutions to research and clinical markets that are demanding genetic biomarkers as integral parts of their early detection and drug development programs. This novel technology translates coding sequences into peptides for analysis allowing for high level multiplexing. Comprehensive analysis is achieved using a combination of translation in multiple reading frames and specific protease cleavages. The purpose of this SBIR project is to build a prototype automated RT-PMSG (Reverse Transcript-PMSG) process to provide analysis of target gene mRNA with a sensitivity that enables detection of variants that may be present as a minority component of the sample, as is often the case in a tumor nucleic acid sample. An added value of the multiplexing capability of RT-PMSG is that it allows for detection and analysis of splice variants present in an RNA sample and this capability will be exploited. Specifically, methods will be developed to produce peptide analytes in vitro using E. coli extracts for coupled transcription/translation reactions. A combination of proteases and multiple reading frames will be configured to analyze target mRNAs. The procedures for RT-PMSG will be developed using TP53 and FGFR3 mutant and alternatively spliced transcripts. Standard protocols will be automated, and validated, to achieve high- throughput, cost-effective genotyping. A high-throughput comprehensive resequencing platform that can sensitively analyze tumor-related genes in tumor nucleic acid samples will have wide application in research and clinical institutions. There is a great hope within the community that a greater understanding and characterization of tumor etiology, progression, and recurrence will enable prevention, early detection and improved treatments to reduce the pain and suffering caused by cancer.",

With rare treatment exceptions (such as Tamoxifen and Herceptin), the long-term stage-specific mortality after breast cancer diagnosis has not appreciably changed over the past 50 years. Recently, many have concluded that the single major factor in improved survival in breast cancer has been a shift toward earlier diagnosis. Despite this, the average breast tumor currently measures 2.3 cm across in the U.S. at diagnosis. In contrast to conventional wisdom that micro-calcifications and other features have led to sub- millimeter diagnosis of breast cancer, many breast tumors (30%) are still only found by pain, discharge, and palpation rather than by radiological screening programs. This leaves a large margin for improvement. In the prior R44, we met all R44 aims, and confirmed our hypothesis that early colon and breast cancers are optically detectable. Results of the prior R44 Pilot Clinical Trials are as follows:             The specific aims of this Phase II (R44) continuation proposal are: Aim 1: To manufacture a commercial-grade non-imaging spectroscopic breast scanner, sensitive to angiogenesis and cellularity, under FDA-design control and software requirements; Aim 2: To expand the pre-submission Pilot Trial into a NIH-defined Phase III pivotal trial of the FDA-submitted device enrolling a statistically-justified minimum of 500 patients at 3 centers over 36 months under GLP standards, sufficient for FDA submission, and Aim 3: To submit and obtain FDA approval under 510(k) with clinicals or PMA status during this competing renewal.",

An abdominal aneurysm is found in 5% of adults over 50, and its repair or rupture is the 13th leading cause of death in the U.S. A lethal complication of AAA repair is colon ischemia (1-2% rate of ischemia to the gut, confirmed in 2004 studies from NYU, SUNY, and DREAM study).

We have built a non-invasive research-prototype point-of-care device to detect early cancerous conditions of the uterine cervix. We have tested this prototype in a multi-center pre-pivotal study accruing data from more than 600 women for training our algorithm. We have now started our pivotal study using an FDA reviewed protocol and have collected data from 702 subjects as of this writing. We will also test a pre- production version of our device in this pivotal study. This device, which has now been designed and built as part of a fast track SBIR grant 4R44CA110149, is a cost and size reduced, portable, rugged and more user-friendly than the research prototype. It is identical to the commercial device without incurring the tooling costs necessary to enter the production phase. The current pivotal study data accrual from 720 subjects is funded by our prior Phase II grant award 2R44CA086626. However the FDA has recommended changes in our claims and claim benchmarks resulting in an increase in subject accrual to justify a PMA submission. In this Phase II continuation effort, we will accrue data from an additional 930 subjects. This additional accrual will give us the 1500 subject data required by FDA to meet our claim benchmarks. Upon completing this additional accrual we will continue with the remaining aims of our original grant award viz. validate the algorithm on all pivotal data and prepare and submit the clinical PMA application to the FDA. Cervical cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women worldwide and one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths in women in developing countries. Like all cancers, it is preventable if detected and treated early. Currently, the major obstacles to detection and treatment are inaccurate and painful tests and delays in obtaining results. Spectroscopic diagnosis has the potential of removing all of these obstacles. Thus it not only improves care and quality of life for women suffering from this cancer but also reduces the burden that this cancer poses on health care costs worldwide.",

The investigators have adapted image analysis algorithms, developed in part by a collaborator's missile ballistic systems research program, into an auto-detection and auto-analysis program called Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis (VCS). Phase I demonstrated the ability of VCS to quantify size parameters of proliferating cells in tissue sections with equal accuracy to the gold standard (manual click) approach, but with a significant 8-fold improvement in throughput efficiency. Operationally, the VCS program acquires an internal target of color pixels associated with the feature of interest, while the user performs manual data collection for the first section from the initial case in the study. Once the user verifies an acceptable level of accuracy relative to manual data collection (gold standard), the program can be switched into fully automatic mode, a combination of motorized stage control for systematic-random sampling; auto-detection of stained microscopic features of interest; and, auto-analysis of global and local size parameters and their variation based on state-of-the-art stereological principles. These investigations found that biological features that label (stain) proteins with specific immunological-based probes, followed by amplification of the signal with chromogen reactions or fluorescence, stimulate the most robust response from the VCS algorithm. Phase II will expand VCS to the 3-D analysis of all 1st-order (number, length, surface area, and volume) and 2nd-order (variation, spatial distribution) stereological parameters (Aim 1); validate 3-D VCS against the gold standard approach and identify the principal tissue processing and staining procedures to increase algorithm robustness (Aim 2); and, develop StereoTutorials and on-line documentation to assist the conversion of current users of computerized stereology systems from manual to automatic VCS approaches (Aim 3). The long-term goal for VCS is to increase the throughput efficiency for stereoanalyses of parameters on tissue sections without a loss of accuracy; reduce research costs in terms of time and labor; and, accelerate scientific progress toward improvements in health and the management of disease. Solid evidence that the PI and colleagues can successfully commercialize the VCS program in Phase III is demonstrated by worldwide sales and support of the Stereologer and other stereology resources for the past decade.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malignant melanoma, with an estimated growth in incidence of about 6% per year for decades, causes considerable loss of life. Yet melanoma can be easily cured if detected early. Digital dermoscopy has shown promise for more accurate detection, particularly at an early stage. Recent conferences have highlighted a general agreement on definition of dermoscopic features and moderate agreement on the most useful structural features. Automatic detection of these specific structures that are critical for early diagnosis and are used in various dermoscopic diagnostic algorithms would be desirable. Yet little work has been published on automatic detection of any specific dermoscopic structures. Although specific colors figure prominently in the definition of the most critical dermoscopic structures, little work has been done on finding the specific regions or region combinations in the color space where colors are located, particularly with reference to the surrounding skin. The work in Phase I and after Phase I successfully segmented the border within 5% of the range of the dermatologists' borders, found several highly accurate dermoscopy features, and brought mean diagnostic accuracy on difficult early lesions to a high level. This proposal seeks to develop a digital dermosocopy system by 1) comparing classifiers 2) testing border accuracy and modifying segmentation if needed 3) developing an algorithm that uses a three-dimensional representation of a probability density function to specify single and paired melanoma colors via cluster methods and fuzzy logic techniques 4) identifying critical structural features including brown globules, abrupt border cutoff, granularity, regression, and pigment asymmetry with high accuracy 5) developing a clinical interface for acquisition of images within the clinic 6) testing the new algorithms in six dermatology clinics including two pigmented lesion clinics with both EpiLight and DermLite II Pro dermoscopy images taken in the clinic. Key features of the research include dermatopathology confirmation of specific structures and the use of relative color analysis. If successful, software will be marketed to the growing number of dermatologists with digital dermoscopy capability. The commercial software package will be ready for marketing as a diagnostic adjunct for digital camera dermoscopy attachments. Malignant melanoma, with an estimated growth in incidence of about 6% per year for decades, causes considerable loss of life. Melanoma can be easily cured if detected early, and this project seeks to develop a digital dermoscopy device that can detect very early melanomas. The project goal is to develop inexpensive melanoma detection software and test it in multiple dermatology clinics.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The goal of this application is to develop a genetically engineered therapeutic human skin substitute with enhanced antimicrobial and angiogenenic properties for use in the treatment of type 1 diabetic skin ulcers. Chronic diabetic skin ulcers exhibit poor blood flow and typically become infected resulting in impaired wound healing and amputation, a life threatening complication of diabetes. The standard of care for chronic, infected, nonhealing diabetic wounds is antibiotic treatment and synthetic dressings. Because bacterial strains typically encountered often become antibiotic resistant, especially in the chronic wound, the clinician is limited to more potent antibiotics with undesirable effects on viability and migration of cells in the diabetic skin ulcer. This, coupled with the growing concern over emerging new multi-resistant strains of bacteria, underscores the need for innovative approaches to supplement antibiotic treatment regimes used in open wound therapy.  Stratatech Corporation's strategy to promote wound healing in infected diabetic skin ulcers is to develop a novel human skin substitute possessing a range of enhanced antimicrobial, re-epithelialization, and vascularization properties. Our FastTrack SBIR proposal outlines proven strategies for the generation of human skin substitutes genetically engineered to secrete biologically active antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) capable of stimulating vascularization and cell migration. Animal models of type 1 diabetes and chronic wound healing will be used to test the hypothesis that a human skin substitute tissue containing human AMPexpressing cells will prevent chronic wound infection, facilitate re epithelialization, and vascularization, and thus provide an optimal environment for the healing of diabetic wounds. Advances in ex vivo genetic engineering of a patented human keratinocyte cell line at Stratatech Corporation has made our young company uniquely positioned to generate genetically enhanced human skin substitutes for use in the treatment of type 1 diabetic skin ulcers.",

Despite that, efficient, inexpensive and simple-to-apply wound-healing drugs are presently unavailable. Here, we initiated the development of such a drug. In Phase I we demonstrated the superior wound-healing activity of a collagen-, fibroblast- and angiostimulatory compound isolated in our lab from a medicinal plant used for chronic wound treatment. The bioactivity of this compound has been validated in healing-impaired diabetic mice and in wounded human skin graft/mouse chimeras. Furthermore, the preliminary safety studies showed that the topical application of this product may be safe. In this Phase II project we propose to a) establish the optimal bioactive dose of this compound using rodent and rabbit wound-healing models; b) demonstrate in rodents, rabbits and swines that this compound is more efficient than the wound-healing prescription drug currently used in clinic; c) demonstrate that this drug- candidate not only does stimulate wound healing, but also results in greater tensile strength of the healed tissue, d) validate its safety in a series of PK/ADME/Toxicology tests. Together, the proposed experiments should confirm the therapeutic potential of this novel wound-healing compound and advance its development towards the IND application.",

        "abstract": "In the near future, there will be an urgent need for large quantities of Nb3Sn superconductor for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), an experimental fusion device.  However, the DOE has only a few domestically-located companies that are capable of supplying this need, and two of these are subsidiaries of European companies that have orders and commitments to the EU fusion program.  Thus, there is a serious need for a U.S. company that can supply some of this superconductor.  This project will demonstrate that a United States company can supply superconductor strands that meet  toroidal-field specifications from production-size billets.  In Phase I, several lengths of strand were made from two small billets, without any fabrication problems.  The aim was to meet the specification for the central solenoid conductor, which has lower electrical loss and slightly lower critical current density.  The material produced had a lower critical current density than required, but the reasons for this result were identified and are not thought to be insurmountable.  Phase II will focus on reducing the distortion of the filaments, enlarging the billets, controlling the spacing-to-diameter ratio of the superconductor rods, and improving the critical current density.  First, small billets will be fabricated to enable the process to be refined and modified to meet the toroidal-field specification.  Afterwards, large billets will be fabricated to demonstrate the viability of a domestic strand supplier.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:   In addition to the fusion application, Nb3Sn superconductors should find use in open-area Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), where the patient is more accessible to the surgeon.  (MRI is the largest commercial application of low temperature superconductors.)  There is also a need for this type of product in High Energy Physics research and in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance",

Syandus's current interactive delivery platform allows pharmaceutical firms and content experts to communicate complex concepts to physicians and patients through interactive presentations, discussion groups or self-directed learning. The addition of network-enabled collaboration afforded by this proposed project creates the opportunity for interaction between users and content experts without the constraints of geography. The integration of multiplayer game technology into Syandus's platform requires the innovative application of this technology to serve a new purpose. This proposal will support modification of the existing platform to function in a collaborative setting, building a collaborative engine to synchronize application data between users, integration of a third party multiplayer networking solution and development of a prototype application to test collaborative functionality. Syandus has completed projects with several of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies for the delivery of innovative medical education products based on the existing platform. In the first business application derived from this proposed concept, physicians will be able to remotely connect with nationwide content experts to interactively learn the latest best practices and medical science in a more compelling way than currently available. The pharmaceutical industry strives to communicate medical science innovation and new treatment methods through an information cascade from international and national level thought leaders, to regional physician thought leaders, to practicing physicians and their patients. The anticipated results from the proposed concept will be a learning tool for pharmaceutical companies that allow groups of physicians nationwide to have an interactive dialog about a disease state and appropriate treatment. Longer term, in the educational realm, Syandus's technology could be used to develop more sophisticated collaborative learning environments that allow students, regardless of geographical location, to assemble in a virtual biological world or system (such as a cell or organ) and work together as individuals or in groups to solve problems and optimize processes. A highly rewarding learning experience can be created through the free exchange of information and ideas enabled by a collaborative network coupled with compelling visuals, rich interactivity and the underlying intelligence of mathematical models. Transforming Syandus's existing platform with multi user capability adds rich human interaction into the remote learning process, brings scientific models to life, and allows greater dissemination of knowledge.",

Phase I funding for this project enabled the successful development of an electrophysiological tool, based on recording the visual evoked potential from the surface of the head, to assess the integrity of select visual pathways known to be affected by the disease process of glaucoma. The goal of the proposed Phase II project is to refine this instrument to serve as a diagnostic screening device for this ophthalmic disorder. Glaucoma affects millions of Americans and it is one of the leading causes of blindness in the U.S. today. It produces a gradual and progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells. Unfortunately, by the time this glaucomatous neuropathy is detected, there is typically extensive and permanent damage to the visual system, and profound loss in visual function. Presently, there is a paucity of screening and diagnostic tools available to vision professionals that can aid in the early detection of this disease and in the monitoring of treatments for the purpose of neuroprotection. There is evidence to indicate that select large-cell (magnocellular) pathways in the visual system are affected in an early stage of the disease. We intend to exploit this knowledge in the development of the proposed system. Specific Aims: 1. Improve the performance of the current prototype device through the addition of hardware and software features such as eye movement monitoring and automated noise detection. 2. Evaluate the operation and reliability of the modified device in a multi-center study of glaucoma patients, glaucoma suspects, ocular hypertensives, and age-similar control observers. 3. Develop an equation for prediction of glaucomatous damage from the set of response measures obtained to optimize the accuracy of the screening test.",

This project will develop high temperature capacitors by using a new type of temperature-compensating nanocomposite dielectrics.  The approach will be based on the use of materials with a positive temperature coefficient of dielectric constant, and a particular design for the composite microstructure.  Phase I demonstrated dielectrics with less than 14% reduction in dielectric constant over a range from room temperature to 300oC, with relatively low dielectric loss and high resistivity.  During Phase II, manufacturing formulations and processes for high-temperature capacitors will be developed and optimized, and the performance the capacitors will be assessed through actual application testing.   Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new capacitors should have application in consumer electronics, medical electronics including defibrillators, automotive electronics including electric vehicles, and electric utilities.

There is therefore a recognized need to enhance the surgical repair of rotator cuff injuries. Recently, extracellular matrices have been used to aid surgical repair of connective tissues, although they have very modest mechanical properties and do not represent optimal designs of a product for their application. The objective of this program is to develop a product that has characteristics specifically designed to aid the surgical repair of rotator cuff injuries. A functional tissue engineering approach is being used to develop a device that will enhance the surgical repair of rotator cuff tendons. The device will be generated using the application of new technologies that have recently been developed at Synthasome, for which patent applications have been filed. The final product will be a device composed of a biomaterial with mechanical properties similar to native human rotator cuff tendon (designed to stabilize the repair site and confer mechanical functionality during the repair process), coated with a human extracellular matrix (to support in vivo biological repair). The overall long term hypothesis that this program will test is that a tissue engineered acellular construct composed of a functional scaffold and an extracellular matrix, designed to provide mechanical stability and functionality and support biologic repair, will enhance the quality of surgical repair for rotator cuff injury. The objectives of a previous Phase I application have been achieved. The objectives of this Phase II project are to determine the device effectiveness and safety in vivo (using a canine model of rotator cuff repair), and develop a human extracellular matrix-based repair product and test its safety in vivo (using a standardized biocompatibility model). Specific Aim 1. Determine effectiveness of the device in vivo, using a canine model of rotator cuff repair. Specific Aim 2. Prepare a human repair construct, and determine biocompatibility of the device. The successful outcome of these Aims will be the development of an acellular, human-based tissue engineered construct with the demonstrated ability to enhance the repair of rotator cuff injury, and with demonstrated safety. The successful outcome of this project will be the development of an acellular, human-based tissue engineered construct with the demonstrated safety and ability to enhance the repair of rotator cuff injury.

A major challenge for biomedical research in the post-genomic era will be to identify and understand the mechanisms by which gene regulatory sequences coordinate gene transcription in normal and disease-affected pathways. The goal of the proposed program is to develop and make commercially available a set of validated lentiviral transcriptional reporter vectors and reporter cell lines for the most critical disease-related signal transduction pathways. These pathway-specific reporter vectors will allow researchers to study pathway mechanisms and identify changes in the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of human diseases. Under Phase I funding, a set of lentiviral transcriptional reporter vectors, technology for construction of transcriptional factor- specific constructs, and high complexity transcriptional reporter libraries were developed and validated for the p53 pathway in the HeLa cell model. High-throughput technology for identification of functional reporter constructs based on combination of bar-coded transcriptional reporter libraries and Affymetrix GeneChip(tm) microarrays was developed. A set of single color transcriptional reporter vectors and constructs for 15 different transcriptional factors was released as commercial products. Under Phase II funding, we propose to extend the program towards the development and commercialization of a comprehensive set of validated lentiviral reporter constructs for 25 well-characterized transcriptional factors with dual color luciferase and fluorescent reporters, covering about 30 major signal transduction pathways associated with a wide range of human diseases. The functional validation of individual constructs will be performed by screening the high complexity transcriptional reporter library against an array of different cell lines treated by different therapeutic and signal transducing agents and by knockdown of specific transcriptional factors by siRNA constructs. The established technology will be applied, in collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, for identification of targets for drug development aimed at the restoration of suppressed p53 pathway in a set of human carcinoma cell line models. The anticipated outcomes of the proposed research and will be a commercially available set of kits comprising of lentiviral reporter constructs, a collection of stable transcriptional reporter cell lines for drug screening applications, a database of functional activity of different transcriptional response elements and transcriptional modules, and several validated anticancer drug targets. In addition, we will launch human and mouse genome-wide transcriptional reporter libraries, which will be a powerful research tool for the discovery of novel transcriptional factors associated with disease state.",

Since the early 80's, the computer aided design (CAD) market has grown dramatically, and 3D CAD has become the most technically-advanced tool for designing complex shapes. However, very little work has been done to merge the physical clay and CAD environments. Virtual Clay aims to fuse these environments, blurring the line between art and engineering and giving designers a unified modeling tool at all stages of development.  By advancing the state of the art in design and opening new worlds of design to mechanical engineers designing and modeling products, broad impacts are anticipated. The Virtual Clay system represents a significant advancement in wearable computing, where the user directly manipulates a virtual object with his or her hand. Further, a physics-based simulation of clay in a design environment promises to open new areas of exploration in the CAD world. By giving control to the user of not only the design, but the simulation environment itself (the user can control how soft or hard the clay is, for example), a whole new way of thinking about how simulation and CAD can evolve. Further, artists and engineers will benefit from being able to watch and decipher every manipulation that an expert modeler has completed on the virtual clay. Bringing a physical medium to a digital environment will thus open up numerous possibilities in design, assessment and analysis, testing, and collaboration.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The U.S. health care system depends on an estimated 52 million informal caregivers to provide care to ill or disabled adults in their homes. Most of these caregivers are family or friends, not paid assistants or volunteers. Increasingly, they are caring for the seriously ill and those with progressive life-threatening illness. As life expectancy rises, death comes after years of chronic disease and the numbers of those \"living with dying\" grows. Family and friends are called upon to act as caregivers, advocates, and proxies for loved ones who are approaching the end of life. To meet these challenges, family caregivers need information for decision making, skills education to manage the many tasks involved in providing end-of-life care, and emotional support. Care Companion will offer an integrated service consisting of standalone and \"live\" components, including 1) interactive multimedia resource that provides professionally reviewed information on end-of-life and skills training deliverable on CD ROM or online; 2) a comprehensive online service that provides the CD ROM / online content parsed for customized access (via registered user profiles), user-generated content (from online events and user contributions), and peer-to-peer interaction and sociability. This integrated customized education and support environment is based on the following assumptions: 1) better-informed family members will be better caregivers, 2) learning is enhanced as part of a social process, 3) the combination of education and support will enhance the care giving experience and reduce its negative effects on caregivers. By supporting family caregivers we hope to improve the quality of end-of-life care for care receivers and their families. The combination of online education and peer support will be scientifically evaluated using a randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of Care Companion in reducing the adverse effects of care giving. Effects on caregivers will include self-report of their physical and mental well health (SF 12) and their emotional response to their situation (perceived stress, coping, perceived self-competency, and loneliness).",

The system will follow a stored map, using GPS for location outdoors and providing location indoors with an inertial guidance system that is periodically updated and re-centered through a small number of light fixtures which are modulated to give a location signal while still providing non-flickering illumination. IONS will provide a seamless transition from outdoors to indoors, allowing one system to be used for all wayfmding. Users can access maps through wireless networks (WiFi) and can use IONS to create their own maps for later use or for sharing with blind friends. Phase I demonstrated the concept and showed performance indoors equivalent to verbal directions given by a skilled mobility specialist. This project will develop a more convenient optical sensor for users, improve system accuracy and audio guidance, and incorporate a commonly used mapping database. The project will develop software for use on more powerful computers and ultimately for use on personal data assistants (PDAs) and even cellphones. In Phase II the system will be installed in a commercial facility and its full indoor/outdoor capability demonstrated and evaluated in comparison with verbal wayfinding techniques by having subjects follow a route outdoors to the door of a building, then indoors to reach a specific destination. This system will help people who are blind to live and travel more independently and increase their opportunities and capability for employment. It will enhance their lifestyles and decrease their dependence on sighted people. The system should also have value for people with cognitive disorders and those who are unable to read signs or who would otherwise benefit from audio guidance in wayfinding. Products resulting from this project will be the computerized IONS system for wayfinding, the remote Talking Lights optical sensor and software.",

New advances in the technology of micropattern detectors, and in particular Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs), offer significant improvements in performance over traditional tracking detectors.  This project will develop a commercial source of GEM foils for use in the nuclear and high energy research community.  Phase I involved a systematic investigation of various aspects of the production of GEM foils.  Detailed measurements were made on the physical properties of the foils, such as hole size, hole spacing, and hole geometry.  The principle cause of a gain instability was identified and solved by the use of a cleaning agent in the last stage of production.  Overall, the study has lead to a much better understanding of the manufacturing process and to improved performance of the foils.  Phase II will concentrate on improving the quality, reliability, uniformity and gain stability of the GEMs.  Specific studies will involve measurements of gain stability over time, spatial gain uniformity, and rate dependent effects.  The primary objectives of Phase II will be to identify the critical manufacturing parameters involved in producing reliable high-quality foils and to develop a capability for producing larger foils, while maintaining good quality control.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Entamoebga histolytica is a protozoan parasite and the causative agent of amebiasis in humans. Intestinal amebiasis causes debilitating diarrhea and dysentery, while extraintestinal amebiasis occurs when the parasite migrates from the intestinal tract to organs throughout the body, most commonly the liver. The NIAID Blue Ribbon Panel on Biodefense Agents B&C targeted E. histolytica as one of the three parasitic pathogens of highest priority for research because it is environmentally stable, infectious at a low dose, and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. E. histolytica cysts are predominantly acquired through ingestion of contaminated food and water, leading to 50 million cases of amebic colitis and amebic liver abscess annually, and an estimated 100,000 deaths occurring due to infection. Accurate diagnosis of infection by fecal microscopy, antigen testing, PCR, or IFA leads to successful treatment and full recovery. Several issues confound proper diagnosis, including the litany of other organisms that can cause similar intestinal symptoms, the presence of non-pathogenic Entamoeba spp. in the fecal specimen, and the lack of fecal positive results once amebic infections become invasive. E. histolytica must be specifically identified since non-pathogenic strains of Entamoeba spp. colonize the human intestine at 3-10 fold the rate of E. histolytica, making E. histolytica-specific diagnostics of particular value. Proper identification eliminates misdiagnosis of symptoms and treatment with unnecessary and possibly dangerous drugs. Further, a simple method of diagnosis must be made available to identify invasive amebiasis in the absence of positive fecal testing. This STTR Phase II application describes the GMP manufacture of two integrated rapid diagnostic tests used for the identification of intestinal and extraintestinal amebic infections in humans. Specific Aim #1 highlights production and FDA clearance of the E. HISTOLYTICA ANTIGEN QUIK CHEKTM test, which is designed to identify E. histolytica- specific antigen in fecal specimens from patients with amebic colitis, and in serum, whole blood, saliva and urine from patients with extraintestinal amebiasis. Specific Aim #2 highlights production and FDA clearance of the E. HISTOLYTICA ANTIBODY QUIK CHEKTM test, which is designed to detect anti-E. histolytica antibodies in serum samples of patients exposed to E. histolytica who are antigen negative. The tests will be manufactured at TechLab, Inc. using reagents developed through our partnership with the University of Virginia. The tests will be provided to UVA and our consortium sites in Bangladesh and Germany for clinical testing. Both sites have access to specimens and patients from areas where amebiasis is endemic. Further, Specific Aim #3 highlights analysis of these two tests together in point-of-care environments in order to identify the most effective diagnostic strategy for identifying amebiasis in humans.",

Many of these codes are being and will be used in integrated modeling efforts required for the successful operation of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER).  However, each such effort is concerned primarily with new physics and pays relatively low attention to interoperability of the developed components.  Because fusion scientists need to ensure that these various codes can work interchangeably, this project will develop a componentization framework (as opposed to a coupling framework) that will contain a set of common interfaces for coupling commonly used types of fusion codes (including equilibrium, stability and transport).  The interfaces will be developed in consensus with several teams involved in integrated modeling, and the components will work interchangeably in multiple coupling frameworks, such as SWIM and CPES.  In Phase I, the compatibility of the standards of the National Transport Code Collaboration (NTCC) \u00c2\u00bf which consists of modules extracted from established fusion codes \u00c2\u00bf were analyzed, and an approach to the modernization and componentization of several NTCC transport modules and solvers was developed.

        "abstract": "Superconducting radio frequency (SRF) accelerator cavities lose power to stray electrons, especially when the electron motion is in resonance with the fields and the electrons strike the cavity surface repeatedly (multipacting).  One of the main tools for studying multipacting is numerical simulation, but none of the existing codes has sufficiently realistic models of all the physical processes.  One main limitation of present modeling approaches is the lack of three-dimensionality.  A related need is for parallel computing to handle the increased computational requirements of running in three dimensions.  Typically, new designs for SRF cavities are tested by building physical prototypes and examining their performance.  This practice renders the use of a large variety of different geometries (for different accelerating sections) problematic, due to the high cost of prototyping the different designs.  This project will add needed models and features to the VORPAL plasma simulation code so it can function as a virtual prototyping tool for understanding multipacting in SRF cavities.  Phase I demonstrated that VORPAL\u00c2\u00bfs higher-order conformal boundary algorithms and flexible interface could be used to accurately model the electromagenetic fields in typical SRF cavities.

Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:   In addition to the application for Nuclear Physics accelerators, SRF cavities are major component of free electron lasers.  Consequently, the new design tool for SRF cavities should provide low cost prototyping for industries that use free electron lasers, such as defense and surface processing.",

This project will develop a novel, fully-kinetic simulation code to investigate the loading of heavy metals into ECR ion sources (ECRIS) via such alternate mechanisms as vapor loading, ion sputtering, and laser ablation.  In Phase I, a massively-parallel 3D particle-in-cell (PIC) code was enhanced by adding impact ionization and recombination models.

The feasibility of using a particle-in-cell (PIC) code to model important kinetic effects in an ECRIS plasma was demonstrated.  In Phase II, coordinated simulations and experiments will be used to optimize the location and orientation within the ECR magnetic bottle for both a metal vapor oven and a biased rod for ion sputtering.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop an absorbable hernia mesh that is superior to existing products and can be cleared through the FDA' 510k premarket notification process. An absorbable mesh made of Tepha's PHA4400 biomaterial would have several key advantages over existing products and is clearly indicated by the trend in the market place towards lighter, more flexible and partially absorbable meshes. The absorbability of the mesh would reduce late term fistula and risk of infection and possibly tissue adhesions. Greater flexibility of the fiber will reduce mesh stiffness and eventual absorption will reduce the stiffness of the resulting tissue repair. The product is expected to find further application where current synthetic non-absorbable meshes provide poor outcomes, such as implantation in contaminated surgical fields, or in pediatric patients where they can hinder growth. The total number of patients that could benefit from this new mesh is large if it proves to be superior to existing options. Approximately, 1.5 million inguinal hernia repair procedures and 200,000 ventral hernia procedures are performed each year. The research approach will employ a new absorbable biomaterial, known as poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (also known as PHA4400), that has been shown to have prolonged strength retention in vivo compared to existing absorbable suture biomaterials. The specific aims of the project are to: (1) prepare three configurations of a PHA4400 mesh with an initial burst strength comparable to commercial synthetic (polypropylene) hernia meshes; (2) evaluate the new mesh configurations in an animal model for hernia repair and select the most appropriate mesh for further development; (3) evaluate the biocompatibility of the finished device; (4) develop methods to characterize the finished device for tensile strength, suture pullout strength, burst strength and tear resistance; (5) determine the degradation profile for the mesh in a long- term animal implantation study; (6) evaluate the surgical functionality of the mesh for hernia repair in an animal model; (7) evaluate the stability of the product and package in a one-year accelerated aging study. In addition to the FDA's specific requirements, if time allows, we also plan to (a) evaluate the ability of the mesh to resist adhesions, and (b) evaluate the utility of this mesh in a contaminated surgical field and/or determine the potential for compatibility in a setting of infection. In addition to developing a product that could improve surgical outcomes of hernia repair procedures, the research will also help to introduce a new absorbable medical biomaterial into the medical community that could find other uses, for example, in controlled release, tissue engineering, and other devices. The objective of this project is to develop a new improved hernia mesh using a novel absorbable biomaterial. It is anticipated that the product could reduce the incidence of complications resulting from current hernia repair procedures. A large number of patients could benefit from this product if it proves to be better than existing hernia meshes as more than 1.5 million patients undergo hernia repair procedures each year.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of our anti-acne drug discovery and development program is to produce a novel therapeutic for acne that adresses both the bacterial and inflammatory component of this disease. Our approach to accomplish this goal involves evaluating a focused series of patented 5-naphthoylsalicylanildes in biological systems predictive of clinical anti-acne activity (this Phase 1), and choosing the best compound from these studies for progression to pre-clinical pharmaceutical development (Phase 2) and clinical trials in humans (Phase 3). The combined biological and physico-chemcial properties of the 5-naphtholysalicylanilides gives them a unique advantage over several other drugs and formulations currently used in the treatment of this disorder. These include: 1) a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with exceptional activity against Propionibacterium acnes (a significant factor in the progression of acne) as well as other dermal pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and other Staphylococcus species that may play a secondary role in this condition; 2) potent dermal anti-inflammatory activity, 3) inhibition of cyclooxygenases and PgE2 production, 4) inhibitory activity against certain tissue destructive enzymes such as the matrix-metalloproteases 2 and 9 and neutrophil elastase which are activated in response to infection; 5) high lipophilicy which makes them suitable for use in topically administered treatments for conditions where they can partition and act in lipid rich components of affected sites and 5) a high level of both topical and oral safety These qualities, plus the patent status of the technology, make an optimized 5-naphthoylsalicylanilide an excellent candidate for development as an active anti-acne agent. In Phase 1 we chose an optimized compound for progression (Naphthafluor). In Phase 2 we are requesting support for several preclinical pharmaceutical development and safety studies required before evaluation in humans can commence. We expect the success of these studies will entice a major pharmaceutical partner to pursue the continued development and clinical evaluation of Naphthafluor (Phase 3) as an anti-acne treatment.",

This Phase II project continues research and development of an Emotional Intelligence (El) intervention, \"Insight!\", for children ages 5-7. \"Insight!\" offers multi-media resources and a skill-based curriculum specifically aimed at enhancing El competencies that is innovative in content and format. It provides a unique means of bridging the intervention setting with home efforts to promote emotional and social functioning of children. During Phase I, the prototype was developed and tested for feasibility with community- and school-based mental health professionals and elementary school teachers. Skill acquisition and product feasibility were tested with parents and children. Product feasibility was successfully established and substantial support for continued development was provided. Phase II will utilize Phase I findings to revise, modify, and extend intervention components to maximize quality and effectiveness. Once finalized, a scientific evaluation of intervention efficacy for mastery of El concepts and positive changes in emotional, social, and behavioral functioning will be conducted. Given \"Insight!\" is applicable within both community and school settings, two efficacy trials will be conducted. For the clinic-based trial, 100 children will be randomly assigned to treatment or control conditions. For the school-based trial, six K-2nd grade classrooms in each of two participating schools (one treatment, one control) will be randomly chosen to participate. For both trials, outcome data will be collected from child participants, parents, and teachers regarding participants' skill acquisition and emotional, social and behavioral functioning. Children, parents, and professionals will also evaluate quality and usability of \"Insight!\". Spanish translations of final versions will be created and a web-based distribution center developed with access to downloadable materials, shopping cart capability, and options for participation in interactive online training. Development of psychiatric disorders due to socio-emotional deficits is a public health concern with annual US economic, indirect cost of mental illnesses estimated at $79 billion. Development and implementation of efficacious El interventions such as \"Insight!\" can reduce these costs.",

Because lithium-ion batteries have a higher energy density relative to the presently-used nickel-metal hydride batteries, lithium-ion batteries have the potential to extend the range of these vehicles, while also reducing battery mass and size.  In particular, lithium iron phosphate \u00c2\u00bf which offers much higher safety, higher abuse tolerance, longer cycle life, and lower cost \u00c2\u00bf presents an opportunity to accelerate the introduction of lithium-ion batteries for automotive applications.  However, the low-temperature performance of present lithium iron phosphate materials does not meet the targets of the U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium.  This project will conduct a study to improve the low-temperature performance of lithium iron phosphate.  Phase I targeted the activation energy for transport processes, as a potential pathway for improving the low-temperature performance of lithium iron phosphate.  Phase II will continue the strategies identified in Phase I and develop a material that meets the requirements for automotive batteries at low temperature.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Because of its great advantages in cost and safety relative to presently-used, metal-oxide cathode materials, an improved lithium-iron-phosphate cathode would accelerate the introduction of lithium-ion batteries for hybrid electric vehicle applications.

A number of studies have shown that AMT is effective in facilitating epithelial wound healing and reducing stromal inflammation, scarring and unwanted new blood vessel formation. Using the Principal Investigator's proprietary method, Bio-Tissue, a subsidiary of TissueTech, Inc., has distributed more than 10,000 human amniotic membrane products (trademark name: \"AmnioGraft(tm)\") to more than 1,200 ophthalmic surgeons worldwide since 1997. Nevertheless, the AmnioGraft(tm) transplantation procedure requires the use of sutures and surgery in an operating room. Under past SBIR Phase I grant support, we developed a \"suture-less\" AmnioGraft(tm), currently trademarked as Prokera(tm) (formerly called AmnioLens) as a first step toward achieving our ultimate objective of performing AMT without sutures to reduce the medical cost and facilitate the ease of patient care, especially for those patients suffering from severe ocular surface destruction such as Stevens Johnson syndrome and chemical burns. Now that Prokera(tm) has received FDA's 510(k) approval as a Class II device (Dec 2003), we would like to accomplish the following three tasks in this Phase II SBIR application. Aim 1: To automate the manufacturing process for FDA-approved Prokera(tm) to meet the projected increase of clinical uses. Aim 2: To explore the future clinical applicability of FDA-approved Prokera(tm) to promote corneal nerve regeneration in neurotrophic corneas caused by diseases and surgeries before epithelial breakdown takes place. Aim 3: To develop and complete pre-clinical testing of \"ProKera-S\", a second generation of softskirt ProKera(tm) that provides more comfort to patients receiving excimer laser-assisted corneal refractive surgeries. Taken together, we may further promote our business development by expanding the market potential using Prokera(tm) for suture-less AMT.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although injection and aspiration of soft tissues and joints is a mainstay in the therapy of rheumatic diseases, surveys of training programs have continually shown that medical trainees are not able to practice these procedures with sufficient repetition and supervision to become technically proficient. Most physicians, therefore, have to learn these important procedures in a very sub-optimal fashion by practicing on their patients in an unsupervised environment once they are in the community. To address this and other lack of training opportunities in medical procedures, Touch of Life Technologies, Inc. is pioneering the creation of virtual reality based simulators, among which is the Virtual Reality-based Joint Injection Simulator (VR-JIS). The VR-JIS offers a virtual knee or shoulder combined with haptically enabled virtual palpation, virtual syringe, and simulated ultrasound to create an environment for structured and monitored practice of joint injection procedures. The VR-JIS includes a Mentor program that provides instruction, guidance, and testing. Solutions to all technically challenging aspects of the Mentor and simulator combination have been demonstrated during the phase I effort. In this phase II effort, the system will be matured to a production system ready for standalone use in training programs around the world. The specific aims of the phase II effort to accomplish this are: 1) Add a wide and relevant range of pathologies including varying size potential spaces, 2) Refine the Mentor/Simulator to seamlessly control all relevant states of the simulation, 3) Create a complete curriculum of needle procedures relevant to the knee and shoulder, and 4) Validate the efficacy of the resulting system. This effort will develop a computer-based system for practicing needle insertion techniques for joints. The system is designed to reduce the trainee's dependence on patients as training devices.",

        "abstract": "Currently, the best performing ultra-capacitors, an important technology for hybrid electric vehicles, utilize a non-aqueous electrolyte based on acetonitrile, which is highly flammable and considered toxic.  Alternative electrolytes that do not contain acetonitrile are based primarily on propylene carbonate and have about 35% of the conductivity of those with acetonitrile, which significantly degrades the performance of the capacitor.  This project will develop and synthesize a number of new quaternary ammonium tetrafluoroborates and determine their solubility and maximum conductivity in non-acetonitrile electrolytes.  Phase I successfully found and developed a group of non-acetonitrile electrolytes with conductivity as high as 60% of the acetonitrile-containing electrolytes.  In addition, the flash point of these electrolytes was increased from 2oC to 120oC (increased safety), and the allowable capacitor voltage was increased from about 2.8 volts to over 4.2 volts (increased performance).  The increased performance and safety were accomplished with relatively non-toxic, low-cost solvents and newer versions of quaternary ammonium tetrafluoroborate salts.  Phase II will complete the optimization and final selection of the preferred electrolyte compositions.  Processes for manufacturing and purifying the preferred electrolytes will be developed on a small pilot scale.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new ultra-capacitor electrolytes should overcome a major safety and hazard barrier in the wide acceptance of the use of ultra-capacitors in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and electric vehicles (EV).  The replacement of the currently used acetonitrile-based electrolytes with these essentially non-flammable, non-toxic, higher-voltage electrolytes could eliminate the safety issues that have been raised for ultra capacitors.  Further, the use of ultra-capacitors with these new safe, high performance electrolytes should aid the rapid commercialization of HEVs and EVs",

        "abstract": "Ethylene and propylene, two of the most important building blocks of the U.S. petrochemical industry, are produced by steam cracking of ethane, propane, or heavier hydrocarbons and are also a by-product of fluid catalytic cracking.  Unfortunately, as produced, these species are always in admixture with other species from which they must be separated.  The conventional method of separation is cryogenic distillation, which is extremely energy intensive.  In this project, the best features of liquid-liquid extraction and membranes will be combined into a novel membrane-mediated extraction (MME) process.  The process will use complexing agents, which are commercially viable and for which their ability to extract olefins has been quantified; their use in a high-surface-area membrane module will enhance their extraction efficiency due to the increased transport area.  During Phase I, selected solvents and complexing agents were synthesized and used in batch laboratory extractions.  The effect of solvent type, complexing agent composition, feed molecular type, and other parameters were evaluated for the extraction of olefins of commercial interest.  During Phase II, the nature of the molecular interactions between olefins of different size and specific complexing agents will be quantified.  The optimum complexing-agent/solvent combination will be scaled up and used in a pilot plant, which will be constructed in Phase II.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The MME process could be used to effectively recover olefins from waste streams.  Correspondingly, the first application for this process will be the recovery of valuable olefin from a waste stream produced by a major chemical company in Texas.  The waste stream contains approximately 13 wt % of this olefin in an isoparaffininc solvent and is currently incinerated for lack of a cost-effective method of recovering the olefins.   The process also provides environmental credits for eliminating incineration.  Once demonstrated on a small scale for this application, the process would be expected to work well for ethane/ethylene or propane/propylene separation in steam cracking operations.",

However, currently available therapy remains unsatisfactory. In this project, we propose to electrically stimulate the small intestine for the treatment of obesity. The feasibility of intestinal electrical stimulation has been demonstrated in Phase I of this project. The long-term aim is to develop an implantable stimulator for the treatment of patients with obesity using the proposed IES method. It is hypothesized that IES reduces weight by reducing food intake via its inhibitory effects on stomach motor functions and by reducing intestinal absorption via its excitatory effect on intestinal transit of nutrients. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) to test the functionality and reliability of a newly developed implantable stimulator in animals, 2) to optimize the performance of IES with various stimulation parameters in animals, 3) to investigate long-term efficacy and safety in reducing weight in animal models of obesity. A multidisciplinary team has been assembled with extensive knowledge and experience in engineering, physiology and clinical medicine related to device development, the gastrointestinal system, electrical stimulation, and obesity. Physiological experiments are designed to study the feasibility and to optimize the proposed method. A prototype implantable stimulator has been developed. The long-term efficacy and safety of the proposed method will be investigated using the stimulator in a porcine model.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) or comet assay is now recognized worldwide as a simple and inexpensive method for detection of different types of DNA damage. Adoption of the comet assay for genotoxic studies has been hampered to date by the lack of a standardized platform and procedures for the assay, as well as the labor-intensive nature of the assay for multiple-sample analysis. Another problem associated with the assay is that to avoid introduction of artificial DNA damage to cells, the assay needs to be run of freshly isolated cells or tissues. This make it difficult to direct compare cells collected at various times, or to collect samples in the field where the assay cannot immediately performed. Trevigen in the Phase I application developed a high throughput comet slides for standardization of the comet slide preparation for the assay. These slides are available at present in formats for single assay analysis (2 well format) and also for high throughput analysis (20 and 96 well format). Trevigen also demonstrated in preliminary studies that it is possible to preserve cells without DNA damage for analysis later or to use as standards in subsequent assays. The goals of the Phase II application are: 1. To standardize the electrophoretic platform and procedures for the comet assay by developing a controlled environment for electrophoresis of the damaged DNA in the cells, which will eliminate the problems, associated with reproducibility of the comet assay in the day to day operation. 2. To develop comet assay standards based on cells, which were treated with various concentration of DNA damaging agents, and long term preservation of these standards or other biological materials, to be used as reference material in the comet assay. The accomplishment of these aims will results in a standardized comet assay procedure, which can be used in any laboratory and can be developed as a high throughput automatic system. The preservation of cells without DNA damage will allow development of standards for the comet assay and will allow that biological material could be archived for future studies or to be shared between laboratories. It would also allow field collected samples to be safely transported for analysis later. The single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) or comet assay is a simple and inexpensive method for detection of different types of DNA damage. The long-term objective of this project is to develop standardized platform and procedures, including DNA standards for this assay.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) comprises a family of viruses of over 100 different strains. The high-risk strains of HPV cause cervical cancer, which is the second leading cause of female cancer mortality worldwide with 288,000 deaths yearly. The goal of the proposed work is to develop a DNA-based diagnostic test for the oncogenic strains of HPV that is more rapid and has significantly lower false positives and false negatives than the currently available test. In Phase I, Trevigen established proof-of -principal for a combined real-time DNA amplifacation technique called LAMP (loop-mediated amplification) with cleavage by thermophilic DNA repair enzymes (SNIPases), of an immobilized probe targeted to the E7 gene of HPV16, an oncogenic strain that causes over 50% of all cervical cancers. The presence of the cleavage product, diagnostic for the HPV16 target DNA, was detected as a colored band on a lateral flow membrane. The lateral flow platform was chosen because of its simplicity and readout in less than 10 minutes. Under Phase II funding, we propose to optimize the real-time DNA amplification (PCR or LAMP) and the SNIPase cleavage reaction with a new hyperthermophilic AP endonuclease from Pyrobaculum aerophilum called PA-Endo IV, in a process known as PCR-SNIPase or LAMP-SNIPase, leading to a colored band on a dipstick within 1.5 hour from start to finish. The combination of the DNA amplification with the SNIPase reaction will reduce false positives and negatives because PA-Endo IV only cleaves the immobilized probes only when they are perfectly hybridized to their appropriate oncogenic HPV strain target DNA. The reaction will be multiplexed to allow detection and identification of all 13 oncogenic strains of HPV in four reactions using four radial lateral flow devices to be developed as part of this Phase II application. Finally, our optimized HPV test will be tested and qualified on archived cervical samples from a cohort of high-risk patients. The Phase II funding will lead to the development of a robust and rapid test for detection and identification of oncogenic strains of HPV that will significantly reduce the incidence of false positives and therefore reduce the need for colpsocopy, an expensive and invasive procedure. The simplicity of the assay will allow its implementation in a new efficacious \"screen-and-treat\" procedure for underserved populations.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a widely used technique for the amplification, manipulation and/or detection of DNA. Herein we propose the further development of a novel \"Hot Start\" PCR strategy which may have potential utility in the amplification of low-copy-number DNA. Several strategies for conducting \"Hot Start\" PCR have been commercialized; however, none of these utilize chemically-modified synthetic oligonucleotides that offer significant potential advantages relative to currently available methods. The present proposal aims to further explore the feasibility of using synthetic oligonucleotide primers which contain modification(s) at the 3'- end. This modification, which can easily be introduced with a reagent that is compatible with conventional DNA synthesizers, is intended to prevent 3'-extension prior to a \"Hot Start\" preheating step. In that step, the modification is intended to undergo thermally-induced fragmentation to the corresponding unmodified oligonucleotide, which can then be recognized and extended by DNA polymerases. In Phase I, we demonstrated that the modified primers displayed the desired \"Hot Start\" fragmentation properties and that these primers could not be successfully extended by DNA polymerases prior to a preheating step. In Phase II, we plan to further develop the utility of these chemically-modified primers in PCR-based applications by optimizing the \"Hot Start\" properties. Chief among the envisioned advantages of the proposed new method for \"Hot Start\" PCR include its use with any thermostable DNA polymerase and buffer-pH. It is also proposed that this new method when used in combination with currently available \"Hot Start\" DNA polymerases may provide greater levels of specificity and reliability for genetic testing, clinical diagnostics, blood-screening, forensics and biodefense, as in all of these applications there are serious adverse consequences of false negatives and false positives. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a widely used technique for the amplification, manipulation and/or detection of DNA. With the increasing shift towards the use of PCR for diagnosis, where accuracy of detection is of the utmost importance, several \"Hot Start\" PCR strategies have been commercialized to further improve the accuracy. Herein we propose the further development of a novel \"Hot Start\" PCR strategy which may have potential utility in the amplification of low-copy-number DNA.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is an established clinical need for a non-invasive measure of body iron stores that is safe, accurate, cost effective and readily available. An accurate, clinically validated susceptometer based on low-temperature superconductivity (LTS) has been available for more than two decades, but its complexity, cost (~$1,000,000), and need for liquid helium have restricted its use to a handful of research centers. Given the liquid helium requirement, and the fact that no significant cost reduction has occurred since its inception, it has been widely felt that superconducting susceptometry is unlikely to enter general clinical practice. The discovery of high-Tc superconductivity and the recent emergence of flexible materials based employing superconductors have dramatically altered the technical picture. In Phase I, we combined these novel materials with a number of other recent advances and overcame the technical barriers to widespread implementation noted. Specifically, we developed an proof-of-principle instrument using conventional magnetic sensors and a very innovative flux concentrator. The recent availability of low vibration and small mass cryocoolers has made the instrument depend only on wall power for operation and uncomplicated cryogenics. The new proposed instrument will have a material parts cost often times less than the ITS system and be much simpler to operate and maintain. A new measurement methodology has been developed that eliminates the costlier and unreliable elements while promising equivalent or superior sensitivities. Our Phase II goal is to build on our strong progress in Phase I and construct a prototype cryosusceptometer that is accurate, inexpensive and can be operated by personnel who have no specialized technical training. A simple low-cost cryosusceptometer will satisfy the pressing need for accurate clinical iron assessment over a wide range of iron stores (0.2 mg/g-wet weight to above 10 mg/g). It also promises to open up a number of other applications for superconducting susceptometry, in both medicine and industry. To achieve this, we propose a step-by-step development program that concludes with a preliminary clinical evaluation involving twenty iron overloaded (thalassemic and sickle-cell) patients and five normal control subjects.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The use of chlorine for the disinfection of domestic water supplies produces a range of halogenated organic compounds as a result of chemical reactions between the chlorine and naturally occurring organic material (NOM). These disinfection byproducts (DBFs) occur at parts per billion level and the consumption of chlorinated water containing these compounds has been linked to an increased incidence of a number of cancers and other ailments. As a consequence, it is highly desirable to reduce the levels of these DBFs in drinking water in order to limit their impact on human health. Current methods for DBP removal tend to focus on the reduction of NOM prior to the chlorination process. However, available technologies are only moderately effective or are cost prohibitive for large-scale applications (e.g. reverse osmosis). Triton proposes to use selective adsorbents to remove the DBFs after the chlorination step. During the Phase I project, it was demonstrated that certain hydrophobic nanoporous sorbents have great advantages over existing materials for a cost effective and efficient removal of DBFs. This Phase II proposal addresses the experimentation for both POU and POE devices necessary to qualify the adsorbent material, relative to standards set forth by both the EPA and the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF). Importantly, this proposed effort also addresses the commercialization of these materials in POU and POE devices with existing companies in the drinking water treatment industry.     The proposed Triton's approach of adsorbing DBFs with a special adsorbing bed of material in both POU and POE devices has the following advantages:       Municipal treatment facilities can continue to use time-tested halogens as the primary and/or secondary means of disinfection, saving billions of dollars in infrastructure required to convert to new water treatment methods such as UV and Ozone.   The retrofitable nature of the adsorbent media into POE and POE devices permits suppliers of water treatment devices to expand their market offering without the need to build new devices.   Consumers can readily have access to the new technology through the existing marketplace infrastructure and devices.",

Although available urinary and recombinant FSH products have been quite successful, there is currently an unmet therapeutic need for improved FSH analogs for all infertile women and particularly for older patients and those relatively unresponsive to current therapies. We have previously described the first superactive analogs of glycoprotein hormones that considerably increase receptor binding affinity as well as both in vitro and in vivo biopotency and maximal efficacy. During our Phase I support at Trophogen, Inc. we have identified a number of promising LH and FSH superactive analog candidates in several in vitro and in vivo models, including rodent oocyte quantity and quality. We now wish under Phase II support to focus our efforts on further in vivo testing of our lead hFSH analog candidate and two alternates versus standard recombinant FSH in various physiologically and therapeutically relevant rodent and nonhuman primate models. Specifically, in rodents we propose to employ the classic Steelman Pohley assay, various assays of in vitro fertilization and embryo development and, in selected cases, embryo transfer to surrogate females, assessment of pregnancy rates and the quantity and quality of newborn pups. Such studies will be performed in immature, mature and aging rodents as well as in those with models of genetic or chemically induced infertility. In nonhuman primates we propose to do a paired study of analog vs standard FSH using methods emulating human ART. We also propose to develop additional stable cell lines with the lead FSH analog candidates and optimize further fibrous bed bioreactor production as well as purification methods. In addition we plan to characterize selected purified analogs by multiple physicochemical methods relating to both protein and carbohydrate structure.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project addresses what is considered to be a significant unsolved problem in the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) industry; the fact that many CAD models contain numerous small, unwanted holes or gaps. These gaps occur most often along the seams where two surfaces in a CAD model meet, such as where a wing meets the fuselage of an airplane, and result from fundamental mathematical limitations. Software for analyzing a CAD model for physical properties such as aerodynamics, deflection, or stress cannot work unless those holes are repaired; a time consuming process that causes a significant bottleneck in the CAD workflow. Under Phase I funding, a solution to this gap problem was devised that uses a new surface formulation called T-Splines. Tasks to be performed in Phase II include extending the algorithms to work in arbitrary cases, designing and implementing algorithms for converting trimmed-NURBS models into gap-free T-Splines, adding fillets to the surface intersection, and incorporating the core software into two existing CAD packages using the idea of a \"plugin.\"  The gap problem has vexed the CAD industry for over 25 years.  The solution to the gap problem conceived in previous efforts involves a new technology called T-Splines, which some researchers in the CAD community believe represents a significant advance in the field of surface modeling theory.  This project will help the T-Splines technology to mature and will hasten its adoption into the CAD industry.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The current \"best practices\" procedure for diagnosing the in utero drug exposure of fetuses is testing the newborn's meconium for the presence of drugs. Meconium is difficult to collect and in 8-20% of births in the U.S. the meconium is released into the amniotic fluid pre-birth due to some type of fetal distress. While drugs may have induced this fetal distress it is unlikely that these infants will be tested for drug exposure due to lack of available meconium for testing. Under Phase I funding we studied the feasibility of substituting umbilical cord for meconium in fetal drug testing. Umbilical cord is readily available at every birth event and is easily collected. During the Phase I study we screened 118 matched meconium/umbilical cord samples with immunoassays specific for amphetamines, opiates, cocaine metabolites, cannabinoids, and phencyclidine (PCP) (NIDA-5 panel). The meconium samples were tested and reported out as routine clinical samples. Umbilical cord extracts were prepared, screened for the same drugs, and the results compared to the screening data for the respective meconium samples. Cutoffs for the umbilical cord screening tests were determined by ROC analyses of the data. Agreement between meconium and umbilical cord for amphetamine screening was 96.6%; for opiates was 94.9%; for cocaine metabolites was 99.2%; for cannabinoids was 90.7%; and for PCP was 100% for negatives (no PCP positive samples were obtained). Having established feasibility of umbilical cord testing in these Phase I studies, we now propose to extend these studies in Phase II to optimize and develop for production testing the umbilical cord extraction and assay procedures. We will screen by drug group-specific immunoassays and analyze by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), the gold standard in drug testing, a large sampling (1000) of umbilical cord specimens from potentially drug- exposed neonates obtained from various socio-economic and ethnic populations at several birthing sites in the U.S. The data obtained will be used to establish drug screening cutoffs having optimum sensitivity and specificity. The umbilical cord screening and gold standard GC/MS assays will be validated and a marketing plan will be developed to introduce these assays into the drug testing arena. Testing of umbilical cord specimens will simplify drug testing of newborns, will allow testing of those infants suffering fetal distress, and will provide the potential to intervene for a greater population of drug-exposed babies.",

        "abstract": "The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is an international effort to build the first power-producing, agnetically-confined fusion reactor within the next decade.  The reactor design requires the development of advanced materials for flow channel inserts that will accomodate a lead-lithium (Pb-Li) alloy, tritium-breeder exit temperature of ~700\u00c2\u00b0C.  The flow channel insert must have low thermal and electrical conductivity, resistance to thermally induced stress, impermeability, and non-reactivity with the Pb-Li alloy.  This project will develop a sandwich structure for these inserts, using a previously-developed, high-specific-stiffness open-cell silicon carbide (SiC) foam with integrated, thin, dense SiC face sheets (80-90% porous).  The structure not only will satisfy the above requirements, but also will be far more manufacturable, exhibit higher thermal stress resistance, and cost substantially less than SiC/SiC composites.  In Phase I, a matrix of SiC-foam/SiC-facesheet, flow-channel insert specimens was fabricated, and thermomechanical modeling and liquid metal testing were performed.  The modeling and test results indicated that the concept could meet the flow channel insert requirements.  In Phase II, a 30-cm tall, flow-channel insert section (12\u00c3\u201412 cm2 cross-section) will be designed and fabricated for testing with high temperature Pb-Li.  The properties of the SiC foam/SiC facesheet insert first will be optimized through thermal, mechanical, and chemical testing.  Test results will be incorporated with thermomechanical modeling to determine the optimal SiC foam density and foam/facesheet thickness.  Performance will be demonstrated by subjecting components to an environment that simulates that of an actual flow channel insert.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Nuclear fusion is an ideal alternative to increasingly scarce and expensive fossil fuels, and can provide a much greater quantity of environmentally sound energy than wind, solar, and geothermal sources.  The proposed flow channel insert should serve as a key component that would enable fusion reactors tol ultimately be used for large-scale commercial energy generation.",

However, fusion technology cannot be realized without the development of advanced materials that allow operation under the high heat flux and radiation conditions necessary for maintaining burning plasmas.  This project will develop and demonstrate innovative materials and components to allow extended steady-state operation of fusion devices at heat flux levels greater than 15 MW/m, with brief, more intense pulses of energy deposition during plasma disruptions.  Chemical vapor deposition/infiltration will be used to produce refractory materials and structures for this application that cannot be fabricated by conventional processing techniques.   In Phase I, preliminary design work was performed on an innovative, ultrahigh-heat-flux plasma-facing component composed of a thin tungsten shell integrally bonded to an open-cell tungsten foam core.  Tungsten-foam/tungsten-shell heat exchangers were fabricated using chemical vapor deposition.  High-heat-flux testing demonstrated an outstanding heat flux capability of 22.4 MW/m at 4 MPa pressure and 27 g/s of helium flow, a world-class heat flux for a helium-cooled refractory device.   In Phase II, ultrahigh-heat-flux capabilities (>20 MW/m ) will be achieved by further optimizing the plasma-facing component design; size scalability of a unique modular channel concept operating at very low pressure drop will be demonstrated; and high-heat-flux capability limits will be established through an expanded matrix of tests. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Heat exchangers with high-heat-flux capability and low-coolant pressure drop are critical for efficient heat transfer in nuclear power generation plants (fission and fusion), which remain the only practical alternative to fossil fuel energy sources.  Other areas of commercial application are high-Mach combined-cycle propulsion and airframe systems.

The identification of novel a-amidated peptides from a biological source has been significantly hindered by lack of a specific assay for this class of bioactive peptides. Our hypothesis is that numerous a-amidated peptide hormones remain undiscovered. Identification of these novel a-amidated peptide hormones will lead to an increased understanding of cellular signaling pathways and to the role played by the a-amidated peptides in human disease. The novel a-amidated peptides uncovered by our innovative assay could also lead to new therapeutics for the treatment of human disease and/or new tools for the diagnosis of human disease. In Phase I, a novel platform technology (PAM/GO/Luminol chemi-luminescent assay) for the discovery of a-amidated peptides was developed that exploits the unique chemistry of a pro- hormone processing enzyme, peptidylglycine a-amidating monooxygenase (PAM). PAM catalyzes the conversion of glycine-extended peptides to the corresponding peptide-amide. In Aim 1 of this Phase II application, cardiac and prostate cells will be grown in the presence of a PAM inhibitor to accumulate glycine-extended peptides in the conditioned medium. The conditioned medium will be fractionated and analyzed using the PAM/GO/Luminol assay. Fractions identified to contain putative glycine-extended peptides will be further purified and their molecular mass and amino acid sequence will be determined. In Aim 2, the isolated peptides will be characterized to determine if they are derived from unknown genes, and their tissue distribution and abundance will also be determined. Unigene will utilize its proprietary recombinant expression technology to produce milligram to gram quantities of all novel peptides discovered as part of the Aim 3 efforts to enable commercial sales for the research market. The preliminary function of the novel amidated peptide hormones will be elucidated in Aim 4 by a series of in vitro assays and in vivo studies in appropriate rodent models. The long term goal of this project is to perform pre-clinical, toxicology and proof-of-concept clinical studies to determine whether a given novel peptide can be developed for the treatment of diseases that represent unmet medical needs. The clinical development of such commercially viable peptides will be out- licensed to pharmaceutical companies for further clinical development, and for marketing and distribution.        Amidated peptide hormones are ubiquitous in the human body and perform important roles in health and disease. Many peptide hormone-based drugs have been successfully developed and are currently in use for the treatment of diseases such as diabetes, osteoporosis, prostate cancer and others.

        "abstract": "Lighting is estimated to consume 8.2 quads (approximately 762 TWh), or about 22% of the total electricity generated in the U.S.  New, high efficiency solid state light sources, such as light emitting diodes (LEDS) and organic LEDs (OLEDS), are needed to reduce the ever increasing demand for energy.  An OLED is potentially a cost-effective diffuse light source that may compete most directly with conventional incandescent light sources; however, improvements in the overall efficiency of these devices are still required before they become commercially viable and attain expected cost and performance goals (of $3 per 1000 lumens and 90 lumens per watt, respectively).  This project will utilize novel OLED fabrication techniques to enable 40 lm/W, organic, solid-state lighting sources to replace 12 lm/W incandescent sources, and hence reduce overall energy consumption in the U.S.  In Phase I, the stated efficiency goal was surpassed:  OLED architectures were designed and materials were incorporated to enable the creation of a warm white phosphorescent OLED, which had an efficacy of 36 lm/W at a luminance of 1,000 cd/m2, a correlated color temperature of 4,400 K, and a color rendering index of 71.  In addition, it was shown that the device can be operated continuously at constant current for over 200 hrs before its initial luminance of 1,550 cd/m2 decreases to 775 cd/m2.  In Phase II, the power efficiency and operational stability of the phosphorescent OLED will be enhanced via improvements in the recombination efficiency of electrons and holes in the OLED emissive layer.  Because the recombination efficiency is directly affected by the doping of emissive molecules into a host material, precise control of the mixture of dopants and host molecules will be implemented by using an organic vapor phase deposition technology.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:   Today, OLED technology is the leading emerging technology for flat panel displays (FPDs).  Many features desired for FPDs also are making OLED technology of great interest for solid-state lighting:  (1) OLEDs are bright and colorful lambertian emitters with excellent power efficiency at low voltages; (2) they are thin-film devices that provide thin form factors especially when built on flexible plastic substrates; and (3) they require less materials, have fewer processing steps, and may be less capital intensive than today\u00c2\u00bfs dominant liquid crystal displays.

The goal is the design, implementation, deployment and clinical validation of two tools: (1) a visualization and analysis tool for investigating propagation dynamics of past and current infection outbreaks; and, (2) a simulation tool for evaluating response measures to potential outbreaks. The research will center on clinical acceptance and usability. The involvement of medical and infection control experts will ensure that the models of infection spread are accurate, the visualization and analysis tools are intuitive, and the simulation tools cover the important infections and scenarios. Every year tens of thousands of lives, and billions of dollars, are lost to infections acquired in health care facilities. The envisioned product will give hospitals powerful tools for reducing these numbers, allowing them to better understand why infections happen and what counter-measures are effective. Hospital-associated infections' impact goes beyond the immediate sickness they cause, forcing treatment of the infection in addition to the underlying illness, and dissuading many from seeking necessary care because of the fear of acquiring infections.",

This technology will impact the current blood donor screening guidelines that call for the deferral of potential donors for one year following travel to malaria endemic regions. Not only do cases of fatal transfusion-transmitted malaria occasionally occur, but also the availability of the blood supply is reduced.

        "abstract": "Cryptosoridium is a resilient waterborne protozoan pathogen that caused gastrointestinal disease and is one of five major causes for 5 million deaths each year worldwide.  Recently, a Cryptosoridium outbreak has sickened more than 1,700 people, mostly children and teenagers in New York.  Cryptosoridium oocysts are of particular interest in the water industry because the infectious dose is low (1to 132 oocysts) and it does not respond to common drug treatments.  Self-contained microelectrochemical assays are desirable because precise detection can be performed down to a single oocyst on colored and turbid samples.  In addition, electrochemical detection, that depend only on loss and gain of electrons, immediately adjacent to surface-bound assay components provide rapid signals even for very low analyte concentrations based on short transport distances for reporter molecules.\n\nIn Phase I, we successfully demonstrated our chip-based self-contained microelectrochemical hybrid assay (SMEHA) that involved immunoassay followed by DNA-hybridization assay to confirm viability of the oocysts.  Both assays which took ~90 min to complete were demonstrated in an 8 x 3 array of 50-\u00c2\u00b5m diameter cavities.  The ability to detect live C. parvum oocysts down to 5 oocysts/10 L of pelleted surface water samples in less than 90 min were proven in Phase I of  this project.\n\nThis Small Business Innovations Research Phase II project proposes to develop disposable SMEHA cartridges for the quantification and viability assessment of water borne pathogens to meet the escalating need for fast warming of pathogen outbreaks and possible dispersal of bioterrorism agents.  Although the disposable SMEHA cartridges can be specified for nearly any pathogen of interest, this Phase II project will focus on the detection of Cryptosoridium oocysts and Giardia cysts.  Both protozoans seriously threaten the nation\u00c2\u00bfs water supply because they resist ordinary water treatment processes and do not respond to common antibiotics.  Because of the speed and specificity of our proposed device, investigators will be able to act quickly to suspected Cryptosoridium or Giardia contamination.  Both the source and the path of contamination flow can be efficiently traced.  The development of the disposable SMHA cartridge and reagent  kits will advance the state-of-the-art over existing EPA methods 1622 and 1623 by providing a previously unavailable combination of speed, sensitivity, affordability, ease-of-use, and test of viability of waterborne pathogens.",

Computational methods can speed this ligand discovery step, but are not yet reliable enough to circumvent extensive experimental testing, even in the favorable instance where the 3D structure of the protein is known. The central goal of this SBIR project is to develop and commercialize a new computational method for assessing the affinities of drug candidates for a protein target of known 3D structure, accounting efficiently for changes in translational, rotational and conformational entropy upon binding. This method will speed discovery of new medications to improve human health, and will generate substantial sales in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, as well as from government and academic labs.       During Phase I, we aim to demonstrate successful initial implementation of the method on a single computer and in parallel on a commodity compute cluster, and to show that it yields converged free energies in nontrivial test cases. We also aim to show that properly computed free energies can yield significantly different ligand rankings, relative to more elementary models.",

The risk of bacterial contamination is approximately 1 in 2000 transfusions, which makes it the single greatest infectious risk in transfusion medicine today. Currently, no rapid, broadly reacting detection test is available commercially. Verax has assembled a set of binding agents that selectively bind to conserved cell- surface structures of either Gram positive or Gram negative bacteria and is the basis of Verax's proprietary Pan Genera Detection technology (PGD). In Phase I, Verax demonstrated the feasibility of the PGD technology in detection of bacterially contaminated platelets by formatting these binding agents in an easy- to-use immunoassay rapid test. In Phase II, Verax commercially developed and optimized the rapid test, demonstrated reliable manufacture of the test and verified assay performance in a pre-clinical setting. For Phase II Continuation, Verax will demonstrate scale-up manufacturing, validate manufacturing processes and validate clinical performance. The clinical validation studies will include tests for the following performance characteristics: clinical specificity, pan genera reactivity, analytical sensitivity, reproducibility of detection, interfering substances, user robustness and product stability. In addition, Verax will perform the first-ever U.S. incidence study for bacterial contamination in platelets by screening a large population of stored (day 2-5 post-collection) human platelets (leukoreduced and non-leukoreduced) near the time of transfusion with the PGD Test and plate culture (aerobic and anaerobic). The outcome of that study will be a clear definition of the incidence of bacterial contamination in platelets near the time of transfusion, the bacterial species implicated in the contamination events, and the titer of bacteria at the time of testing. At the end of this project, Verax will submit the Platelet PGD Test for BLA approval to the FDA.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): VIDA Diagnostics is taking a leading role in pioneering new image display and analysis tools which take advantage of the rapid advancements in multi-row detector computer tomography (MDCT) of the chest. The company is providing software solutions for the image directed diagnosis and therapy of common pulmonary diseases. There is now a critical need for objective quantitative tools for both assessing lung structure an function as well as guiding novel interventions. With this phase II SBIR, we seek to continue our efforts to combine our parenchymal and airway analysis to plan, guide and evaluate endobronchial-based interventions. The management of pulmonary emphysema and of lung cancer is currently undergoing major change. With emphysema, novel therapy in the form of one-way valves within the bronchial tree, is in clinical trials both in the United States and Europe with multiple companies introducing products. This therapy (referred to as endoscopic lung volume reduction therapy) requires that the valves be placed endoscopically to all of the airways subtending the most severely affected lung lobe. Because of poor patient lung function it is highly desirable that the valve placements be performed efficiently and effectively. This requires substantial pre and intraoperative computer based planning, with analysis and evaluation of the subtending airways, as well as of the emphysematous lung parenchyma. VIDA Diagnostics has utilized a phase 1 SBIR to develop highly relevant software solutions (developing as the Pulmonary Pathfinder) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of these procedures, has engaged all of the major companies within this health care space, in maturing and testing the solutions. Additional interest is being shown by other companies in software solutions for stent placement in a compromised airway. Lung cancer has seen a major new interest in early detection through MDCT screening. Early detected lesions are lung nodules, of which only about 3% are malignant. Expensive hardware solutions to facilitate biopsy of these lesions have been developed very recently, including bronchoscopic ultrasound and magnetic tracking devices. VIDA Diagnostics, as part of the effort to provide a road map to the region of lung emphysema, will develop simple software solutions to facilitate lung nodule pathfinding to assist in real time bronchoscopic biopsy procedures. Such visualization tools should add to lung nodule biopsy success rates, and reduce substantially the need for expensive surgical options. VIDA Diagnostics is facilitating bench to bedside evaluation and incorporation of these pulmonary path finding software solutions into clinical practice, and is enjoying substantial across the board encouragement and interest from pulmonologists, supporting companies and from the wider community. Advances in medical imaging and novel, non-surgical therapies for lung disease make it critical to accurately detect, measure, and track lung abnormalities. This project aims to develop methods for identifying lung disease and to help a physician plan non-surgical interventions via the airways. These methods are urgently needed to take advantage of emerging therapies for the early treatment of lung disease.",

In Phase I, a mid-infrared spectrometer for the detection of carbon dioxide at 4.3 microns was constructed, based on a pulsed quantum cascade laser (QCL).  The sensitivity, selectivity, and precision of the instrument for isotopic carbon dioxide analysis were determined by using a high-performance optical cell specifically suited for QCLs.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop a small handheld device that can be used for both near continuous and discrete noninvasive measurement of blood glucose from the finger. VivaScan has developed and successfully tested several noninvasive blood glucose monitor laboratory prototypes that use the earlobe as the measurement site. Their operations are based on measurements of near-infrared (NIR) light attenuation by glucose using the patented Optical BridgeTM (OB) method. The OB uniquely nulls out the background attenuation of the tissue, overcoming the major problem of optical blood glucose measurements. In the Phase I study, VivaScan developed a prototype portable device that noninvasively measures blood glucose from the finger. Its tests produced 98.2% of the data (877 data pairs) in the clinically acceptable A & B zones in the Clarke error grid, with an average measurement error of 18.5% or 20.5 mg/dl. Based on the Phase I study, we concluded that the finger is a better noninvasive measurement site than the earlobe because: 1) it is a more ergonomic measurement site; 2) finger measurements do not require active participation of the user allowing also for automated near continuous measurements on sleeping or unconscious patients (e.g. in hospital environment); and 3) finger measurements are easier to perform. In addition, numerous opportunities for improvement have been identified. Overall, the goal of the proposed work is to extend our laboratory prototype portable system to a patient oriented affordable small handheld device. The main aims for Phase II include: 1) develop a custom laser diode system light source; 2) enhance the electronics; 3) redesign and miniaturize the optics and device mechanics; 4) design a handheld system; 5) further enhance the glucose measurement algorithms; 6) achieve one point calibration; 7) build three handheld devices; and 8) test their performance with patients. Our performance goals include: 1) achieve a blood glucose estimation accuracy nearing existing individual finger prick invasive blood glucose measurement devices (=q15%); 2) achieve both near continuous and discrete measurements; and 3) achieve instrument stability requiring one point calibration (with a finger prick device) less than once a week. Subsequent FDA approval of a handheld personal blood glucose monitor will be sought. More than 18 million people in the United States are afflicted with diabetes. Poor management of the disease, (often due to the patient's reluctance to stab themselves for the necessary blood sugar reading), results in debilitating complications ranging from blindness to renal failure. Several national studies have concluded that these complications could be prevented by more frequent testing of blood sugar, which would be facilitated by a painless, bloodless glucose monitor such as the one we propose to develop here.",

The overall goal was and is to develop and commercialize these human bioassay systems. Phase I work definitely established that new assay models exhibit many advantages over conventional monolayer cell cultures and animal-derived biomatrix systems. HuBiogel assays of defined bioactivity or environment are established for real-time analysis of tumor growth and angiogenesis. Based on project's clinical relevance, we also initiated active collaborations with two renowned cancer researchers. With this promising technology, we propose three extended tasks to fully accomplish our R&D goals. They are: 1) Establish efficient protocols for biomatrix production, analysis and formulation at commercial scale using automated technologies; 2) Complete the development of 3D tumor growth, invasion and angiogenesis assay platform using human breast and brain tumor cell models; 3) Validate functional properties of HuBiogel assays by established cellular and molecular analysis techniques. Our integrated technology will allow precise real-time analysis of tumorigenesis cascade. New 3D assay technology will provide more clinical relevance as it emulates human tumor-like biology and function. This advanced bioassay system will be useful for endpoint analysis of early to late tumorigenesis stages, parallel evaluation of specific positive and negative regulators and phenotypic profiling of tumor cells or biopsies. Thus, the timely completion of this promising R&D project will positively impact cancer biology, drug discovery and therapeutic research markets. Project Relevance: No acceptable commercial tumor assay model currently exists which utilizes a natural or defined human biomatrix system.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Enormous medical and technical progress has been made in detecting, treating, and reducing the adverse impact of nearly all other sensory impairments, except for loss of the sense of balance. Time and training in compensatory skills can help ameliorate some of the life-altering effects of this syndrome for patients with mild to moderate symptoms. At present, however, there is no approved or standardized therapeutic device available for those with chronic balance loss due to vestibulo-cerebellar dysfunction. The overall objective of this project is to develop a practical, wearable, cosmetically acceptable substitute for vestibular information that will improve the postural and functional abilities of these individuals. The BrainPort balance device presents head-postural information via electrotactile stimulation to the superior surface of the tongue. The subject then uses this tactile information to obtain correct head and body alignment and maintain balance. After training with the BrainPort balance device, adult subjects with severe balance loss due to various forms of vestibular dysfunction exhibited improved balance and postural control, as evidenced by a reduction in the number of falls and increased composite scores on standardized posturographic tests (NeuroCom CDP). Subjects also retain improved balance control for up to 6 hours after a 20-minute training session, and exhibited functional transfer to more stable and symmetric gait. Our objective in this Phase-2.2 project is to expand the applicability of the BrainPort balance device under the following Specific Aims: (1) to evolve and refine the BrainPort balance device by implementing a Pulse- Width-Modulation method of the electrotactile stimulation, (2) recruit and train subjects with severe chronic balance deficit due to central and mixed vestibulo-cerebellar etiologies, and (3) standardize and optimize the regimen for training these clinical populations using the current program as a template. We hypothesize that people with chronic balance loss (affecting an estimated 18 million people in the US, including elderly) will be similarly aided by use of this system. The studies funded by SBIR Phase-1 & 2 clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the BrainPort balance device. The proposed Phase-2.2 studies will confirm the effectiveness of pulse-width-modulation stimulation method, and better define the population of vestibular disorder patients that will derive benefit from this system. Ultimately, we envision that the BrainPort balance device will become a key component of a comprehensive vestibular therapy program.",

We also have shown that it is feasible to recruit Caregivers of relatives with AD and other dementias who can use the tailored Caregiver Video (with Telephone Coaching) to enhance their ability to apply the skills taught on the Video to the situations they confront as Caregivers. In addition, we have modified our psychosocial test battery so as to make it more easily comprehensible and not burdensome to fill out. We are now ready o produce the complete Caregiver Video, to conduct an adequately powered randomized clinical trial to test its effectiveness in reducing (or preventing deterioration in) psychosocial risk factors and biomarkers of stress and increasing psychosocial well-being in Caregivers, and to document that these benefits are maintained over a relatively long follow-up period of six months. If this research is successful in demonstrating such benefits of the Caregiver Video with Telephone Coaching, it would lead to important societal benefits of reduced distress and improved health among the growing numbers of people in the U.S. who are Caregivers for relations with AD or other dementias. In addition to these benefits in terms of improved health among Caregivers, the prior research on behavioral interventions suggests the potential for significant medical costs reductions in the Caregiver population, with the even further potential of cost savings that could accrue if Caregivers' improved abilities to cope with the stresses they face resulted in reduced institutionalization rates among those they care for.

        "abstract": "Williams-Pyro, Inc. (WPI) has designed and successfully demonstrated a proof-of-concept of the Distributed Automatic Reconfigurable Transponder (DART) that will be capable of achieving distributed multi-nodal voice/data communication for fire fighters. In Phase 2 we will focus on developing a fully functional system that reduces communication failure while maintaining a robust and flexible system. Specifically, WPI proposes to develop a fully functional AccuTag\u00c2\u00bf-based DART, which consists of a series of distributed nodes that will relay voice transmission and data to the incident commander located outside the building. The DART system will be based on state-of-the-art technologies, allowing several distributed DARTs to communicate between individual team members inside the structure as well as with the incident commander located outside the structure. This system will allow faster, more accurate information transmission, resulting in timely fire detection and safer firefighting. COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Commercial applications of the proposed AccuTag\u00c2\u00bf-based Distributed Automatic Reconfigurable Transponder (DART) vary widely, with possibilities including police and fire departments; emergency management services; petroleum companies; water, gas, and electric utilities; mining companies; and transportation companies such as railroads, taxicab operations, and airlines. The firefighting market is the initial focus of our commercialization efforts (worth approximately $500 million, and WPI's estimated market share after five years on the market is expected to reach approximately 5 percent). The opportunities within this market are large, with approximately 30,000 fire departments, 50,000 public safety agencies, and more than a million firefighters nationwide. In addition to the large size, the market offers other promising factors such as great need.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Empirical support exists for cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for child anxiety, but the development and evaluation of cost-effective and transportable CBT approaches is critical. A widely endorsed goal is to disseminate evidence-based treatments to community settings. For the millions who have limited access to mental health facilities, a more accessible treatment is very much needed. A CD-ROM based CBT could increase, by a significant magnitude, the number of anxious youth for whom CBT would become available. Reports indicate that most of the 2.5 million American children seen in clinical practice each year receive interventions that have never been tested in a clinical trial, and CBT has been found to be underutilized by mental health providers. A CD-ROM therapist training program could provide a cost- effective and efficient way to train therapists in providing empirically supported CBT for anxious youth and promote the dissemination of evidence-based treatments. The primary goal of Phase I was to develop 4 sessions of the \"Coping Cat CD\" (CCCD) to examine its feasibility and acceptability. The preliminary data indicated its' acceptability and feasibility with anxious youth. The goal of Phase II is to develop and evaluate the full 12-session CCCD and supplemental materials (i.e., a Notebook and a Coach's Manual) for children aged 8-13 years diagnosed with a principle DSM-IV anxiety disorder. To communicate the CBT content, the CCCD uses interactive strategies (e.g., self- navigation) and immerses the user in an engaging (e.g., flash animation) and age-appropriate learning environment. The effects of the CCCD will be evaluated in Study 1 (n=60): a comparison of (a) CCCD, (b) a previously evaluated individual CBT, and (c) a 12-week attention control. The CCCD does not rely on trained or experienced practitioners for delivery. This Phase II project will also evaluate a CD-Based Training (CDBT) program designed to train therapists in the implementation of CBT. A separate trial, Study 2 (n=60), will compare the impact of (a) CDBT, (b) traditional manual based training, versus (c) waitlist control, on child treatment outcome. Outcomes will be assessed using independent diagnostic interviews, and self-, parent-, and teacher-reports. Maintenance of gains will be evaluated at 3-month follow-up. The larger goals are to develop an effective and affordable CD-ROM version of CBT for anxious youth and a CD-ROM based therapist training program to make evidence-based treatment available to a wide range of youth through educators, healthcare workers, service agencies, and therapists.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the development of an assessment tool that will enable users to profile a decision-maker's cognitive agility and expertise in high-level business situations. It is appropriate for evaluating decision makers in organizations and students who aspire to leadership roles. This version of the product can also be self-administered. It is based on results from recent basic research conducted by Workplace Technologies Research Inc. (WTRI) that revealed the cognitive mechanisms involved in the thinking of highly accomplished experts in business. It uses knowledge elicitation technology that WTRI has developed over several years to support research on the identification of intuitive expertise (in the sense of Dreyfus 1997). The proposal outlines a plan to develop an on-line Internet based version that is self-scoring and tested among well-known experts. The product will be field-tested for its ability to predict general vs. industry specific expertise. The expected outcome is an easy to use tool for professional evaluators, professors, students or individuals, which will assist in staff development and education. The profiles generated by the product will identify hidden strengths, areas of weakness, and suggestions for further development. The long-term goal is distribution by recruiters, coaches, universities and consultancies. In the current climate of rapid workplace change, decision-makers need to continually evaluate their ability to adapt to changes and re-invent their organization's value and competitive future. Few assessment tools address the cognitive underpinnings of the skill set involved. Rather, they evaluate personal traits or sub-skills that have some correlation with leadership, broadly defined. Using an empirically verified model of expertise in business strategy development and performance prediction, the research team at WTRI has built an assessment tool that locates an individual with regard to this model; much like chess players are evaluated against a notion of a Chess Grand Master. When applied to individual client situations, this tool has been shown to have powerful predictive capability and thus has successfully informed staff development efforts. Its distinctive feature is assessment of the ability to analyze disparate sources information in order to make strategy level decisions and supporting tactical plans. Making the tool more widely available and usable by non-scientists could importantly contribute to efforts to increase the performance of both organizations and decision makers. Organizations, distributors and several institutions of higher learning have expressed interest in this technology, which they consider to be addressing an area of unmet need.",

The main problem facing the development of an effective filter is the ability to efficiently filter fine particles below one micron.  This project will address this problem by developing  composite, nano-structured, lightweight filter materials that can effectively remove micron and sub-micron-sized particle contaminants, especially heavy metal species.  The technique to grow the nano-structured filter media will have low energy consumption.  In Phase I, composite nano-structured lightweight filters were developed from high performance polymers and other ingredients.  Filters were designed, fabricated, and tested with a fluid media containing very fine silicon or iron oxide particles.  The particle capture efficiency was far superior to the conventional filter media, with practically the same thickness, weight, and pressure drops.   Phase II will optimize and scale-up the nano-structured composite filter media developed in Phase I.  A continuous growing process and device will be designed and constructed as a first step toward mass production.  A series of filtration tests and SEM analyses will be performed to assist the optimization.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The lightweight composite filter media should have application in a variety of recovery and pollution-control processes:  treatment of radioactive water, waste water and metalworking fluids; purification of drinking water; separation of metal contaminates from engine oil; and recovery of precious metals.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is known that conventional anti-scatter grids are limited in their ability to control scatter in general radiography. In recent years this problem has been aggravated by the use of less efficient (thin, high line density, low lead content) grids, and the increasing size of patients. As a result, radiographic image quality is often insufficient to answer questions concerning trauma and other clinical areas, and patients undergo additional higher dose, more expensive imaging exams. In many instances these additional exams could be eliminated and health care costs reduced if a better radiographic imaging system were available. We propose a coarse, high-ratio air interspace grid coupled to an orthogonally aligned low-ratio conventional grid. Together, these will effectively eliminate scatter and will have a primary transmission comparable to commonly used grids. A low-ratio grid is compatible with a range of source-to-image distances (SIDs). The coarse grid will have articulating grid slats, permitting variable SIDs and angled views. In order to build a compact and clinically acceptable system, the coarse grid can only move a short distance to blur out grid lines. It has been demonstrated that this can be accomplished by employing a quasi-trapezoidal x-ray tube current waveform.  In Phase I we propose to demonstrate that an appropriate quasi-trapezoidal x-ray tube current waveform can be obtained in general radiography. In Phase II we propose to design and construct a compact and high efficiency crossed-grid system, interface it to an x-ray generator, and demonstrate that it can control scatter much more effectively than a conventional grid. The system will be able to accommodate general radiography, chest radiography, angled projections, tomography, and a range of SIDs. It can be used with either screen-film or digital image receptors, and will improve tomosynthesis and dual energy applications.  RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: General radiography (x-ray images) plays an important role in health care delivery. Scattered radiation degrades image quality; social and technical trends have aggravated this problem in recent years. We propose a scatter control system that greatly increases the image quality of x- ray images without increasing patient dose.",

        "abstract": "Air particulate has been identified as a source of primary and secondary health risks.  More than 5000 air particulate monitoring stations have been established in the United States, mostly for measuring the total mass and the size distribution.  Real-time monitoring instruments for mass and size distribution are commercially available today.  The network of monitoring stations performing chemical composition is smaller.  Samples are typically collected on filters which are then transported to laboratories for analysis.  This is particularly true for monitoring for monitoring of heavy metal contamination, which is predominately performed using energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) analysis in laboratories.  Even with a high-power (water cooling needed), heavy and expensive lab instrument a long sampling time (24 hours typical) is needed to achieve reasonable detection sensitivity.                                                                          \n\nWe propose development of a unique EDXRF system for real-time measurement and monitoring of elemental composition, particularly heavy metal contaminants.  The use of innovative x-ray optics in the proposed system enables time-resolved measurements with significant improved detection sensitivity, and achieves such performance in a low-power, compact and automated system.                                                                                                                                         \n\nXOS has successfully demonstrated (in Phase I) the performance of the proposed approach by retrofitting the new x-ray optic technology into the existing particulate monitoring system.  Even with the non-optimized prototype, a detection limit of 10 to 40 pg/m3 was achieved for Fe, Cu, Zn, Sr, and Br with a 50W x-ray source and eight hour sampling time, it is estimate that this sensitivity was more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of the conventional EDXRF method.                                                                                                                                        \n\nThe ultimate goal of the Phase II proposal is to develop a prototype system capable of collecting samples and performing composition measurement in a continuous and automatic mode. We expect to achieve the equivalent detection limit of Phase I with 1-hour time resolution for transition elements with a 50-watt system.  The system, which can be configured for PM2.5, PM10, or total suspended particulate (TSP), will be packaged as a field deployable instrument with the size, weight, and power consumption similar to those currently deployed in EPA networks,                                                                                                                              \n\nConsidering the proposed technology is unique and new, the initial market may be research-oriented.  This will provide the opportunity for the PM monitoring community to review the technology and recognize its benefits.  Once accepted by the research community we expect systems deploying the technology to be widely distributed both in the United States and internationally.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Carbohydrates play an important role in many cellular functions and diseases; however, carbohydrate-based drug discovery research is lagging compared to other biologically important molecules because of the significant challenges in creating and obtaining carbohydrate-based molecules. This difficulty is exacerbated by the lack of easily available of starting materials created with rare sugars. One such sugar is L-ribose. L-ribose is the core of several nucleoside- based pharmaceuticals presently on the market or undergoing clinical trials. As the need for these drugs increases, demand for L-ribose is going to increase significantly. We propose a fermentative route to the production of L-ribose and other rare sugars using a mannitol-1- dehydrogenase (MDH). The MDH has a broad substrate specificity profile that allows the production of many different rare sugars from readily available and inexpensive polyols. Phase I of this research dealt with the recombinant expression of the MDH gene within Escherichia coli and demonstrated the synthetic utility of the system with L-ribose being our initial target. This phase II portion will expand upon the successful phase I research to study the scale-up of these conversions into a commercially viable process as well as the engineering of the MDH to expand the synthetic utility of the enzyme beyond the substrate specificity of the wild-type MDH. Specifically, we intend to 1) improve the expression and activity the mannitol dehydrogenase, 2) scale-up the L-ribose production, 3) test and scale-up in vitro bioconversion and/or fermentations of other rare sugars, 4) improve the NADH oxidase for cofactor recycling, and 5) modify the substrate specificity of the mannitol dehydrogenase. This technology will create a diversity of low-cost rare sugars to expand the portfolio of carbohydrate starting materials available to biochemists and medicinal chemists. Rare sugars are becoming increasingly important in the development of therapeutics, whether for attachment to natural products, or as the building blocks for nucleoside-based antivirals. Many of these rare sugars, such as L-ribose or D-mannose, are simply not available in large quantities for biochemical and pharmaceutical studies. Our work will create a portfolio of low- cost sugars that will enable the production of a wide variety of carbohydrate-based therapeutics for drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug use is common among pregnant women, yet only an estimated 32 percent to 42 percent of prenatal care providers routinely ask patients about their use of drugs. Prenatal visits afford a unique opportunity for providers to educate women about prevention, and to detect drug use during pregnancy. To facilitate efficient use of provider resources, we developed a computerized interactive survey interview, the Pregnancy Information Program (PIP) that has been extensively tested in non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, and American Indian populations. Earlier studies demonstrated that the PIP was well received in multiple ethnic/racial pregnant populations. More importantly, the PIP evoked more honest responses regarding drug use and other socially stigmatized behaviors than paper-and-pencil questionnaires. In Phase I we updated the program, integrated current diagnostic standards, added a tailored motivational intervention, and incorporated audio and video elements to the program. For this Phase II project, we propose to further enhance the software capabilities, expand the domains of use to clinicians, and develop a commercial quality CD ROM prototype of the entire instrument. We will beta test the completed instrument in 6 community women's clinics, to determine its acceptability and ease of use, through anonymous clinician surveys and rates of completion. We will also conduct a randomized, controlled clinical trial of 346 pregnant women to determine PIP's ability to promote behavior change from the initial to the third trimesters of pregnancy. Primary outcomes evaluated in this trial include self-reported changes in nutrition, drug use, alcohol use, cigarette smoking, HIV risk behavior, and partner abuse avoidance. We will also assess stages of readiness to change, where change is not yet manifest. Subjects in their first trimester will be randomized to complete the PIP or a computer questionnaire minus the educational and customized motivational feedback. Both groups also will receive printed educational information. In their third trimesters, subjects will complete a second computer-based questionnaire to determine current behaviors, and will participate in a personal interview regarding their reaction to PIP. Paired data will be analyzed using generalized linear mixed models to estimate differences between and within groups over time. This study will reveal the potential of the PIP to enhance prenatal healthy behaviors, and improve birth outcomes, while saving providers time.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radio frequency (RF) catheter ablation is an established treatment for patients with cardiac arrhythmias. RF ablation of atrio-ventricular nodal reentrant arrhythmias has been highly successful, since the known anatomy of the atrio-ventricular node enables precise identification of the site of origin of the arrhythmia and thus delivery of the ablative energy. Ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) presents a greater challenge, since the origin of the arrhythmia could be anywhere in the ventricles, and existing techniques used to locate the site usually require that patients be maintained in arrhythmia for a significant period of time. These factors combine to limit the procedure primarily to treatment of slow VTs in patients who are hemodynamically stable during arrhythmia.  In Phase I of this Fast-Track project, concept feasibility will be demonstrated for a new catheter guidance system that will direct the tip of an ablation catheter to the site of origin of an arrhythmia and reduce the time needed to locate the site such that a patient need only be maintained in the arrhythmia for a few beats. The system will feature an innovative \"inverse algorithm\" analysis code that uses a single equivalent moving dipole (SEMD) to model both electrocardiograph (EGG) potentials from body-surface electrodes and the current pulses delivered from the tip of an ablation catheter. By processing body surface potentials during a few beats of VT, the system will identify the SEMD location that corresponds to the source of the arrhythmia when the bioelectrical source is most localized. Using the same algorithm, it will then identify, in real time, the location of the catheter tip from analysis of potentials resulting from low-energy dipolar current pulses delivered to electrodes located at the tip. The system will also include a real-time graphical display that will allow a clinician to quickly guide the catheter tip to the source of the arrhythmia for precise delivery of RF energy.  Even in the presence of realistic levels of noise in the ECG signals, preliminary work has shown that estimation of the SEMD location from body surface potentials is a breakthrough innovation that will allow for precise, rapid guidance of ablation catheters to arrhythmic foci. Phase I will prove feasibility in a breadboard system developed to demonstrate the ability to guide an ablation catheter to the location of an electrical source within a phantom torso. This work will serve as the foundation for development and in-vivo test of a full prototype guidance system in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Devices that employ fuel cell technology (such as vehicles, portable devices, and remote installations) require frequent startup/shutdown cycles.  Surviving these cycles, particularly at freezing temperatures, will require the development of cost-effective, high-performance, proton-exchange membrane (PEM) materials.   This project will develop a high performance membrane with excellent dimensional stability over a wide range of temperature and relative humidity.  The new membrane will alleviate the water/ice expansion problem during the freeze/thaw process while simultaneously facilitating operation at low humidity and high temperature.  This improved operability under suboptimal conditions will retard shorting and enhance the durability of the membrane.  Phase I developed a dimensionally stable membrane that showed stellar mechanical stability compared to Nafion\u00c2\u00ae, with a creep rate at least one order-of-magnitude lower.  The feasibility of the concept was demonstrated in membrane formation, membrane-electrode assembly fabrication, fuel cell performance, and freeze/thaw stability.  Phase II will develop alternative membrane fabrication processes to lower cost and increase performance, and demonstrate freeze/thaw stability and scalability with both 50 cm2 fuel cells and short stacks (3-5 cells, 100-200 cm2, 250-500W).   Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The new PEMs should be readily applicable to fuel cells employed in vehicles, portable devices, and remote installations.  Compared to conventional ionomer membranes, the new membrane should provide higher reliability, longer life, and wider relative humidity and temperature operating ranges.  Its low projected fabrication cost of ~ 2 \u00c2\u00a2/cm\u00c2\u00b2 should enhance commercialization possibilities.",

In addition to its use as a contact thermometer for core temperature measurement, promising applications for the Radiometer include detecting infections around post-surgical wounds or implanted devices, locating malignant tumors that cause local temperature increases in subcutaneous tissues, evaluating vascular insufficiencies and inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, and determining the efficacy of treatments for these diseases. The novel architecture of the Radiometer will be implemented using miniaturized microwave components including recently available silicon-germanium microwave transistors for low-noise amplifiers and a high-gain logarithmic amplifier/detector integrated circuit that drastically reduces the gain required to amplify temperature-generated noise to adequate detection levels. A novel low-loss resonant switch using microwave field-effect transistors has been developed to simplify the digital calibration process without the added noise or excessive loss of other available miniaturized switches. The digital calibration and measurement technique developed and proven in previous cabinet mounted digital radiometers will be adapted and used in the proposed Radiometer which will be tested in a specially developed tissue-equivalent 3-D phantom capable of simulating clinically interesting subsurface temperature profiles, and the results will be used to finalize the design of a prototype instrument suitable for laboratory testing leading to a final design suitable for clinical testing. Contacts with manufacturers will be established with the aim of early commercialization. Unlike conventional thermometers, the Handheld Digital Microwave Radiometer will conveniently, quickly, and non-invasively measure subsurface temperatures. The Radiometer will provide new means of locating infections and lesions because of the ability to estimate a temperature-depth relation. The effectiveness of treatments can be quantified by monitoring changes of internal temperatures with medicines or procedures.",

        "abstract": "Recent evidence indicates that the prevalence of substance abuse is significant among children and adolescents, and initiation of drug use is often occurring at very early ages.   These findings underscore the need to initiate age-appropriate prevention efforts with youth at an early age in elementary school and continue these interventions throughout middle school and later years.   We previously developed and evaluated an interactive, computer-based drug abuse prevention multimedia program for middle school-aged youth that incorporates effective components of both drug abuse prevention science and educational technologies (called Head On: Substance Abuse Prevention for Grades 6-8 TM).  This computer-based program was designed to promote the increased adoption of effective prevention science, and was shown to be easily exportable, able to be applied with fidelity, cost-effective and efficacious in increasing accurate knowledge about substance abuse prevention and decreasing rates of cigarette and alcohol use, intentions to use substances and positive attitudes toward substances among middle school-aged youth.   In Phase I of this STTR project, we developed and demonstrated the scientific, technical and commercial merit and feasibility of a prototype of a computer-based drug abuse prevention program for elementary school-aged children (called Head On: Substance Abuse Prevention for Grades 3-5 TM).   In this Phase II application, we propose to complete the development and conduct a controlled school-based evaluation of the effectiveness of the computer-based prevention program in increasing knowledge about substance abuse prevention, retarding initiation of substance use and increasing a wide variety of protective factors against substance abuse in elementary school-aged children.  This program may extend effective prevention science to this age group, while addressing many of the challenges associated with the current delivery of evidence-based prevention programs.  An effective, multimedia substance abuse prevention learning environment, which provides an integration between state-of-the-art computer technology and prevention science research, may be of substantial benefit in providing drug abuse prevention education to elementary school children. This program may deliver evidence-based substance abuse prevention in a manner that is considerably more cost-effective than the labor-intensive, prevention interventions that have been demonstrated to be efficacious in preventing the initiation of drug use among this age group.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to develop a novel dual FRET molecular beacons technology for living cell detection and analysis of cancer.  Molecular beacons are dual-labeled oligonucleotide probes with a stem-loop hairpin structure.  Hybridization of molecular beacons with target mRNAs corresponding to cancer markers results in fluorescence of the cell.  Thus, cancer cells (bright) can be distinguished from normal cells (dark).  However, the conventional design of molecular beacons may induce a significant amount of false positives in cancer cell detection due to probe degradation by nucleases and non-specific interactions.  To overcome this difficulty, we have developed the dual FRET molecular beacons approach in which a pair of molecular beacons with respectively donor and acceptor fluorophores hybridizes to adjacent regions of the same target mRNA and results in a FRET signal upon proper excitation, which is readily differentiable from non-FRET false-positive signals due to probe degradation and non-specific probe opening.  In our Phase I STTR studies, we have demonstrated that, using dual FRET molecular beacons in living cell mRNA detection, false positive signals can be significantly reduced.  We have also developed new molecular beacon delivery methods with high efficiency and fast kinetics for live-cell studies, and examined the sensitivity and specificity of detecting Kras and survivin mRNAs in living cells.  In Phase II STTR studies, we will demonstrate the quantitative capability of molecular beacons in detecting and analyzing cancer genes in living cells.  We will use dual FRET molecular beacons to detect the up-regulation of specific genes and compare the mRNA levels detected using molecular beacons and RT-PCR.  To further increase the detection sensitivity and specificity, we will use molecular beacons to target multiple sites on the same mRNA molecule and target multiple tumor markers in the same pancreatic cancer cells.  We will demonstrate the capability of molecular beacons to detect mutant mRNAs in fixed or live cells and the sensitivity of detecting a small number of cancer cells in a sample.  The goals are to develop the dual FRET molecular beacons technology for early cancer detection and diagnosis, and to commercialize this technology for a wide range of biomedical applications including cancer analysis, drug discovery, and in vivo detection of gene expression in basic biological studies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mitochondrial dysfunction underlies the pathology of many disorders, including inherited mitochondrial diseases, many degenerative diseases, and the adverse effects of certain therapeutic drugs. At present there are no reliable standardized methods for detection and analysis of these defects. Our goal is to meet these needs with a set of novel assay kits that simplify analysis of key mitochondrial proteins and add powerful new analytical capabilities. These innovative kits are based on a unique set of proprietary reagents and associated intellectual properties developed by the Principal Investigators. The reagents are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that immunocapture intact, functional mitochondrial enzymes, and the intellectual properties are patents (pending) that cover these mAbs and their application. The Phase II STTR grant will drive commercialization of these technologies in three areas: 1) pharmaceutical drug safety screening for mitotoxicity, both to guide new drug development and to monitor adverse effects of licensed therapeutic drugs; 2) diagnosis of mitochondrial disorders (inherited and acquired) with simple standardized tests; and 3) research applications ranging from basic research into mitochondrial structure/function, to applied research that will help identify biomarkers (pathogenic and diagnostic) of mitochondrial disease. We have successfully met our Phase I goals and also accomplished additional work proactively. Working prototypes of all three types of kits are in hand and we have documented their basic performance characteristics. We are currently marketing early versions of some kits, and have established that there is a strong scientific and commercial demand for them. Phase II work will complete the development of these and other tests and validate their technical utility, making them ready for commercialization. Relevance in lay language: Mitochondria are/the powerhouse of cells and produce 95% of the energy needed for life. The proposed kits will enable personalized mitochondrial medicine, including measurement of an individual's mitotoxic burden (the degree to which his/her mitochondrial energy production system is damaged), and allow assessment of an individual's sensitivity to mitotoxic agents (including adverse effects of therapeutic drugs and environmental toxins). The kits will also be used to detect and monitor the progression of inherited mitochondrial diseases and degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Type-2 diabetes, and this will help clinicians determine whether or not new therapies for these disorders provide beneficial results. Finally, they will offer a way to for new therapeutic drugs that can protect mitochondria from toxic agents, and thus potentially prevent or treat mitochondrial disorders.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Phase I funding for this project supported the successful development of the backbone for a new generation of retroviral gene therapy vectors that contain safety and efficacy features designed to overcome the problems that have been found with retroviral vectors used in current clinical trials. The model disease targeted is the well-studied genetic disease Adenosine Deaminase Deficient Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID). Phase I work has produced a vector backbone with all viral regulatory sequences involved in gene expression removed and replaced with tissue-specific human (or eukaryotic) regulatory sequences. Specifically the vector has the authentic human ADA Locus Control Region (LCR) and the human ADA promoter in a Self-Inactivating (SIN) backbone, together with additional sequences to improve safety and stability. The vector has a high titer and was shown to express GFP in a tissue-specific (i.e., specific for T cells) manner that suggests that the ADA LCR and ADA promoter are functioning properly. The goal of Phase II is to use the vector backbone developed in Phase I to construct clinically useful, commercially viable gene therapy vectors that can be utilized in clinical trials. The safety and efficacy features being developed can be incorporated into any retroviral vectors and therefore are of broad utility. The hypothesis on which this work is based is the following: Retroviral vectors can be made safer and more efficacious by deleting viral c/s-regulatory sequences and replacing them with human (or other eukaryotic) regulatory sequences. We hypothesize that by removing the enhancer/promoter in the 3' LTR (i.e., using a SIN backbone), inserting a human LCR together with its natural endogenous promoter, and providing insulator sequences, the potential for regulated, tissue-specific, physiological gene expression would be greatly increased while the potential for activation of downstream oncogenes would be greatly decreased. Insertion of a suicide gene translated from an IRES would provide an additional safety feature. Retroviral vectors built using these principles would increase the efficacy and safety of gene therapy vectors to be used in clinical trials. Commercialization Aspects: The achievement of the goals outlined in this Phase II proposal will provide a series of superior retroviral gene therapy vector that will be highly suitable for human gene therapy clinical trials. To commercialize these vectors, Neumedicines plans to partner with companies who are specifically targeting gene-based diseases. Such licensing arrangements will provide for use of these vectors by our partners in a field-exclusive manner, and consequently, will provide a critical step in bringing the technology to its marketable fruition.",

Phase I demonstrated the feasibility and promise of integrating laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) capability into daVinci. Phase II will develop a complete, integrated application environment and testbed surgical applications for LUS-guided liver surgery. Our general goal is to provide the image quality and access of \"open\" ultrasonography in a minimally-invasive environment, while also improving the surgeon's ability to do ultrasound-guided procedures. The Phase II system will provide a realistic evaluation of the potential of an LUS-capable daVinci system for hepatic surgery as well as evaluation of the design choices and trade-offs in the functions developed. Phase II has three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Develop functional capabilities required for LUS-assisted robotic surgery. We will extend the Phase I architecture to improve robustness, flexibility, and suitability for evaluation. Other functional enhancements include an articulated robotic LUS probe, prototype biopsy and ablation tools, \"virtual fixtures\" and improved semi- automated behaviors for ultrasound imaging and targeting of lesions, LUS visualization capabilities integrated into the daVinci user interface, as well as other significant enhancements to the interface permitting the surgeon to interact with LUS system, images, and other functions of the system. Specific Aim 2: Produce an Integrated Robotic System for LUS-Assisted Hepatic Surgery. We will combine these capabilities to produce a system suitable for in-vivo testing of three hepatic procedures: 1) assessment (staging) to locate and measure tumors; 2) Needle placement for biopsy/ablation; and 3) resection of small tumors. In each case, the goal is to combine the fundamental capabilities developed in Aim 1 with sufficient application-specific tooling and software to provide necessary clinically relevant context for development and to support the evaluations proposed in Aim 3. Specific Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness of the overall system and specific functions for hepatic surgery through in-vivo evaluations and ex vivo phantoms. A successful Phase II will provide the foundation of a product that will enable surgeons to perform US-guided hepatic procedures in a minimally invasive manner with the image quality and dexterity currently available with open laparotomies.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Organophosphorous (OP) neurotoxins such as paraoxon, sarin, soman, VX, and Russian-VX, are a broad class of chemicals commonly used as pesticides and chemical warfare (CW) agents. Currently, over 100,000 tons of chemical warfare agents are stockpiled worldwide, and thousands-of-tons of OP pesticides are released into the environment annually. Enzymes known as phosphotriesterases, commonly called organophosphorous hydrolases (OPH), are capable of hydrolyzing OP and CW agents into harmless products. Because of their potential for destruction of these neurotoxins, and since most enzymes are environmentally safe and used in commercial products such as laundry detergents, organophosphorous hydrolases have recently become the focus of intense research efforts aimed at developing these enzymes into products for enzyme- based decontamination. Unfortunately, the enzymes currently in development lack many of the desired properties such as solution solubility, thermal and pH stability, and substrate specificity for all of the potential applications of these enzymes. Therefore, we used bioinformatic approaches to identify novel OPH enzymes with unique physical and biochemical properties. We identified, cloned, expressed, purified, crystallized, and determined the x-ray structure of a novel OPH from an extremophile that has significant activity against the chemical warfare agent soman. This enzyme has unique physical properties such as high solubility and thermostability compared to all of the other OPH enzymes under development. Therefore, our version of OPH holds significant promise for technological advancement in both civilian and military applications that require novel OPH enzymes for enzyme-based decontamination. Since large-scale expression and production of our enzyme is necessary to make our enzyme commercially viable, and since our version of OPH has low activity toward V-agents, in Phase I of this project we developed new overexpression vectors for commercial production, and we developed automated screening methods to search for variant enzymes with improved catalytic properties. In Phase II, we propose to develop large-scale production and purification processes for the enzyme, and to further enhance the catalytic activity of the enzyme towards the V-agents using directed-evolution approaches.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infection remains as one of the major complications associated with utilizing biomaterials. Surgical site infections account for approximately 14-16% of the 2.4-million nosocomial infections in the United States, with these infections resulting in increased patient morbidity and mortality. The inherent bulk properties of various biomaterials, including those that comprise sutures, provide a milieu for initial bacterial adhesion with subsequent biofilm production and growth. Once the pathogen(s) adheres to the biomaterial surface, treatment with antimicrobial agents is ineffective due to limited penetration of the agent through the bacterial biofilm. Thus, development of a novel infection-resistant suture would provide a localized bacteriocidal environment. In Phase I, Ciprofloxacin (Cipro), Linezolid and Doxycycline were successfully incorporated into nylon, silk and polyester (Dacron) suture materials using textile-dyeing techniques, resulting in infection- resistant suture materials with optimum antimicrobial properties while maintaining the physical properties of the materials. The goal of this Phase II is to evaluate these novel infection-resistant sutures in vivo using a wound infection model. Our hypothesis is that antibiotic-dyed sutures will release antibiotic in a slow, sustained fashion over a period of time as demonstrated in our Phase I in vitro studies, preventing bacterial infection at the suture surface as well as in the surrounding tissue. Current non-degradable suture materials do not possess these characteristics. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) apply antibiotics to nylon, silk and Dacron sutures using dyeing parameters established in Phase I, 2) characterize the physical properties of antibiotic-dyed sutures, 3) determine antibiotic release and antimicrobial activity of antibiotic-dyed sutures using spectrophotometric and in vitro microbiological assays, 4) assess infection-resistance of antibiotic- dyed sutures using a wound infection model and 5) evaluate explanted sutures for localized healing as well as strength using histological and physical testing techniques, respectively. Based on the current infection rates in conjunction with the costs to treat these patients (an average $2,300/episode), surgical wound infection results in an annual cost to the healthcare system of greater than $5 billion. Thus, a significant market exists for application of our technology in order to prevent wound infection.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain is a significant medical problem. Its treatment, in particular chronic neuropathic pain, remains an area of unmet therapeutic need. An important potential group of drugs for the treatment of neuropathic pain are compounds which act as antagonists at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Drugs from this class have also been shown to enhance the analgesic effect of morphine and to inhibit tolerance development to this opioid. Despite their great promise as analgesics, the clinical usefulness of the only available NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine, has been limited due to its psychotomimetic, sedative and motor side effects. This has prompted an effort towards identifying other NMDA receptor antagonists which retain analgesic properties but with a more acceptable side effect profile. Phase I STTR funding for this project has demonstrated that the novel NMDA receptor antagonist, norketamine (NK) and its enantomers [R(+) and S(-)-NK] have analgesic properties in a rodent model of neuropathic pain. The majority of side effects are with the R(+)-enantiomer. Thus, we have established the feasibility that norketamine, specifically S(-)-NK, has the potential for development as a novel agent for the treatment of neuropathic pain. The ultimate objective in the proposed Phase II STTR funding is to develop an NMDA receptor antagonist with fewer and more tolerable side effects for the treatment of chronic pain. The specific aims of the Phase II STTR proposal are to: 1) further characterize the pharmacologic profile of S(-j-NK, in comparison to R(+)- NK, in established rat models of pain and behavior; 2) perform non-cGMP bulk synthesis of S(-)-NK for preclinical studies; 3) evaluate the oral bioavailability, assess the metabolic profile, and determine the optimal oral dose of S(-)-NK in the rat; 4) provide a bulk manufacturing process for the API, formulate an oral capsule dosage form of S(-)-NK and obtain cGMP S(-)-NK and cGMP placebo for use in the Phase I clinical trial; 5) evaluate toxicological properties of S(-)-NK including neurotoxicity; 6) conduct a Phase I clinical trial to assess the safety of S(-) NK. In summary, Phase I STTR findings have established the feasibility that S(- )-NK is a viable candidate for further development as a drug for neuropathic pain. The Phase II STTR proposal will build upon Phase I STTR findings to further characterize the pharmacology and toxicology of S(-)-NK, to obtain an Investigational New Drug application, with the overall goal of proceeding to a Phase I clinical trial in humans.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is associated with a number of serious neurological conditions. Its successful management yields improved outcome for patients, yet ICP can only be measured by placing a device within the cranium through a hole in the skull (yielding invasive ICP, or ilCP), a procedure associated with significant risks and requiring a neurosurgeon for its implementation. A non-invasive and easy method of measuring ICP (nICP) could be extremely useful for rapidly diagnosing neurological problems associated with high ICP. In our preliminary studies we have designed a methodology to determine nICP and assembled a pre-prototype device that allowed us to collect the data necessary to implement this methodology during post-hoc analysis. Among other variables, this approach uses arterial blood pressure (ABP) measured invasively. We have built a series of nICP algorithms and successfully tested them on up to twenty-one patients whose mean ilCP ranged between 5-50 mmHg. Also, we have built and tested a prototype device that both facilitates the real-time comparison of nICP with ilCP and allows the storage of patient data for further nICP algorithm refinement. Moreover, our preliminary analysis shows that this approach is amenable to implementation with non-invasive ABP. The purpose of the present proposal is to refine this approach to nICP to the point that it can be favorably compared to ilCP, whether using invasive or non-invasive ABP.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endogenous somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) offer novel targets for treating pain via both peripheral and central mechanisms. Our studies show that peripheral SSTR activation prevents nociceptor sensitization and provides phasic and tonic inhibitory control of nociceptors. This modulation is an important therapeutic goal since sensitization of peripheral nociceptors in inflammation defines the quality and duration of primary hyperalgesia and contributes to central sensitization and secondary hyperalgesia. Targeting peripheral SSTRs is further supported by clinical studies demonstrating analgesia following systemic administration of the SST peptide analog octreotide (OCT). The targeting of central SSTRs to treat pain is supported by several clinical studies that date back over two decades. Thus, intrathecal administration of native SST as well as the peptide analog OCT provides analgesia in severe pain (e.g. cancer pain) even in cases when opioids are no longer effective. Unfortunately, the potential of SST analogues for treating pain by central mechanisms has been unrealized due to poor CNS penetration of available SST peptide drugs. Our ultimate aim is to develop non-peptide SSTR agonists known as NISAs (Non-peptide Imidazolidinedione Somatostatin Agonists) as novel analgesics. Phase I studies were completed using the potent and highly SSTR2 selective NISA, SCR007. Administration of SCR007 by a local (intraplantar) or systemic (ip) route, reduced pain behaviors in vivo and peripheral sensitization of nociceptors in vitro in two models of acute inflammation. In Phase II, other NISA analogs with a spectrum of lipophilicities will be compounded and tested in vitro for antinociceptive properties (Aim 1). SCR007 and another promising NISA analogue (from Aim 1) will be tested in 2 models of chronic pain (Aims 2 and 3), with the aim of identifying an analgesic compound that is suitable for drug development. Using constant infusion by Alzet pumps, the anti-nociceptive effect of candidate drugs will be tested in two clinically relevant chronic pain models which have inflammatory components (spinal cord injury- and complete Freunds adjuvant-induced pain), via two routes (systemic and intrathecal). We will assess the behavioral, physiological and anatomical outcomes of NISAs treatment, evaluating their potential to yield highly desirable analgesics which could greatly reduce the current reliance on opioid therapies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Celiac disease is an inflammatory autoimmune disease in which CD4+ T cells target, damage and eventually destroy the villous tissue structures of the small intestine, interfering with the absorption of nutrients from food. People who have celiac disease cannot tolerate gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye and barley. This debilitating disease affects 1 of every 120-300 people, which in the United States alone translates to a market size of roughly 2.2 million people. The goal of the proposed work is to test lead compounds (developed under Phase I funding) in vitro on human HLA-DQ-restricted T cell clones, and quantify their ability to control activated intestinal T cells in HLA-DQ transgenic mice. The approach presented is based on patented RTL technology (US Patent #6,270,772) for which Virogenomics holds an exclusive license. The therapeutic efficacy of the RTL technology was first described in EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. In this animal model RTLs inhibited activation of pathogenic T cells and could be used to prevent and treat disease. The potential of these molecules in the treatment of other human diseases provided a strong rationale to develop HLA-DQ-derived human RTLs for treatment of celiac disease. Under Phase I funding, HLA-DQ-derived Recombinant T cell receptor Ligands (RTLs) were designed and purified. These molecules also underwent rigorous biochemical and biophysical characterization. Recently, huCD4/DQ2 and huCD4/DQ8 transgenic mouse models of gluten sensitivity have been developed. In the huCD4/DQ8 transgenic model the T cell response to gluten was CD4 dependent, HLA-DQ restricted and led to the production of cytokines IL-6, TGF-beta and IL-10, with intestinal lymphocytes from gluten-fed mice displaying an activated phenotype. We will use these animal models to take DQ-derived RTL lead compounds through proof-of-concept experiments in vivo. Under Phase II funding we propose 1) In vitro characterization of the biological effects of DQ-derived RTLs on human T cell lines obtained from patients with celiac disease, using these studies to refine our lead compounds to maximize their biological activity; and 2) Characterization of RTL dosage requirements to modulate cytokine production and block activation of intestinal T cells In transgenic mouse models of celiac disease.",

We recently completed Phase I of this project (R41 MH070982; Training for Treatment of Adolescent Depression [TTAD\\), in which we developed and evaluated the prototype of a computer-based program designed to train clinicians in delivering the Adolescent Coping With Depression (CWD-A; Clarke et al., 1990) course in a group setting. The TTAD Phase I prototype program presented three of nine core CWD-A course elements. In an evaluation with 40 mental health clinicians, consumer satisfaction was extremely positive and significant improvements occurred in course-related knowledge, self-efficacy, and intentions to use therapy components presented in the program. Based on the promising results of Phase I, we would now like to conduct Phase II of our project. Specific Aims for Phase II are: (1) Create a complete computer-based training program for mental health clinicians that includes the six remaining course skills and incorporates feedback received in the Phase I formative evaluation. In addition, we will develop program modules that address the specific needs of the additional populations or settings (e.g., use in schools, juvenile corrections). (2) Create a companion Web site for the program which offers on-line registration for continuing education (CE) credit, self tests, access to current research, and FAQ (frequently asked questions) content provided by a CWD-A expert. (3) Conduct a randomized controlled trial with 128 Master's-level clinicians, recruited from Oregon and New Mexico, to evaluate the incremental value of using the enhanced computer-based program plus the CWD-A manual versus using the written manual alone during a one-week program evaluation period. Outcomes will include pre-post and between group changes in attitudes, knowledge, intent to use, and consumer satisfaction. (4) Develop a final version of the computer-based training program for marketability. Relevance. Adolescent depression is a significant public health problem. Although effective treatments for adolescent depression have been created and evaluated in research settings, they are seldom adopted in clinical practice. The proposed development of a computer-based interactive program designed to train mental health providers in the use of an empirically-supported treatment for depressed teenagers will provide a standardized and high-quality training that is delivered in a cost-effective and accessible manner. The proposed program will fulfill a critical need because no formalizing training procedure (written, conference-based, or computer-based) for the CWD-A intervention currently exists.",

The goal of this application is to continue our efforts to develop novel chemical libraries with the diversity and complexity common to natural products as a marketable product to the pharmaceutical industry. Key to our strategy is the use of fermentation derived natural products and recombinant non-natural variants as high complexity feedstock materials for diversity oriented synthesis. Unlike analog generation, these recombinant natural products are specifically designed to allow chemical diversification. Our approach differs substantially from combinatorial biosynthesis in that only a few, well-defined compounds are needed from fermentation sources. By only requiring a limited set of recombinant compounds from the organism, careful optimization can be conducted to ensure high yields of material. While this strategy relies on nature to construct a high degree of the complex features of the library, diversity-oriented strategies are utilized to generate large libraries that cover vast areas of structural space. Under the Phase I award, we have developed a number of direct and efficient strategies for converting a recombinant building block (nonactate) into several unique molecular architectures. This Phase award will allow our efforts to transition from the methods stage to Phase III, large-scale production and marketing of compound libraries. Under this award we will (1) prepare moderate sized libraries of highly diverse and complex molecules from nonactate, (2) develop new methods for scaffolds generation from the polyketides methymycin, pikromycin and spinosyn and (3) develop two new recombinant natural feedstocks, pikrodiene and spinosene. Through these efforts, Promiliad will be in a position to become a major supplier of new chemical entities to the pharmaceutical industry.",

Surgical reconstruction followed by an extended rehabilitation period is commonly recommended for ACL tears. The purpose of this STTR project is to develop a comprehensive behavioral multimedia package designed to reduce preoperative anxiety, decrease pain and anxiety during rehabilitation, and enhance rehabilitation outcome. In a novel application of existing technology, a prototype of an interactive CD-ROM has been developed to provide ACL reconstruction patients with information on surgery- and rehabilitation-related matters and instruction in presurgical and postsurgical coping strategies. Prototype audio recordings based on an empirically validated relaxation and guided imagery protocol for postsurgical ACL rehabilitation have also been produced. Phase II tasks will include: (a) producing final prototypes of the CD-ROM and series of audio recordings (taking into account the results of Phase I studies); and (b) conducting a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effects of the CD-ROM and audiotape series on presurgical and postsurgical process and outcome variables. In the clinical trial, 132 patients scheduled for ACL reconstruction surgery will be administered measures of demographic and injury-related variables, pain, mood, range-of-motion, knee laxity, and subjective knee symptoms prior to being assigned randomly to an experimental condition or a control condition. Experimental group participants will be exposed to the CD-ROM and series of audio recordings, whereas control participants will receive no such exposure. Preoperative anxiety will be assessed prior to surgery, and pain, mood, reinjury anxiety, and adherence to clinic- and home-based rehabilitation activities will be assessed on a monthly basis for the first six months of postoperative rehabilitation. Measures of range-of-motion, knee laxity, and subjective knee symptoms will again be administered six months after surgery. Successful performance of the CD-ROM and audio recordings in Phase II will result in a product ready for marketing to orthopedic patients and professionals in Phase III.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II project will complete the development and study of a computer-based product intended primarily for teaching children with intellectual disabilities. The product, \"SymbolTeacher,\" addresses a pivotal skill - symbolic matching to sample - which is a target of many current programs for teaching this population. In a symbolic matching task, students are presented with an array of two- or three-dimensional stimuli and required to select the item that \"goes with\" a sample; hence the name \"matching to sample.\" Unlike an identity matching-to-sample task, in which a match is made on the basis of physical identity, symbolic matches involve stimuli that are not identical; matches are made on the basis of instruction and feedback. For example, a student is taught to match the picture of a dog (referent) to the printed word DOG (symbol); there are no physical stimulus properties that define the symbol-referent relation, and thus nothing inherent in the stimuli to guide the student if he or she has had no previous experience with them. The project has two major objectives. First, we will adapt well developed, extensively researched laboratory methods and software for use by parents, teachers, and other helping professionals. Second, we will evaluate the resulting product to determine that it can be used effectively in typical teaching situations. There is a manifest need for the product. Symbolic matching provides a foundation for teaching a large variety of discrimination, reading readiness, and symbolic communication skills. However, many children with intellectual disabilities do not learn symbolic matching readily (or at all) via conventional instructional methods. Over the past decade, a substantial investment of NIH research funding has led to the development of methods that can reliably establish symbolic matching in children with disabilities. Despite these advances, the relevant knowledge and tools are not readily accessible to the professionals, parents, and children who would benefit. We will use the STTR funding mechanism to give broader access to this behavioral technology.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current technologies used in blood banking are extraordinarily labor intensive, prone to human error, and an order of magnitude more expensive per test that those in other clinical laboratories. Coupled with a growing shortage of skilled medical technologists, dwindling supplies of human plasma-derived phenotyping reagents, and an inherent difficulty in fully automating agglutination-based methodologies, the ability to perform rapid and accurate pre-transfusion testing in a cost-effective manner has become a significant challenge. PhenoTech's long-term objective is to use a set of novel molecular technologies to develop a new class of renewable, inexpensive, high-quality blood bank testing reagents that will function in a rapid, high- throughput, automatable assay system. At the core of the proposed technology are red blood cell antigen- specific monoclonal antibodies displayed on the surface of bacteriophage particles. Phase I studies proposed to exploit the naturally-occurring presence of unique DNA sequences within the particles to develop an assay system in which the phenotype of a cell is determined by assaying the genotype of the detecting reagent. Such a strategy would offer extraordinary sensitivity and specificity, would require minute amounts of testing materials and reagents, would be easily adapted to automation, and would be amenable to multiplexing strategies offering the possibility of simultaneous antigen profiling of a red cell sample in a single reaction vessel. This would make extended phenotyping and matching of blood beyond the traditional three-antigen A, B, and Rh(D) affordable and routine. Such a paradigm shift in the practice of transfusion medicine would then serve to reduce the incidence of red cell alloimmunization and occurrence of delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, decrease the development of positive antibody screens and the costs in working them up, and improve the turn-around-time for the provision of immunologically-compatible blood. As reported in this Phase II proposal, PhenpTech was successful in demonstrating the feasibility of multiplexing red cell typing reactions using its novel reagent genotyping methodology. Reactions required less than 1/100,000 the number of RBCs of a conventional agglutination assay and used attogram equivalents of conventional antibody reagents. In addition, the ability to use phage particles which express anti-globulin-like molecules for performing indirect antiglobulin tests, the most labor-intensive and costly group of pre-transfusion tests, was also shown. Having demonstrated the feasibility of phage reagent genotyping methods, PhenoTech's Phase II program will now focus on the development of a suite of phage reagents to clinically important blood group antigens required for further development of its blood testing technologies. Combined with its concurrent development of a microfluidics-based \"lab-on-a-chip\" platform, PhenoTech will be able to provide the tools necessary to ensure the safe practice of transfusion medicine in the future by addressing the technical and fiscal limitations of conventional blood bank testing methods.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of drugs based on the MC2R antagonists will directly benefit children with CAH and Cushing's diseases, and will help us to understand MC2R's role in metabolic pathways. The long term goal of this project is to discover small molecule inhibitors of MC2 receptor and develop drug to treat several metabolic diseases including CAH and Cushing's diseases afflicting children. Our Phase I studies to identify novel ACTH small molecule antagonists were successful; we were able to identified three novel non-peptide small molecule ACTH antagonists that have high affinity to the MC2R. The inhibitors belong to the same chemotype with a similar chemical backbone. These compounds are full ACTH antagonists that potently inhibit ACTH-stimulated adrenal cell activity. We have achieved the Phase I goals and discovered a novel series of small molecule non-peptide ACTH antagonists. Phase II of this project will be dedicated to extending our studies of ACTH antagonists by examining structure-activity relationships using series analogs of identified inhibitors to assess their ACTH antagonist potency, specificity, and selectivity, and initiating animal testing. Specifically we will: 1) examine ACTH antagonist structure-activity relationships to increase our understanding of basic structural requirements for the compound to bind to MC2R; 2) assess selectivity and specificity of the ACTH antagonists to other melanocortin and unrelated receptors; (3) assess ADME- related characteristics such as human serum albumin binding, P450 inhibition, lipid membrane, CACO-2 permeability, and in vitro cytotoxicity; 4) perform in vivo animal toxicology/pharmacokinetic testing; and 5) assess ability to block ACTH action in an in vivo animal model. These studies combine ChemDiv's expertise in drug discovery with a Yale laboratory with expertise in GPCR action and treatment of adrenal disorders. The studies will lead to novel approaches for treating patients with ACTH-dependent adrenal disorders.         Project Narrative: The production of adrenal gland hormones, including cortisol and androgens, is regulated by pituitary ACTH (adrenocorticotropin hormone), which acts via the melanocortin-2 receptor (MC2R) to stimulate steroid production. Serious clinical disorders affecting the adrenal gland include congenital virilizing adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and Cushing's disease. The ability to antagonize ACTH action will greatly facilitate the care of these and other conditions affecting the adrenal gland. Unfortunately, high-affinity small molecule ACTH antagonists are not identified yet and are not currently available for clinical use.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) accumulates mutations with aging in human beings and animal models of accelerated mtDNA mutagenesis produce advanced aging phenotypes such as osteoporosis, cardiomyopathy, neurodegeneration, hair loss, anemia and reduced fertility. Though compelling, these animal models are insufficient to prove that mtDNA is responsible for aging phenotypes. If mtDNA could be delivered to mitochondria in vivo, the role of mtDNA in aging could be directly addressed. In conjunction with the Center for the Study of Neurodegenerative Disease (CSND) at the University of Virginia, in a Phase I STTR, Gencia Corporation successfully utilized a method to transfect mitochondria with full-length mtDNA. This was done by using a novel mitochondrial transfection technology, Protofection? (Protein Mediated Transfection), a technology developed and solely owned by Gencia Corporation. Protofection is a DNA-binding, non-viral delivery vector consisting of an engineered recombinant protein that targets mitochondria for DNA delivery. Additional data beyond the aims of the Phase I study show that protofection can deliver and express a full-length mtDNA engineered to express a reporter protein (GFP, Green Fluorescent Protein), in vivo and that delivery of normal mtDNA can ameliorate metabolic defects in cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) cells made from aged human subjects. The mechanism by which the mitochondrial transfection technology delivers mtDNA to mitochondria was also discovered and suggests the existence of mitochondrial lipid rafts. In this Phase II STTR, Gencia Corporation and the CSND propose to address the contribution of mitochondrial genomic damage to aging phenotypes by transfecting normal mtDNA into aged mice and mtDNA from aged mice into young mice. The proposed mtDNA transfection experiments will directly determine which aspects of aging phenotypes are caused by mtDNA and which can be reversed by the delivery of normal mtDNA. Efficacy in ameliorating specific phenotypes of aging (which may include sarcopenia, cognitive decline, osteoporosis and others) will be the basis of Investigational New Drug (IND) applications to the FDA/CBER (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research) for the use of mtDNA gene therapy in these conditions. By 2030 an unprecedented 20% of the population will be over age 65. Since mutations in mitochondrial DNA may be responsible for many aging phenotypes, having a therapy for mitochondrial DNA may reduce this burden. The research proposed in this Phase II STTR will directly address what aging phenotypes are caused by mitochondrial DNA and whether these phenotypes can be reversed.",

Our proposed studies are aimed at developing a novel tumor immunotherapy by using cryptic peptides of Her-2 protein and modified Her-2 peptides, both of which break immune tolerance to ?self? tumor antigens expressed on breast cancer cells. In general, most tumor antigens have been characterized as normal, non-mutated self peptides, linking the concepts of autoimmunity with the development of tumor immunity. Our phase I studies have demonstrated the ability of peptide vaccination to elicit anti-Her-2 antibodies that resemble Herceptin, a monoclonal antibody currently approved for immunotherapy of human breast cancer. Similar to Her-2 binding by Herceptin, antibodies induced by peptide vaccination bind native Her-2 protein on living tumor cells and in solid phase immunoassays, as well as denatured Her-2 protein and peptides therein. We have demonstrated that immunization with Her-2 peptides elicits antibodies that inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. The goal of the Phase II study is to develop enhanced anti-Her-2 tumor immunity with a select group of Her-2 peptides in combination with adjuvants approved for human use, alum and novel TLR-based adjuvants. At present, antibody-mediated treatment of breast cancer requires prolonged administration of the therapeutic. This work will attempt to establish vaccine- based long term immunity with antibody specificities and biologic efficacy comparable to Herceptin therapy. The overall objective of this research is to develop peptide-based vaccination strategies to mimic the anti-tumor properties of Herceptin, an antibody with proven clinical efficacy in patients with breast cancer.",

A variety of antipsoriatic therapies are available, however, due to problems with side effects and variability in clinical response, intense clinical and commercial interest remains in the development of new treatments. In the current studies, we are investigating the antipsoriatic potential of topically administered thiazolidinediones, a novel class of drugs that has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of a variety of cell types including keratinocytes. These drugs have been shown to have antipsoriatic effects when adminstered orally and previous Phase I STTR studies have indicated that they may also be effective when topically administered. In this Phase II application, we are continuing development of an extremely potent thiazolidinedione for topical treatment of psoriasis. We are testing for optimal dose concentrations in state-of-the art animal models of psoriasis and are performing toxicology studies to determine the safety profile with topical administration. In addition, we are exploring the potential of this agent for use in treatment of other inflammatory skin diseases. We are also testing the anti-psoriatic potential of a related non-thiazolidinedione compound that affects multiple pathways known to influence mechanisms underlying psoriasis. Through these efficacy and safety studies, the current Phase II STTR experiments will provide major steps towards attracting financial support and 3rd party agreements for Phase III commercial development of this new therapeutic option in the management of psoriasis. This project is designed to development a new drug for the treatment of psoriasis, a common and often debilitating skin disease that affects 1-2% of the population.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this program is to save lives and improve the quality of care of people requiring vascular access by enabling quicker access and minimizing failed attempts. Direct visualization of target vessels with ultrasound imaging will minimize number of attempts and failed attempts, thus allowing more rapid vascular access for administration of IV fluids or medications, improving patient satisfaction, reducing the need for more invasive procedures and saving healthcare providers' valuable time. This program will make ultrasound guided vascular access available to a greater number of healthcare providers in a wide range of settings by developing and validating a low-cost ($2,000 per unit), easy to use, and highly portable ultrasonic imaging system called the Sonic Window. This system will be comparable in size to a mobile phone or PDA and is specifically designed to meet the needs of users with little or no experience in medical imaging at a fraction of the cost of currently available portable ultrasound systems. Our system will form C-Scan images (image plane parallel to skin surface) that are intuitive for novice users and display those images at the site of acquisition, allowing the user to see the image in the perspective that would be obtained if you had a clear ?window? through the skin into the tissue or vessel of interest. The Sonic Window is being realized by combining a low profile 2D array, custom integrated circuits, novel beamforming and image processing algorithms implemented on a commercial Digital Signal Processor, and a LCD display. Innovative technological approaches are employed to circumvent conventional engineering wisdom that holds that C-Scan imaging is inherently more complex and costly than B-Scan imaging (plane perpendicular to skin surface). The Specific Aim of this Phase II research is to demonstrate the efficacy of a prototype Sonic Window system for guiding peripheral IV access procedures. This aim will be accomplished through two clinical studies involving nurses which compare the success of ultrasound guided peripheral IV insertions with the prototype to landmark based peripheral IV insertions (control). The first study will be comprised of known difficult to access patients (i.e. 1 failed access attempt) requiring IV placement. The second study will be comprised of patients requiring IV placement from a nursing unit with a population of patients generally regarded to have difficult access (e.g. bariatrics, oncology, ICU). In order to perform the studies, we will first complete integration of a clinical Sonic Window prototype and perform system validation, optimization and safety verification. A positive conclusion from this research, demonstrating faster and easier peripheral IV access, will increase confidence in the commercial viability of the Sonic Window product. In future stages of development, we will extend this work to include more complicated access procedures such as central line insertions. This research is a collaborative effort between PocketSonics, Inc. and the University of Virginia (Departments of Biomedical Eng., Electrical and Computer Eng. and the School of Nursing).

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In Phase I of this proposal, products were developed necessary for disseminating CAST, an effective indicated suicide prevention program. One of the products is The CAST Trainer Guide. Fundamental to CAST is skills training within the context of group support. The training of CAST Leaders therefore focuses on the acquisition of leader behaviors that foster skills training and group support. Little is known about the processes required to transfer indicated prevention programming from research to school environments. In Phase II, our intent is to test the effects of the CAST Training Model (explicated in the CAST Trainer Guide) on levels of CAST Leader implementation readiness, using a randomized wait-list control design. Specific Aims: CAST training participants vs. wait-list controls will reveal greater implementation readiness on    4 indices. That is, CAST trainees vs. controls will show higher: Aim 1: Percentages of critical elements covered (dose) with greater quality of delivery (competence) - as coded by a 3rd party observer using the CAST Content Evaluation Form. Aim 2: Levels in fostering group belonging when expected - as coded by a 3rd party observer using the Leader Group Building Behaviors checklist.    Aim 3: Levels of promoting skills training when expected - as coded by a 3rd party observer using the Leader Skills Training Behaviors checklist. Aim 4: Effects of 5 independent variables will be tested on the dependent variable: implementation readiness, as measured by the CAST Implementation and Satisfaction Surveys. The independent variables are trainee attitude toward (1) the CAST conceptual model, and (2) the need for continued training/supervision; trainee scores on (3) Leader hiring criteria met; (4) assessments of the training manuals/resources; and (5) evaluation of CAST training.    Products: Upon completion of Phase II, products critical to disseminating CAST will be in place, including: 1) a team of 8 CAST Trainers certified to train CAST Leaders with fidelity, 2) a CAST Coordinator Guide, 3) The Administrator's Guide to CAST Implementation, and 4) a \"science-based\" CAST Training Model for CAST Leaders. Significance: We know of only one model program that reported efficacy results of their training model. Goal 4 of The National Strategy for Suicide Prevention states, \"Develop and Promote Effective and Professional Practices.\" This study will add to prevention science by: (1) providing an evidence-based CAST suicide prevention program, with training, to health care professionals, (2) ensuring an effective CAST Training Model that fosters effectual intervention fidelity, (3) identifying training components that promote implementation fidelity in the transfer of CAST from research to practice. Ultimately, for all concerned with the alarming problem of youth suicide in their communities, they will be able to promote or deliver CARE for the benefit of suicidal youth.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cepheid Inc and the New Jersey Medical School have developed an assay system that integrates sample processing and real-time PCR diagnosis into a single, hands free process. During the successful completion of a phase I STTR application we demonstrated that this system simultaneously detect the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and diagnose rifampin resistance directly from clinical sputum samples. The assay uses an inexpensive plastic cartridge to collect sputum samples, concentrate the bacteria present in the sputum, perform high efficiency cell lysis and deliver inhibitor-free DNA into a PCR tube without user input. Detection of TB and rifampin resistance is also performed within the cartridge using a real-time PCR assay and a series of molecular beacon probes. The goal of this phase II STTR application is to further refine the sensitivity and robustness of the assay and to develop the commercial reagents, materials, software and protocols so that our system can be tested in larger-scale trials leading to its commercialization. This STTR will result in a desktop system that is sufficiently simple and robust to be performed anywhere with minimal training; and sufficiently sensitive and specific to be performed on patients with smear negative tuberculosis. Specifically we aim to: 1) Modify the assay to function in a new six-color instrument, and further refine the assay using innovative strategies to increase its sensitivity, specificity and robustness. 2) Convert assay components and protocols into the appropriate format for clinical trials and subsequent commercialization by lyophilizing all reagents for factory packaging, and developing simple methods to load samples and buffers into the cartridge. 3) Perform pre clinical testing to verify assay sensitivity, specificity and limits of detection and assess the effects of potential interfering substances. The system will then be retested using a large number of clinical sputum specimens. Finally, we will develop complete documentation on the assay including production, and development reports.",

Phase I results showed that (1) polyaxial amorphous polymeric initiators can be end-grafted with glycolide to produce crystalline fiber- forming segmented copolyesters (SP) and (2) two SP-based monofilaments were identified as candidates for further development in Phase II. Although the compliance of these monofilaments was higher compared to dry SGS, they were stiffer than wet SGS. Hence, post-Phase I studies were pursued on other polyaxial fiber-forming compositions which can be used to prepare compliant monofilaments with a modulus of less than 100 Kpsi while remaining competitive with SGS in terms of other suture properties. And segmented polyaxial grafted polyesters (SPGs) having chains made of practically amorphous polytrimethylene carbonate core and highly segmented crystallizable terminal components based principally on glycolide and e-caprolactone were explored and shown to have more promising properties than the SPs. Hence, Phase II objective was revised to focus on the development of the SPG system primarily to produce compliant monofilament sutures as preferred alternatives to plain and chromic SGS. And, Phase II plans entail (1) optimization of two SPG systems selected in post-Phase I to choose one final system to produce preferred alternatives to plain and chromic SGS, with and without reliance on significant radiation-dose modulation of their properties; (2) completion of development and process validation studies on selected sutures based on the final SPG system; (3) completion of comparative in vitro and in vivo studies of SGS and their synthetic SPG-based alternatives (SGS-A); (4) initiation of safety, stability, and scale-up studies on SGS-A; (5) completing exploratory studies on other SPs and/or SPGs as preferred alternatives to certain absorbable commercial monofilaments; and (6) completing Phase III plans.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain management is rapidly becoming a major healthcare challenge. As many as 50 million to 75 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, a number that is certain to increase. In some cases, chronic pain is compounded by episodes of acute moderate-to-severe pain, which \"breaks through\" the around-the-clock medication administered for the treatment of chronic malignant pain. Breakthrough pain is particularly difficult to treat due to its severity, rapid onset, and frequent unpredictability. Cancer is among the most devastating conditions associated with pain. Approximately 50 percent of all cancer patients with moderate to severe pain experience breakthrough pain. The management of breakthrough pain is often poorly controlled by the analgesics currently available in the market, the most common of which are the immediate-release opioids. Given the debilitating effects of breakthrough pain, the need for a safer, more efficient, non-opioid, rapid-onset analgesic is clear. Ketamine hydrochloride is a U.S. FDA approved anesthetic that has been used in tens of thousands of patients since its introduction into clinical practice greater than 30 years ago. At sub-anesthetic plasma concentrations, ketamine acts as a potent analgesic. Ketamine acts as a non-competitive, non-opiate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. IDDS has developed a proprietary formulation of ketamine for intranasal administration. Results from five company-sponsored phase I and II clinical trials established that intranasal ketamine provides rapid onset of pain relief with dose-related effectiveness and duration of effect without producing sedation or significant neurological or cardiovascular side effects associated with anesthetic doses. The objectives of this proposal are to demonstrate the safety and analgesic efficacy of the IDDS proprietary formulation of intranasal ketamine for the management of chronic malignant breakthrough pain. Specifically, the project aims to: 1) establish the safety and efficacy of ketamine hydrochloride for the management of moderate-to-severe pain; 2) evaluate the safety and efficacy of transnasal ketamine in a pivotal phase III multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trail in patients suffering from moderate to severe malignant breakthrough pain; and 3) use the results of the safety and efficacy analyses of the proposed pivotal phase III trial to support the filing of a New Drug Application (NDA) for transnasal ketamine with the U.S. FDA. Dr. Carr, the principal investigator, is an experienced researcher and has successfully conducted the pilot study upon which the present proposal is based.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During Phase I of our research project, we developed a microarray system that can be used to measure the expression of known miRNAs in human, mouse, or rat samples. We used the microarray system to analyze tumor and normal adjacent tissues from patients with lung, colon, breast, prostate, bladder, thyroid, and pancreas cancer. Each tumor type could be readily distinguished from the accompanying normal samples based on the expression levels of 3-10 miRNAs. While each different tumor type was characterized by its own unique miRNA profile, it is interesting to note that several miRNAs appear to be up- or down-regulated in almost all tumor samples relative to normal adjacent tissue samples. This suggests that specific miRNAs might play roles in tumor suppression. Putative mRNA targets for a number of these miRNAs are known oncogenes providing a potential link with oncogenesis. We have verified that the expression of two well- known oncogenes is regulated by one of the miRNAs that was found to be differentially expressed in cancer samples, providing a potential link between reduced miRNA expression and oncogenesis. During Phase II of our research project, we will create methods for, isolating, amplifying, and labeling the miRNA in a sample to enable the analysis of small samples like those that result from needle biopsies and laser capture microdissection (LCM). The amplification method will facilitate studies of miRNA expression in specific types of cancer cells within the tumors of cancer patients and allow researchers to better understand how miRNAs contribute to oncogenesis. We will use the procedure that we develop to analyze LCM samples from lung and colon cancer tumors and normal adjacent tissues to verify that miRNA expression does differ between cell types in tissues.",

The proposed mechanism of action of LlGO-069-136 is the prevention of neutrophil and monocyte adherence to endothelial cells, and subsequent extravasation to the inflamed lung tissue, via blockade of E- and L-selectin, an adhesion molecule responsible for the trafficking of leukocytes from the blood into tissues. It is proposed that this blockade will break the cycle of inflammation responsible for the progressive lung damage that characterizes acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), chronic bronchitis (CB) and COPD. Described in the plan is the detailed preclinical research and development program including efficacy testing, manufacturing, pharmacology, toxicology and INO preparation. LigoCyte expects to fund major portions of the preclinical activity, including the initial efficacy testing of LIGO-069-136 in a non-human primate LPS lung inflammation model and development and manufacturing of the drug substance and drug product. Under the Phase II SBIR renewal funding, LigoCyte will conduct the extensive candidate product testing required for safety (toxicity) and a determination of its biological properties (pharmacology). In addition to assay development work and product testing being done at LigoCyte, much of this work will be done in collaboration with contract research organizations (CROs) that have the capability to conduct manufacturing and/or research under GMP/GLP conditions and regulations. Ultimately, the goal of the program is to provide the FDA with the necessary data to approve LlGO-069-136 for human clinical trials. The subsequent human clinical testing will establish the safety and efficacy of the product as a therapy for managing infection-inflammation driven exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and COPD and establish its ability to slow or arrest disease progression.",

There is significant need to identify novel, effective, small molecule-based cancer therapies. This proposal seeks to undertake further clinical development of a novel targeted agent, PX-12. ProIX Pharmaceuticals has demonstrated there is strong evidence for the following: 1) The redox protein thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) is necessary for the hypoxia-induced increase in HIF-1 alpha in cancer cells. Trx-q causes an increase in HIF-1 alpha transactivating activity and expression of VEGF as well as HIF-1 alpha straining and angiogenesis in experimental tumors in vivo. 2) The expression of Trx-1 is increased in many human primary tumors where it is associated with aggressive tumor growth and decreased patient survivial. 3) Pancreatic tumors are highly hypoxic and express both high levels of HIF and Trx. 4) The small molecule, PX-12 is a potent inhibitor of Trx-1 and the hypoxia induced increase of HIF-1 alpha in a solid tumors. 5) A Phase 1 clinical trial has shown that administration of PX-12 via an i.v. infusion is well tolerated by cancer patients and decreases Trx-1 up to 50-80%. 6) Efficacy, defined as tumor reduction or stable disease, was seen in 7 of 32 advanced metastatic patients treated with PX-12. 7) Trx lowering >25% over a 21 day period (1 cycle) was significantly correlated to increased patient survival. The hypothesis upon which the study is based is that PX-12 is an effective inhibitor of Trx-1, HIF-1 alpha and tumor angiogenesis, with low patient toxicities and good efficacy in Phase 1 clinical trial. Pancreatic cancer, because of its high Trx-1 and HIF-1 alpha levels and angiogenic character is an ideal tumor in which to test the disease specific activity of PX-12. The objectives of this SBIR renewal by ProIX Pharmaceuticals are to: 1) study the efficacy of PX-12 against pancreatic cancer in patients who have failed a single round of gemcitabine therapy and 2) to determine whether PX-12 inhibition of Trx translates a modification in tumor blood flow(angiogenesis).",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a debilitating condition that afflicts nearly 5 million Americans, and it has an increasing incidence. Despite improvements and enormous research efforts (both federally and commercially), pharmacological treatments are ineffective in many patients such that the demand for donor hearts is far greater than the supply. A primary reason why pharmacological, electrical, and/or stem cell treatments are ineffective in many patients may be that they do not directly modulate mechanics in the wall of the heart and strain has recently been shown to be a fundamental stimulus of myocyte gene expression and growth and remodeling. Basically, aberrant growth and remodeling should be anticipated when the strain pattern or mechanical environment is grossly abnormal as in borderzone myocardium post infarction (i.e., dyskinesia) and in CHF (i.e., hypokinesia). To eliminate dyskinetic and hypokinetic motions, Corlnnova Incorporated is developing a novel direct cardiac compression device that can be collapsed and then implanted in a minimally invasive manner. The overall goal of this fast-track proposal is to test the treatment hypothesis in an Ovine model that elimination of dyskinesia in the borderzone of infarcts will preserve borderzone myocardium and thus reduce infarct expansion and scar formation. Prior to testing this hypothesis in phase II, the following phase I milestones will need to be met: 1) Successful implantation into adult sheep via a minimally invasive procedure, 2) Demonstrate an ability of the device to modulate filling of the right ventricle (RV) to compensate for an expected increase in RV ejection, and 3) Demonstrate an ability of the device to eliminate or significantly reduce dyskinesis in an Ovine infarct model. The engineering work will be performed at Corlnnova by the inventor and another experienced engineer.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The effort under this proposal is to prepare for and perform a large clinical study using in-vivo confocal microscopy to validate the results of a smaller, recently published study of the efficacy of this technology for diagnosis of melanoma. The main goal of this Type 2 Phase II Competing Continuation SBIR Proposal is to obtain data for submission to the FDA as a step in the Federal regulatory approval process. The clinical research plan is intended to demonstrate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and the test efficiency of in-vivo confocal microscopy for detection of the most deadly skin cancer - melanoma - in a population of approximately 600 patients presenting with a suspicious pigmented lesion on clinical examination. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2005 approximately 59,580 new cases of invasive melanoma will be diagnosed in the United States, and that 7,770 deaths will occur due to the disease. If melanoma is diagnosed and removed while the tumor is localized, the five-year survival rate is 97.6%; however if the lesion has metastized to either a regional or distant site, the five-year survival rate drops to 60.3% or 16.2%, respectively [Cancer Facts and Figures, 2005]. Consequently, the need for early detection is crucial to a melanoma patient's long-term survival of this disease. This proposal represents one of the final steps in the technological innovation needed to bring a revolutionary medical device to the market. Confocal microscopy can non-invasively image skin in-vivo with cellular resolution. This potentially permits pathologic diagnosis without the need to excise tissue. Just as MRI and CT scans have largely eliminated the need for routine \"exploratory surgery\", in-vivo reflectance confocal microscopy may one day eliminate the need for routine invasive skin biopsy. The proposed study has a high probability of a positive outcome. A recently published pilot study of the efficacy of confocal imaging for the diagnosis of melanoma demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for images read by a panel of diagnostic readers with relatively little training (30 minutes). Consequently, the proposed study, a comparison of confocal imaging to the \"gold standard\" of pathologic examination of excised tissues, conducted at leading U.S. clinical sites and utilizing well-trained diagnostic readers, should produce a compelling clinical data for use in the Federal regulatory approval process. In addition, the project will produce and submit for publication an extensive atlas of confocal images and a glossary of terms for the description of confocal images of pigmented lesions.",

The goal of this project is to develop a set of components that can be added to standard power wheelchairs to convert them into \"smart\" wheelchairs which can assist the user in navigation and obstacle avoidance. During Phase I, a prototype of the Smart Wheelchair Component System (SWCS) was developed from a laptop computer and a collection of sonar, infrared and bump sensors. The evaluation activities performed during Phase I demonstrated that the system is compatible with multiple brands of wheelchairs, can accept both continuous and switch-based input, and can support front-, mid-, and rear-wheel drive wheelchairs. During Phase II, we propose to refine the system hardware and software; replace the laptop computer with an embedded microprocessor; fabricate enclosures for the system components; and develop tools to support clinicians in installing and configuring the system. The system will be evaluated in tests involving potential users, clinicians, and wheelchair design standards. The final product will be a market-ready modular system which can be attached to a variety of standard power wheelchairs. This product has the potential to increase the independence and quality of life of many wheelchair users and potential wheelchair users whose disabilities limit their capacity for independent wheelchair navigation.",

There are currently no specific medications for treating the medical problems caused by acute or chronic PCP abuse. Thus, long-lasting medications that could prevent or minimize PCP effects, and the need for day-to-day patient compliance are sorely needed. We hypothesize that antibody-based medications (developed and produced in Phase I of this STTR), with their extremely favorable pharmacokinetic properties and unique mechanisms of action might provide new hope as an innovative and novel medication for treating PCP abuse. The medication designed for this project is a chimeric monoclonal antibody produced in plants, which was engineered from the antigen binding variable regions of an anti-PCP mouse monoclonal antibody and the constant regions of a human IgG2 antibody. This new medication, called ch-mAb6B5, will have a combination of the proven effectiveness of the mouse anti-PCP monoclonal antibody combined with the safety of a human monoclonal antibody. The Phase I application of this STTR focuses on the expression of this antibody in a recombinant, plant based expression and manufacturing system using tobacco plants. This system has already successfully delivered products to the clinic for human testing and a strong commercialized manufacturing system already exists. By using this new paradigm in expression and manufacturing, the goal of this STTR is to provide safe, efficacious and cost effective therapies for drug abuse treatment. This combined expression, manufacturing and clinical effort is needed to confirm the utility of this approach. The potential for long term impact on health care due to increase in drug abuse could be very large and will be a public burden. Very few therapies are available in this area and these types of industry/academic consortia are necessary to bring these treatments forward.

In these studies, safety and pharmacokinetic measurements in volunteer human PCP abusers will be used to determine the safety profile, dosing strategy, and biological dose of ch-mAb6B5. The efficacy and duration of action of chmAb6B5 will then be determined in a similar group of patients undergoing outpatient cognitive-behavioral therapy for their PCP abuse. The objective knowledge gained from these Phase I and II clinical trials will be used to determine safety of the medications and the clinical scenarios (e.g., chronic PCP abuse) in which the medications could be efficacious and beneficial.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Liver cancer is a significant and increasing health concern. In the United States, there will be over 72,500 cases of colorectal cancer metastasized to the liver. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is also an increasing concern in the United States, primarily due to a rise in hepatitis C. The incidence of HCC in the United States has doubled to 17,550 cases over the last decade, and it is expected to double again over the next ten years. The vast majority of these patients will die within 5 years. The current standard for treating liver cancer is surgical resection, but only about 20% of patients are eligible for this procedure. Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation is one alternative therapy. In this therapy, a small electrode is inserted into the tumor and a high-power, high frequency electrical current heats the tumor. This therapy is a particularly attractive alternative to resection because it is inexpensive and it has a low incidence of complication. However, this therapy is only effective on small tumors-it is ineffective when treating tumors larger than 3-4 cm in diameter. A system capable of treating large tumors is critically needed since half of patients have tumors larger than 3 cm at initial diagnosis, and these larger tumors decrease life expectancy. We propose to complete the development of our saline-enhanced radiofrequency (SERF) ablation system capable of treating large liver tumors. Our system uses radiofrequency heating of tissue with simultaneous injection of hot saline through the electrode and into the tissue. The extracellular flow of saline convects the thermal energy deeper into the tissue to treat larger volumes than previously possible. Our technique has created 8 cm diameter thermal lesions in vivo. These treatment volumes are 20 times as large as those created with conventional RF electrodes. We will complete the design of our therapy system and needle and validate that it complies with medical electrical safety standards (EN60601-1), biocompatibility (ISO-10993), and validate the sterilization to a sterility assurance level (SAL) of 10(-6). We will then carry out a multi-center clinical trial at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, the University of Louisville, the University of Cincinnati and the Southwestern Medical Center. Upon completion of the clinical trial we will file and obtain 510(k) clearance to sell SERF ablation systems in the United States.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Summary Advancements in device miniaturization, integrated circuits packaging, microfabrication technologies, and biocompatible materials have made possible the development of complex neural prostheses designed to restore lost functions such as movement, hearing or vision. Neurological diseases result in significant impairment for millions of individuals worldwide. The requirements for these advanced neural interfaces are not met by currently approved implant devices, which use rigid packaging and are equipped with mostly single or low-density multielectrodes for sensing of physiological events or delivery of electrical stimulation. Neural prostheses such as retinal prostheses require a large number of electrodes, due to the amount of information that must be conveyed, and cannot rely on existing technology. To interface effectively with the nervous system and to open up new applications, miniaturized, flexible electrodes and packaging are needed. As continuation of an on-going Phase II SBIR grant entitled \"Insulating Coatings for Implant Devices and Ribbon Cables\" funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke, we propose long term in-vitro and in-vivo studies for our flexible neural interfaces to collect a comprehensive set of data in preparation of clinical trials and regulatory approval. The retinal implant was chosen as test vehicle for our technology because of the complexity of the device with a large number of channels, the harsh environment for our encapsulation technology and the delicate nature of the tissue. However, the technology we develop will be easily applicable to other devices. We will develop novel, 3-dimensional wide field microelectrode arrays to improve contact to the retina and reduce damage to the tissue. Additionally, these electrode arrays will have a 10-mm diameter area of contact with the retina, thus enabling a wide field of vision. To enable testing of full system implants in vivo in dogs our interfaces will be connected to a proven hermetically sealed implantable stimulator electronics package from Second Sight. This is a key feature of this proposal made possible by our alliance with Second Sight. Years of development have gone into the microelectronics and materials for this next generation implant, and we will be able to leverage that development for this proposal. Advancements in microfabrication and materials have made possible the development of flexible neural interfaces. These medical devices are targeted at treating incurable neurological disorders and solve difficult technical problems that are limiting the capability of neural implant devices. Such diseases are widespread in the population as a whole and their impact on individual health is profound. The progress made by us so far with support from NINDS through Phase II SBIR demonstrates that our technology has the potential to lead to a successful commercialization of complex and challenging neural interfaces like the retinal stimulator and make a real impact on public health by increasing the capability of implantable neural prostheses.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to increase the effective resolution of optical light microscopes using deconvolution algorithms specifically designed for restoring imagery at a sub-pixel level. Light microscopy (LM) of living cells is typically diffraction limited to a maximum resolution of approximately 200nm, and resolution improvements are often considered to require hardware modifications such as structured illumination. The sub-pixel deconvolution software is intended to give life-science researchers an opportunity to increase the resolvability of fine structures within their 3D specimens, using their existing instrumentation and at a low cost. The sub-pixel algorithm is based on maximum-likelihood deconvolution and analytic continuation of photon-limited data. Particular importance is placed on developing algorithm acceleration techniques to reduce processing requirements and make the software commercially attractive. Methods will be investigated that model the effect of the camera pixel dimension and noise. Noise suppression methods are important to improve algorithm robustness in low-light imaging situations, and to retain fine features while preventing unwanted artifacts. The deconvolution will employ phase retrieval methods to estimate the wavefront error at the exit pupil of the microscope directly from the observed data. This approach to blind deconvolution will improve the ability of the algorithm to adapt the point spread function to subtle aberrations and tolerances in the objective lens specifications. Additionally, the sub-pixel algorithm will enable under-sampled imagery using on-chip camera binning or large pixels, and optical sections that are spaced beyond the Nyquist limit, to be correctly processed. The algorithms will be extended to be compatible with widefield fluorescence, transmitted light brightfield, spinning disk confocal and laser scanning ponfocal modalities. Performance will be verified using manufactured test targets and biological specimens with known structures.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In recent years, it has become clear that the majority of cell surface markers are shared by many types of stem and progenitor cells. Thus the ability to separate unique cell sub-populations using current methods is limited. Although it is known that stem cells secrete specific factors into the extracellular space, it is difficult to characterize secretory activity of individual viable cells within a heterogeneous population. Association of the secreted factor(s) with a specific cell type provides an additional marker that can be used to characterize the cell and permit separation of cells while maintaining viability. Combining immunophenotyping with secretory profile is powerful approach for both research and eventual therapeutic applications. Development of new, reliable methods for analyzing and recovering single, viable stem cells based on secretory profile combined with expression of cell surface antigens is of considerable interest. The GMD Stem Cell Assay addresses the need for a functional, multiparameter, single cell assay that does not compromise cell viability, physiological state, and functionality. Phase I research optimized the assay for use with several experimental hematopoietic models. Phase II research will expand use of the assay with other models, including endothelial progenitor cells. This assay format can be widely used for immunological studies, including stem cell research and clinical applications. By providing a reliable method for analyzing and recovering single, viable stem cells based on secretory profile combined with expression of cell surface antigens, this assay format will be useful for stem cell research and clinical applications.",

The use for these products is in biomolecular studies of RNA structure using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The market for these products is structural biology groups in academic and industrial laboratories engaged in structure determination or NMR screening of RNA.   Stable isotope labeling with 13C, 15N, and 2H is a requirement for application of multidimensional NMR studies for structural biology of macromolecules. Existing methods for labeling of RNA and DNA suffer from three main drawbacks. First, the production of isotopically labeled nucleotides is complex and time consuming and difficult to carry out in individual laboratories. Second, it is extremely expensive, since the materials for a single sample can cost many thousands of dollars. Third, the existing methods only permit uniform isotope labeling, while there is considerable advantage to selective isotope labeling.  Recently, we have developed technology that will ameliorate or eliminate these three drawbacks.  The technology involves the efficient single-pot synthesis of labeled ribonucleotides from labeled precursors using a series of enzymatic transformations. In order to make these reagents widely available to the structural biology community, we propose to optimize and scale up production of these reagents for commercial distribution.",

Thus, cardinal modifications of dialyzer reprocessing technology are urgently needed to satisfy effective clearance of various uremic retention solutes other than urea. The NovaTron technology developed by Novaflux Technologies (Novaflux) has been validated to satisfy these recent demands, namely: the recovery of dialyzer membrane functions to like-new conditions, including clearance of middle solutes over many reuses. This technology will be significant since >70% of dialysis patients in the U.S. receive treatment with reprocessed dialyzers. Novaflux has received SBIR Phase I (R43-DK55419) and Phase II (R44-DK55419) grants to develop a novel dialyzer reprocessing technology that solves the fundamental limitations of current reprocessing methods. The Company has demonstrated that the NovaTron technology accomplishes the following results: i) full replacement of manual cleaning at the sink; ii) full recovery of TCV; iii) demonstrated in vitro and clinical capability to recover clearance of middle solutes (a2-microglobulin); iv) increase in reuse number to >40 without adverse effects; v) decrease in consumption of chemicals and RO water and in dialyzer disposal cost; and vi) deliverance of performance equivalent to that of single-use dialyzers during every reuse. The objectives of the proposed Competing Continuation Phase II study are to: i) build and validate a Beta-prototype device to satisfy FDA requirements; ii) assess the device with respect to performance standards related to the FDA approval process; iii) evaluate safety and effectiveness of the device; and iv) complete clinical studies in support of the FDA approval process for devices and to support new claims. Novaflux will be responsible for planning, directing, and executing the proposed study. The Specific Aims of this study are: Aim 1: Finalize and define the design requirements, performance specifications and standards of the NovaTron device (hardware and software) according to the FDA process; Aim 2: Validate, assess and refine (VAR) the Beta NovaTron device and processing chemistries following the GMP process according to FDA requirements for preclinical and clinical trials; Aim 3: Perform system validation, preclinical studies, in vitro assessment and field simulation of the Beta NovaTron device; Aim 4: Prepare, submit and receive approval for FDA-IDE and IRB needed for the clinical evaluation; Aim 5: Perform two clinical trials using Polyflux(r) and Optiflux(r) dialyzers to evaluate the safety, performance and efficacy of the NovaTron technology and to meet the requirements of the FDA submission; Aim 6: Conduct post-clinical final validation and assessment, and refine the final NovaTron device; Aim 7: Perform final audit for FDA approval process; Aim 8: Prepare interim and final reports and publications; Aim 9: Hold periodic meetings with FDA regarding requirements and process for submitting an application.

The objective of the Phase I pre-clinical studies outlined in this fasttrack STTR proposal is to validate the proposed methods of isolation, characterization, and administration of preferred progenitor cell preparations. The overall goal of the clinical research summarized in the Phase II section of this fast-track STTR project is to begin a progression of human clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Arteriocyte's cellular therapy, using a combination of non-embryonic stem cell populations to create new blood vessels in patients with coronary artery ischemia. The key hypothesis underlying this work is that early AC133+ hemangioblasts, rather than mature endothelial cells, are the critical cells that home to sites of vascular injury and mediate new vessel formation. The clinical trial springing from the project team's preliminary data is to investigate whether intra-coronary infusion of escalating doses of AC133-selected autologous marrow-derived stem cells is reasonably safe for use in humans with coronary artery ischemia, and if this treatment shows any improvement in coronary perfusion. Pre-clinical studies for Arteriocyte's cellular therapy to treat arterial ischemia will be completed during Phase I of this STTR project, with a clear focus on validation of the processes by which cells are selected from bone marrow and then infused via catheter into coronary arteries. The company's overall commercialization plan focuses on developing \"off the shelf\" products based on umbilical-cord blood stem cells (using its proprietary technology) that can be made available in a timely and effective manner to manage coronary artery disease.

There is a high incidence of neurological complications amongst survivors, and these represent the leading cause of morbidity. Over the past several years, the care of these patients has been improved via the introduction of new systemic as well as neurospecific therapies. Speed of institution of therapy appears to be an important factor affecting efficacy. Yet, in the crucial initial hours to days post-arrest, assessment of neurological status in these patients is essentially non-existent. Thus, there is a need for an objective validated tool to assess prognosis and to track neurological status in the early recovery period. In response to this need, we have developed the Cortical Health Index (CHI). This EEG-based index incorporates multiple weighted parameters which are related to cortical recovery. The strength and uniqueness of this approach results from consideration of both the temporal as well as the spectral domains. Our Phase II results demonstrate that CHI measured within the first 6-hours post-arrest is strongly correlated with clinical outcome at hospital discharge in a 30-patient cardiac arrest study. We now propose to pursue regulatory approval of the CHI Monitor. Our plan involves a prospective clinical trial involving 4 centers and 100 patients. We will test the ability of CHI to 1) predict subsequent neurological functional outcome of cardiac arrest patients, and 2) provide real-time tracking of brain injury and response to therapy. Successful completion of this project is defined by FDA clearance of the CHI Monitor. It is our goal that the CHI Monitor will identify patients who could benefit from aggressive intervention, and then track the response to the therapy. Providing this information to the treating cardiologist in the immediate post-resuscitation period represents a major change in care delivery for the cardiac arrest survivor.",

        "abstract": "Individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) and pancreatic insufficiency (PI) are prone to fat malabsorption, putting them at risk for caloric, essential fatty acid, and choline deficiency, which, in turn, may lead to growth failure and a poorer clinical course. Many subjects with CF have essential fatty acid deficiency, characterized by decreased levels of linoleic acid and an increased triene/tetraene ratio, and an associated choline deficiency. As a key membrane phospholipid, choline is required for methyl metabolism, cholinergic neurotransmission, transmembrane signaling, lipid cholesterol transport and metabolism. Choline deficiency is associated with liver disease, apoptosis, steatosis, as well as brain and visual development abnormalities. In a previous randomized control trial, supplementation with LYM-X-SORB(TM), an organized lipid matrix containing lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) monoglycerides, and triglycerides, has been shown to improve fatty acid status and vitamin E and retinol binding protein levels over a 12-month period and to improve both growth and pulmonary function status over 18 months in subjects with CF. We propose to conduct a randomized placebo-controlled double-blinded study to evaluate the effectiveness of the next generation LYM-X-SORB(TM) with improved palatability and mixing characteristics, on fatty acid and choline status of 78 children, ages 6.0 to 17.9 years, with CF and PI. We propose that essential fatty acid status (linoleic acid levels, triene/tetraene ratio) and choline status (phosphadytlcholine/ phosphatidytlethanolamine (PC/PE) ratio) will be normalized after 12 mos of supplementation with LYM-X-SORB(TM)  in subjects receiving LYM-X-SORB(TM) (n=39) compared to those receiving placebo (n=39). We will also explore whether LYM-X-SORB(TM) supplementation will improve fat soluble vitamin status, bile composition, incidence of fatty liver, inflammatory cytokines, resting energy expenditure and respiratory quotient over 12 mos and improve pulmonary function, growth status, body composition and overall health status over 18 mos. Subjects will be recruited from five Cystic Fibrosis Centers and have four major protocol visits to CHOP (baseline, 3, 12, and 18 mos), and one visit at their home Center (6 mos).

While this has led to initial clinical evaluations of gentamicin therapy in human inherited disorders, long-term application of this approach is compromised by the considerable adverse effects of this drug. PTC Therapeutics, Inc. (PTC) has pursued the concept of a pharmaceutical approach to treating diseases caused by nonsense mutations and has identified a novel, low molecular weight compound (PTC124) that is considerably more potent than gentamicin in both cell and animal models. PTC124 has the potential for near-term broad application in numerous genetic disorders, but such widespread utility requires mechanism of action analyses which demonstrate that it: i) promotes insertion of near-cognate tRNAs at premature termination codons; ii) principally targets premature translational termination, not normal translational termination; iii) has limited host-transcriptional effects on non-targeted mRNAs; iv) does not elicit toxic side effects in whole animals; tnd v) promotes nonsense suppression in additional animal models of disease states. This fast-track STTR proposal describes molecular biological approaches to all of these issues. In Phase I, we will use cultured =ells to address items i-iii and to establish the technological approaches required for addressing the remaining issues in animal models in Phase II. More specifically, we will treat HeLa cells with PTC124 and: I) define the events promoting nonsense suppression and II) determine whether PTC124-mediated nonsense suppression has global consequences for cellular mRNA decay and translation.",

Our customers will include: (i) neuroscientists interested in synaptic and intracellular zinc signaling, (ii) clinicians treating victims of stroke, head trauma, cardiac arrest, and seizures, where zinc is now understood to be one of the worst of the toxins injuring brain cells, and (iii), biologists growing or studying cells in vitro who want to monitor (and control) the pZn of their media. Collectively, these markets represent about 80,000 customers, with consumables of ~ $500/yr (scientists) to ~$10,000/yr (clinicians). In Phase I, we built prototype, fluorimetric zinc measurement tools, and we used them to establish the value for physiological pZn in the brain (7.7 +/- 0.3). In Phase II we shall capitalize on our knowledge of the physiological value of pZn and our access to proprietary zinc-sensing fluorescent molecules and: (i) complete development of a solution-based fluorimetric pZn Meter, \"tuned\" to measure physiological pZn, (ii) develop and optimize cuvettes with the zinc-sensing fluorescent molecules attached to the walls, for \"semi-automatic\" pZn determinations, (iii) develop an evanescent wave illumination for the cuvette, so that the fluorimetric zinc assays can be done even with \"dirty\" solutions in the cuvette, (iv) adapt the evanescent wave+ surface assay to an optical fiber \"zintrode,\" (v) perfect the attachment and sensing chemistry on zintrodes so that they can be used for medium-term (days-weeks) in situ recording of intracranial pZn.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gastroparesis is defined as delayed emptying of solids and is a common disease defined as delayed emptying of the stomach. It is present in at least 20% of about 150 million patients with diabetes worldwide and in more than 20% of patients with functional dyspepsia that affects about 10%-25% of the general population. Gastroparesis is a refractory disease with a lack of therapeutic options. Common symptoms of gastroparesis include nausea, vomiting, early satiety and abdominal bloating. Medical treatment for diabetic gastroparesis is very limited in the USA. A medical device (called Enterra Therapy) using gastric electrical stimulation (GES) is approved for the treatment of severe nausea and vomiting in patients with gastroparesis. However, it does not seem to normalize gastric motility or emptying. A novel method of GES is proposed in this application: two-channel synchronized dual pulse GES. In this method, the configuration and waveforms of electrical stimulation are determined based on a number of pathophysiological factors of gastroparesis, including impaired fundic relaxation, visceral hypersensitivity, gastric dysrhythmia, gastric antral hypomotility, and delayed gastric emptying. The electrical stimulus is composed of long pulses (which will normalize dysrhythmia and enhance fundic relaxation) and short pulses (which will relief symptoms and possibly reduce visceral sensention) delivered at the appearance of the physiological gastric electrical waves (synchronized with gastric electrical waves, which is known to enhance gastric contractions and emptying). A multi-disciplinary team is formed including a veteran researcher in gastroparesis, a gastroenterologist, an electrical engineer and others. Experiments are to be performed in an animal model to test the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed novel method of GES in tackling each of the pathogeneses of gastroparesis and to develop an implantable gastric electrical stimulator which can be implemented using a minimally invasive method of laparascopy. Gastroparesis (slow emptying of the stomach after a meal) is common in patients with diabetes and functional dyspepsia but there are few treatment options. This project is proposed to develop a stomach pacemaker which is cable of improving abnormal functions of the stomach related to this refractory disease. A number of innovative ideas are incorporated into the proposed method to tackle abnormalities related to gastroparesis.",

In STTR Phase II, we showed that chronic oral administration of NPI-031G (150 mg/kg/day) suppressed daily alcohol drinking by almost 50 percent in animals throughout a 4-week study (see Preliminary Data Section C).    Recently, we demonstrated that the extract of kudzu, which contains 20 percent NPI-031G, reduces alcohol intake significantly in heavy alcohol drinkers. In this continuing application, we propose to complete the preclinical work, including a toxicity study in year 01 and 02, a prerequisite for an IND application. In year 03, we will focus on clinical evaluation in human alcoholics. Specifically, we will conduct the following studies.    Year 01: 1) Synthesis of radio-labeled NPI-031G; 2) Purification of NPI-031G (>99.0 percent) for clinical study; 3) Bioavailability and pharmacokinetic study; and 4) Toxicity studies (mutagenic, acute toxicity).    Year 02: 1) Chronic toxicity study; 2) In vitro and in vivo drug metabolism studies; 3) Preparation of Drug Master File (DMF); 4) Request for IRB approval, 5) Submission of IND application; and 6) Phase I safety and alcohol challenge study in humans.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fullerenes are a class of closed-cage nanomaterials comprised exclusively of carbon atoms. A great deal of attention has been focused on developing medical uses of these unique molecules. This proposal concerns the development of fullerenes in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy, a non-invasive procedure that combines a non-toxic photosensitizer with harmless visible light to kill microbial cells. An advantage of photodynamic therapy is its high level of selectivity. This is achieved by using photosensitizers that selectively target specific cell types and by controlling the area that is illuminated. In the Phase I study, a number of fullerene-based photosensitizers with highly desirable properties were synthesized and tested. The PS inactivated a broad spectrum of microbes (6 log reduction of gram positive bacteria, gram negative bacteria and fungi). The Phase I results are particularly encouraging because the fullerene photosensitizers were effective at low concentrations and needed only low levels of illumination. In addition, under conditions where bacterial cells were killed, mammalian cells were unharmed. Tests also showed that the fullerene photosensitizers performed substantially better than an antimicrobial photosensitizer commonly used in clinical practice. In the Phase II study, an understanding of the relationship between the nanoscale properties of fullerenes and their ability to selectively photoinactivate microorganisms will be developed, leading to the commercial development of treatments for localized bacterial and fungal infections. In addition, the PS will be tested for the mediation of topical PDT in mouse models of infected wounds and burns using bioluminescent bacteria and low-light imaging to follow infection progress in real time. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy can serve as a new technique to combat pathogenic bacteria that have developed antibiotic resistance. Wound infections affect millions of Americans each year. With ever increasing antibiotic resistance, antimicrobials are sought for treatment of localized infections (bacterial and fungal) with applications in dermatology, dentistry, and ophthalmology. A global market of $3 billion dollars is projected, representing a significant opportunity for commercialization.",

The code will have a 3 year lifetime, and may be considered for re-release in June of 2007. The current code contains the traditional phantom types (Cristy/Eckerman), which are considered state-of-the-art in internal dosimetry today, but which many believe should be replaced with more realistic phantom types, as is being made possible by advanced medical imaging technologies and other approaches. More realistic representations of organ geometries and overlap provide better estimates of organ doses for use in diagnostic and therapeutic applications of radiopharmaceuticals in medicine, particularly in cancer therapy. The use of voxel-based Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT), Single Photon Computed Tomography (SPECT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging systems provide 3D representations of patient anatomy. Preliminary data comparing dose calculations from existing standard stylized (MIRD) models and those based on real human images have demonstrated some notable differences in calculated absorbed fractions and dose factors. Two standardized phantoms, one each representing the adult male and female, have been developed under the direction of the International Commission on Radiological Protection, and phantoms representing the newborn and pregnant woman at 7 months' gestation have also been designed. We propose extension of these works to develop a complete phantom library is needed to provide the user community with a full set of realistic phantoms for routine use in nuclear medicine. Other, more general radiation safety applications as well will benefit from these more realistic phantoms. Phase I of this project will entail review and testing of existing work, identification of specific phantoms necessary to complete the OLINDA/EXM library and gathering of candidate image data sets for segmentation. Phase II will entail the segmentation of the phantoms, modification of the phantoms to meet organ mass requirements, calculation of dose conversion factors for all organs, using Monte Carlo techniques, and implementation of results into the OLINDA/EXM code.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobile bearing TKA implants are preferred owing to their potential to better restore natural knee kinematics, and could find increased acceptance if the important clinical concern related to increased wear is addressed. Equally, overcoming the materials fatigue related failures of polyethlylene (PE) tibial inserts over the long term would be a significant step forward in extending the life, range of motion and function of the more popular fixed bearing TKA implants. In Phase I, we successfully demonstrated the feasibility of a novel, ultra-low wear bearing for TKA implants by developing and wear testing of a new ceramic optimized for low friction articulation against established CoCr alloys. The novel ceramic material was shown in standard tests to possess the highest combination of strength, toughness and Weibull modulus, with a significant enhancement over current state of the art Biolox Delta. We have also demonstrated in pin on disc tests a 10 fold reduction in multidirectional wear compared to CoCr-PE bearings, under a 3X higher contact stress. This success points to the clinical potential of a novel alternate TKA implant bearing with ultra-low wear and high safety characteristics: a CoCr femoral condyle/ with a ceramic tibia insert. If successful, this novel TKA bearing offers the potential to eliminate PE material failure and promises to increase the life of TKA implants by a factor of 2 - 3X. Indeed, this bearing has the potential to introduce a unique, safe and effective alternative bearing for the first time, for TKA implants. In Phase II, we aim to extend these results by developing and demonstrating the wear performance, mechanical and biological safety of actual TKA implant components in a physiologically / clinically more relevant geometry. In Phase II, we propose to extend these promising results by developing, optimizing and demonstrating in vitro, the wear performance, mechanical safety and function in a set of comprehensive, statistically rigorous experimental designs. We also propose to conduct wear tests to 10 million cycles in a knee simulator on actual TKA bearing components of both mobile and fixed bearing designs, using physiologically relevant test parameters, to confirm the superiority of the novel proposed bearings. Major orthopedic implant manufacturers have expressed interest in our technology and collaborating on the evaluation of the novel TKA bearings.",

Most primary healthcare practitioners recognize the important relationship among nutrition, physical activity and health. Few incorporate either dietary or physical activity counseling into routine practice. Lack of self-efficacy for such counseling is among the commonly cited reasons. The proposed project follows the successful Phase I project, and will develop a tool called Automated Guidance tool for Medical Encounters addressing Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (AuGMEnT). AUGMENT will rely on interactive technology to automate the administration, collection, and analysis of dietary and physical activity questionnaires; and guide counseling and resources tailored to the patient's unique needs. AUGMENT combines nutrition and physical activity assessments. The patient will respond to questionnaire prompts on a handheld computer with a touch-sensitive screen in the physician's office.

Early diagnosis of AD is crucial for individuals and families to plan for their futures, to obtain appropriate care, and to start treatment as early as possible.

Research studies show that quantification of cerebral atrophy from MRI could aid in AD diagnosis; the current grant proposes to complete the steps necessary for FDA regulatory approval of a software device that could provide such information automatically to clinicians. Our first aim is to integrate, refine and further optimize the structural analysis stream developed in previous SBIR grants. This will involve porting research code into an FDA-approvable code base, refinement of skull- stripping and partial volume estimation methods, and their integration into the segmentation processing stream software. We will implement a method for identifying cases where the automatic quantification may have yielded inaccurate results, and refine discriminant functions to optimally classify different diagnostic categories.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chicago PT is developing rehabilitation robotics to help clinicians provide more intensive functional retraining of overground walking, post-stroke. Chicago PT's concept is to build devices that work with the clinician rather than replacing the clinician, in order to retain the clinician's skilled manual connection with the patient in all its important aspects: physical, sensory and psychological. The KineAssist device, proposed for further development and testing here, allows clinicians to safely challenge patients to their limits of gait and dynamic balance, which otherwise could not be done due to the risk of falls. Innovations include the incorporation of dynamic balance and challenge into gait training, training in functional contexts overground rather than on a treadmill, the recording of objective measures and progress, integration into conventional practice, and quick setup and transitions to and from sitting. Chicago PT's commercialization plan begins with leading hospitals as part of a research consortium, followed by in-patient rehabilitation facilities, and later outpatient clinics. Chicago PT intends to form a relationship with an industrial partner to provide the necessary infrastructure for broader distribution.   In the proposed Phase I period Chicago PT will further develop its KineAssist device, improving on the prototype device in response to feedback from clinicians, and further advancing certain engineering issues. Significant software development is planned for improved allowance of motion of the patient and accessibility to the clinician, and a new force based interface for clinicians and researchers will be developed.   Further, we will demonstrate unimpeded motion with the KineAssist during overground functional tasks. The motions of overground gait and balance tasks will be evaluated both with and without the KineAssist, by healthy individuals as well as stroke survivors, to assess the ability of the KineAssist-patient interface to allow key characteristic motions associated with select functional tasks. Specifically, we hypothesize that kinematic trajectories within the KineAssist will be uninterrupted and continuous. We will attempt to identify tasks where kinematic trajectories are altered by the KineAssist.   After these aims are achieved, we will be in a position to initiate human subject testing that will investigate the use of the KineAssist during standardized training protocols. In phase II, we plan to investigate overground and functional walking performance under conditions of body-weight support and under novel destabilizing and stabilizing force-field conditions.",

An aptamer is a single stranded nucleic acid that acts like an antibody but that can be expressed and function inside cells. The PD173955 RNA aptamer will be selected to lay the groundwork for developing a novel imaging technology that could also be used for enhancing drug therapy. The Concept is that the aptamer, present inside the cell or targeted to the cell surface, could concentrate drug in or around the cell. A radioactive analogue of the drug could be used for imaging.    The proposed basis of imaging involves accumulation of radiolabeled drug by aptamers. The increased intracellular or pericellular drug concentration in the cell should increase the effectiveness of the drug. However, the kinetic parameters of the aptamer are expected to be very important for optimal imaging and therapeutic enhancement. Therefore, we are developing a computational model that is based on a mathematical rendering of the kinetic and diffusion constants of the aptamer, drug and the enzyme targeted by the drug. Development of the mathematical model will proceed in parallel with the aptarner selection and guide the choice of selection protocols.    The following specific aims are proposed for development of an aptamer to PD173955 for imaging and therapeutic applications: 1) prepare PD173955 linked to a solid support for aptamer selection, 2) select an RNA aptamer that recognizes PD173955, and 3) develop a mathematical model for the use of aptamers in imaging and enhancing drug therapy.        Phase II        The current proposal describes a novel nucleic acid structure based on aptamers that will be expressed in cells to mark them so they can be detected in viva by available imaging technology. We call the markers intracellular Multi-Aptamer Genetic Tags\" (IMAGEtags). The basic innovation in the proposed IMAGEtag design is the expression, in living cells, of aptamers that can be used to track the cells in vivo by a noninvasive procedure. Cells that express IMAGEtags will be detected by virtue of the concentrated radiolabeled ligands that are bound and trapped in the cells by the aptarner components of IMAGEtags. The promoter from which the IMAGEtags are expressed will determine which cells can be imaged. For example, many genes that are responsible for increased proliferation are expressed in cancer cells and not in most normal cells. If these promoters, or a \"synthetic\" promoter that was highly expressed only in cancer cells, were used to drive IMAGEtag expression then cancer cells would be imaged.    We also propose that the IMAGEtags could also be applied to enhancing drug therapy. Because the mechanism of imaging involves accumulation of ligand, IMAGEtas that recognize a particular drug could draw more drug into the cell and increase the effectiveness of the drug.    The design and selection of IMAGEtags and their target ligands will be guided by computational modeling to optimize the kinetic characteristics of the aptamers and their ligands for imaging and enhanced therapeutic applications.    Development of MAGEtags for imaging and therapeutic applications will be achieved by the following specific aims: 1) refine the PD173955 aptamer to function inside cells and prepare cells that stably express the aptamer, 2) refine the mathematical model for in vivo imaging, 3) validate the ability to image with aptamers in vivo using cultured cells, and 4) Use the PD173955 aptamer to image in animals.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Secondary structure in single-stranded ONA and RNA is a significant barrier to the efficient hybridization of short oligonucleotide probes. While some probes to a given target hybridize efficiently, other probes to the same target may not hybridize at all. Use of longer probes, on the order of 60 nucleotides in length, is one way to overcome this problem. Unfortunately, such probes cannot be used to directly detect single nucieotide polymorphisms or point mutations. Use of pseudo-complementary (pc) DNA or RNA targets that lack secondary structure should facilitate the use of short probes and enable the development of generic oligonucleotide microarrays wherein every permutation of a short probe (e.g., an 8-mer) is represented on the array. Such arrays are ideally suited to the resequencing of DNA for SNP identification and to the acquisition of genetic profiles for identification purposes. We have shown that nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) of 2-aminoadenine (nATP) and 2-thiothymine/2-thiouracii (sTTP/sUTP) can be enzymatically incorporated into DNA or RNA. These bases are pseudo-complementary since they don't interact with each other but can individually pair to the regular base complement. In this Phase I proposal we will evaluate whether dNTP analogues of dGTP and dCTP can be used together with dnATP and dsTTP in a primer extension assay to generate structure-free single-stranded DNA that can hybridize to short DNA or RNA probes with high efficiency and specificity. Existing data from ourselves and others indicate that this goal should be readily attainable and would form the basis for evaluating pseudo-complementary DNA and RNA targets for use in conjunction with short probes in a microarray format.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The project long-term objective is to develop a surgical navigational system that will enable in-bore, MR imaging guided interventions on any type of scanner. This new system will facilitate the use of MRI to guide diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. MRI has unique advantages compared with other imaging modalities? It has exceptional high soft-tissue contrast, it uses non-ionizing radiation, imaging can be done in any position and orientation inside the body, there is no shadowing or blocking due to air, bones, or other body structure. Coupling these unique imaging characteristics with a convenient mean to guide intervention under real-time MRI guidance can have significant effect on the management of cancer patients by replacing various surgical procedures with minimally invasive interventions. The specific aims of the project are to adapt the current EndoScout tracking system to guide breast biopsy inside closed-bore MRI scanners; to evaluate the accuracy of the system and to test its human-machine interface; to conduct a multi-center clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the new system; and to achieve FDA clearance for marketing. To accomplish these aims, Robin Medical will collaborate with three clinical institutions. Robin Medical will adapt the EndoScout tracking system for use on closed bore scanners, will conduct technical studies to verify the accuracy of the system, will manufacture and install the surgical navigation systems in the clinical testing sites, will supervise the multi-center clinical study, and will work to achieve FDA clearance of the product. The iMRI Center at the Norton Hospital (Louisville, KY), where the EndoScout system passed rigorous testing during its development, will provide the setting for the technical testing of the new system. The Brigham and Women's Hospital (Boston, MA) will join Norton Hospital during the second year and both sites will conduct the initial human study on their open MR scanners, where an immediate backup option for manual biopsy is available. Following the demonstration of the reliability and the safety of the system, a multicenter clinical study will be conducted at these two sites and at The George Washington University Medical Center in Washington, DC. Due to lack of convenient way to guide biopsy inside the bore of MR scanners, biopsies of MRI-detected lesions are done with less reliable stereotactic apparatus or by open surgical biopsy. The development of a simple, low-cost system to facilitate MR-guided breast biopsy on any closed bore scanner will reduce the use of surgical biopsy in many patients and may lead to a substantial cost saving to the healthcare system.",

The annual cost to the United States economy of back-related problems has been estimated at between $35 Billion and $50 Billion. Sedentary jobs have been linked to an increased risk of back injury, and it has been shown that sitting for prolonged periods with a flattened lumbar curvature increases the stress on intervertabral discs. Stress on the back can be reduced if the lumbar spine remains sufficiently curved. We have developed a device that is worn around the lower torso, holds a bend sensor to the lumbar spine, monitors lumbar curvature, and provides vibrational feedback to the wearer when the wearer is in a poor posture so that the wearer can modify his or her posture and reduce the stress on his or her back. In Phase 1 we confirmed that feedback from the device can be used to reliably influence seated posture. In Phase 2 we will carry out long term tests on patients who experience back pain. Using our device, patients will learn to maintain improved lumbar curvature while sitting, and we will investigate whether this improved posture reduces the severity and/or duration of lower back pain.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unlike adults, neonates cannot undergo traditional mental status testing (orientation, language, memory, etc.) as a measure of cortical function. However, the use of EEG is well established as one of the only semi-objective means to characterize the health of the cerebral cortex in neonates. Unfortunately, the availability of expert neonatal EEG interpretation is very limited, and is present at relatively few specialized pediatric centers in the country. Even when available, the review and interpretation of neonatal EEG is time and labor intensive. Because of these limiting factors, many hospitals rarely perform EEG monitoring in the neonatal intensive care unit, regardless of its value in neurological assessment. The envisioned device from this project is an EEG monitor that can trend the neurological wellness of neonates, with the capability for complete EEG review and verification by clinicians. The algorithm being developed for this monitor specifically analyzes neonatal EEG for clearly defined abnormalities in order to provide a simple neurological assessment score (the N3 Index) in one of the following ranges: (i) normal, (ii) mildly abnormal, (iii) moderately abnormal, or (iv) severely abnormal. The assessment algorithm consists of signal processing techniques used to quantify the amplitudes, durations, and frequency compositions of any discontinuities or asymmetries present in neonatal EEGs. The algorithm also includes methods for artifact effect minimization and the discrimination of foreground events from the background EEG. A data fusion analysis of the selected signal processing parameters calculates the final assessment score, which is displayed over time to produce a reliable trend of EEG assessment. More accurate prognoses of neurologically at-risk newborns from the proposed monitor may have several benefits. First, they can impact level of care decisions, especially for those neonates given poor prognoses (e.g.: severe neurological deficits or death). Secondly, the continuous assessment of the EEG background can be a measure of treatment success, indicating neurological improvement or decline after treatment has been given. The relevance of the proposed project is that the development of an easy-to-use neonatal EEG monitor with accurate analysis methods could enable more widespread monitoring of brain status in newborns. It also would enable earlier detection and management of brain injury in this population, which could promote both improved outcomes and reduced health care costs.",

(800-3000/episode). Over 80-100 million Foley catheters are used world wide per year. About 2/3rds of the microorganisms causing CAUTI gain access to the bladder extraluminally (via the external surface of the catheter), and about 1/3rd of the infections occur intraluminally from the collection bag.Under a phase II, we developed and conducted a pilot clinical trial on an antiseptic device (Foley GuardTM) that was placed between the bag and a commercial antimicrobial silver hydrogel infection control Foley catheter to study its effect on intraluminal infections. The results showed about a 50% reduction of the intraluminal infection, however the overall CAUTI was not significantly reduced due to the extraluminal route provided by the commercial catheter. Recognizing this need, we have developed our own coated Foley catheter based on our patented formulations, that is very superior the current commercial antimicrobial Foley catheters in the market today. The highly enhanced in vitro performance is related to the unique silver chemistry and its sustained delivery in biological fluids which is lacking in the current commercial coatings; safe lubricants, biofilm disruptors and antifungals in our formulation provide additional defenses. The prototypes have passed the basic biocompatibility tests. The coatings contain the same antimicrobial components as the extruded Foley Guard device. We present a plan for the continued development of a combined product (TIC :Total Infection Control - coated Foley catheter connected to the bag accessory developed in Phase II). An optimistic projection is made based on the favorable meta analysis for silver based products and our comparative data. The phase II continuation project will pilot manufacture the TIC system with well qualified OEM medical device manufacturing partners, collect data for FDA submission such as elution profiles, biofilm resistance and biocompatibility according to FDA guidance document, conduct clinical trials, demonstrate the clinical efficacy and aggressively commercialize this product using a business model that will bring this product quickly to the market.",

Results from proposed studies will play a pivotal role in providing the technical foundation for innovations and products that will be used in thousands of research laboratories. This will improve the research on psychological problems related to learning, mental health, development, and social interaction which in turn may benefit millions of citizens. This proposal develops methods that will allow psychological, neuroscience and clinical researchers to cope with the growing complexity of computer based-experimentation and Internet-based data collection. This project will address five key challenges related to computer-based behavioral and biological data collection. It will provide research and technical solutions including: 1) an experiment specification technology that will allow efficient creation of complex accurate computerized behavioral experiments with modest learning time for the researcher and low probability of error; 2) methods to maintain precision timing (0.1 ms) on standard personal computers even when the operating system timing is erratic and the user has limited understanding of performance tuning of the system; 3) Internet tools that allow distributed experiment management that can maintain timing precision and security across multiple sites and across firewalls with low user effort, 4) automated data management and analysis tools that can quickly be learned and connected to standard analysis streams; and 5) comprehensible integration of tutorial tools, paradigms libraries and data management. The project will develop interface, timing, communication, data management, and support technologies and extensive empirical testing of usability. The Phase I SBIR effort met the ambitious milestones and produced the first formal behavioral data published regarding usability in experiment generation. The engineering prototypes exceeded the precision requirements and lead to new methods that were the basis of a provisional patent application. The research will likely result in market-leading products that are likely to be purchased and installed in over 5000 research laboratories within five years of the start date of the Phase II effort.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The fight against cancer, heart disease, HIV, and all diseases are slow. Lives are being lost. The public spends over $1 trillion a year on health care. The government spends that much again. The tool used most in the fight against cancer employs fluorescent dyes to indicate the presence of cancer, to discover new ways to test for cancer, and to discover medicinal cures. Millions of tests are performed each year using thousands of tiny spots on a microscope slide, called a microarray. These spots fluoresce when a sought-after biological indication is present. The problem is that this ubiquitous method of research and diagnosis can detect less than half of the biological information needed to end cancer because the fluorescent light signal is very weak. The proposed project will increase the sensitivity of fluorescence assays 1000-fold. This innovation will revolutionize the battle against cancer and all diseases. The mission of NCI is to discover and develop new technology for the fight against cancer. This project will continue the development of metal enhanced fluorescence (MEF) begun under a previous Phase I SBIR grant from NCI. MEF uses thin-film technology to deposit layers of metal particles and dielectrics on microarray substrates. MEF has been repeatedly proven to increase the fluorescence assay sensitivity 40 to 100 fold. This project will transfer MEF technology to a manufacturing environment, optimize the manufacturing protocols, and pilot test the first products. Cancer DNA assays will be performed at the NCI Microarray Center to evaluate and validate the performance of the new product. In addition, this project will integrate two commercially available assay technologies with the MEF microarray. The active surface of a microarray substrate must be able to bind biological material efficiently. GenTel BioSurfaces, Inc., provides surface chemistry which is proven to increase binding by a factor of 7-10 compared to all other available substrates. Their surface chemistry combines with MEF to produce an assay sensitivity increase in the range of 100 to 1000. Martek sells super bright fluors that are proven to increase the fluorescence signal 20 to 300-fold compared to conventional fluors. Microcosm has proven that MEF increases the light output of Martek fluors another 40-fold. The integration of Martek labeled assay reagents, Gentel's surface chemistry, and Microcosm MEF substrates promises a multiplicative increase in assay sensitivity exceeding 1000-fold. Martek and Gentel products are on the market. Based on over three years of development at Microcosm, this integrated MEF substrate is ready for commercialization. With this project, a universally needed and revolutionary new microarray assay product line can enter the market in less than two years.",

Phase 1 work showed that using directional microphone arrays in conjunction with dual-channel noise reduction algorithms improves speech reception in noise for cochlear implant users. The proposed Phase 2 work will expand the scope to include noise reduction techniques at every possible point in the cochlear implant acoustic pick-up and signal processing chain. The work considers single and dual microphone arrays, single- or dual-channel preprocessing algorithms, and novel within-channel compressor- control algorithms. Each of these approaches will be studied using methods that range from computer simulations and automatic intelligibility prediction, for rapid system assessments, to speech-reception testing and listening-quality ratings by cochlear implant users with portable real-time signal processing for formal evaluations. Acoustic test environments (simulated or actual) will be realistic with respect to the degree of reverberation, and the number and stationarity of interference sources. A final comprehensive study will evaluate the contributions of optimized signal-processing algorithms in conjunction with four different microphone-array configurations. The results of this work will quantify the benefits of optimized noise reduction options for cochlear implant users. The most promising algorithms will be developed in Phase 3 work through contractual agreements with commercial partners. Cochlear implants are the only viable procedure for restoring a sense of hearing to profoundly deafened individuals. Progress in cochlear implants has increased to the point where many recipients can understand speech in quiet without the aid of lip-reading; however, susceptibility to background noise continues to be much worse for recipients than for normal hearing listeners.
