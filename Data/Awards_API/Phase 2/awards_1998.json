        "abstract": "The objective of this project is to improve the performance of GPS receiver systems on naval aircraft by enabling the use of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) antennas. The approach is to develop a reliable compact, lightweight efficient and rapid-cooling cryogenic refrigeration system that meets NAWC specifications. The innovations are: (1) an integral heat exchanger (IHX) that efficiently cools the HTS substrate and (2) a compact, oil-free diaphragm compressor that drives a closed-cycle J-T cryocooler. The IHX is an HTS substrate with internal cooling channels for rapid, uniform cooling. The compressor drives a highly efficient closed-cycle Joule-Thompson cryocooler that pumps refrigerant gas through the HTS substrates. The Phase II project will entail three major efforts. First, we will scale up the fabrication techniques demonstrated in Phase I to produce a full-size prototypical IHX. Second, we will develop a compact, lightweight cryocooler (compressor, J-T throttle valve, recuperator, and insulation) to provide cryogenic coolant to the IHX. Third, we will demonstrate operation of the cryocooler and IHX by test under prototypical conditions. At the conclusion of Phase II, we will deliver hardware for cryogenic testing in the antenna chamber at NAWC/China Lake.",

This modulator is based on Inductive Energy Store (IES) using an array of Diamond Opening Switches for power compression.  Because power amplification using IES requires a much smaller volume than capacitive pulse compression, the footprint of such modulators is considerably smaller than that of equivalent pulse-line accelerators.  The repetition rate is also much higher than for modulators that use gas switches.  Magnetic switches are best suited to low energy/pulse applications, becoming bulky and less cost effective at >100J/pulse energies.  Si (or GaAs) switches have low voltage hold-off and are limited to 1kJ/pulse at > 10kHz rep-rate, with voltage hold-off at the 0.5-1MV level.  These parameters make it suitable for compact x-ray sources, high power microwaves, waste clean-up withelectron beams and ion beams for materials modification.",

Such a package is portable and readily adapted for use in-situ in various DNA simulators and Plasma Opening Switch testbeds.

Prasad, Principal Investigator\nDr. Mahadevan Krishnan, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG03-97ER82320\nAmount:  $74,989\n\n\nAlameda Applied Sciences Corporation will develop a fast-opening breaking switch to improve the heating of plasma in a fusion reactor based on radiation-induced conductivity in diamond. For radiofrequency heating of fusion plasmas, breaking switches must conduct high currents and hold off very high voltages (approximately 100 kilovolts) when opened rapidly in inductive energy store circuits. Solid-state breaking switches presently available consist of stacks of gate turnoff thyristors connected in series since a single thyristor can hold off only 2-5 kilovolts. Such an arrangement is complicated because of the requirement of floating gate turnoff circuitry. This project aims to develop a single diamond switch that could replace a large series stack of silicon-junction switches. During Phase I, a proof-of-principle switch will be constructed to hold off 10-kilovolts when open and conduct at least 1 kiloampere per square centimeter when closed. This switch will close upon the application of an electron beam trigger and open when the beam is extinguished. After the concept validation in Phase I, a full-scale prototype capable of holding off approximately 100 kilovolts and conducting 1-10 kiloamperes will be validated in Phase II.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This class of switches will find potential application in a variety of switching applications including: Fast-opening breaking switches for radiofrequency heating of fusion plasmas; solid-state circuit breakers for the power distribution industry; fast-opening switches for inductive energy store; and x-ray, electron and ion beam accelerators. The related closing switches will find application in power distribution, electric aircraft, ships and vehicles, to name but a few applications.\n_",

Both systems appeared in the late 1980's, essentially in their present forms, and have been updated continually. ADLS features a sophisticated but highly intuitive and easy-to-use device classification system based on human development and user goals and purposes.  It evolved from a prior print-based version and is the result of 25 years of prior research.  Now in its seventh update, ADLS is still in use nationally and overseas.  But hardware, software, and communications technology have changed dramatically in the past decade.  ADLS, originally designed for Apple II and ported to Macintosh and MS-DOS PCs, has become increasingly antiquated and difficult to maintain and update.  Furthermore, only the very small portion of potential users who purchase the product can access it.  This project proposes to save this unique and valuable national resource and make it universally accessible to teachers, health professionals, and consumers with disabilities by transforming the entire Locator System database content and program code into a state-of-the-art, multi-level and multi-media, world-wide web site on the Internet.

Years of research have gone into optimizing the NASP aerodynamics for high speeds. If we can prove these aerodynamics at low speeds and lay the foundations for the required technologies, we will have taken a giant step towards the goal of cost effective hypersonic flight.

The U.S. Bureau of Mines developed a process by which elemental sulfur can be used as a thermal cement with aggregate fillers to make concrete.  Sulfur concrete appears to be a good solution to solve the problem of deteriorating sewerage structures made from Portland cement.  Portland cement is alkaline and has been found to perform poorly in the acid environment in most sanitary sewer systems.

Frequency conversion approaches must be capable of handling high average power levels, greater than 10 kWatts.  Converting a COIL device to high peak powers will be necessary for frequency conversion.  The approach proposed uses injection seeding with an all solid state, tandem, bulk periodically poled LiNbO (sub 3) (PPLN) scheme to provide MLQS pulse trains from the coil device.  This Phase I effort will build on Aculight's commercial PPLN product line and will be able to fabricate and test the COIL seeder as part of this Phase I program because of this existing capability.  The Phase I work will determine the seeding parameters of bandwidth, pulse energy and frequency control necessary.  A fully stabilized and packaged seed source will be provided as part of the Phase II effort or parallel funding path.  With seeding to MLQS operation in hand, the program will evaluate both solid state and gas Raman conversion approaches for COIL.  In Phase II these conversion schemes will be tested at average power conditions.",

Aculight  proposes a novel laser transmitter approach that can simultaneously generate the required pulse  energy, beam quality, and short pulse needed for ranging and discrimination.  The proposed  approach is to combine a diode-pumped Yb:S-FAP (Ytterbium Strontium Fluoroapatite) laser with an  innovative, short-pulse-length scaled, unstable resonator OPO.  This configuration reduces the  weight/size of the laser transmitter by a factor of 10x over a standard Nd:YAG laser-driven OPO.  Phase I will show the feasibility of obtaining high efficiency and good beam quality in a short pulse  from a high-pulse-energy unstable resonator OPO.  Unstable resonator OPOs pumped by short  pump pulses will be experimentally characterized to provide data to correlate and validate Aculight's  unique unstable resonator OPO computer model.  The correlated model will then be used to generate  a preliminary design of an optimized parametric converter suitable for long-range LADAR systems.",

The final instrument will be cost-effective, simple enough to be operated by non-technical people, and rugged in design.

These refrigeration systems develop ice on the heat exchanger fins which reduces the system efficiency since significant power is used to defrost the heat exchangers.   If a low cost smart defrost system is developed and installed on these systems, up to 15% of the total refrigeration power consumed could be saved.   This project is to develop a low cost, rugged defrost system that could save enormous amounts of power in refrigeration without adding additional workload to the refrigeration system operators.    The complete system consists of an innovative frost sensor module, a custom microcontroller and commerically available control relays for the refrigeration system.  In Phase I, a novel and extremely rugged frost sensor module for use in demand defrost will be demonstrated.  The innovative sensor module and the control algorithms will be tested in the laboratory on a commercial refrigeration system.  Phase II, will include the development of a complete control system and a full-scale test.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The opportunity to significantly reduce energy consumption, and operating costs, for a wide range of commercial industries starting in 1999 could have wide economic benefit by the year 2002.

Our Phase II program will further develop the   interconnects and optimize their deposition and patterning for   use with high temperature circuits.  In addition to their   stability, we will examine interaction of the interconnects with   ohmic and rectifying contacts and  potential wire bonding   materials.  Phase III research and development will focus on   further improvements in reproducibility, quality, and cost for   implementation in commercial application specific integrated   circuits.",

Brown, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-97ER82319\nAmount:  $75,000\nBased on a combination of physical, electronic and optical properties, the semiconductor materials system (aluminum, gallium, indium nitride) has emerged over the last two years as the clear choice for fabricating optical devices producing green, blue, and ultra-violet light.  These materials are very attractive for use with advanced sensors for use in detecting and monitoring, for instance, the illegal diversion of nuclear weapons materials.  However the widespread use of nitride-based devices is currently limited by fabrication yield due to the lack of a suitable starting substrate material.  The choice of the starting substrate is crucial for insuring the quality of subsequent device layers.  In this project a new wafer substrate for the nitride-based Light-Emitting Devices (LEDs) will be used to eliminate a major source of device defects (and consequently yield loss).  This substrate consists of a low defect density gallium nitride prepared by hydride vapor phase epitaxy.  In Phase I the material synthesis technology of key elements of LEDs will be developed on the gallium nitride substrates.  A functional device having blue light emission will be demonstrated at the end of Phase I.  The demonstration of high brightness blue and green LEDs will be the goal of Phase II. \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  High brightness blue and green LEDs are essential components in the design of full-color displays, high density data storage systems, and spectroscopic analysis systems.  The LEDs are also potential candidates for replacing incandescent lamps (e.g., traffic signals) because of their low power consumption and long life.  The gallium nitride substrate proposed for use in this program could potentially become the substrate of choice for all nitride-based devices.  Finally the device technology developed in Phase I and Phase II would be directly applicable to the fabrication of blue semiconductor lasers._",

In the past, the application of permanent magnets was limited to very small devices, such as subfractional horsepower motors.  Traditional methods to manufacture magnets also require many processing steps: pulverizing, milling, magnetic alignment of the grains, cold compacting followed by sintering, and post-sintering.  Recent rapid advancement in permanent magnet technology has drastically changed this situation.  In Phase I of this project, economic methods to produce grain-oriented neodymium-iron-boron magnets employing just a single-step extrusion process will be investigated.   Because the alignment of a magnet produced by hot extrusion depends on the shape and dimensions of the extrusion die, the project will also examine shaped dies and the compositions of the alloys.  During Phase II, the most promising approach will be selected, and scale-up of the process will begin.  An electro-mechanical device, such as a brushless motor, will be designed and constructed during Phase II to determine the advantages of these magnets.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Economically produced high-energy magnets will be extremely beneficial in the construction of  inexpensive, high-efficiency brushless motors for applications in industrial drives, home appliances, and electric vehicles.

The one-dimensional multi-element silicon detector, in conjunction with integrated circuit electronics, has demonstrated promising results for overcoming both of these limitations. Because small detector elements have inherently higher count rates and do not require cryogenic cooling, significant improvements in throughput and system cost can be achieved by integrating arrays of many small elements with the associated electronics.  In Phase I of this project, an integrated two-dimensional silicon array detector will be developed. The energy resolution of the array detector will be similar to that of conventional cryogenically-cooled lithium-drifted silicon detectors, while the count-rate capability of the detector will be a 100 times higher. A larger two-dimensional multi-channel integrated-detector module will be developed during Phase II. That effort will be focused on system design aspects, such as packaging, details of the amplifier and analog-to-digital signal converter, the interface to standard personal computers, and data-acquisition software.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  These integrated X-ray detectors will find broad applications in spectroscopy and imaging. The spectroscopy market will use high count rate X-ray detectors with scanning electron microscopes for analysis of materials and biological chemicals. Also these detectors will be used for X-ray fluorescence spectrometers for both laboratory and process-control applications. In particular there is a need in the semiconductor industry for high count rate detectors, with good energy resolution, to monitor thin-film deposition during silicon-chip fabrication.  Finally, there is a market for imaging sensors that includes radiography, tomography,  and protein crystallography.\n_",

The system will use x-ray digital tomosynthesis for image acquisition, and advanced image processing, including morphological operators, to extract circuit features from the images.  The objectives of Phase I are to 1) demonstruate the capability to image individual layers in multilayer printed circuit boards, 2) demonstrate the extraction of trace geometries from the images using image processing, morphological operators, or other advanced techniques, and 3) develop a conceptual design of a system (hardware and software) which optimally performs these functions.  The Phase I program will answer thefundamental questions:  Will traces be visually prominent in reconstructed images of internal layers?  Can novel image processing techniques extract trace geometries in a usable engineering format?  Can a system with the required performance be produced for a reasonable cost? The project will determine the image quality necessary to efficiently extract printed board patterns, and its implications for system design and operating parameters.  A number of image processing algorithms will be tested and their relative merits and weaknesses will be outlined.",

The algorithm is intended for application in a periodic dynamic system with a large number of degrees of freedom as is commonly the case in current comprehensive rotorcraft analysis codes (such as 2GCHAS).  The innovation of this proposal can be summarized as follows:  1) Utilizing Model Order Reduction to establish a sufficiently accurate reduced order model based on model reduction from finite elements to find the rotorcraft trim.  The transient of the full finite element dynamic equations are solved using the solution from the reduced order model as an initial estimation to reduce the runtimes to reach steady state.  2)  Taking advantage of periodicity of a multi-bladed rotor to reduce the size of rotor system equations by a factor of the number of blades.  3) Applying the Quasi-Newton method for the solution of nonlinear equations to overcome the disadvantage of computing and inverting the Jacobian matrix as required in the Newton-Raphson method.  Utilization of Broyden-Fletcher-Shanno Rank Two algorithm, one of the most successful algorithm of the Quasi-Newton method in nonlinear equation solutions, will allow the aerodynamic effects to be included in the solution iteration.  Thus, the solution convergence speed will be improved.",

Its characteristics derive directly from propulsion and power generation capabilities inherent in microturbine technology under development at MIT.  The proposed vehicle configurations is an oblate spheroid, giving a high package volume with sufficient fuel capacity for hover duration of about one hour.  Thrust from multiple microturbines is used directly for propulsion, maneuver and hover, with control implemented via pulsed on-off operation of selected engines.  The result is a High Performance Aerial Vehicle (HIPERAV), carrying a large instrument package, which incorporates sensor, data transmitter, and mission/vehicle control functions.  This is conceived as an interchangeable plug-in unit, with programmable capability.  Electrical power is taken from one or more of the propultion turbines, resulting in very high power for data transmission.

Recent legislation may limit theuse of many existing chemicals and the cost of research has slowed the introduction of new fungicides.Without new chemistry, the few products left for integrated pest management will be overused leadingto resistance.  Microbial natural products offer an abundant source of chemical diversity, yet there arefew natural products fungicides for agriculture.  The proposed research will develop fungicides basedon bioactive microbial metabolites that we have shown to suppress Phytophthora, Alternaria, Botrytis,and Plasmopara.  We will optimize fermentation yield based on metabolite production and formulatethe broths for stability and effective delivery.  This will produce a mixture of bacteria and spores inwhich we control the level of bioactive metabolites, allowing us to make a reliable product that is safeand efficacious.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of compact products employing mixed technologies, such as personal digital assistants, wireless communicators and sensor systems, is creating a host of new needs in electronics packaging.  These products are driven by small size, light weight, high-operating frequencies, unique micro-to-macro interfacing and low-cost.  There is a need for a simplified and reliable process for direct chip attachment.  Through under-filling the chip with a solid encapsulant, direct chip attach technology is now a reliable method for attachment of small chips to polymeric substrates.  The encapsulant redistributes stress in the package from the fatigue-intolerant solder joints.  However, the encapsulant's effect is to force the chip and the substrate to take up the strain, bulging the substrate and the chip.  This bulging causes its own new set of problems such as making larger chips susceptible to cracking during bending.  Another problem is that the degree of bulging, and hence the degree of strain relief, is highly dependent on the flexibility  of the structure of the underlying substrate.  For MEMs, this bulging will have significant impact on the performance of the device attached.  The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate a new, reliable, compliant direct chip structure that eliminates this bulging.  A program to improve direct chip attachment technology is of the highest priority for industry.  The realization of this technology will reduce the cost and increase the reliability of a myriad of military and commercial products that require high-density, chip-scale packaging.  The improved cost and reliability  will impact a broad range of applications with an annual market potential for the technology exceeding $50 million.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this program is the development of low cost, low viscosity and high performance epoxy resins cured by a novel method, for use in multichip modules (MCM) substrates. The revolutionary epoxy resin, invented by the principle investigator of this proposal, has very high temperature performance (Tg of 280_C to 320_C), low dielectric constant (less than 3), and outstanding moisture resistance. The cost of the resin is comparable to conventional epoxy resins cured and much lower than that of cyanate esters and polyimides. In this proposal. the new resin will be developed especially for applications in electronics. The resins for these applications should meet the conflicting requirements of low viscosity (for ease of processing) and high molecular weight (multifunctionality) to produce high cross-linking density with high Tg. Molecular design, synthesis. formulation and property analysis will be conducted to develop the desirable properties. When completed. the laminates produced from the resins should be completely compatible with conventional established PWB manufacturing procedures.  The CCE and its carbon fiber reinforced composites were selected as one of the best inventions by Longman Cartermill Innovation Magazine, June. 1994: reported by High Performance Plastics Magazine, 1993 and Reinforced Plastics Newsletter Magazine, January, 1994 respectively.  A program to develop low cost and high performance materials for manufacturing of MCMs is urgently needed for industry. The realizat on of this resin technology should open a market that may exceed $220 million annually within five years for high-density MCM substrates.",

The world has become increasingly vulnerable to the spread of old and flew infectious organisms and water-borne pathogens as illustrated by recent outbreaks of 20 well-known and at least 29 previously unknown diseases.  New tests are needed to detect the presence of viral pathoqens down to 103 particles/mL body fluid and l04 particles/mL environmental water.  We propose to develop electrochemical instruments for detection of enterically-transmitted ENA virus pathogens based on gene-probes for specific nucleic acid sequences.  Our specific phase I objective is to establish the feasibility of using gene-probes coupled to colloidal gold electrodes for rapid and easy detection of ENA virus in contaminated waters.  A sandwich hybridization technique will be used that allows identification of specific nucleic sequences in crude samples.  Our expected result will be a system composed of disposable test-strips and a hand-held electrochemical monitor that uses nucleic acid hybridization to rapidly and easily detect pathogenic ENA virus.  AndCare's experience in the development of small electrochemical test instruments will be used to meet the innovative objectives of this project.  AndCare's commercialization strategy will be to produce low-cost, good-performance tests while working with the testing laboratories, state and federal agencies and major universities to introduce the tests and highlight their benefits over traditional methods.  At the same time we will target small laboratories that have not been able to offer such tests because of their difficulty and relatively high costs and thus develop an entirely new market segment",

It 11as been shown that large area APDs are potentially an excellent alternative to photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) in applications such as LIDAR, nuclear medicine, physics research and nuclear radiation measurement instrumentation. They can offer improved performance based on their compact size, solid state reliability, immunity to magnetic fields, better energy resolution for nuclear applications and the potential for spatial resolution for imaging. However, due to the high cost of APD production by existing techniques, they are not now widely used. We propose to conduct the research and development necessary to implement a revolutionary APD design that can be manufactured entirely using standard automatic planar techniques employed in the IC industry. This will result in a low cost, high efficiency, high resolution alternative to PMTs which can both improve performance and reduce cost of higll performance optical and nuclear instrumentation. This approach will also lead to the ability to fabricate planar arrays of APDs for imaging applications.  The development of an inexpensive replacement for PMTs would have many applications. PMTs are used in numerous scientific instruments which dedect low levels of light, such as LIDAR, spectropllotometers, and various biochemical instruments. PMTs are used in nuclear radiation detectors for nuclear medicine and in nuclear and particle physics systems. High performance APDs are already a commercial product, even at the present price. An inexpensive replacement for a PMT would find widespread commercial appeal.",

These modules are derived from a well-posed mathematical   formulation which enables us to define precise interfaces among   the fusion modules. This approach provides three benefits to Air   Force Wright Labs. (AFWL).  First, it enables AFWL to construct   a fusion algorithm with close-to-optimal target tracking and   classification performance.  Second, it allows AFWL to study new   fusion algorithms by implementing alternate algorithms for each   module.  Third, it allows AFWL to process data from any   combination of sensors making the architecture applicable to a   variety of fighter platforms and missions.

Warfighters will soon gain global access to this huge volume of information.  Rather than construct separate redundant, and inconsistent situation estimates, a Dynamic Database can reduce the data to a comprehensive, self-consistent representation of the environment.  This proposal explores the use of Bayes' Nets as a central building block of a Dynamic Database.  The key to a Dynamic Database is the maintenance of a statistically consistent set of hypotheses about the situation.  Bayes' Nets provide a rigorous methodology for enforcing statistical consistency among a large set of parameter estimates and relational hypotheses.  Technical challenges include the ability to efficiently update estimates in the database, incorporation of efficient search mechanisms, embedding of computational services, and presentation of products to users.  A small end-to-end prototype will provide a complete context for the Bayes' Net investigation, and will identify system-level technical challenges relative to the representation.

The point of departure is a baseline SAR/FLIR fusion system that can be implemented with ATR techniques ready today, and which provides a performance level against which enhancements can be judged.  The enhancements then considered involved SAR-assisted pose estimation, feature-level fusion and feedback strategies for FLIR-directed enhanced SAR processing.  In the second, dual component of our proposed program, we will develop analysis tools to assess quantitatively the benefits of different levels of fusion and to predict theoretically the value of various potential sensor enhancements.  The evolutionary nature of our overall proposed approach increases its short-term probability of success, and the steps we have already taken in this proposal to investigate a first-level enhanced fusion concept lead us to believe we will make a significant contribution to SAR/FLIR fusion technology in Phase I.",

In response to this need, American Research Corporation of Virginia proposes the development and evaluation of interactive multimedia for enhancing parenting skills of adolescents and adults with children aged 2-4 years. Interactive multimedia is the integration of text, graphics, and audiovisual media with computer- based information retrieval techniques to enable a user to view information in a nonlinear, intuitive manner.  Phase I technical objectives include development of instructional content and scripts for video portions of the program, integration of the content with multimedia presentation technology, and evaluation of the Phase I system with regard to usability and knowledge gain.  In Phase II, additional instruction will be developed for parents with children from prenatal to eight years of age.  Phase II evaluation will entail assessment of changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behavior with regard to more traditional methods of instruction.",

The software will analyze the digital data obtained from X-ray images using three analytical filters:  wavelets, fractals, and artificial neural networks (ANN).  Wavelet analysis will be used for (1) noise reduction, (2) determination of edges and curvatures, and (3) gray-scale encoding.  Fractal analysis will be used to determine object textures.  ANN will be used to aid in the detection of known objects.  Although capable of carrying out an analysis using only one riltering technique, the unique image analysis potential of DAXIS is achieved by combining the filters in a sequential manner.  The synergistic effect resulting from this combination will yield a set of parameters that will improve image analysis over existing techniques.  A successful DAXIS will improve the detection and identification of objects scanned in a radiograph.   The impact of this improved image analysis software will benefit agencies such as the FM and Customs baggage inspection programs, industrial manufacturing processes, and medical diagnosis efforts, such as those-used with mammography for breast cancer screening programs.",

In order to develop this promising technology into an economical manufacturing process, it is critical to develop low cost manufacturing processes,  for the fabrication of the substrate, the buffer layer and the YBCO layer.   This project will develop a low cost, non-vacuum based process for the buffer layer deposition in this program.  The proposed process is scaleable to long lengths of continuous conductors and is an inherently low cost technique.  Initial work in this area has demonstrated the formation of expitaxial oxide buffer and the subsequent of YBCO films with the performance required for commercial applications.  The goal of the Phase I program is to demonstrate the capability of applying this process to the deposition of oxide buffer layers on the metal substrates required for actual conductors.  The Phase II program will be directed to the scale up of equipment and optimization of processing conditions required for the manufacture of continuous conductors with lengths exceeding 100 meters.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The development of a low cost process for the manufacture of YBCO tape conductors will allow the production of  the next generation of HTS conductors at a manufacturing cost below the $ 10 kA-m benchmark for commercialization.  The superior high field performance of the YBCO conductors will allow their use in commercial  and military applications including motors, generators, SMES, current limiters, transformers and power transmission cables at temperatures in the 77 K range.  The commercialization of HTS will also result in significant energy savings and the development of new technologies and manufacturing jobs.\n\n_",

A novel controlled manufacturing process will also be developed through which long and continuous lengths of high-performance high-temperature superconductors can be fabricated.   Successful work in Phase I will enable substantially greater control over the microstructural development in bismuth-2223 composites, particularly in terms of achieving a higher level of phase purity and further simulating the beneficial effects of reaction- induced texturing.

        "abstract": "New power semiconductor device performance is limited by cooling because high heat-flux cooling systems have not matched their increased power density. Therefore, real designs rarely achieve device ratings. American Superconductor (ASC) demonstrated CryoPower+, which cools a variety of power MOSFET topologies by direct immersion in coolants from 77-300K, with boiling where appropriate. CryoPower (TM) optimizes system cost, size, efficiency and pulse handling capability for only MOSFET applications ASC proposes a new innovation, to extend CryoPower(TM) to IGBT/MTO minority-carrier devices. This innovation first requires Phase I characterization of conduction and switching losses, and of the safe operating area (SOA) across an economical temperature range. Characterization concentrates on four-layer devices such as the new high-voltage, insulated-gate, bipolar transistors (HVIGBT) and MOS-controlled, turn-off thyristors (MTO). High device switching losses depend on minority carrier lifetimes, which decrease considerably with temperature. We expect an economic and reliable active cooling system to allow increased switching frequencies. Device SOA should also increase with active cooling, dependent on nonlinear mechanisms inherent in the chosen device.  Phase I Characterization data and Phase II hardware demonstration data will help realize the full economic benefit of this innovation by allowing device performance and cooling system optirnization.  The Phase I and II programs will enable industry to reap the synergetic benefits of both CryoPower(TM) and IGBT/MTO technologies. Multi-megawatt, high voltage applications using new power semiconductor devices are found in numerous Military and Commercial systems. These range from pulse power circuits for radar and sonar systems, to large industrial process controllers, where small percentile increases in system efficiency and reliability can translate into large operating cost reductions and profit increases.",

        "abstract": "On-site recovery of constituent materials from compound semiconductor waste streams presents an opportunity for reduction of hazardous material waste and cost of manufacturing. UDRI has developed a low-cost process for recovering gallium and arsenic from the production of gallium arsenide where the primary contaminant is the other element of the binary compound. This method can be applied to other compound semiconductors also. AXT proposes to grow gallium arsenide crystals from waste materials recovered by the UDRI process from AXT's normal gallium arsenide substrate manufacturing production line. The crystals will be wafered and analyzed by typical compound semiconductor analysis techniques such as Hall effect, GDMS, X-ray, etc. to determine what level of binary residual can be successfully used to grow high quality crystals. Additionally, preliminary studies will be made to determine the concentration of contaminants in the recovered gallium and arsenic and their impact on the purity of the grown crystals. Since the typical starting materials are 6-7N purity, the on-site recovered materials may retain similar purity after the UDRI process.  Successful demonstration of crystal growth will pave the way for implementation of the recovery process in a commercial volume-production environment.  Successful implementation of the on-site recovery technology can lead to reduction in waste and cost of compound semiconductor crystals. Localized waste recovery avoids the cost of landfill and future potential hazards.",

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I program will investigate the feasibility of a hierarchical target detection/recognition approach for robust, semi-affine-invariant target detection and recognition for hierarchical foveal machine vision (HFMV) based targeting systems.  The system is organized into three hierarchies:  a hierarchy of camera models for different targets at different circumstances, a hierarchy of multiresolution images (foveal images), and a hierarchy of filters to achieve automatic target detection and recognition.  Targets are detected based on their appearances by maximum discrimiant filters across multiple scales.  The maximum discriminant filters are derived by an integration of a limited number of target appearance templates combined with appropriate camera models through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).  Templates are incorporated into Linear Phase Coefficient Composite (LPCC) filters to achieve target detection.  The proposed approach promises robust target detection/recognition on individual images and image sequences as long as the change in appearance of the target can be described by affine transformations.  Even though it is is developed primarily for visual and infrared (IR) HFMV imageries, the proposed approach can be used for other types of images such as images from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Laser Radar (LADAR) sensing platforms.  The proposed algorithm can be mapped into feedforward neural networks.",

A general and more efficient approach to creating such high-accuracy models is proposed herein.

        "abstract": "Three approaches -- a wake-integral procedure, a viscous theory of aerodynamics and an integro-differential method for Navier-Stokes flows -- will be fully developed and consolidated to create a new technology for studies of aerodynamic drag associated with unsteady flows.  These new approaches deal with theoretical, experimental and computational aspects of the aerodynamic drag problem.  They utilize integral expressions derived from vorticity formulations of the Navier-Stokes equations.  With these integral expressions, aerodynamic drag on a solid object can be determined using only a limited amount of information about the trailing vortical wakes flow.  Coexisting drag components on the solid object can be individually determined.  In the Phase I work, an investigation of the hovering rotor problem will be performed.  Wake integrals will be derived and computer codes will be prepared for separately evaluating drag components on hovering rotors using available wake data.  The viscous theory of aerodynamics and the integro-differential Navier-Stokes solver will be extended to the hovering rotor application.  The feasibility and the practicality of the new technology as applied to the problem of the rotor in forward flight and to other unsteady flow problems will be demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "The growing reliance on wireless electronic systems presents us with a need  for new diversity antennas for civilian and military platforms. These antennas must take account of platform curvature, material treatments and nearby interactions, all of which affect the antenna performance.  To support the development and design of these antennas, a new generation  of analysis is required which retains geometrical adaptability and material  generality in addition to being capable of treating small details on large scale platforms. We propose to develop such software by combining two powerful and  flexible methods. One of them has already been shown to be highly effective  in modeling complex, conformal antenna configurations on doubly curved platforms whereas the second approach is an established methodology for modeling large scale  platform interactions. We will develop a software package which integrates the  two methods along with improvements for platform treatments and near zone field  interactions. The proposed software suite will be run on engineering-class  workstations and will rely on CAD geometrical descriptions of the antenna and  surrounding platform. We are confident that commercially-viable software  will result from this effort and will incorporate a variety of visualization  tools (for geometry and antenna parameter display) and graphical interfaces.",

Recently, we have demonstrated room-temperature optically pumped lasers from 2.8 to 4.5 microns based on InAs/InGaSb/InAs/AlSb type-II quantum wells.  For 4.5 micron devices, lasing was observed up to 310 K, and the peak output power per facet was more than 3.65 W at 160 K and about 360 mW and 280 K.  For 350 K 3.2 micron lasers, the maximum peak output power per facet was more than 260 mW at room temperature.  Electrically-pumped lasers based on type-II superlattice have also been demonstrated.  Since the Auger non-radiative recombination rate could be suppressed by more than two orders of magnitude using bandgap engineering, the radiative efficiency and hence power efficiency could be dramatically improved.The Phase I effort will be directed towards the demonstrations of room-temperature high-power optically-pumped lasers and high-temperature electrically-pumped laser diodes with high repetition rates.",

The control station and the UTA mission package without requiring continuosly high band width data links.  The single controller can support multiple UTAs due to the inherent decision aiding at interface provided by ICAV.

These interventions will include decision aids, enhanced team procedures, and shared information displays, designed to enhance the resource allocation function in a team comprised of members with different expertise, knowledge, and skills.  Rather than designing a computer-based task from scratch, the APTIMA, Inc. team proposes to modify the DDD-based task they have developed and tested over the last ten years in order to meet the Air Force specifications, and focus most of the Phase I effort in the study of those team interventions which have a maximum potential to affect team performance.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract).  Inhaled gene products are desirable for chronic respiratory diseases with high morbidity and mortality, e.g.  cystic fibrosis, emphysema, asthma, lung cancer, and tuberculosis.  Aerosolization of DNA (plasmids) using conventional flow-through aerosol devices may cause breaking of plasmid strands due to extensive shearing.  The investigators developed a prototype aerosol system (AERxTM) that generates a cloud of respirable aerosol by single extrusion of liquid through an array of precise micron- size holes.  Nozzle and drug reservoir form an integral disposable part that avoids potentially toxic or incompatible stabilizers.  Because the medicament is in its native form and enters the nozzle only once, the probability of damage to gene vectors is vastly reduced.  The aerosol 'bolus' is released with a predetermined inspired volume to optimize delivery to desired parts of the respiratory system.  Studies with normal volunteers showed that combining suitable particle size with breath and aerosol actuation control results in a desirable and reproducible pattern of drug deposition in the lung.  Comprehensive in vitro evaluation of the aerosol properties and the quality of the aerosolized DNA/vector will be done in Phase I.  In Phase II, the investigators plan to commence on clinical scale product development and pre clinical studies in a primate model. $ = TOTAL AWARD AMTS & NOT LIMITED TO PORTION OF PROJECT RELATED TO SUBJECT OF SEARCH SUBPROJECT $ = TOTAL AWARD AMOUNT DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF SUBPROJECTS SOURCE:  CRISP  FORMAT F    FY 97      LAST UPDATE 04-07-98 1QUERY 1536                        ID SEARCH 06/01/98   PAGE    428 --PROJECT NUMBER......1 R43 HL58263-01                 INVESTIGATOR NAME/ADDRESS FY  97    OGATA, LYNN C IRG/INTRAMURAL UNIT..ZRG2                             MEDINOX, INC AWARD AMOUNT.........    $66,696                      11555 SORRENTO VALLEY RD SAN DIEGO, CA  92121 PERFORMING ORGANIZATION: MEDINOX, INC. TITLE   IMMUNOLOGIC METHODS FOR IN VIVO NITRIC OXIDE DETECTION ABSTRACT: DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from applicant s abstract) The major objective of this research is to develop a simple, sensitive, and accurate assay method for detection of nitric oxide levels.  Nitric oxide is produced in the human body and is important for vasodilation, neurotransmission, and immunity.  Although several disease states are associated with abnormal levels of nitric oxide including septic shock, stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, pre-eclampsia, and impotence, there are no diagnostic tools available for the in vivo detection of nitric oxide.  For this project, rats will be immunized with a novel metal chelating complex capable of scavenging nitric oxide (a Medinox proprietary compound).  Monoclonal antibodies capable of recognizing the nitric oxide-scavenger complex will be isolated.  These antibodies will be utilized to develop a new immunoassay for nitric oxide levels.  If successful, Phase II of this project will adapt the assay for use in detecting nitric oxide levels in patients suffering from many nitric oxide-related inflammatory and infectious diseases. $ = TOTAL AWARD AMTS & NOT LIMITED TO PORTION OF PROJECT RELATED TO SUBJECT OF SEARCH SUBPROJECT $ = TOTAL AWARD AMOUNT DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF SUBPROJECTS SOURCE:  CRISP  FORMAT F    FY 97      LAST UPDATE 04-07-98 1QUERY 1536                        ID SEARCH 06/01/98   PAGE    429 --PROJECT NUMBER......1 R43 HL58272-01                 INVESTIGATOR NAME/ADDRESS FY  97    SOUTHAN, GARRY J IRG/INTRAMURAL UNIT..ZRG7                             INOTEK CORPORATION AWARD AMOUNT.........    $98,975                      8280 KUGLER MILL RD CINCINNATI, OH 45243 PERFORMING ORGANIZATION: INOTEK CORPORATION TITLE   NOVEL SCAVENGER FOR TREATMENT OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION ABSTRACT: DESCRIPTION (Adapted from applicant's abstract): Reperfusion injury of the ischemic myocardium is characterized by overproduction of oxygen and nitrogen derived free radicals and oxidants.  Some of the final common pathways of reperfusion injury include the production of the toxic oxidant peroxynitrite, the free radical nitric oxide, and the prostaglandin thromboxane.  Inotek, Inc.  has developed an agent, mercaptoethylguanidine (MEG), which interferes with all 3 pathways simultaneously, acting as a potent scavenger of peroxynitrite, inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, and selective inhibitor of the inducible nitric oxide synthase.  The overall goal of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to establish whether MEG prevents cellular injury in an experimental model of myocardial infarction and reperfusion.  This hypothesis will be tested using well-established rat models of myocardial ischemia- reperfusion. Demonstration that MEG prevents tissue injury in this model would represent a breakthrough in the design of novel therapeutic regimens for reperfusion injury and would justify continued commercial development of MEG.  Phase II SBIR funding would be used to support pre-clinical toxicology, pathology and clinical studies. $ = TOTAL AWARD AMTS & NOT LIMITED TO PORTION OF PROJECT RELATED TO SUBJECT OF SEARCH SUBPROJECT $ = TOTAL AWARD AMOUNT DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF SUBPROJECTS SOURCE:  CRISP  FORMAT F    FY 97      LAST UPDATE 04-07-98 1QUERY 1536                        ID SEARCH 06/01/98   PAGE    430 --PROJECT NUMBER......1 R43 HL58285-01A1               INVESTIGATOR NAME/ADDRESS FY  97    HILD, GABOR IRG/INTRAMURAL UNIT..ZRG7                             ELGAVISH PHARMAGNETICS AWARD AMOUNT.........    $99,279                      1737 VALPAR DRIVE BIRMINGHAM, AL  35226-2343 PERFORMING ORGANIZATION: ELGAVISH PARAMAGNETICS TITLE   ELGAVIST, AN MRI CONTRAST AGENT FOR DIAGNOSIS OF IHD ABSTRACT: DESCRIPTION: Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the number one cause of death in western societies.  A rapid and noninvasive method of early detection of myocardial underperfusion would be important for the timely institution of therapy, but no method to date has provided reliable, high-resolution detection MRI is a noninvasive technique with excellent soft tissue resolution.  For IHD, however, it is hampered by the lack of sufficient intrinsic contrast.  With specific contrast agents MRI would enable the early detection of perfusion abnormalities.  Existing agents, however, are not specific enough nor are retained long enough to allow stress-coupled MRI of perfusion.  We have designed and synthesized effective new agents.  Three have passed the in vitro tests Gd(BME-DTTA), Gd(MHE-DTTA), and \"ELGAVIST.\" We have shown that Gd(BME- DTTA) creates detectable MRI contrast of underperfused myocardium in images of LAD- occluded ferrets and dogs, in vivo, but it requires liposomic dispersion. Its best water-soluble analog, \"ELGAVIST,\" is the most likely to gain commercial success.  Thus the goal of the present proposal is the small- scale study (Phase I) of \"ELGAVIST\" efficacy in the in vivo experimental dog model of acute myocardial ischemia followed by reperfusion, with and without dobutamine-induced pharmacologic stress.  The results would likely lead to a more detailed Phase II which should establish the clinical potential of \"ELGAVIST\" for early diagnosis of IHD with a market potential larger than that of Thallium or Cardiolite. $ = TOTAL AWARD AMTS & NOT LIMITED TO PORTION OF PROJECT RELATED TO SUBJECT OF SEARCH SUBPROJECT $ = TOTAL AWARD AMOUNT DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF SUBPROJECTS SOURCE:  CRISP  FORMAT F    FY 97      LAST UPDATE 04-07-98 1QUERY 1536                        ID SEARCH 06/01/98   PAGE    431 --PROJECT NUMBER......1 R43 HL58288-01A1               INVESTIGATOR NAME/ADDRESS FY  97    PURDUM, HOWARD E IRG/INTRAMURAL UNIT..ZRG7                             SIMUTECH INC AWARD AMOUNT.........    $99,700                      2660 HAMPTONS CHASE ALPHARETTA, GA  30202 PERFORMING ORGANIZATION: SIMUTECH TITLE   IMPROVED INTRAOPERATIVE BLOOD COLLECTION SYSTEM ABSTRACT: DESCRIPTION (Adapted from applicant's abstract): Intraoperative blood salvage (IBS) is a procedure to collect, process and return the patient's own blood during a surgical operation.  Compared to transfusion from even a carefully selected donor, the main advantages of IBS include the elimination of the risk of disease transmission, the prevention of immune reactions, and the avoidance of hemolytic, febrile and allergic problems. IBS also provides ready availability, which is particularly important for rare blood types.  IBS also follows directly from the need to provide a clear field for the surgeon.  In addition, IBS is cost effective, and reduces the demands of the blood bank industry for its limited resources. The proposed technology is oriented toward improvements in the collection phase of IBS.  The new technology is thus designed to work with the conventional blood salvage systems that already provide significant benefits.  The additional components of the proposed system are relatively inexpensive, compared to the cost of cell washers or units of transfused blood.  These components are also quite simple to use, resulting in minimum requirements of technician training and cost.  Finally, the prospect of improved patient care, resulting in shortened hospital stays, makes the proposed system quite promising in terms of net cost effectiveness. $ = TOTAL AWARD AMTS & NOT LIMITED TO PORTION OF PROJECT RELATED TO SUBJECT OF SEARCH SUBPROJECT $ = TOTAL AWARD AMOUNT DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF SUBPROJECTS SOURCE:  CRISP  FORMAT F    FY 97      LAST UPDATE 04-07-98 1QUERY 1536                        ID SEARCH 06/01/98   PAGE    432 --PROJECT NUMBER......1 R43 HL58297-01                 INVESTIGATOR NAME/ADDRESS FY  97    PACHENCE, JAMES M IRG/INTRAMURAL UNIT..ZRG3                             VERITAS MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES I AWARD AMOUNT.........   $100,000                      116 VILLAGE BOULEVARD, SUITE 2 PRINCETON, NJ  08540-5799 PERFORMING ORGANIZATION: VERITAS MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. TITLE   NOVEL APPROACH FOR TREATMENT OF PULMONARY HYPERTENSION ABSTRACT: DESCRIPTION: (adapted from applicant's abstract) The principal aim of this proposal is to deliver a sustained release, polymeric agent to prevent collagen accumulation in hypertensive blood vessels.  The polymer, a backbone of alternating PEG2000 and lysine with the proline analogue cis-4-hydroxy-L-prol ine (cHyp) attached to the lysine group, has sustained, specific antifibrotic activity.  It is proposed to redesign the polymer by using PEG1000 in place of PEG2000 to increase drug \"loading\" of the polymer.  Because of the size of the p olymer (Mr=21,000d), liposomes are required for uptake by endothelial cells and a polysaccharide -coated liposome will be employed to enhance cell uptake.  Retention of the polymer/liposome delivery system will be tested using an endothelial cell/smooth muscle cell (SMC) coculture system. Uptake of the delivery system by endothelial cells, stability of the polymer in cells and release of the active agent to SMCs to inhibit collagen synthesis will be studied.

Current immunosuppressive regimens have limited efficacy and are associated with substantial toxicity. The key final common pathways of transplant rejection include the production of the toxic oxidant peroxynitrite, the free radical nitric oxide, and the prostaglandin thromboxane.  Inotek, Inc.  has developed a revolutionary immunosuppressive agent, mercaptoethylguanidine (MEG), which interferes with all 3 pathways simultaneously, acting as a potent scavenger of peroxynitrite, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, and a selective inhibitor of the inducible nitric oxide synthase.  The Specific Aim of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to establish whether MEG prevents organ dysfunction and cellular injury in an experimental model of transplant rejection.  This hypothesis will be tested using a well- established rat heterotopic cardiac transplantation system.  Demonstration that MEG prevents tissue injury and prolongs graft survival in this model would represent a breakthrough in the design of novel immunosuppressive regimes for transplant rejection and would justify continued commercial development of MEG.  Phase II SBIR funding would be used to support pre- clinical toxicology/pathology and Phase I clinical studies. $ = TOTAL AWARD AMTS & NOT LIMITED TO PORTION OF PROJECT RELATED TO SUBJECT OF SEARCH SUBPROJECT $ = TOTAL AWARD AMOUNT DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF SUBPROJECTS SOURCE:  CRISP  FORMAT F    FY 97      LAST UPDATE 04-07-98 1QUERY 1536                        ID SEARCH 06/01/98   PAGE    434 --PROJECT NUMBER......1 R43 HL58332-01                 INVESTIGATOR NAME/ADDRESS FY  97    GIBIAN, GARY L IRG/INTRAMURAL UNIT..ZRG7                             PLANNING SYSTEMS INC AWARD AMOUNT.........    $99,008                      7923 JONES BRANCH DRIVE MC LEAN, VA  22102 PERFORMING ORGANIZATION: PLANNING SYSTEMS, INC. TITLE   ANALYSIS, STORAGE, AND TRANSMISSION OF LUNG SOUNDS ABSTRACT: DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the applicant's abstract) Listening to lung sounds (auscultation) is used in the diagnosis of pulmonary problems. Although X-rays and pulmonary function test are normally used as well, neither is adequate by itself for diagnosing all types of lung diseases. There is recent evidence that differences in lung sounds among common pulmonary conditions allow good predictions of diagnostic categories.  The application of high-resolution acoustic analytical techniques to develop methods for the remote monitoring of lung function by analyzing breath sounds through a computerized telephone network could make detection and more frequent assessment of pulmonary problems more convenient and more affordable.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop a clinically useful system on a common desktop personal computer.  This Phase I proposal addresses (1) wavelet based processing techniques to provide enhancements in auscultation for diagnosing lung diseases, data compression and storage, and automatic detection of adventitious sounds by a single system; and (2) a preliminary design study for a remote monitoring system based on transmission of lung sounds between computers on a telephone network.  The affordable nature of such a system makes it suitable for widespread use.  The system would find commercial application in hospitals, clinics, schools and industrial sites, and doctors' offices. $ = TOTAL AWARD AMTS & NOT LIMITED TO PORTION OF PROJECT RELATED TO SUBJECT OF SEARCH SUBPROJECT $ = TOTAL AWARD AMOUNT DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF SUBPROJECTS SOURCE:  CRISP  FORMAT F    FY 97      LAST UPDATE 04-07-98 1QUERY 1536                        ID SEARCH 06/01/98   PAGE    435 --PROJECT NUMBER......1 R43 HL58338-01                 INVESTIGATOR NAME/ADDRESS FY  97    ANDERSON, D MICHAEL IRG/INTRAMURAL UNIT..ZRG2                             MILLENNIUM HEALTH AWARD AMOUNT.........   $100,000                      2734 CORTLAND PLACE, NW WASHINGTON, DC  20008 PERFORMING ORGANIZATION: MILLENNIUM HEALTH TITLE   MULTIMEDIA FITNESS PROMOTION FOR SEDENTARY ADULTS ABSTRACT: This project will develop and evaluate a multimedia exercise promotion program to meet adult learning characteristics by: 1) structuring the program into modules that can be used individually or sequentially; 2) allowing users to select their own path through the program, based on time, need, and learning style; 3) ensuring that the focus of the program is on the application of skills and concepts through use of scenario-based learning experiences; and 4) ensuring that the feedback component of the program is a constructive learning experience providing users with response- specific feedback, remedial branching when needed, and a complete, printed, personal exercise prescription.

In an era of declining education budgets,  teachers are rarely given the opportunity for continuing their own education in this critical subject area.  It follows that unless they choose to do so of their own accord, their understanding will lag behind scientific understanding.  It is of utmost importance to equip our teachers with  knowledge and support in subject areas  relating to drug abuse.

The intervention will address four mediators that predict drug use onset: (1) ideals, (2) normative beliefs, (3) prosocial bonding, and (4) personal commitments.  The intervention will be packaged for use by community groups (recreation centers, church groups, and groups such as 41-I Clubs and Girl and Boy Scouts). These groups currently lack access to research-based approaches to prevention in a format that fits these organizations' settings. This project will be a collaborative effort that will involve the Nebraska Council, a group with extensive community-based program experience. During Phase l, program materials will be developed. Materials will allow flexibility in program delivery so that community groups can accomplish drug use prevention goals within their normal framework. Phase l will include (1) a survey of community program providers in two states (Nebraska and North Carolina) to assess program feasibility and (2) a quasi-experimental pilot study in which groups typical of those expected to be ultimate users of the program will participate. The impact of the program on key mediating variables will be assessed.  Community program leaders and teens will be assessed regarding their satisfaction with the program.",

        "abstract": "Aspen Systems proposes to develop a novel process to increase the strength of sapphire at elevated  temperatures.  The resulting strength increase will alleviate the adverse effects of frictional heating of  sapphire windows.  Frictional heating can initiate a c-axis strength loss, leading to premature failure.   The Aspen process will uniformly implant silicon atoms through the entire window, as well as, result  in the production of uniform point defects throughout the crystal structure.  These mechanisms will pin  the crystal lattice, resulting in a structure more resistant to rhombohedral twinning and thermal shock  failure.   Preliminary tests conducted by Aspen Systems have demonstrated that this process can be applied to  high purity sapphire with no adverse effects on the transmission characteristics in the Midwave  (3-5mm) region.    For the Phase I effort we will demonstrate proof-of-principal that our process can increase the high  temperature strength of sapphire without degrading its optical properties.   During the Phase I Option  and Phase II effort, we will optimize and tune the process to maximize the high temperature strength of  the resulting sapphire.   A statistically significant number of sapphire coupons will be processed and  tested to verify the mechanical properties of the modified dome material.

        "abstract": "While the benefits of auxiliary heating of the human body when exposed to extremely cold temperatures are well known, there is currently no suitable technology developed to provide body heating in a completely autonomous and mobile system.  In Phase I of the proposed program Aspen Systems will investigate the various technologies available to provide auxiliary heating to the body and identify those that show high potential in meeting the stated objectives.  This will be followed by a demonstration of feasibility.  At the completion of the first phase of the program we will be certain that the approach selected is the most advantageous and may be successfully developed into a marketable product.  The Phase II program will include the development, prototyping, and field testing of a personal heating product which will be introduced to the commercial market immediately upon completion of the Phase II effort.  The personal heating product developed in our program will not only greatly enhance the effectiveness of military personnel in performing their job function, but will also extend the mission lengths and conditions in which they may operate and survive.  The emphasis on the development of a dual use product will generate a larger production volume which will result in lower costs for both military and commercial customers.  Aspen Systems is in a unique position for success based on our previous experience in this area, our ties with commercial companies which currently manufacture and distribute personal heat transfer products, and our technology currently under development to catalytically reform diesel fuel and JPS to clean burning gaseous fuels.  The personal heating product developed in this program will be directly applicable to many commercial markets and will greatly improve the productivity and job satisfaction of construction workers, cold storage facility workers, and utility linesman, to name but a few.

This method uses intersecting lasers in a gaseous medium to cause fluorescence from desired points. By scanning a series of intersection points in either a rastor or vector scan in a timeless than the eye's 15 Hz refresh rate, a true three-dimensional image can be generated. The idea has recently become much more practical with the advent of visible diode lasers. The concept will be demonstrated using rubidium vapor and diode lasers at 780 nm (writing an invisible excited line or plane) and 630 nm (causing red fluorescence at the intersection point with the 780 nm laser). The method can be extended to other colors such as yellow, green, and blue as appropriate diode laser sources become available. Mechanical scanners will be used for the Phase I demonstration. A scaled up device would be likely to use acousto-optic scanners to achieve large numbers of voxels (3-D pixels). In addition to being able to write fluorescent images into the display, there is the potential for writing absorbing opaque regions, through which hidden objects cannot be seen.

Our geometry- based TBD process is based on a nonlinear energy maximization procedure that does  not require parallel processing for multiple trajectory hypotheses. Atlantic developed the geometry-based TBD technique in the context of airborne passive missile warning.

        "abstract": "The proposed effort is directed at achieving Automatic Target Cueing (ATC) performance at levels which are essential for near term system deployment.  The performance required for deployment is beyond the capability of current systems.  The design emphasis is to have robust performance under a full range of operating conditions, and to use techniques which lead to efficient real time implementation in Phase II.  The basis of the approach is to apply adaptive nonlinear spatial filtering to FLIR imagery.  This innovative filtering allows the imagery to be simultaneously characterized in terms of both local thermal intensity and target spatial extent.  We have shown static (non-adaptive) filters of this type can detect very low contrast targets in real imagery with sensitivity superior to other architectures.  The proposed approach uses approximate target range information to allow real time adaptation of the filter parameters.  This innovation results in sharper filtering, such that the filter response to typical clutter is suppressed, while a strong response to targets is retained.  The overall result will be a significant reduction in ATC system false alarm rates, while maintaining the capability to detect low signature targets.  In the phase I effort, we will adapt proven range independent FLIR ATC algorithms to utilize data from a laser rangefinder.  This system will be tested and evaluated on selected FLIR imagery.  Additionally, textural and structural metrics will be developed which can be used to reject false alarms resulting from thermal gradients caused by natural objects.  In the Phase II program, the full ATC system will be refined, and implemented in real time hardware.  Performance will be evaluated in a blind test on a comprehensive set of imagery which encompasses a wide variety of targets, target ranges, and terrain types.  Anticipated benefits of the proposed research include dramatically improved performance for ground based and airborne sensor platforms for detection, cueing, and target servicing tasks.

        "abstract": "The penetration of hyperspectral sensing from either airborne or spaceborne platforms into both commercial and defense applications, has risen the need for efficient data transmission and storage.  This efficiency can be provided by data compression technology that exhibits sufficient compression ratio at no or minimal loss of information and can perform the task in real or near real time.  This Phase I SBIR is aimed at developing and assessing the feasibility of a practical hyperspectral imagery compression process that combines two key components; adaptive wavelet decomposition technology and spectral binning.  The proposed compression technology will be capable of both lossless performance as well as controlled information loss to achieve higher compression ratios.  The developed algorithms will make maximum utility of unique attributes of hyperspectral imagery in order to achieve high compression ratings.  Since real or near real time performance is desired, the focus of the development will be on computationally efficient algorithms that can be implemented in real time on COTS or special purpose hardware (such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays).  In addition to real-time, size, weight and power is of high interest for airborne and spaceborne platforms.",

        "abstract": "Modeling and simulation (M&S) provides the potential of serving as a cost-effective expedient for developing, acquiring, testing, and fielding new technologies for the future battlefield-provided the limitations of existing tools and techniques can be overcome.  As the Army focal point for communications M&S, the U.S. Army Communications-Electronic Command (CECOM) has the lead for performing M&S to support systems engineering and analysis needed to evolve Army legacy systems and to introduce evolving communications systems technology needed to meet Warfighter requirements for seamless and integrated multimedia services.  To date, CECOM efforts have focused on the Tactical Internet and echelons brigade and below in preparation for the Task Force XXI Advanced warfighting Experiment (AWE), planned for early 1997.  As the Army moves forward, however, the requirement exists for simulations of echelons Corps and Division-which will include interfaces to joint and coalition forces.  This will greatly increase the scope and complexity of the simulations.  Such large-scale simulations, utilizing today's technology and methods, are computer resource and time intensive, in some cases requiring several days of computer run time.  Objectives of the Phase I Small Business Innovation Research effort are to provide a model improvement plan that will provide recommendations for reducing simulation setup and run times, increase confidence in results and decrease life-cycle costs.  This will be accomplished by presenting a number of prioritized enhancements and modifications to existing models.  The follow-on Phase II effort will result in a demonstrable prototype of those enhancements and/or modifications deemed to provide the greatest benefit/cost ratio.

Recent work on relay algorithms to detect faults and coordinate multiple circuit protection devices (CPDs) has demonstrated high-speed relay algorithms capable of reliably detecting transient events within several microseconds of their occurrence. These relay algorithms can be used with new switchgear being developed capable of switching power buses and feeders in several microseconds Ultra-high-speed relays need to distinguish accurately between normal and fault transients. The approach advocated is based on learning normal power system load transients and switching patterns as viewed from the perspective of the CPD. Dynamic polynomial neural network (DPNN) predictors will be used to model both normal and fault transients; their coefficient values, future forecasts, state phase-plan trajectories, and model error residuals can be used to distinguish normal from fault transients. The technique is adaptive and does not require substantial pre-training of the neural networks. Traditional prediction methods (e.g., reduced-order modeling) require computational throughput too excessive to be affordable for real-time implementation.

        "abstract": "State-of-the-art real-time diagnostic systems generally consist of two integrated components: fault detection and fault classification (isolation) systems. Although such systems may be able to recognize failure precursors, they have no mechanism for exploiting diagnostic information for prognostic purposes, i.e., for predicting the time to machinery failure. Prognostic information is critical as it provides a quantitative measure on which to base subsequent actions. It is the essential improvement needed in future condition-based maintenance systems and the one for which demand is greatest in both the military and commercial communities. The approach taken herein is based on the development of analytic parametric machinery component models. Analytic models are reconciled with sensor-based information by using adaptation to \"parameterize\" faults; such models thereby characterize the dynamic state of the machinery components modeled. The process of going from vibration signatures to analytic model parameterization is inherently an inverse problem, and one that neural networks are well suited to solve in real time. Once the analytic model parameters are identified, they may be used to initialize critical failure mechanics (e.g., crack growth) models, which can be used to predict remaining useful life under any user- specified loading condition.",

        "abstract": "American health care is in the midst of momentous change. Quality improvement principles are being used increasingly to enhance productivity and efficiency of health care delivery and to help contain costs. In producing patient outcomes and resource utilization measures, it is vital to control appropriately for case mix (i.e., differences in patients due, e.g., to illness severity) in the predictive model. If the severity of illness among patients can be accounted for accurately, differences in patient outcomes--mortality, resource utilization, morbidity, and patient function (both at discharge and over the long term)--will reflect, in large measure, differences in the quality-of-care received. With an accurate patient outcomes model, trained and validated using high-integrity hospital patient records, control for illness severity is explicit: the predictive model captures the relationship between observables and outcomes. Quality outcomes differing significantly from the expected values, as predicted by the model, reflect differences in quality of care. Static and dynamic polynomial neural networks (PNNs) will be used to synthesize accurate prediction of patient outcomes based on the most cost-effective patient observables. For categorical variables, PNNs are trained using a minimum logistic-loss fitting criterion; for continuous variables, a minimum squared- error criterion is used.",

It allows decreased test time, increased reliability and reduced test program development cost.  Manual probing is costly to implement, is subject to judgement errors and requires the operator to consult ancillary documents.  Normally, functional end-to-end testing is performed at the card's interface connector.  When no test connector exists or insufficient test points are available, probing must be employed.  This technique requires human judgement and additional technical references to identify the probe points.  The Robotic Test Probe technique circumvents these problems.  Once initial design costs are amortized, only minor modifications will be required to accommodate other applications.  It can be incorporated into a VXI test set utilizing standard COTS hardware/software and also provides a unique solution to implementation of Vertical Commonality into the testing toolset.Under the proposed Phase I effort, experience BCO Inc Engineers will use their aggregate knowledge to specify requirements, identify appropriate hardware/software requirements and provide a proof of concept.

        "abstract": "Beam Technology Corporation is prepared to develop an innovative personal Radio frequency Radiation Dosimeter based on concepts originally enunciated by Dr. Johnathan Kiel, The approach will use a technology that promises to be much more versatile than currently available methods of measurement, which often employ E-field probes and meters.  The objective is to use a novel chemical, Diazoluminomelanin (DALM), as a sensitive material for detection of the radio frequency radiation (RFR) exposure.  The DALM will be employed as a thin film in the detection part of the dosimeter, in a sealed container to be designed.  During the Phase I Project, we will explore the use of a system which would have the DALM film exposed to a specified frequency of light during the period of RFR exposure and subsequently determine the extent of RFR exposure by measuring the slow fluorescence emitted by the film (in a reader to be designed) upon pulsed activation by light of the same or a similar wavelength.  Since there is no published literature describing this technology, a second approach which will be explored is to activate the DALM film to emit light, also in proportion to the RFR exposure, using either an existing Quantitative Luminescent Imaging System (QLIS), or a modification thereof designed specifically for this dosimetry system.  The DALM film would be designed to allow for reading on a daily basis (to determine exposures of moderate to high intensity only), or at 3-month intervals (for reading a combination of both.  Potentially, the system could be designed to indicate that an RFR exposure which is currently occurring (above a to-be-determined intensity level).",

The toolbox will be an open environment containing all the components required a PDE control problem, including the effect of sensors and actuators.   With the toolbox, the user will be able to design and access PDE controllers in an efficient, flexible and user-friendly manner.  The toolbox will be able to solve real-world engineering problems of interest to the Air Force, other government agencies, and commercial industry.  The toolbox will be demonstrated on a problem modeled after a JSF design challenge:  to design a controller for an aeroservoelastic wing section to achieve perscribed camber and twist.  The toolbox will reduce by one to two orders of magnitude the time required for  designing controllers for PDE distributed systems.  It will contain stand-alone modules for standard control design methodologies as well as interfaces to third-party control design software such as MATLAB and Matrix X.  In Phase I, we will develop key components of the functionality of the toolbox and demonstrate it on control design of a model fluid-structure interaction problem.",

Our hypothesis is that a 1 ,2-dihydrophthalazine AMPA receptor antagonist would be a safe and clinically useful drug for the treatment of seizure disorders such as epilepsy. Phase I specific aims are to: 1) Synthesize the individual stereo isomers of SYM 2206 and two non-chiral-center containing analogs of SYM 2206. 2) Test each new analog for its ability to protect mice and rats against seizures at non-toxic doses. 3) Select a compound for preclinical toxicology and pharmacokinetic evaluation in Phase II of the proposal. The work in Phase Il is expected to complete the preclinical development of one of the compounds. Phase III will comprise clinical trials for the treatment of epilepsy or other seizure disorders.",

To solve the problem, Beltran proposes to study combined techniques that include Magnetic Particle Technology and 3-D (Three Dimensional) Combined Magnetic Particle and 3-D Electrochemical Technology -- Combined Technology -- or CT). Of interest are processes that can reclaim the heavy metals for subsequent refining. The extent of development in Phase II will be sufficient to scale up to a small field test. The Phase I program will develop and prove the concept of using CT and/or MPRT in wastewater treatment. The prof of concept will include a safety and environmental impact study. The Phase II program will develop a prototype CT and/or magnetic particle resin technology which takes advantage of the negative charge present on colloidal impurities in sewage, effluent, and raw water. The theoretical treatment process may involve changing the ion charge on magnetite, contacting the effluent, inducing flocculation, clarifying, and release of the impurities from teh magnetite.",

In particular, planar colloidal arrays may be formed in designated areas of the electrode surface, and these dynamic plannar arrays may be subjected to operations such as: place-and-hold; translocate; split; merge; etc. This technology permits a novel approach to fluid and matter transport that is functionally integrated with the spatial confinement and concatenation, respectively, of conconccurent and sequential analytical procedures.  The phase I effort will focus on the introduction of an integrated analytical system based on the novel methology of dynamic planar arrays that is native to the planar geometry of on-chip chemical analysis.  A selection of essential functional system components will be demonstrated: in-situ sample purification; mixed-phase activity assay for a critical enzyme in the eucaryotic signal transuction pathway; and the automated, real-time parallel processing of dynamic planar arrays by externally imposed patterns of illumination from a spacially addressable source array.",

While the benefits are enormous, the resulting bacterial species are not natural to the ecosystem and specific subspecies must be continuously monitored in the field.  Monitoring instruments should have detection limits as low as tens of organisms per liter and should have detection times of several minutes.  This project will evaluate the ability of piezoelectric detectors to provide the requisite stability, sensitivity and ruggedness for field-based bacterial detection and speciation.  Three essential steps will be addressed in Phase I: the selection of the piezoelectric sensor geometry, the selection of an attachment chemistry and the demonstration of sensor performance.  The Phase I effort will employ sample injection of crude polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product to demonstrate detection.  Phase II will focus on engineering refinement of the system components, integration of sample collection, preconcentration  and amplification reactor subsystems with the detector and the evaluation of sensor arrays.  Phase II will result in a prototype of a complete system with detect limits of tens of organisms per liter.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This project is expected to result in a low cost, simple, sensitive and selective field portable sensor with applications in environmental monitoring, food processing, clinical diagnostics and medical research.

During Phase I, additional studies will be conducted to demonstrate the technology with explosives found in mines, evaluate potential interferents, and develop data that can be used to predict the performance of ranging from to vehicular-mounted detectors.

In collaboration with TRS Ceramics, Inc., single crystal relaxor PT piezoelectrics will be integrated into the transducer, providing ultra high electromechanical coupling (up to 92%), broad bandwidth, high sensitivity, and decreased impulse response for improved axial resolution.  Using a one dimensional model, bandwidths of up to 130% have been realized.  A direct comparison between an optimally designed single crystal relaxor PT composite transducer and an optimally designed PZT composite transducer will be made to demonstrate this performance enhancement.   This Phase I research will provide a basis for further transducer optimization and cost effective manufacturing of an optimally matched broadband array in Phase II.  A Phase I option for modelling, construction, and testing of an array element  will enhance the development of the Phase II proposal.",

Recent breakthroughs in the design of graded index plastic optical fibers have dramatically increased POF's data transmission rate.  A bandwidth of more than 3 (three) Ghz at 100 meters has been demonstrated.  Fluoropolymers with elevated glass transition temperatures greater than 150 degrees C, addressing the crucial thermal limitation of present POF technology.  Fluoropolymers are also capable of much lower light attenuation compared to hydrogen based polymers with attenuation's down to 60 dB/Km or less, and also can exhibit low moisture absorption.  In addition, this method of obtaining a graded refractive index in the fiber is particularly able to provide enhanced radiation resistance to the fiber.  This program will in addition explore the development of improved coatings which will protect the GIPOF from temperatures of -40 degrees C to +150 degrees C and moisture ingress, and which are tolerant to low earth orbit.",

        "abstract": "The inability to deposit copper directly onto aluminum is a longstanding problem in microelectronic manufacturing.  Presently, aluminum must be coated with a barrier layer such as TiN  to promote copper adhesion and provide good electrical contact between the two metals.  This work will demonstrate a nonaqueous galvanic process for selectively depositing a highly adherent copper coating directly onto aluminum device structures.  The coating, which forms spontaneously at ambient temperature via direct displacement of aluminum, will serve as a base for further copper deposition by sputtering or electroless methods.The direct displacement copper coating process potentially offer a lower cost-of-ownership than sputtered or CVD barrier layer processes since no specialized equipment would be required.  Moreover, application from a liquid bath should improve the ability to deposit copper into deep contact holes and trenches where sputtering or CVD processes often fail.  The required chemicals should pose no exceptional disposal problems within a fab environment and, in principle, should be recyclable to allow further cost savings.The proposed program will be conducted in conjunction with the University of Missouri-rolla where the nonaqueous direct displacement process was initially developed to supplement solvent extraction techniques for the reclamation of heavy metals.",

The micro-manipulator will provide users tactile sensing through coupling to a force-reflecting haptic interface.  The system applies advanced techniques in robotics engineering and sensory feedback developed in the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Telepresence surgery in the far-forward battlefield and other remote settings requires a compact, transportable dexterous telemanipulator providing precise tactile feedback to the operator.  The BRS laparoscopic telemanipulator meets these requirements and will permit triage and stabilization of casualties while minimizing logistical support needed for deployment.  Enhanced dexterity and tactile feedback will make endoscopic surgery in hospital settings faster, safer and open new procedures to minimal access intervention.  The Phase I effort will design and prototype a telerobotic micro-manipulator and positioner with 7 degrees-of-freedom capable of laparoscopic intervention through a 5mm trocar port, actuated via computer controlled servo-motors.  The end-effectors will contain microsensors providing force-feedback to the user.  In Phase II, this design platform will be expanded by increasing sensor number, type and configuration and, integrating the device with software-driven control mechanics, providing algorithms for motion scaling and overcoming latency/lag problems.",

        "abstract": "Low power electrostatic thrusters are greatly penalized by the lack of small efficient cathodes.  Conventional hollow cathodes are relatively large and consume power and propellant at a rate approaching that required by the small thruster, thus greatly reducing the overall efficiency and Isp.  An attractive alternative to the hollow cathodes (which are thermionic emitters) are field emission array (FEA) cathodes.  These do not require propellant or a heater and operate at low power.  Many FEA cathodes can be considered including the original metal based Spindt cathode, diamond like carbon (DLC) and diamond based cathodes.  Most recently, CVD diamond film emitters have demonstrated promising performance.  Therefore, the development of a diamond film cathode will be the focus of our effort.In Phase I we will deposit various nitrogen doped CVD diamond films on silicon substrates and characterize them using SEM and the Rutherford back-scattering technique to determine their morphology and nitrogen content.  Selected samples will be incorporated into an electron emission test fixture and their voltage-current characteristic will be measured as a function of the vacuum tank environment (Ar, Xe) and pressure.  The effort will be carried out in cooperation with ASTeX Inc. under subcontract to Busek.  ASTeX has demonstrated expertise in CVD diamond deposition.In Phase II, diamond cathodes suitable for operation with electrostatic thrusters will be constructed and tested on an existing low power Hall thruster.",

        "abstract": "Hall thrusters typically operate at 50% efficiency, 1600 sec specific impulse and have a proven track record on Russion satellites.  Despite this impressive performance there are several areas in which Hall thruster improvements are possible.  The propsed effort will focus on two such areas (1) thrust density (thrust per unit frontal area of the engine) which at present decreases with increasing thruster size and (2) efficiency improvements, that are possible across the spectrum of Hall thruster sizes, by controlling VB drifts.  These improvements will be realized by modification of the conventional Hall thruster geometry.  Other potential benefits include lower erosion rate of the discharge chamber (translating into longer life), diminshed beam divergence, better management of spacecraft communication interference by the ion beam and possibly easier spacecraft/thruster integration.In Phase I, the novel Hall thruster will be designed, constructed and tested.  The thruster size selected for this demonstration is 1.5kW making it directly comparable to the SPT 100.  Testing will include measurement of thrust as a function of propellant flow, applied magnetic filed and power input to yield Isp and efficiency performance map.In Phase II, a near flight weight prototype will be demonstrated.",

A radical advance in the practicality and efficiency of CSE as an integral component of an overall system development process is an essential breakthrough.  This proposal outlines a unique approach to address this problem through the development of an intelligent tools suite to support CSE--aprinciple driven approach to the analysis and design of complex human-machine systems.  In Phase I, we will use an integrated, design-centered, process-based approach to the review, systhesis, assessment, and evaluation of CSE methods, tools, and appropriate computer technologies applicable to the general information warfare domain.  Having a robust, comprehensive process model framework is critical to the success of the literature review in order to provide an organizing framework for the findings.  A successful Phase I effort, based on our integrated, process-based approach to the synthesis and evaluation of current CSE methods and tooks, is expected to provide an excellent framework for:  .  consolidating the variety of methodological approaches to CSE,  .  defining a baseline CSE tool suite based on an integrated set of current methods and tools,  .  highlighting critical gaps and needs in the development of a comprehensive, full life cycle CSE suite.",

        "abstract": "As identified in the SBIR announcement, virtual environment technologyhas found widespread use in the military in applications related to the recreation of a photo realistic display.  The SBIR announcement further recognizes that a significant need exists for aids in developing skills for managing complex situations which are best addressed at a more abstract level.  The current proposal seeks to address this need by adapting human immersion concepts and virtual environment technology normally associated with real world display to the more subtle requirements of complex mission management rehearsal.  By allowing a trainee to view, navigate, and interact with an abstract virtual world, more substantial information regarding the subject matter can be imparted.   The proposed effort has 2 technical objectives.  The first is the identification of requirements inherent in using commercial off the shelf (COTS) hardware and software that will allow for the development of a military and non-military immersed virtual environment mission rehearsal system.  The second is the establishment of functional system specifications and recommendations for specific COTS hardware and software.  Performance of the proposed program will serve as a necessary step toward the development of a protype mission rehearsal system.  CASDE experience in the practical aspects fo military modeling, simulation, and virtual environments, supplemented by the extensive computer science expertise of Professor James Hahn of George Washington University, will ensure a thorough and successful completion of the proposed study.  Completion of the proposed program will form the initial step in development of an immersed virtual reality based system for complex mission rehearsal.  The primary military benefit of such a system is anticipated to be a revolutionary breakthrough in techniques for system management training.  In particular, the application of immersed virtual reality to an abstract virtual environment is expected to significantly aid in imparting a higher level of conceptual understanding.  Both warfighting and peace time benefits are to be expected.",

        "abstract": "Currently, thermal spray (flame and plasma spray) is the only single step method of applying most metal and non-oxide ceramic coatings to large objects. These coatings are usually of a low quality, and thin films cannot be applied. An in situ deposition technique that inexpensively and easily applies nitrides, carbides and other non-oxide thin or thick films in an environmentally friendly manner is a priority for any number of commercial applications.  Combustion chemical vapor deposition (CCVDsm) as invented by the principal investigator and president of MicroCoating Technologies (MCT), is a low cost, high quality deposition technique that permits the deposition of many oxygen stable materials. CVD quality films of numerous materials have been produced via CCVD in the open atmosphere without a furnace or reaction chamber, but the process is generally limited to the deposition of oxides and noble metals. A new method, termed RECVD, has been conceived that allows for the deposition of carbides, nitrides and elemental coatings in the open atmosphere. Conventional CVD uses expensive, high vapor pressure precursors to deposit these materials. In contrast, RECVD, using MCT technology developed for CCVD processing, can utilize inexpensive, environmentally safe precursors since the vapor pressure of the precursors is not a considerable concern.  Low cost, production friendly RECVD will be demonstrated for the first time during Phase 1. Cr. A1N. B4C, BN, SiC, Si3N4. TiB2, TiN, TiC and Ti will be thermodynamically studied for processing, and then the capability to deposit three of these materials will be experimentally tested. This proposal will demonstrate the capability to inexpensively deposit quality metal and non-oxide ceramic thin films that cannot currently be deposited under ambient conditions.  Low cost, high quality coatings that can be applied over large areas are desired for wear, strength, chemical, electrical and thermal applications. The possible commercial applications are almost as large as the thin film metal and ceramic coatings field. Numerous companies have met with MCT and are excited about non-oxide CVD coatings applied in situ. A letter from General Electric, stating their into",

This instrument will allow practitioners to perform PCR reactions 5-10 times faster than almost all commercial instruments (i.e., 30 PCR cycles in as little as 15 minutes).  It will also perform real-time fluorescence detection of up to four separate DNA targets, avoiding post-amplification verification of products (such as electrophoresis) , further decreasing the time of analysis. Phase I will provide the requisite analysis and engineering design for the extension of a previously proven portable prototype thermal cycling instrument into a commercial product.  Due to existing interest by third party investors, including diagnostic and life science research product companies, and financial institutions; Cepheid anticipates being able to participate in a Fast Track program.  During Phase II, Cepheid will integrate the separate computer controller with the analytical thermal cycling instrument into a single hand-held package, suitable for high volume production.  The Phase II product represents a significant step toward Cepheid's vision of a powerful, portable DNA diagnostic instrument capable of receiving raw samples, such as whole blood, extracting and purifying target nucleic acids (DNA and/or RNA), performing amplification, and identifying and quantifying target organisms or sequences.  BENEFITS:  Instruments based on this approach could be used in biowarfare and medical defense applications, and for rapidly diagnosing diseases (and disease vectors) in the field. Commercial versions will have diverse applications such as identifying infected or contaminated livestock, food, water supplies, and infectious disease diagnostics in the doctor's office or the emergency room.

First, polycrystalline ceramic bodies which have a narrow distribution of fine grains, a grain size less than a few micrometers and near theoretical density must be obtained.

Recognizing that early vision does not accept symbolic top-down inputs because it does not have the capability to process symbolic data, we will implement the top-down effects as a modulation of various visual functions by changing the values of the free parameters of those functions (such as parameters for relative weighting of processing channels).  A limited software prototype will be implemented to demonstrate model feasibility, to be followed up in Phase II with a full scale implementation and validation through psychophysics experiments.  The proposed model enables the development of design tools that predict the impact of new designs on operator/system performance, before expensive real-time operator-in-the-loop simulation studies are conducted.

The Case-Based Reasoning Tool for Command and Control Warfare Strategy Development consists of four main modules: 1) the Knowledge Elicitation (KE) Module uses personality and individual trait instruments to determine the personality and cognitive styles of key military leaders; 2) the Decision-Making Library maps specific decision making styles to the cognitive styles identified by the KE Module; 3) the Command and Control Characterization Module characterizes C2 nodes and C2 links as a function of information infrastructure given a particular country or region; and 4) the Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) Module determines C2 vulnerabilities as a function of C2 characterization and decision-making style.  We propose graphic representations of C2 vulnerability for enhanced understanding and visualization of the Information Battle Space.  Following the demonstration, we will evaluate the concept's potential for full-scope development.

We plan to use a hierarchial concent that builds large formation tactics from small conventional fighting units, to provide a straightforward development path for large group tactics development, while ensuring that we deal with tactics that are compatible with how fighter pilots learn and implement their techniques.  We propose a five-task development effort, consisting of:  1) problem scope and requirements definition; 2) development of ACTOGA software libraries and performance measures; 3) integration of ACTOGA prototype with MIL-AASPEM; 4) demonstartion of system performance; and 5) requirements specification for full-scope implementation and commercialization.",

        "abstract": "The management and dissemination of Inboard and offboard information and the associated situation assessment of the tactical picture and determination of the associated response is a major task for Air Force personnel. Significant effort has been made in countering this challenge with advances in sensor capabilities. enhancements in onboard avionics, and combined intra and inter service command, control, and communications. This rapid evolution must be met with concomitant advance in fusing information from disparate sources and providing the capability to detect, track, classify, and engage targets and provide timely assessment of the situation.  Additionally, a rapid and verifiable means is needed in situ for the control and management of sensor and information assets. Here, we propose to develop an Intelligent Fusion and Asset Management Processor (IFAMP) for enhancing tactical awareness for Air Force command and control. The innovation here is the incorporation of two synergistic technologies: the embedded knowledge, human like reasoning, and incorporation of ambiguous information of fuzzy logic; and the situation assessment and diagnostic and inferential reasoning capabilities of belief networks. Specifically, the IFAMP incorporates the following components: a fuzzy logic low level fusion manager, fuzzy logic event detection, belief networks for situation assessment, and a fuzzy based asset management component.",

The development of smaller and stronger permanent magnets will allow the construction of smaller devices that consume less energy.  The discovery of rare earth iron nitride magnetic materials has brought about a worldwide search for other materials that offer improved magnetic properties, such as high magnetization, anisotropic fields, and coercivity.  These permanent magnets can be used at high temperature due to their high thermal conductivity.  However, these materials are not stable at temperatures higher than 600oC.  Thus, sintered permanent magnet cannot be produced using current technologies.  Another problem is that the magnetic properties of these materials degrade with time.  If these two problem can be solved, small lightweight devices can then be fabricated from these materials.  In Phase I, sol-gel technology will be used to synthesize these high- performance permanent magnets.  The advantages of sol-gel technology include excellent control of stoichiometry of precursor solutions, direct fabrication of nitride, low sintering temperature, homogeneity of the materials and fine grain structure, low cost, and simple and inexpensive equipment.  In Phase II, the production line will be scaled up, and these high-performance permanent magnets will be commercialized.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The annual market for permanent magnetic materials alone is approximately $3 billion per year and growing steadily.  Permanent magnetic materials play a significant role in a variety of technologies ranging from magnetic data storage devices to large electrical motors.  Using sol-gel technology, rare earth iron nitride powder and sintered magnetic materials can be fabricated with high quality and low cost.  Applications include computer peripherals, printers, actuators, spin imagers, guided wave pipes, bearings, and acoustic devices.  In a full-sized family car alone, there are about 20-30 devices that use permanent magnets.\n_",

        "abstract": "In this proposal, we plan to synthesize a novel, new, UV-curable and fluorinated polymer using fluoronation and sol-gel process. This polymer has been proven to be a good replacement for spin-on glass (SOG). This polymer can be converted to a highly porous organic/inorganic composite at relatively low process temperature by controlling heat treatment temperatures, atmospheres and the sequence. This highly porous Quorinated organic/inorganic composite can be expected to have much lower dielectric constant. By using this family of polymers with different chemical composition to create more excess carbon and organics for burn-off, more than SC% porosity with extremely low dielectric constant (< 2 ) can be expected. Due to the organic/inorganic nature of this composite, excellent mechanical strength and high temperature stability can be expected even for that with more than 50% porosity. Conventional or advance lithography (such as electrons ions, X-ray) can be used to pattern this polymer films. No photoresists and related chemicals is needed, and no complicate etching process either. The washout polymer solutions can be recycled for further application. Therefore, this sol-gel polymer process of highly porous, fluorinated organic/inorganic composite films for low-k IMD applications will not only be with excellent material performance, ultra-low-cost, simple, high throughput, but also environmentally benign.  This low-k composite films can be integrated into many microelectronic devices. This sol-gel process for direct-patterning lo v-k IMD will minimize or eliminate many existing microelectronic process. The chemicals for microelectronic processing and the waste that produced from these processes can also be minimized.",

These technologies have enabled the creation of high-throughput facilities; not only in academic and government laboratories but also in commercial production environments. More robust workflow-based laboratory automation and information management systems are needed to direct, track, and monitor the work.  This project will develop a novel, effective, and flexible, workflow-based laboratory information management system which is critical to the success of these high-throughput, rapidly-changing environments.\nThe system will be three-tiered, workflow-based, and will allow a designer with minimum computing abilities to quickly formulate or reconfigure a workflow design using an interactive, graphic modeling tool.  The Phase I goals include the development of a robust workflow data model, a workflow specification language, and a prototype workflow execution engine.  Phase II will focus on graphical design tools and automatic system creation and reconfiguration tools.\n     \nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This project would result in a commercial tool for building workflow-based laboratory information management systems.  A large market exists for such a tool within the domain of high-throughput facilities for sequencing, genotyping, and genetic diagnostics.\n_",

High throughput molecular biological enterprises critically depend on the cost-effective management of complex laboratory workflow.  Existing laboratory information management systems (LIMSs) record the physical object status and workflow progress, but were not designed to model and plan the specification, design and performance of the workflow itself.  Thus existing LIMSs focus on current and historical laboratory data, and do not represent the means by which that data was collected, nor alternative strategies for future data collection and analysis.   This project will enhance a commercial LIMS to model laboratory processes, workflow configuration and capital resources, both actual and hypothetical.  This will enable queries to be posed which monitor, analyze, and aid productivity optimization.  Future workflow progress will be estimated by a simulator driven by current LIMS database contents, historical observation (e.g., of resource failure rates), and resource deployment plans.  The simulator will be integrated with a sophisticated LIMS being developed for sequencing, genotyping, and genetic diagnostics.  New capabilities will include statistical reduction of past laboratory performance to tune independent variables for simulation input; background projection of production yields at specified time horizons, with advance \nalarms of inadequate progress;  and analysis of future resource allocation plans by applying \u00bfwhat-if\u00bf scenarios to live production data.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  It is anticipated that the simulator would initially be targeted at biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that are involved in genotyping and genetic analysis.  The simulator package would also be marketed to any group that is involved in clinical genetics and human molecular genetics.\n_",

In some cases, over- or under-reliance can lead to catastrophe.  The primary objectives of the proposed Phase I work are (1) to develop a systematic general framework for training users of decision aids, with particular attention to the role of facilitating accurate and useful assessments of trust, and (2) to develop methods for measuring the benefits of such training, and of decision aid use in general, for workload and situation assessment.  CTI's proposed work falls into four tasks.  We will: (1) develop a framework for identifying the training requirements imposed by decision aid use, as a function of the aided function, the automation style, decision aiding features, and user experience: (2) identify specific training techniques that will address the requirements of decision aid use; (3) develop robust and valid measures of situation awareness and workload suitable for testing the effects of training and decision aid use; and (4) identify a specific decision aiding system and application domain in which the framework, training methods, and measures can be tested.  The proposed training requirements framework, training methods, and measures will find promising markets in a variety of military, civilian, and non-governmental domains where decision aids are being introduced.

The LADAR operates at an eyesafe solid-state wavelength in order to achieve a compact, rugged design capable of stand-off ranges of 20 km or more.   Simultaneous precision range, Doppler and micro-Doppler target signatures are extracted with an extremely efficient processing architecture.  Range resolution of one foot with simultaneous velocity precision better than 1 mm/sec are expected.  Target ID can be performed with such imagery to a relatively high degree of fidelity because of the inherent spatial scale information that it provides.  Additional target pixels can be accessed through the vibration signature that can be produced with the base waveform and its higher order variants.  The novel coherent LADAR is proposed rather than a conventional direct detection LADAR as the former provides significant payoffs in sensitivity at long ranges, used lowpower transmitters, and can access both range and vibration signature discriminants.  The Phase I program will examine several Air Force scenarios of mutation and associated processing of the general pulse format for the scenario in question.  The range and Doppler processing algorithms will be evaluated relative to their potential for on-chip implementation in 8x8 to 32x32 pixel arrays for flood illumination imaging.  A preliminary sensor design, incorporating imaging array concepts, will be established for development and demonstration in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Nonlinear optical frequency converters for lasers are impacting a variety of systems including weapons fire control, active beacon adaptive optics, target designation, range finding, and active multispectral imaging ladar.  Most next-generation systems require frequency agile transmitters with improved power scaling.  For example, there are currently few high average power (1 to 20 kW) frequency converters suitable for industry, remote sensing or military applications.  Traditional frequency converters, such as Optical Parametric Oscillators (OPOs), require costly, fragile crystals which typically cannot be grown in sufficient size or quality to operate at high average power.  On the other hand, Solid State Raman Scattering (SSRS) offers unexploited advantages for higher power operation, including:  (1) no birefringent phase matching to limit power scaling, (2) lower cost, larger, higher optical quality crystals with superior thermal and mechanical properties, and (3) the ability to produce phase conjugation and other forms of beam cleanup.  Coherent Technologies, Inc. (CTI) is developing innovative SSRS frequency converters with new crystals.  Coupling the new technologies with CTI's expertise in turnkey field and flight-worthy electro-optics systems will facilitate new dual-use products.

Preliminary emphasis is on upgrades that will improve the ability to analyze combustion processes in the secondary combustion chamber of ducted rocket engines (DRE).  This will involve inclusion of heterogeneous surface-burn particulate combustion models into CRAFT which have nonequilibrium gas/particle interactions and interactive kinetics, competing with the nonequilibrium gas phase kinetics for reactants.  Both Lagrangian and Eulerian particulate frameworks will be incorporated.  Emphasis will be on heterogeneous carbon kinetics and metallic oxide kinetics whereby the oxidizer shell surrounding unburnt metals (Al, Zr, B, ...) can melt in combustion zones permitting further heat release downstream.  The three-phase combustion framework formulated will serve as a stepping stone to extending this methodology into the primary chamber and analyzing detailed grain surface layer burning.  This work takes very recent technology developed for gun propulsion and for metallic explosives and casts it into a framework for analyzing three-phase combustive processes in tactical missile propulsive systems.  The synergism of analyzing all such processes in the same computational framework is of great benefit to the government.

Phillips, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG03-97ER82353\nAmount:  $75,000\nAmong the various alternative fuels proposed for energy-efficient engines in heavy-duty vehicles (delivery vans, buses, and tractor trailers), natural gas has the greatest potential to achieve very high efficiency and low emissions.  The preferred on-board storage system is liquified natural gas.  Problems may occur when a diesel engine that has been optimized for fuel economy and low emissions for a particular composition of natural gas is fueled with a different composition of natural gas.  There is a clear need for low-cost sensors in the vehicle to determine the composition of the natural gas fuel.   The Phase I project will evaluate the potential for using sound propagating through fuel to determine the gas composition; this will be the basis for developing an acoustic instrument to measure the concentration of  individual constituents of natural gas and its combustion properties.  Phase II research and development will culminate with the testing of a prototype sensor onboard a vehicle.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Using sound to measure the composition and quality of the liquified natural gas fuel will lead to the development of an off-the-shelf sensor that can be located in the electronic control module of the engine.  The sensor would allow the engine to operate much more efficiently and have better fuel economy, reduced exhaust emissions, and better reliability and durability.\n\n_",

        "abstract": "Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is a retrovirus that causes a chronic infection in horses.  In theabsence of a vaccine, the control of this disease depends on the diagnosis and elimination of infectedhorses.  Currently approved diagnostic procedures utilize agar gel diffusion (AGID), or enzyme-linkedimmunosorbant (ELISA) methodologies to detect antibodies against the virus in horse sera as evidenceof infection.  Although the AGID procedure has been the industry standard, it is inherently lesssensitive, much slower, and subject to considerable variation in interpretation, when compared toELISA methods.  Current ELISA methods utilize either a direct sandwich procedure based on asynthetic peptide corresponding to a region of the small envelope glycoprotein, or an antibodycompetition format utilizing monoclonal antibodies directed against the major core protein (p-26) of thevirus.  In either case, a single antigen is used.  The major problem with the current ELISA assays is theobservation that each misses some positive samples.  In addition, the competition ELISA is prone tofalse positives.  This project is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of combining recombinant proteinmethodology, synthetic peptides, and a novel conjugation procedure to make a rapid, sensitive, andspecific diagnostic test for this important viral pathogen of horses.",

        "abstract": "Lean burn spark engines are a promising technique to further reduce both NOx and hydrocarbon/carbon monoxide (HC/CO) engine emissions.  Higher lean burn levels improve HC/CO oxidation while simultaneously reducing NOx formation.  The NOx reduction is due to cooler flame temperatures.  While the lean burn limit (beyond which combustion is poor) restricts further emission reductions, the use of oxygen enriched air (OEA) significantly extends the lean burn limit and further reduces emissions.  To date, no compact supply of OEA has been available to extend the lean burn limit.  Compact Membrane Systems, Inc., has developed high gas flux OEA membranes with 30 times the productivity of existing membranes.  This allows compact portable OEA systems to extend automobile lean burn limits and further reduce NOx/HC/CO emissions.  In Phase I, feasibility of the membranes will be demonstrated on a small (5-10 hp) engine.  The goal of the project is a 40% reduction in NOx and a 15% reduction in HC emissions.",

Additional cost avoidance and quality gains are the result of transitioning the \"lessons learned,\" and test maturity gained during manufacturing in-process and system acceptance (sell-off) testing to the maintenance environment. This study investigates the feasibility of exploiting common ATS hardware and software architecture/interfaces to meet both factory and field maiantenance test requirements. The study considers the utilization of computer-aided design, manufacturing and engineering (CAD/CAM/CAE) test information, commercially developed test technologies, and DoD ATS commercial equivalents integrated into a test requirements capture/creation framework. The strategy for the study includes looking into the test engineering business processes within an actual avionics developer and application of the draft ABBET standards and other applicable test engineering standards. A conceptual system definition for a prototype framework and work plan for its development are part of the study report. Anticipated Benefits: The concept of implementing a framework which integrated and enables better utilization of CAD/CAM/CAE test information to generate ATE applications which support both factory and field testing, can enhance the competitiveness of any defense electronics firm. The concept is also applicable to any electronic equipment manufacturer in the aerospace, automotive and other commercial sectors.",

        "abstract": "The United States Navy has numerous projectiles/munitions loaded with explosives such as Explosive D, which present problems with demilitarization. Explosive D which has been pressed into and removed from projectiles or other ammunitions is much more sensitive than new or unused material.  Therefore, reclaimed material should not be pressed or loaded into ammunition items until it has been recrystallized.  Apart from recrystallization cost, removal from the Projectiles Or ammunition could be risky because of the sensitivity changes due to aging.  Therefore, there is a need to develop a safe and cost effective technology which would convert Explosive D into commercially usable product in an environmentally acceptable manner. Conducting Materials Corp. (CMC) has developed a cost effective microwave technology known as \"Microwave Induced Rotational Excitation Technology\" (MIRET).  This technology can convert high explosives like HMX, RDX, TNT into commercial products.  An attractive attribute of this technology is that it can selectively decompose one high explosive in the presence of other constituents.  Additionally since metal does not absorb microwaves MIRET can be employed to decompose a desired high explosive such as Explosive D, in situ, without it being removed from the projectile or munitions.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an improved bucket design that will revolutionize the approach to fire suppression.  Helicopters now use slung buckets to deliver water, retardants and foam to fire sites.  The urgency of time (fire control lines must be established before the fire overruns them) and the need for expensive equipment (helicopters typically cost $20 million and rent for $5,000 per hour) demand that rapid -- and controllable -- technologies be used.  Unfortunately, current bucket technology does not have any means to control the release of material delivered, except by varying the speed and height of the aircraft.  With the smart bucket design proposed herein, the pilot simply selects the coverage level and volume of the material to be deposited.  A system controller then opens the bucket valve on command and varies its position to provide uniform flow rate and deposition.  More strategic use of the bucket contents will then occur.  Instrument inputs for wind speed, ground speed, acceleration and release height will be used to adjust valve position to obtain the desired coverage level under the helicopter and downwind of its flight path.  When installed, this system will reduce operational costs, increase pilot safety, and save millions of dollars in resources (life and property) by putting down reliable fire control lines and/or extinguish the fire more quickly.",

These functions are presently performed electronically at low speed and require converting the optical data to an electrical signal. Our device is a novel hybrid of LiNbO3 Mach-Zhender interferometer and SOAs. The device uses the nonlinear phase shift associated with SOAs to make a general purpose, all-optical logic gate operating in the 1550 nm band with speeds exceeding 10 Gbps. This device can be used to duplicate optical data from one wavelength to another, or to make a bit-by-bit NOT-XOR operation between two optical signals.  In Phase I CoreTek will demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by constructing the device from in-house components. In Phase II, various components of the multipurpose device will be integrated on a single chip, and the various modes of operation demonstrated.  CoreTek's multipurpose SOA-based component can be used in WDM networks as a wavelength converter or as an all-optical data regenerator. It can also be used in its header recognition function in the front-end decision circuit for cross-connect systems as well as in nodes of fiber-optic self-routed networks and optical computer interconnects. Because of its transparency to bit-rate and wide wavelength range of operation, it can be implemented in local and wide-area network nodes of various traffic speeds.",

        "abstract": "CSA Engineering, Inc., and its team partner, Pratt and Whitney, propose to develop and validate a design methodology for using Multi-Particle Impact Damping (MPID) in high temperature applications.  Research work has indicated that multi-particle impact dampimg (also referred to as \"particle damping\") could be a viable option for extreme temperature applications.  However, to date, the lack of a robust design methodology that includes both MPID material characterization testing and an analytical method based on test has limited MPID usage to \"trial-and-error\" applications.  The innovtion of this proposal is a focused research effort that will develop a complete design methodology for MPID.  This effort will develop a MPID material characterization test procedure to enhance the understanding of the damping mechanisms and obtain MPID damping properties.  Further, an analytical method will be developed that uses the material characterization data todesign damping into structural systrms using MPID.  This complete design methodology will be validated in \"proof-of-methodology\" testing on a structural component in the Phase I program.

        "abstract": "Avionics are hardmounted in today's launch vehicles (LVs) to conduct internally generated heat away from the electronics, but this causes a high vibration environment for the avionics.  One LV manufacturer attributed a mission failure in 1996 to avionics damage introduced by excessive vibration.  Current technology isolators block heat conduction due to material and physical design constraints.  New approaches to designing conductive isolators are proposed.  Conductive loading of viscoelastic polymers, thermal shunt designs, and shape memory alloys are all proposed as innovative concepts to improve conductivity in isolation designs.  Loading of a viscoelastic is a procedure where either a metal or another compound is suspended in the material.  Loaded materials are commonly sold in the electronics industry for increased thermal and electric conductivity.  However, no manufacturer has developed elastomeric isolation components with these compounds.  Thermal conductive shunts are also proposed.  They could increase conductivity with little change to the mechanical properties of isolators.  Shape memory alloy concepts are also proposed.  These elements offer unique nonlinear performance and temperature insensitivity.  Phase I efforts would examine the performance offered by each, and test two of the best designs at the brassboard level.  Phase II would demonstrate isolation and conduction performance for a simulated avionics payload.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract).  Dense genetic linkage maps enable the identification of causative genes for genetic disease.  Using these maps to genetically localize even one disorder on the genome requires hundreds of thousands of genotyping experiments.  This genotyping process has been automated through the use of PCR-based microsatellite markers, automated DNA sequencers, robotic handling, and computer analysis.  However, the microsatellite markers produce an intrinsic PCR stutter artifact that has thus far precluded full genotyping automation. Recently computational methods have been developed that overcome this key molecular biology bottleneck.  The applicants software system automatically transforms DNA sequencer data files into genotypes.  Limited empirical testing of such software system on DNA sequencer data has produced genotypes at a low error rate.  These initial results suggest that further testing and validation may establish the feasibility of this computational approach.  If ultimately successful, the methods described may help advance the accurate and rapid localization of genes within the human genome. This application focuses on determining the feasibility of (1) automated microsatellite genotyping with low error on data from automated DNA sequencers and (2) automated microsatellite genotyping using pooled DNA material. $ = TOTAL AWARD AMTS & NOT LIMITED TO PORTION OF PROJECT RELATED TO SUBJECT OF SEARCH SUBPROJECT $ = TOTAL AWARD AMOUNT DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF SUBPROJECTS SOURCE:  CRISP  FORMAT F    FY 97      LAST UPDATE 04-07-98 1QUERY 1536                        ID SEARCH 06/01/98   PAGE    390 --PROJECT NUMBER......1 R43 HG01589-01A1               INVESTIGATOR NAME/ADDRESS FY  97    SCHMUKLER, ROBERT E IRG/INTRAMURAL UNIT..ZRG7                             PORE SQUARED BIOENGINEERING AWARD AMOUNT.........   $100,000                      13905 VISTA DR ROCKVILLE, MD 20853-2612 PERFORMING ORGANIZATION: PORE SQUARED BIOENGINEERING TITLE   LOW VOLTAGE ELECTROPORATION FOR GENE TRANSFER ABSTRACT: DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): The objective of the proposed research is to evaluate the gene transfer efficiency of a new method of electroporating cells, using low voltage (< 20V) waveforms, under physiologic conditions.  The new method relies upon the unique structure and geometry resulting from embedding living cells into the holes of thin (10 um) insulating films (track-etched filters).  This preparation is analogous to a multi-parallel-whole-cell-patch-clamp preparation.  A third of a million cells are simultaneously embedded into the film holes and electroporated.  The resistive seal around each cell of between 65-70 MQ serves to amplify the field strength across the film, by 1000X.  This method allows electroporation to be carried out, while minimizing deleterious effects from joule heating and electrochemical products.  One advantage is that only a single side of the cell membrane is porated, due to the asymmetric cellular geometry of the embedded cells.  The ability of this new method to produce electroporation with 95-99% cell viability has already been demonstrated in a pilot study, Gene transfer efficiency will be determined by transfecting the B- Galactosidase gene into mammalian COS-7 monkey cells.  The specific aim of the proposed research is to determine the gene transfer efficiency for this new method. $ = TOTAL AWARD AMTS & NOT LIMITED TO PORTION OF PROJECT RELATED TO SUBJECT OF SEARCH SUBPROJECT $ = TOTAL AWARD AMOUNT DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF SUBPROJECTS SOURCE:  CRISP  FORMAT F    FY 97      LAST UPDATE 04-07-98 1QUERY 1536                        ID SEARCH 06/01/98   PAGE    391 --PROJECT NUMBER......1 R43 HG01597-01                 INVESTIGATOR NAME/ADDRESS FY  97    SCHULTZ, SHELDON IRG/INTRAMURAL UNIT..ZRG2                             SEASHELL TECHNOLOGY AWARD AMOUNT.........    $99,750                      9265 DOWDY DRIVE, SUITE 105 SAN DIEGO, CA  92126 PERFORMING ORGANIZATION: SEASHELL TECHNOLOGY, LLC TITLE   NEW TECHNIQUE FOR HIGH RESOLUTION MAPPING OF DNA ABSTRACT: DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract).

TITLE   GRAPHIC INTERFACE AND PROTOCOLS FOR GENOMIC DISPLAYS ABSTRACT: A growing need for graphically displaying and accessing genetic sequence information has been generated by the large (and increasingly larger) quantity of sequence data available to researchers.  Despite this need, there are no generally acceptable standards for encoding and transmitting graphic display parameters (i.e., how to display a sequence and which features to highlight).  MapKit (TopoGEN software) has been rated the best sequence mapping software of 1996 by Biotechnology Software and Internet Journal.  On the Windows/PC platform, MapKit accomplishes the goals of graphically representing a broad range of sequence features and providing a local server that can interact with other applications to display and select sequence features.  The purpose of this SBIR is to enable the development of a public domain standard that supports distributed data processing and is platform independent, i.e., a graphic sequence feature representation protocol that may be transmitted over the Internet and implemented on any computer system (Macintosh, Unix-based, etc.).  The specific aims of the SBIR include developing the protocol, defining display and access standards for sequence viewers, creating as a prototype a public domain sequence viewer for the Windows/PC platform, creating a web site to support the project, and using the web site to distribute the protocol description and Windows software to users (genetics researchers, molecular biologists, etc.), software developers, and database managers.",

The high demand for blood and blood components in the civilian and military populations, coupled with the growing risk of blood-borne infectious diseases, necessitates the evaluation of high-throughput strategies for generating safe alternatives to donor-derived blood.  Preliminary work has shown that Cellfoam devices are capable of maintaining the immature HPC phenotype in the absence of co-cultured stromal cells or supplemented cytokines, and that CD34+ HPCs in short-term Cellfoam cultures retain the multipotent ability to produce myeloid, lymphoid and erythroid progency. These unique capabilities will be exploited in Phase I to evaluate the ability of Cellfoam to support the survival of both immature and lineage committed HPCs, and to facilitate their targeted differentiation in the presence of selected exogenous cytokines into erythroid, myeloid and platelet lineages.

A high ash content lowers the digestibility ofthe feed, and the indigestible fraction, in particular phosphorous, creates an effluent dischargeproblem.Several screening technologies have been developed for reducing the ash content.  However, theefficiencies of these processes are limited due to similarities in particle size.  The proposed air-separation will sort based on particle size, density, surface roughness and particle shape.  Themeat particles will have a lower density, more irregular surfaces, and a shape resulting in ahigher drag coefficient than bone particles thereby promoting separation efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Danya International, Inc. proposes to design and develop an automated, multimedia system for the vocational rehabilitation of recovering drug and alcohol abusers who have little employment experience. The system, called the Vocational Rehabilitation Job Opportunity Enhancer, or VR4-JOE, will consist of software on a set of CD-ROMs, and an accompanying manual for substance abuse counselors. VR4-JOE will help clients in substance abuse treatment programs to: assess their own specific work-related skills, attitudes and interests; make appropriate choices about schooling and employment; prepare resumes that deal with gaps in their work histories and other problems; rehearse job interview skills, including the skills for handling difficult questions about their employment and medical histories; and rehearse techniques for handling work situations, such as interactions with co-workers and supervisors, as well as dealing with potential triggers for relapse. During Phase I, an outstanding team of vocational rehabilitation professionals, drug treatment specialists, and software technicians will develop the design and content of the complete VR-JOE system. During Phase II, the system will be programmed, tested and evaluated in actual use with recovering substance abusers in treatment. During Phase III, with the financial and marketing support of DSA, Inc., the VR-JOE system will be marketed nationally.",

A  tailored, distributed communications network model will be designed and  developed based on known operational and environmental constraints  inherent to the mission of a submarine to assess current and alternative  systems to improve data throughput.  We will replicate the current submarine  communications framework to provide a benchmark system, identifying  communications systems bottlenecks and limitations to throughput.  By  iterating the parametric data structures of the model (e.g., antenna loss, bit  error rates, propagation delays, and link protocols), we are able to conduct a  systems-wide technical modeling, simulation and performance analysis of the  submarine communications network.  From this baseline, system parameters  will be adjusted to optimize channel utilization and maximize data throughput  while maintaining data integrity.  By leveraging commercial, leading edge  advances in antenna design, advanced modulation and coding (source and  channel) schemes and lossless data compression techniques, alternative  communications data links and technologies that have wide commercial  application and availability will be overlaid on the model structure to identify  those approaches that have multi-path application and offer the greatest  potential for throughput improvements.",

In the direct manipulation interface for scenario generation, the person constructing a training scenario would \"point and click\" or \"reach and grab\" components to 1) construct a training scenario and 2) dynamically alter a scenario as it occurred. The first generation DMI scenario development system that we will construct will be based on conventional DMI techniques, such as point and click, and two dimensional representations of the visual information. The second generation DMI scenario generator will incorporate virutal reality technology to permit the scenario designer to \"reach into\" a three-dimensional library of objects and events to view and select them. To construct the scenario using the virtual reality DMI, the scenario developer will place objects and events stored in the libraries of virtual objects and events into the three dimensional virtual space of the training scenario. The objects will be given their behaviors-- trajectories and timing -- by direct manipulation through, for example, a glove that gives the developer the ability to pick up virtual objects. We anticipate that this technology can be integrated into the wide scale distributed simulation systems currently being constructed.",

Concepts to capitalize on the attributes of electric drive and active suspension utilizing swing arm technology are explored and a practical system selected.  The use of independent drive wheels of a hybrid electric drive combined with advanced compressible fluid active suspensions with fuzzy logic controls provide the synergy to achieve greater vehicle performance levels in mobility, speed over varioua terrain and side slopes, and gradeability speed improvement beyond the state of the art.  The project will also investigate the use of a joystick control for the functions of speed, direction, steering, and a chassis attitude and ride height using fuzzy logic in the control system.  By using vehicle attitude control, side slope capability will be enhanced, approaching the 600 requirement.  Constant torque motors provide high gradeability & speeds and series parallel motors provide the speed range capability.  The proposed concept is feasible and has the potential to fulfull the Army's need for a high mobility scout vehicle.  The future need for a high speed, high mobility scout vehicle has already been identified by the military.

        "abstract": "The use of night vision devices (NIVUs) by US Army foot soldiers, aviators, and drivers of combat and tactical wheeled vehicles has enhanced operations at night by allowing increased mobility and potentially safer operations.  With this increased capability in the night environment has come an increased exposure to the hazards of that environment and the risks that the command structure must manage and balance with mission requirements.  Numerous vehicular accidents have occurred during night field exercises involving drivers wearing image intensification (12) systems.  These accidents can frequently be attributed to perceptual problems experienced by the drivers.  Experience has shown that performance with NVDs increases with practice and experience.  However, there is little formal training provided in night driving skills and few opportunities to practice these skills under realistic conditions.  The general objectives of the Phase I effort are to define and demonstrate a low-cost Night Driving Simulator (NDS  concept for training night driving skills with 12 devices and to identify and evaluate the tecniques and resources that are available for implementing this approach.  The results of this effort will lead directly to the development of an NDS Phase II.  System developers are recognizing that night vision systems can aid drivers of commercial vehicies and law enforcement vehicles during poor visibility conditions.  Once these systems are available to the commercial sector, training programs will be required to reinforce formal training and provide recurring training to maintain skill levels.  The NDS developed during the Phase I and Phase II efforts will have direct application in these areas.",

        "abstract": "The use of synthetic data for the generation of target signature templates is a vital element of current and future automatic target recognition systems.  [1] [2]  Although current synthetic signatures closely match their measured counterparts, they suffer from two shortcomings: 1)  susceptibility to model error and 2)  poor representation of signature variance.  The current model validation relies on visual comparisons between the target model and pictures of the target.  This technique could be greatly improved if  individual facets, which were primary contributors to the observed range profile error could be identified.  Such a technique would automate many aspects of the model validation process.  The second shortcoming of the current synthetic signature generation is its poor representation of the nondeterministic characteristics evidenced in measured data.   These effects are crucial in defining accurate variance estimates of the observed measured data.  In order to better represent such nondeterministic effects, ray history information can be used to predict signal variance and increase the accuracy of the classification algorithm.  However, the computational complexity and storage requirements of the current ray history traceback method make its use prohibitive. We propose several techniques to overcome these drawbacks and improve the current synthetic signature estimation and model validation procedures.",

Immunization appears to be the most promising control method, butcommercial vaccines are not readily available.  We have previously developed and tested arecombinant IPNV vaccine in rainbow trout and brook trout fry.   Although the vaccinesignificantly reduced fish mortality, it did not prevent virus infection.  This vaccine has not beentested in Atlantic salmon.  To develop an IPNV vaccine that also prevents the establishment ofthe IPNV carrier state, it is essential that fish immune responses to IPNV are understood.However, there is scant knowledge of fish immunity to viruses.  The final goal of our research isto produce an IPNV vaccine that prevents both fish mortality and infection.  Towards this goal,we propose to immunize Atlantic salmon yearlings with our recombinant IPNV vaccine and anovel naked plasmid DNA vaccine, and then compare the vaccine-induced humoral and cellularimmune responses to those induced by virulent IPNV.  Vaccinated fish will also be challenged togive preliminary data on whether the vaccines prevent the establishment of the carrier state inyearling fish.",

This will allow for stiffened sections to be assembled quickly into structures.    The main goal of the proposed phase I effort will be to provide conceptual designs which can be achieved by pultrusion.   Additionally, a weight and cost analysis for these concepts will be provided.  Coupon samples will be manufactured and  tested in order to obtain essential design data for continued work.

Emphasis is placed on tradeoffs between algorithm efficiency  and performance.  The littoral acoustic environment is characterized by near  and far field targets and dense dynamic near and far field directional  interference at many ranges and levels of stationarity.  Unique applications of  Sub-Aperture Spatial Processing and Parabolic Near Field Wave Front  Approximation techniques are proposed as efficient techniques to reduce  target suppression caused by a mismatch between the Adaptive Beamforming  constraints and the near field acoustic wave front and sensor array shape  estimates.  A third technique uses Synthetic (array data) Covariance Estimates  made from conventional beam spatial spectra for adaptive beamforming  weights computation to provide a fast low throughput weight updating  technique in dynamic signal fields.  The fourth technique provides an  innovative approach for passive target range estimation by using Near Field  Adaptive Beamforming Focused Range Zones.  Theoretic performance  calculations will be made based on  spatial covariance data models that will  incorporate wave front and array shape uncertainties and dynamic source  geometries.  When possible limited amounts of real data will be used.  Signal  processing  gains and processing resource requirements will be tabulated  with the most promising techniques selected for an extensive real data  evaluation in Phase 2.",

Exercise setup times and the number of human operators/instructors, needed to run an exercise, have reduced the number of useful training hours and increased the cost to train.  To combat this situation, a more efficient means for controlling simulation exercises must be established.  The number of simulation applications in use and the lack of consistent configuration and control methodologies require that any control mechanism be readily adaptable to new applications, while providing the instructor/coordinator a consistent interface with a minimal learning curve.  Such a system must be able to accommodate industry standard protocols such as DIS, application specific protocols, and the anticipated next generation protocol.  To develop this interface, a study must be made of existing applications and control mechanisms along with the methods currently employed by instructional personnel.  The results must then be compared with the desired simulation functionality and human resources available to determine what actions can and should be taken to stream line the simulation control methodology and reduce the man loading required to conduct a simulation exercise.",

Kempkes, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-97ER82358\nAmount:  $74,938\nLinear colliders and accelerators used in high energy physics research require both high peak-power pulse modulators and fast opening and reclosing circuit protection devices of considerably higher efficiency than currently available.  Existing vacuum tube-based systems are expensive to build, repair, and operate.  Solid state devices have only recently demonstrated a capability to meet some high power switching requirements, however at power levels well below those desired.\nThis project will address these problems by developing a very high speed, solid state pulse power modulator, building from an innovative insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)-based switch module prototype and existing solid state pulse modulators designs.  These modulators utilize multiple solid state, switching modules configured to achieve a high voltage and current switching capability.  Phase I of this project will design a full-scale solid state system capable of meeting required parameters and will build a working switch module and controller for this high speed, high power pulse modulator.  In parallel, this project will evaluate innovative ways to maximize the efficiency, manufacturability, and cost-effectiveness of such a solid state system.  In Phase II, a full-scale pulse modulator system for demonstration and evaluation will be built.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This project will extend the capabilities of solid state modulators for numerous applications in low power materials processing, semiconductor processing, and medical applications to new areas where faster, higher power switches are required.  In addition to future linear colliders for high energy physics research, applications would include radar systems, X-ray and laser systems, and ion implantation systems.\n\n\n_",

The surface and mass of concrete accomplish the tasks of absorption and storage of energy.  Concrete cannot, however, effectively distribute the stored energy within the building system.  This project intends to overcome this deficiency by improving the directional thermal conductivity of concrete while maintaining its advantages in absorption and storage of solar energy.  The approach adopted in this project involves the construction of a multi-layered preplaced aggregate concrete, where the aggregates in each layer are recycled materials possessing different thermal characteristics suiting the absorption, storage, and distribution tasks in passive solar building designs.  The Phase I research will resolve the processing issues relevant to the production of the new preplaced aggregate concrete system and will validate the advantages of this system in passive solar building designs.

The program will be capable of representing   all pertinent features of multiple shaft gas turbine rotor-bearing   systems, and will include advanced models of magnetic, gas, dry   sleeve, and rolling element bearings.  Results from the program   will include stability, critical speeds, unbalance and transient   response, including nonlinear steady state performance.

This approach offers the capability to temporally scale the laser dynamics and to implement control algorithms based on computationally intensive approaches, such as neural networks.  To facilitate these investigations, a Nonlinear Dynamics Testbed (NDT) will be developed that include real-time displays, a function generator for driving the laser model, an analog control module, PC-based data acquisition, and a digital signal processor (DSP) for implementing and testing sophisticated control algorithms.  The NDT will offer capabilities to generate chaotic oscillations for the laser simulation circuits in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 100 kHz; display real-time information about the array including time series, frequency spectra, phase-space trajectories, and Poincare maps; use analog feedback to bring chaotic systems into periodic orbits; digitize and record multiple system states and control signals simultaneously; and monitor multiple states in the laser simulation circuits and synchronously output control signals generated with the user's algorithms implemented on a DSP.

        "abstract": "Dynetics proposes a combination laser and digital system to produce an innovative Small Arms Target Scoring System (SATSS) for testing of small-caliber munitions.  The SATSS utilizes two orthogonal, large-area, eye-safe laser beams and high-speed, charge-coupled device (CCD) electronics to measure projectile locations.  With the addition of one infrared (IR) screen, the instrument readily provides velocity information and dispersion characteristics.  By design, this instrument is capable of handling a wide range of projectile sizes and velocities in either single-shot or burst-mode operation.  The SATSS is attractive because 1) it is insensitive to environmental issues (temperature. humidity, background light etc.), 2) the instrument is readily applied to multiple scoring applications, and 3) the setup, calibration, and operation of the instrument can be rapidly accomplished by range technicians.  In addition, the SATSS appears to have a production cost consistent with Oehler's system 82 acoustic screens (around $25,000).  In this proposal, details of the instrument are provided along with a Phase I development plan.  The primary goal of our proposed Phase I effort is to perform a series of tests demonstrating the feasibility of producing a deliverable instrument during Phase II.  SATSS will enhance the development and testing of munitions in the tri-Services.  Currently, munition testing methods are sensitive to environmental factors and cannot perform with the new/future types of ammunition.  The proposed instrument uses a flexible technique that is adaptable to many testing scenarios.  By paying strict attention to development cost during Phase I, we believe that the SATSS can be developed into a commercially viable, range product.",

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex inherited disorder that affects children and young adults. Approximately 75,000 patients worldwide suffer from CF.  In CF the mutated gene encodes a defective chloride channel.  The resulting decreased chloride permeability reduces net water secretion increasing mucus viscosity in the lungs, where mucus plugs the airways and leads to infection.  Drugs such as duramycin, targeted to chloride transport, are rational candidates for preventive therapy for CF.  The purpose of this project is to test the ability of duramycin to induce chloride secretion in vivo, using potential difference measurements in the nose of normal and CF patients. $ = TOTAL AWARD AMTS & NOT LIMITED TO PORTION OF PROJECT RELATED TO SUBJECT OF SEARCH SUBPROJECT $ = TOTAL AWARD AMOUNT DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF SUBPROJECTS SOURCE:  CRISP  FORMAT F    FY 97      LAST UPDATE 04-07-98 1QUERY 1536                        ID SEARCH 06/01/98   PAGE    414 --PROJECT NUMBER......1 R43 HL57157-01A1               INVESTIGATOR NAME/ADDRESS FY  97    WALASZEK, ZBIGNIEW IRG/INTRAMURAL UNIT..ZRG2                             BIOCHEMIX, INC AWARD AMOUNT.........   $100,000                      PO BOX 161391 AUSTIN, TX  78746 PERFORMING ORGANIZATION: BIOCHEMIX, INC.

TITLE   TRANSTELEPHONIC MONITORING OF HYPERTENSION IN AFRICAN AMERICANS ABSTRACT: DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from Investigator's Abstract).  In the era of decreasing resources for medical care it is likely that the quality of care, especially to the poor inner-city population, may suffer considerably.  However, in appropriate instances using sophisticated computerized technology, we may be able to reduce the cost of care while improving quality of care.  The purpose of this proposal is to determine the feasibility of long-term monitoring of poorly controlled hypertension in the inner-city African American population using a simple-to-operate transtelephonic physiologic monitoring system.  We hypothesize that close monitoring of blood pressure and body weight in a routine daily basis will allow the care giver to reinforce therapy, improve drug compliance, assess efficacy of treatment, and provide patient education with regard to dietary and other deleterious habits.  The goals of this investigation are to: (1) determine patients' ability to independently operate the home monitoring system; (2) determine patient compliance with a predefined monitoring schedule; (3) determine initial efficacy; (4) measure the cost to operate and maintain a service center which will be devoted to the monitoring and treatment of under-served patient population; and (5) determine the validity of Home Health Monitor data as compared with standard hospital instrumentation at the patient home. $ = TOTAL AWARD AMTS & NOT LIMITED TO PORTION OF PROJECT RELATED TO SUBJECT OF SEARCH SUBPROJECT $ = TOTAL AWARD AMOUNT DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF SUBPROJECTS SOURCE:  CRISP  FORMAT F    FY 97      LAST UPDATE 04-07-98 1QUERY 1536                        ID SEARCH 06/01/98   PAGE    416 --PROJECT NUMBER......1 R43 HL57690-01                 INVESTIGATOR NAME/ADDRESS FY  97    JEWELL, JACK L IRG/INTRAMURAL UNIT..ZRG3                             PICOLIGHT INCORPORATED AWARD AMOUNT.........    $99,939                      4622 SUNSHINE CANYON DR BOULDER, CO  80302 PERFORMING ORGANIZATION: PICOLIGHT, INC. TITLE   ON-AIRWAY--IDEAL SPECTROSCOPIC SENSOR FOR CARBON DIOXIDE ABSTRACT: This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project begins development of the ideal on-airway carbon dioxide respiratory sensor: a spectroscopic sensor based on vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs).  The proposed sensor is sensitive, low cost, fast, small, lightweight, low power, eye-safe, reliable, and requires no consumables.  Spectroscopic sensors based on laser diodes are becoming the sensor of choice due to the qualities listed above.  VCSELs have superior spectroscopic and beam qualities over other laser diodes, and are becoming far less expensive than existing lasers.  Key to the program is development of VCSELs at the about 1.6 micron wavelength used for carbon dioxide sensing.  The VCSEL development and eventual component cost will be greatly leveraged by development of VCSELs at similar wavelengths for optical fiber communications.  A about 1.6 micron VCSEL will be produced in Phase I using novel materials.  Its wavelength, spectrum, and tuning characteristics will be verified in a setup using carbon dioxide gas.  The phase II program will produce a sensor nearly ready for use in hospitals. The sensor will also be ideal for monitoring carbon monoxide in homes and industry.",

The requirement is for \"multi-agent sensors and detectors providing real-time detection and identification of chemical/biological agents\".  As a result, the tri-services have had an ongoing interest in biosensors, a class of point sensors which employs the exquisitely selective affinity of biological molecules, typically enzymes or antibodies, for their substrates.  An issue with biosensors is to provide a means of immobilizing the biomolecule in a matrix that can be employed for signal transduction while still retaining their favorable biochemical properties.  A novel thin film matrix comprising conductive hydrated metal oxide is proposed.  We have demonstrated that large biomolecules can be incorporated into these films on electrode surfaces at room temperature from stabilizing buffer solutions, and that the biomolecules retain their activity for substrate.  These unique materials can act both as amperometric and as pH (potentiometric) transducers.  Phase I will demonstrate a model matrix system employing several immobilized enzymes with electro-active or acidic/basic products.  The ultimate goal is a family of robust, highly selective inexpensive, small electrochemical instruments that fulfill the Army's mission at a reduced cost compared to existing alternatives, consistent with the Army's Operating and Support Cost Reduction (0SCR) Program.

        "abstract": "Aircraft range is limited, in part, by skin friction drag.  Recent advances in control technology with small actuators such as piezoelectric materials and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) may make active boundary layer control for drag reduction practical.  The unique characteristics of piezoelectric materials and MEMS are small size, fast response, and low energy consumption.  Additionally, the controls can be integrated with modern electronics and readily produced in large quantities.  In this proposal two control strategies will be pursued.  First, transition in the boundary layer will be delayed as much as possible using wave cancellation techniques.  Second, when transition becomes inevitable, large eddies that cause most of the drag in a turbulent boundary layer will be attenuated through concerted efforts from several neighboring controls.  The basic control unit for achieving active boundary layer control cosists of three elements: (1) flow condition sensors, (2) feed-forward control devices, and (3) an array of actuators.  In the Phase I investigation, the primary focus will be on developing effective active actuator devices.  Simple wind tunnel experiments will generate upstream disturbances on a flat plate and various flow control devices and their motions relative to the artificial upstream disturbance will be evaluated for potential drag reduction benefits.",

TITLE   NANOPHASE ELECTRODE MATERIALS FOR HIGH ENERGY BATTERY ABSTRACT: Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) have a critical need for high performance rechargeable batteries, both implantable and external. High energy density (volumetric for implantable and gravimetric for external) and long cycle life are essential. Clearly, issues of safety and quality control are paramount, especially for implant able applications. US Nanocorp, Inc. (USN) has been created to commercialize a new class of \"nanophase\" materials (i.e. atomic-scale particles on the order of several nanometers) as the active ingredients for high performance rechargeable alkaline batteries. The principals of US Nanocorp, Inc. have developed proprietary innovative materials processes for the synthesis of nanostructured materials that are anticipated to improve battery energy density, cycle life, and rate capability as well as reduce the manufacturing cost of the active materials. This novel approach can be applied to a wide array of battery materials, including nickel hydroxide, Ni(OH) 2, and manganese dioxide, Mn02, both of which are presently used in consumer batteries. The proposed program will focus on fabrication of these two materials in nanophase form.  USN and a strategic partner (Electro Energy, Inc.) will evaluate these materials in bipolar Ni-MM and Mn02-MH batteries using EEI's unique stackable wafer cell geometry.  Feasibility will be demonstrated and an optimal system will be chosen for Phase II development/commercialization.",

Current demilitarization techniques include open detonation and traditional washout methods or meltout.  Open detonation includes uncontrolled air emissions, and is unpopular with the general public; traditional washout or meltout methods may require contact with the explosives, causing contamination and reducing the likelihood of recycle and reuse. Microwave meltout technology has the advantage of rapid removal of high explosive from munition items, with no contamination of the explosive, making it suitable for reuse or recovery.  The developed technology for microwave removal of high explosives from loaded munitions is attractive to both the and government contractors because of potential for reduced cycle times, reduced energy requirements, reduced operating costs and equipment investment, and higher value end product. El Dorado Engineering employees pioneered the original investigations of microwave meltout of explosives for the Army, and conduced actual testing.

The purpose of this project is to build and demonstrate an ultra-low-cost TWT that is designed specifically to meet the unique low-average power DOE accelerator requirements.  A total cost savings of more than $ 35M for a 10,000 tube procurement is anticipated.  The Phase I project will fabricate and test a prototype of the new TWT.

Metals such as chromium, lead, copper, and mercury pose a significant threat to health and safety as well as to the aquatic environments.  Since these heavy metals cannot be degraded or readily detoxified, they pose a serious environmental hazard.  One approach to solving this problem is to use an innovative design for an electrochemical cell to facilitate the removal of low concentrations of copper and lead commonly found in aqueous waste streams at Department of Energy facilities.  Phase I will focus on collecting heavy metals on the surface of a spouted-bed cathode;  upon completion of the electrolysis, metals can be recovered for future use.  Various cathode materials and particulate sizes will be systemically studied for the purpose of optimizing their electrochemical performance in order to remove heavy metals in aqueous waste streams and groundwater.  When the long-term studies of electrochemical cell components have been completed, they will be examined for durability.  The information obtained during the Phase I study will determine whether and how to scale up to the pilot plant stage for Phase II.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Industries that could benefit from successful development of this technology include those involved in the electrowinning of metals, wastewater treatment, cleanup of strip mining runoff, and the manufacture of paints and dye products.\n\n_",

The proposed antenna has a dual slot aperture overlaid by a planar lens with a synthetically graded index profile. Recent developments in material processing technology has made it possible to synthesize low-loss composite lenses with quite arbitrary index profiles. Small antenna size and high radiation efficiency are achieved through optimization of the lens index profile, antenna layout and feed structure. The proposed project will involve both simulation and experimental validation of the proposed antenna design.

Variable-impedance inductors made of rare-earth magnetic materials could help alleviate these kinds of problems.  This project is to demonstrate such a technology since these inductors have an impedance that changes depending on the amount of current flowing through them; it is instantaneous and reversible. The key to the development of these products and realization of their economic benefits is the development of low-cost fabrication techniques for the magnetic materials upon which the products are based.  In Phase I, samples of the magnetic materials will be fabricated and tested, followed by the design, fabrication, and testing of a prototype inductor.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Power electronics systems are increasingly used to control the flow and distribution of electrical power.  These systems would benefit from a reliable passive surge suppression system.  These inductors have application to increasing power quality in power distribution systems, reducing motor staring transients, and enhancing the performance of electromagnetic filters.  Utilities would also benefit from protective devices that limited the extent of blackouts and reduce damage from excessive currents.\n\n_",

Two different forms for the E, P, V equation of stat will be considered:  one of the Mie-Gruneisen type; the second based on a variational principle.

A core component of many AAC systems is dynamic word prediction, in which a list of probable words is autonomously generated and presented for immediate user selection.  Current word prediction systems employ algorithms which do not take full advantage of the language context, and are therefore suboptimal.  Enkidu Research proposes to apply advanced statistical language models to AAC word prediction.  In this approach, an extensive source corpus is analyzed to extract meaningful statistics concerning the probability of all possible sequences of words.  By then considering the past sequence of words entered by the user, the database can be cross-indexed to provide context-dependent predictions of subsequent words.  This paradigm can be extended to arbitrary language components, such as, syntactic and semantic classes, to exploit additional contextual information.  The combinatorial nature of a statistical approach implies that there will often be missing or unreliable entries in the predictive database.  These inconsistencies will be avoided using a variety of established and innovative techniques.  Performance measures for a large collection of predictive algorithm variants will be compiled and then contrasted with traditional AAC prediction method.",

During this project we will perform laboratory studies to address the use of multiple co-substrates to simultaneously stimulate multiple groups of chlorinated solvent-degrading microorganisms.  Initial experiments will be performed in laboratory aquifer microcosms that will allow careful measurements of chlorinated solvent degradation and the calculation of a mass balance of the amount of solvent and growth substrate added to the microcosms and degraded by the natural microbial propulations.  Trichloroethylene (TCE) will serve as a test chlorinated solent, and its degradation kinetics will be fitted to currently-available co-metabolic degradation models.  Growth of different microbial populations in response to co-substrate feeding will be measured to address the feasibility of stimulating  multiple degradative populations.  Experiments will be performed to select the best combination of co-substrates and to optimize co-substrate feeding regimes to maximize chlorinated solvent degradation, and develop an efficient and cost-effective in situ bioremediation technology.

The MBFI has the potential to reduce the annual cost of environmental analyses in the United States by more than $20 million and to reduce the analysis turnaround time from approximately 19 days to less than 15 minutes.  The major barrier to the development of a biosensor instrument for environmental measurements is the diversity of the environmental market; no one analyte is large enough to justify the development cost of a biosensor instrument.  This project will overcome this barrier in two ways. First, the MBFI will use a common disposable biosensor that is capable of eventually being adapted to dozens of analytes.  Second, the development cost will be minimized by using the instrument case, electronics, and disposable housing of the Metalyzer 3000TM currently manufactured by Environmental Technologies Group, Inc.

Values of detection  probability and false alarm will be calculated parametrically.  Area coverage rates will be determined for various concepts-of-operation.  We will also define the technology and technique improvements which can substantially improve detection range versus minimum detectable concentration versus size, weight and power.",

The main goal of the Phase I effort is to demonstrate the feasibility of the conformable technology by producing a prototype.  This prototype will consist of existing passive chips which can be connected into daisy chains in the conformable assembly.  Prototypes will be designed, fabricated, tested, subjected to bending and torsional stress and retested to confirm the reliability of the connections.A second goal of the Phase I effort is to identify military and commercial applications of the conformable technology.  This will be accomplished by reviewing the forthcoming capability with government and commercial entities during Phase I.",

In addition, the absence of thermal expansion mismatch between substrate and readout circuits of FPAs both in silicon will pave the way for larger format arrays.  These substrates will be grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) in the (111)B and 211(B) orientations which are the preferred orientations for HgCdTe growth by liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) and MBE respectively.

        "abstract": "Large planar arrays which consist of several hundred to several thousand antennas provide narrow, high gain pencil beams. Electronic beam steering for terminal guidance radar can be achiev ed using frequency scanning, beam switching, time delay or phase delay. Electronics steering allows beam manipulations in tens of nanoseconds using compact, mechanically rigid structures. Due to the increase in complexity from the additional components there is some loss in gain and pattern deterioration at large scan angles. Conventional electronic phase shifters include solid state and ferrite phase shifters. Although faster than conventional mechanica gimbals, electronic beam steering is far more expensive than mechanical beam pointing approaches. When cost is the primary driver of the system design, phased arrays are typically ruled out. However, an inexpensive phase shifter has been designed for use with aperture coupled phased arryas and demonstrated up to Ka band. The electromechanical phase shifter was configured in a linear sub array to demonstrate a five an an eight element X band phased array. This approach has the potential of becoming an extremely low cost phased array. During Phase I, Epsilon Lambda will pursue companies which are prospects for SBIR Fast Track partnership for Phase II fund matching and Phase III commercialization. During Phase I a study will be conducted to determine a practical, low cost approach to implement a terminal guidance radar scanning array using the new phase shifter.

The system will utilize recently developed long-period grating (LPG) technology which detects index-of-refraction changes resulting from target molecules binding to affinity coatings.  Calculations based on experimental results indicates an LPG-based chemical sensor sensitivity in measurements to parts-pertrillion (ppt).  In the past, metalloenzymes such as carbonic anhydrase have been used in fluorescent-based fiber optic sensors (Thompson and Jones, 1993).  However the sensitivities reported were only in the nanomolar range, and required the binding of a fluorescent molecule after capture of Zn (II).  We emphasize here that with a metal affinity LPG sensor, we can achieve 10 to 1000-fold greater sensitivities by direct loading of a sample, and without additional fluoresent label binding steps.  Hence, less bulky device designs which do not have concentating, pre-purification, and ion-based mass spectrometric detectors are achievable.  It will therefore be possible to integrate the chemical LPG sensor into a portable, operated by a technical with minimal training.",

Nickel-based superalloys are widely used in various industries, such as aerospace and automative industries.  However, nickel superalloys are difficult-to-cut materials.  Traditional mechanical methods failed to machine these superalloys.  Electrochemical Machining (ECM) is an effective method to machine nickel-based superalloys and other hard, passive alloys due to its high removal rate, no tool wear, and no burrs on the machined surface.  However, conventional ECM suffered in poor dimensional accuracy and surface quality caused by cavitation and pitting.  Our novel approach will improve the machining accuracy and surface quality for hard, passive alloys by 1) localize current, 2) maintain hydrodynamic uniformity in the interelectrode gap, 3) reduce electrode gap, 4) reduce electrolyte flow rate, and 5) prevent oxide film rehealing problem.  The overall objective is to develop a novel electrochemical machining process for hard passive alloys.  The specific objective in Phase I is to demonstrate the feasibility to machine nickel-based superalloys with our novel approach to improve dimensional accuracy and surface quality.  Anticipated Benefits:  Our novel process will be used to machine hard passive alloys, such as nickel-based superalloys.

The difficulty arises because only a straight section of standard transmission line can support a pure TEM mode.  And a pure TEM mode is necessary to preserve the risetime of the transmitted impulse.  When there is a bend in the waveguide, the transmitted signal is a broader impulse than the incident signal.  This can severely limit the bandwidth of a UWB system.A new technology has recently appeared which addresses this problem.  One can build a waveguide bend in Continuously Varying Dielectric (CVD) materials, which have been shown to support true TEM waves.  Because these materials support true TEM waves, a bend can be implemented with no dispersion, or impulse spreading, even though it is electrically large.The purpose of this project will be to design and build nondispersive waveguide bends using CVD materials.  The characteristic impedance of various structures will be determined using numerical methods.  A scale model of a candidate structure will be built and tested during Phase I.",

Current methods of forming bunches of electrons are rather complex, cumbersome, expensive, and have very definite limits on performance.  To overcome these problems, this project will concentrate on a new concept for a 34.2-gigahertz, high-power multiplying klystron system called a micro-pulse klystron.  The micro-pulse gun forms the input radio-frequency cavity, and for every period of the radiofrequency period, it products a very short bunch.  Its desirable characteristics are that it appears to be capable of producing high current densities and short pulses.  The bunch pulse width can be adjusted from 1.5-10 percent of the radiofrequency period depending on the radio-frequency voltage level and cavity gap spacing.  A point design was developed based on 11.4 gigahertz input to produce 147 megawatt output at 34.2 gigahertz with 65 percent system efficiency.  Mode locking without mode competition is achievable in the output cavity.  Phase I is aimed at a detailed analysis to establish credible estimates of radiofrequency power requirements, pulse length, emittance, efficiency, gain and other key parameters.  \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  If successful, this micro-pulse klystron should provide a high-power, high-frequency source suitable for high-energy accelerators for linear colliders, free electron lasers, medical and industrial radio-frequency linacs, super-power nanosecond radar, and accelerator test facilities.

Nicholas, Principal Investigator\nMr. Charles Carlberg, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG03-97ER82377\nAmount:  $72,667\n\n\nDOE has identified a market need for a more economical, less energy intensive process for the production of high-quality, small diameter, feedstock without deleterious surface properties. Semi-solid metal forming involves the use of a special starting material (feedstock) that has been heated into a liquid + solid state.  It provides a higher quality and more cost effective alternative to conventional means for forming parts close to their final shape.  Currently commercial semi-solid forming is essentially confined to expensive electromagnetic stirring facilities that produce large diameter feedstock with deleterious surface properties.  The objective of this project is to develop an economical mechanical stirring process for the production of small diameter semi-solid forming feedstock free of deleterious surface structures.  The Phase I project will develop a small scale mechanical stirring facility and demonstrate the feasibility for production of the desired feedstock. The feedstock as well as simple formed parts will be evaluated.  In Phase II, the facility developed in Phase I will be scaled up and detailed processing procedures developed to bring the process to the point of commercialization. \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  If the research effort is successful, this technology will directly benefit industries that require the production of relatively small parts to near final shape.  The aerospace, automotive and computer hardware industries will benefit directly from this technology.  Furthermore, scale-up to larger diameter feedstock would potentially impact the entire light alloy, near net shape forming industry._",

        "abstract": "1In submarine electronics modules, heat dissipated by electronic devices is typically transported along the length of the heat sink (upon which ICs are mounted) to the water cooled side walls. The current pure copper SEM-D heat sink limits the power dissipation per card to 26W in order to maintain acceptable device junction temperatures. Foster-Miller will demonstrate an innovative Gr/Cu metal matrix composite (MMC) heat sink which offers a 25 percent reduction in thermal impedance over the current copper component. The key bottleneck for MMCa-low z-directional conductivity-will be removed by adding z-directional fibers to the planar preform using a Foster-Miller proprietary process. Additionally, the MMC heat sink will have a tailored planar CTE in the card region (thereby obviating a complaint layer) and high planar thermal conductivity. The cumulative effect will be a 6 to 10 C reduction in the device junction temperature (thereby >50 percent reduction in device failure rate) for the same power density, or alternatively, a 25 percent increase in the power dissipation at current device junction temperatures. Additionally, the 45 percent lighter Gr/Cu heat sink will accrue significant savings in the electronics system and structural weight. During Phase I Foster-Miller will fabricate and test MMC specimens representative of three critical regions-card, rib and bend region; of the Foster-Miller SEM-D heat sink concept. This will lead into Phase II when the design and processing will be optimized and high properties will be consistently demonstrated in full scale Gr/Cu SEM-D heat sinks.",

        "abstract": "The Air Force has indicated that current and future research in the area of high velocity ballistic impact will require the development of unique nonintrusive stress/strain measurement techniques for composite materials.  Foster-Miller proposes a unique and highly effective solution to the problem of through thickness stress wave measurement in composite structures which uses through thickness embedded fiber optic sensors.  The technique builds upon past research at Foster-Miller where fiber optic Bragg grating sensors were embedded through-thickness in composite laminates for detection of internal delaminations and crack propagation.  This Phase I proposes to develop the technology required to resolve the strain distribution as a function of length along the sensor so that non uniform strain distributions and stress wave propagation during ballistic impact can be measured. Additionally, the proposed technology will enable the measurement of through thickness strains in composite structures for static and dynamic structural applications.  There is no currently available technology which provides these capabilities.",

Ideally, the battery should meet or exceed current voltage, ampere-hour and discharge ratings and should be benign if disposed of in a marine environment.  Foster-Miller proposes to develop polymeric environmentally degradable batteries using one of three strategies to combine conductivity and biodegradability in one material system.  Our technical approach fuses together our expertise in energy storage devices, biodegradable polymers, and polymer chemistry.  In Phase I we will identify candidate materials for each of the three approaches, then assess the feasibility of each approach, taking into account the conductive and degradation properties of the selected materials and the ease of material synthesis.  Based on these results, we will perform a risk assessment of the three approaches, and develop a replacement strategy for the substitution of our materials into a battery system.  The ultimate goal of this program is to develop a polymeric environmentally degradable battery that can function as a replacement for today's primary (single-use) batteries.",

        "abstract": "Serious limitations to the use of advanced organic matrix composites result from difficulties in producing large complex structures from two-dimensional materials forms such as preimpregnated tape or fabric, anf from the high costs associated with conventional thermal curing.  Electron Beam (EB) curing offers the potential for dramatically lowering costs over conventional thermal curing by decreasing the temperature and time required, but formulations based on commercially available materials with excellent mechanical and thermal properties are required for high performance applications.  Additionally, the EB process will facilitate the development and implementation of novel, low cost tooling for complex structures such as a geodesic dtiffened JSF inlet duct.  Foster-Miller has developed an advanced preforming capability based on flat intersecting braiding technology that can produce complex netshape preforms for composite structures, and a development program at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory has produced EB curable resins with the best mechanical properties yet demonstrated.  This Phase I program brings these two technologies together in an exciting opportunity to advance the state of the art for composite structures.

A recent study sponsored by Air Force Wright Laboratories concluded that only single crystal oxide reinforcements offer adequate reinforcing potential for ceramic matrices for high temperature (1800 to 3500 degree F) applications. However, only a few single crystal oxide reinforcements are available commercially and suffer from drawbacks associated with large diameter (125 um) (inability to form complex shapes by weaving and braiding and limit on thinness and curvature of the part) and handling damage.  Foster-Miller's process can make complex shaped preforms with three dimensionally tailored single crystal oxide reinforcement.  The reinforcement diameter will be less thant 25 um and handling is eliminated.  The process is versatile and can make preforms of various single crystal oxides such as sapphire, YAG, Yb2, yttria stabilized zirconia, MgAl104, doped alumina, eutectic YAG.

        "abstract": "Developmental work on extruded meat in carbohydrate matrix jerky products has been done at the U.S. Army's Natick research laboratories.  The most successful of these efforts has involved processing potato carbohydrate flake with lean comminuted beef, various flavorants and plasticizers in a twin screw extruder.  The resulting jerky is cut into strips, packaged with oxygen scavengers and heat aged at 125\u00bfF.  After only four eeks of this accelerated storage, however, significant toughening of the jerky occurs, resulting in an unacceptable product.  Foster-Miller believes the solution to the problem lies in a designed matrix evaluation of both physical and chemical interactions between and within the protein and carbohydrate phases.  The Phase I program is structured to systematically produce samples and evaluate the effects of processing conditions and formulation variables. Evaluation will include visual observation, texture anaysis, water activity measurement, proton NMR, DSC, and DNA measurements.  Formulational variables we will consider during Phase I include both type and level of plasticizer.  Measurements will be taken both immediately after extension and after varying times during accelerated storage.  The results of this experimentation will enable Foster-Miller to develop an improved meat in carbohydrate matrix jerky snack in Phase II for field evaluation as a MERC/PERC and having significant commercial value.  Successful development of a meat-in-carbohydrate matrix jerky product will enable troops to consume a high carbohydrate and protein diet with minimal preparation while performing mission essential tasks such as marching or maintaining operational security.  This in turn will greatly reduce the Army's logistical burden of feeding its troops for short but crucial periods of time.

Boron-based coatings are roughly twice as hard as the titanium nitride coatings but unfortunately, they are brittle, and do not adhere well to tools or parts.  This project will develop boron-based coatings that are extremely tough (not brittle), while maintaining their high degree of hardness.  They will also be engineered for excellent adhesion and low friction.  In Phase I, the properties of the boron-based coating will be developed and tested in an R&D  coating system.  The coating will be a graded multi-layer structure, each layer imparting qualities that are lacking in boron alone (e.g., good adhesion, toughness, etc.).  In Phase II, the technology will be scaled up to a multi-chamber production system to demonstrate that large quantities of parts can be coated economically.  In both the R&D and production systems, coatings are deposited within a vacuum chamber, and the process is non-polluting.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The project would create a new generation of super-hard coatings (and a coating system) capable of greatly improving the wear life of millions of industrial cutting tools and manufactured parts in the transportation, aerospace, machine tool, textile, and related industries.  The coatings would promote energy efficiency by reducing manufacturing times, and by increasing the longevity of cutting tools and manufactured parts.  Such coatings and coating systems could be used by industrial companies worldwide._",

        "abstract": "We offer an approach to a multiple-order-of-magnitude processing speed/efficiency improvement in vector quantization (VQ) data/image compression, automatic target recognition/classification, and time signal/signature classification. We base our approach on an algorithmic breakthrough, the TABULAR NEAREST-NEIGHBOR ENCODER (TNE), which we discovered and partially developed last year. This algorithm reduces the computational complexity associated with such problems from 1 to over 4 orders-of magnitude compared to other techniques. A significant property is the relative insensitivity of the algorithm's complexity to codebook and/or vector partition size. This property renders feasible the use of very large image quantization or feature vector codebooks in real-time with relatively modest processor hardware. Larger codebooks will render practicable larger vector partitionings and thence greater data compression ratios than were previously associated with VQ methods. The TNE architecture is well suited for parallel processing and for independent sub-space (i.e., correlated partial image block) classifications. This latter property will greatly facilitate model-based classification of partially obscured target imagery and partially masked time signatures. This effort will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in real-time image/data compression; in automatic recognition/classification of exposed and/or partially obscured targets; and in related commercial applications (multimedia, video compression, speech recognition/compression/synthesis, etc.)",

Further \"gray beards\" or \"wisdom figures\" within the government are retiring with a significant loss in corporate memory.  The resulting out flux of experienced personnel and the increasing need to incorporate affordable technologies to either revolutionize capability or simply extend operational life creates an indisputable need for an easy to use set of tools to assess new technology investment costs and affordability before any large expenditure of resources or funds.  The objective of this SBIR is to develop and demonstrate such a PC based software tool which can be used by relatively inexperienced personnel, to quickly and easily assess new technology investment costs ande affordability in terms of meeting technology thrust goals and Return On Investment (ROI) targets.

(FCR) proposes a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program to develop an IC compatible, rad-hard precision voltage reference (PVR) with the stability under temperature and radiation required by military and commercial space electronic systems. Stable reference voltages are required for a variety of electronic systems for use in space such as high resolution A/D converters, pulse width modulators, etc. Previous approaches have been unable to provide the necessary accuracy with the radiation hardness required by space systems. As a result, there presently is no PVR capable of meeting the even more demanding requirements of future space systems for radiation hardened reference elements. To rneet these requirements, a program is proposed to develop a rad-hard PVR having an End-Of-Life absolute accuracy of better than 15 ppm after severe space radiation exposure is proposed.  Both military and commercial users require 14-16 bit rad-hard A/D converters for space applications. Such devices require precision voltage references capable of supplying voltages stable to that level of precision, or they will not perform as designed. This program would develop such a device, filling a critical need for advanced space sensor systems.",

Levinton, Principal Investigator\nDr. Kenneth G. Moses, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG03-97ER82384\nAmount:  $74,866\n\nThe performance of magnetic fusion confinement devices is highly dependent upon the confined plasma behavior near the wall of the vacuum vessel or \"edge region\" of the plasma.  Presently, it is very difficult to measure what is happening in this region.  The purpose of this research is to develop an instrument system that will measure plasma behavior in the edge region.  The measurement approach to be used employs laser light to excite atoms and ions in the plasma edge.  When ions or atoms are excited (raised to higher energy states), they emit light (fluoresce) and return to a lower energy state.  Spectral analysis of the light signals from the excited ion or atom can reveal what is taking place and the structure of the turbulent activity. However, the signals must be sufficiently strong to be seen above the electronic noise of the measuring instrument and the background noise of the plasma light.  This project will evaluate the ratio of the signal to electronic noise and the ratio of the signal to background plasma light noise.  Once these calculations are finished, it will be determined whether the proposed technique of measuring the edge plasma behavior will work or can be made to work.  This project will also evaluate the feasibility of applying the proposed technique in the divertor (ash removal) region of fusion devices to investigate plasma turbulence there.  In Phase II, an instrument will be constructed that can experimentally demonstrate the plasma turbulence measurement system on an operating fusion confinement device.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: This research will result in a new diagnostic tool that will provide measurements with space and time resolution of ion turbulence in magnetically confined plasmas and aid the development of magnetic fusion as a safe, environmentally acceptable energy source.  Other applications will be in manufacturing, materials, electronics, electric power computing, the defense industries, and to the commercial sector where plasma processes are used, such as in the semiconductor industry and environmental monitoring._",

Our approach establishes feature correspondences between image frames, and uses correspondence information in a Kalman filter to correct inertial measurement device drift and to bridge across sparse GPS data.  Expected results include geospatial/pose accuracy to in/mrad levels, sufficient to enable a new generation of image-based 3-D reconstruction applications such as automated surveying.  The proposed Phase I effort will provide a strong foundation for rapid implementation and field validation during Phase II by delivering a complete requirements analysis using inputs from NIMA, DMSO, and image understanding researchers, system design to the hardware component/software flowchart level, and design, empirical validation, and simulation of the proposed navigation solution.",

This fundamental restriction greatly limits the capability of human being in perceiving and understanding the complexity of real world objects.One common problem shared by past development efforts of a number of 3D volumetric display mechanisms is that although the concepts can be demonstrated using the proof-of-concept prototypes, it is very difficult to scale-up to actually produce a full color, full resolution and full size 3D volumetric display systems, due to many inherent limitations of these concepts.We believe that it is extremely important to develop a 3D volumetric display concept that is inherently Scalable.  Large size, full color, and full resolution 3D display system can be built using mechanisms that do not have serious problems in scale-up production.  The primary objective of the Phase I SBIR program proposed herein is to investigate a novel concept of generating high resolution, full color and large size true 3D volumetric images and producing scalable 3D display systems.  Besides the ability to produce high resolution full color true 3D volumetric 3D images without need of viewing glasses, additional advantages of the proposed 3D display method are large angle of view, simultaneous multiple user views, large viewing volumes, flexibility in voxel size and shape, high voxel bandwidth and inherent parallel scanning architecture.In this Phase I SBIR effort, we will investigate the feasibility of the proposed 3D display concept.

The primary objective of this project is to fill this gap, and to develop a high speed and low-cost 3D image sensor with an omni viewing angle (i.e., 360 degree) for the battle field modeling and reconnaissance tasks in digital battle field management applications.  The omnidirectional vision technique offers an extremely wider angle field of view. This sensing capability provides the autonomous vehicles with advantages of no dead viewing angle area, a faster response time and a high speed detection of targets and/or possible intrusion in all directions, lower installation and operating costs, and suitable for a variety of practical battle field environments.  The proposed system, called OMNI 3D Camera, is able to provide full frame 3D images at a rate of 30 frames per second or higher, a capability that no other commercially available 3D sensor can achieve at any cost. The omnidirectional 3D range image can be obtained in a single snapshot with no scanning operation or mechanical moving part. This novel 3D sensoring approach eliminates the computationally expensive process for integrating multiple images captured in different viewing angles, therefore the throughput of the usable 3D information is further enhanced. No scanning nor mechanical moving part is needed. Not only the mechanical design becomes very simple and reliable, but also the no-scan feature overcomes the inherent error source in scanning laser based systems due to the high speed motion of object during scanning. Most components in this system are Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) products, which leads to low installation/operation cost and short development time. Our Omni 3D camera can also provide normal 2D color image of the scene around the autonomous vehicle using the same CCD camera.

The standard is intended for implementation in end stations,  bridges, and bridging routers that implement IEEE LMSC Medium Access  Control (MAC) standards, for example, CSMA/CD (a.k.a. Ethernet) and  Token Ring, and bridging standards.  The standard also operates in  conjunction with FDDI networks since the same MAC definition (ISO/IEC IS  10039) is used in the FDDI standard, as well as ATM network products that  implement the same MAC interface using AAL5.  The GeoLogics Team will study all aspects of these current  standardization efforts and their applicability to Navy requirements, and as  necessary, will recommend modifications to these proposed standards.",

The sensor offers a low-cost, all-weather/all-visibility-conditions high-resolution imaging capability from a small UAV to individuals and small units for surveillance and targeting purposes.  In addition to being able to see through smoke, fog, etc. and its around-the-clock mission capability, SAR provides the valuable range information and it's particularly sensitive to man-made metallic objects such as tanks, artillery pieces, and various ground vehicles.  A special proprietary radar configuration, made possible by GORCA's data-adaptive motion compensation techniques, results in the ultra-lightweight/low-cost construction.  The sensor does not require the placement of INS or IMU equipment on board the UAV.  Depending on system parameters, the total weight of the proposed imaging payload is expected to range between 0.1 and 0.5 lb. A side-looking, lightweight, low-profile microstrip SAR antenna is to be employed.  The rest of the payload is expected to occupy few cubic inches.

Using the wind tunnel data, analytical tools will be recalibrated and performance analyses performed.  A performance map of the HSVTOL capability is expected to confirm that the HSVTOL will significantly out-perform current VTOL concepts in speeds and altitude and have comparable capability to CTOL short to medium range jet aircraft.

Goss, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG03-97ER82388\nAmount:  $74,986\n\nJoining is a critical, enabling technology in many industrial sectors that have problems of concern to the Department of Energy. The reliability of joints, especially welded joints, is often the limiting factor in the performance of systems in automobiles, power generators, and electronics.  In the process industry, it is common to have mounting conditions where a shaft is mounted to a mill head and oftentimes a common cause of shaft failure is this very welding of the mill head to the shaft.  This project will develop an innovative and highly efficient joint technology for the replacement of welded joints in shafts to mill heads. This concept involves the novel use of machinable ceramics and locking assembly joints that will eliminate current welding methods and maintain the structural integrity of the mill head and the shaft while providing improved heat-insulating characteristics. The new joint technology can be manufactured economically using current manufacturing capabilities.  In Phase I, stress analysis and heat transfer computer models (finite element analysis) will be used to examine and optimize several shaft to head attachments. Additionally, computer models will be used to optimize future ceramic-metal shaft to mill head joining technology.  In Phase II, the best methods for connecting shafts to heads with both ceramic and metal locking assembles will be determined.  Prototype mill heads will be developed and tested to ascertain the operating characteristics of the new designs. A final design and prototype of a machinable ceramic locking assembly joint will also be developed and tested during Phase II.\n     \nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: These advanced concepts and approaches will improve joining technology for shafts in both military and civilian markets.

        "abstract": "The opportunity exists to apply evolving technology for nonlinear adaptive control to autopilot design for precision guided munitions.  The approach employs artificial neural networks to represent errors made in inverting the nonlinearities in a feedback inverting controller.  Using an on-line method for weight adaptation results in a highly effective local approximator to the inversion error.  Results indicate that highly accurate adaptation is achievable in fractions of a second, with minimal additional control effort employed during an adaptation interval.  It is proposed that this methodology be employed in Phase I to develop an autopilot for a representative precision guided munition, and that the range of variation in munition design parameters be established over which adaptation is practical.  It is anticipated that a single nonlinear adaptive autopilot could be developed that could be applied to a wide range of guided munitions and missiles, and that it would offer potential for dramatic improvement in weapon maneuverability via nonlinear adaptive control, especially in flight conditions were aerodynamics are poorly modeled, and for advanced configurations employing multiple control effectors with a very powerful resulting maneuvering capability.",

The Phase I research will build on experience gained with earlier multichannel imaging laser radars developed for submunition guidance, and with current work on compact, 2-D APD array imaging laser radar receivers.  This research centers around the development of a multichannel range/intensity measurement module (MRIMM), a custom multichip module which measure the time-of-flight and peak intensity of the reflected laser pulses.  The MRIMM will measure the pulse arrival time with an accuracy of 500 picoseconds (corresponding to three inches downrange resolution), and will simultaneously measure the intensity of the arriving pulses over a wide dynamic range.  The proposed modular optical receiver front end can use a variety of detectors (PIN, APD, silicon, InGaAs), and the bandwidth can be tailored for laser pulse widths from one nanosecond to twenty nanoseconds.  The entire multichannel common module receiver is five mm thick and about the size of a credit card.  The receiver is coupled to the receiver optics focal plane using an industry-standard multichannel fiber optic connector.  The common module's output connector can be connected directly to the parallel port of a standard PC.

Existing photoinjectors have undesirable asymmetric field distributions, caused by the input power coupling aperture in the side wall of the cavity.  These field asymmetries contribute to beam emittance growth during the RF acceleration process, thus preventing the full potential of these electron sources from being attained.  The use of diametrically opposed coupling apertures in the side wall of a traditionally shaped cylindrical cavity can provide bipolar field symmetry, but this introduces quadropolar field asymmetries and also causes an enhancement of the electric field gradient on the cavity end wall surfaces.  In Phase I, a novel racetrack shaped, dual feed coupling cavity, having inherent characteristics that will prevent the above field asymmetries and gradient enhancement, will be investigated and incorporated into the design of a highly field symmetrized multicell structure for a 17 gigahertz high brightness photoinjector.  For transmission and control of the required microwave input power, a high power rectangular waveguide system will also be designed.  In Phase II, the new photoinjector system and waveguide network will be fabricated and interfaced with an existing high peak power klystron and a short pulse laser so that beam evaluation experiments using a high gradient linear accelerator can be performed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Plasma Fusion Center.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  It is anticipated that, if successful, the Phase I and Phase II efforts will result in the fabrication and testing of a short bunch, high current, low emittance, 17 gigahertz photoinjector suitable for advance accelerator and free electron laser research applications.\n\n\n_",

The system supports assisted living providers serving frail elders and other dependent groups and includes approaches to meet the needs of those with cognitive impairment. The system, to be developed in both a paper and pencil and computerized form, is easy to use, so that it is supportive to staff and creates reliable data for continuous improvement and outcomes research. Nursing homes currently use the Minimum Data Set (MDS) as an industry-wide system for assessment, service planning, reporting. However, the MDS, with its health care orientation, does not meet the needs of assisted living providers. The RCI system will use many of the same data points to allow for comparability across settings, and ease of transfer for individual users of long-term care services. The new system will build on Hearthstone's experience in assisted living operations and research, particularly its current SBIR/NIA project is using assessment and outcome measures developed under NIA-funded collaborative studies. $ = TOTAL AWARD AMTS & NOT LIMITED TO PORTION OF PROJECT RELATED TO SUBJECT OF SEARCH SUBPROJECT $ = TOTAL AWARD AMOUNT DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF SUBPROJECTS SOURCE:  CRISP  FORMAT F    FY 97      LAST UPDATE 04-07-98 1QUERY 1536                        ID SEARCH 06/01/98   PAGE     30 --PROJECT NUMBER......1 R43 AG14618-01                 INVESTIGATOR NAME/ADDRESS FY  97    HOBDAY, JOHN V IRG/INTRAMURAL UNIT..ZRG2                             PERCEPTUAL MULTIMEDIA INC.

The number of persons in the United States with dementing disorders, now between 4-5 million, will reach 14 million by the year 2020 [11].  Caregiving is associated with higher than usual health and mental health problems, family disharmony, and social isolation [16-18].  To impact this situation, Perceptual Engineering will develop a CD-ROM/Internet resource for caregivers and families of patients suffering from Alzheimer's.  This Phase I proposal will develop the multimedia components of the first ten (10) of what will be an eventual fifty (50) Most Commonly Asked Questions about disease. This proof of concept prototype will be created as a shell, enabling its reuse for future versions focused on other diseases.  Focus groups will identify, test and validate the process and selection of the fifty Most Commonly Asked questions, and evaluate program effectiveness.  A report of findings will accompany the CD-ROM prototype developed during Phase I. Phase II will develop content and programming for additional modules, including the remaining forty (40)Most Commonly Asked Questions.  Primary commercialization will concentrate on marketing agreements with medical publishers of interactive multimedia and non-profit organizations such as the Alzheimer's Association.",

R. Sarazin, Principal Investigator\nMr. B. Wilcox, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-97ER82391\nAmount:  $75,000\n   \n  \nMetal forming operations are among the most costly materials processing steps that require large capital investments and are extremely energy intensive.  A technique called semi-solid forming is an attractive process but the cost of preparation of semi solid alloys is relatively high, due to the expense associated with electromagnetic or mechanical stirring of the liquid alloy during solidification.  The principle objective of this project is to develop a new, less expensive, energy efficient process for producing alloys (such as semi-solid aluminum alloys for automotive applications), which can be heated to a semi-solid state, transformed and effectively formed into parts which meet or exceed the existing structural and mechanical strength characteristics of semi-solid forming.  Phase I of the project will concentrate on traditional aluminum silicon alloys 356 and 357 which are currently being produced for semi-solid forming by electromagnetic stirring.  Formability studies will be performed to determine if combinations of configuration, injection temperature and pressure will allow ease of formation and acceptable final properties.  These results will be compared to companion experiments using electromagnetically stirred ingot.\n     \nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The principle benefit of a successful research effort would be reduced cost semi-solid formable aluminum alloys.  These are produced exclusively by semi-solid thermal treatment, which permit economical replacement of heavier cast iron and steel parts, particularly in automotive applications, resulting in reduced energy consumption both in raw material formation and vehicle fuel consumption.\n_",

        "abstract": "The thrust of this proposal is to develop a compact integrated sensor/antenna that requires no power supply or wiring capable of addressing concerns of long term embedment/attachment.  The proposed research is to employ wireless excitation and telemetry of sensor data from an array of SAW (Surface Acoustic Wave) sensors located on civil structures.  These devices will be able to be attached to primary construction or power system components such as timber, steel, copper, concrete etc.  The aim will be to develop a rugged sensor that is remotely interrogated.  The measurements will be obtained through wireless remote access.  A base station transmits a signal which is received by the antenna/sensor.  This excites the sensor which then re-radiates a signal containing the raw sensor data back to the base station.  An embbeded microprocessor in the base station then extracts the desired information.  The sensor is completely passive, inexpensive, and reliable.  As part of the research, we will also demonstrate that several measurements such as temperature, moisture content, normal stress, and shear stress can be simultaneously measured.  We will investigate how this enables the removal of system changes for the measured data, such as, decoupling seasonal temperature change effects.  The proposed system will have many applications for structural assessment permitting much more detailed, frequent, and inexpensive inspection of structures.  This includes private sector buildings and plants as well as state and local structures, such as, bridges and utilities.",

        "abstract": "Hard-target weapons currently in development or being considered by DoD include a variety of ground-, ship-, and air-based target penetrators.  The lethality of many of these systems are critically dependent on the ability to maintain geometric stability of the penetrator.  A refractory, wear-resistant material may be essential for effective sand and earth ballistic penetrators.    However, the need for high strength, high density, and in particular high toughness also exist.  Most hard, wear-resistant materials are highly brittle ceramics, and are unsuitable for ballistic penetrators.The emerging field of nanostructured materials allows for desired material properties to be engineered into the composite material.  Unique properties have been well documented in a wide variety of nanostructural systems, where the resultant mechanical properties far exceed the properties predicted by the simple rule-of-mixtures.  High rate chemcial vapor deposition (CVD) is a promising and economically viable technique for producing nanostructural composite components via CVD.  This program will examine the feasibility of producing dense tungsten/tungsten carbide (W/WC) nanostructural composties for hard-target ballistic penetrator nose-tip/nose-cap components.  Nanostructured W/WC that contains only very thin (~10 nm) layers of tungsten carbide interspersed with slightly thicker layers of tungsten has already been demonstrated to possess strength and wear resistance that is far greater than either of the individual constituents.  This Phase I program will demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating massive (thick) deposits of this nanolayered material.  Properties such as hardness, wear resistance, fracture toughness, strength, and elastic properties will be empirically determined and correlated with nanocomposite microstructure to aid in optimizing the material for potential ballistic penetrator application.",

The sensor will be able to determine serum concentrations of IL-6 IL-12, TNF-alpha and CRP in 3-10 minutes.  The portable biosensor system will be based on proven fiber optic biosensor technology recently developed by IA.  Based on this technology, IA has already demonstrated the feasibility of developing a fiber optic biosensor capable of detecting serum IL-6 concentrations at the femptogram/ml level.  During Phase I, IA, Inc. will confirm the preliminary IL-6 results and where necessary, redesign the sensor to improve performance, reliability and stability.  In Phase I, IA will also develop and IL-12 sensor, and evaluate a technique for using a single fiber sensor for measuring multiple serum prognostic indicators.  In Phase II the measurements will be extended to include TNF-alpha and CRP and the field-portable instrument developed.  The proposed system can be used in urgent care facilities, emergency rooms, and hospital wards to improve the care provider's ability to detect and treat low level infections before they become severe.

Advances in SIMOX technology include radiation hardened memories and gate arrays for space applications, ULSI DRAMs for low voltage operation, thin film low power/low voltage circuitry, and extreme (400 degree C) temperature applications of SIMOX circuitry.  A significant aspect regarding device reliability and performance is the silicon dislocation density in the starting surface of the SOI substrates.  However, optically counting etch pits for material etch pit densities ranging from 1E2/cm2 to 1E8/cm2 (depending on the material processing) is extremely time consuming and precludes immediate production feedback.  This Phase I proposal examines the feasibility of an impulsive stimulated thermal scattering method which may be applicable for non-destructively examining Si dislocations.  In Phase I, we will investigate the effect of the acoustic wave analysis on both etched and unetched samples as compared with the destructive chemical analysis.  In Phase II, if feasibility is proven, we will carry out research and development necessary to provide an accurate, automatic, non-destructive dislocation density evaluation technique for substrate production and improvement programs.

Limitations of long-term success include abrupt closure and restenosis, or chronic reclosure, of the vessel - both of which are associated with excessive vascular injury. Intravascular stenting has demonstrated moderate success in addressing these issues. However, current stents tend to be highly thrombogenic and immunologically stimulating. In this Phase I project we propose the novel application of a photochemically activated 1.8-naphthalimide dye in vascular repair following PTCA administration. By utilizing arterial wall and plaque proteins we may be able to produce an \"endogenous\" stent. Introduction and activation of the dye during a final balloon dilatation would cross-link the proteins in the dilated state and repair intimal or medial dissections resulting from the PTCA administration. In doing so, we may provide short- term structural support during the critical post-angioplasty period, as well as a physical barrier limiting exposure of subendothelium to circulating blood and vasoactive factors associated with the restenosis process. Initial results with these dyes in other tissues have yielded outstanding histological results with minimal cellular proliferation or extracellular matrix deposition and no inflammatory response. Phase II research will involve in vivo animal testing of the proposed \"endogenous\" stent with human testing and commercialization occurring in Phase III.",

        "abstract": "Maintaining straightness of continuously welded high speed DoD track rails is critical to the facility's mission, since test vehicles, often traversing the track at up to Mach 10, can experience dangerous dynamic loading due to track irregularities.  Although facilities are constructed with adequate pretension to reduce undesirable effects of irregularities and thermal expansion/contraction over wide temerature ranges, tracks breads often preclude the maintenanct of pretension.  An advanced sensing system to monitor rail stress, and software tools to provide supporting analytical capability would be highly beneficial In the U.S. transportation sector, a similar requirement exists to monitor rail tension in welded rails.  Increasing traffic, speed, and rail loads make the requirement increasingly important. An advanced analysis and test program for this applicaiton is proposed for side-by-side testing of the two most advanced technologies for non-destructive rail monitoring:  electro magnetic acoustic transduction (EMAT) and non-linear harmonic (NLH) magnetic hysteresis.  The project will experimentally compare the technologies against the requirements of a DoD test track, determine the best approach, develop a conceptual system design, and fabricate the test prototype hardware. Supporting tools to analyze rail stress response to temperature will also be developed in working prototype form.",

This neural net would be similar to that recently used by other ARL ATR researchers.  Performance would be further enhanced by smart fusion of individual sensors classifier outputs, either on the same or multiple platforms, i.e., multi-sensor fusion.  Our approach would start with the fusion scheme being investigated by us under another SBIR for Target Acquisition/Target Recognition (TATR) encompassing man-in-the-loop decision making.  For the ARL SBIR, we will enhance the TATR fusion scheme by building an artificial intelligent agent that augments and automates aided fusion function, e.g., adaptive thresholding for multi-sensor fusion.  This intelligent agent would also incorporate production rules for associating different views of the same object for multi-look fusion.  the resulting algorithms will be applicable to ATR fusion implementations both on vehicles and fusion stations.

        "abstract": "An approach is desired that allows composite infrared background scenes to be synthetically generated using a data base of background objects and types.  I-MATH has previously developed an algorithm for a related application, whereby actual scene images are decomposed with a Laplacian pyramid, and then each level in the pyramid is characterized by its second order statistics.  Synthetic scene images are synthesized to have the same characteristics, and the synthetic images are determined to be sufficient by a \"closeness\" algorithm.  Before the synthetic generation of backgrounds can be accomplished, a set of background metrics must be identified, I-MATH has been performing research into such metrics for ten years and is very aware of the limitations of such popular parameterizations as the Schmeider-Wethersby metric for describing clutter.  For the Schmeider-Wethersby metric, there is no representation of target shape, target internal detail, or background clutter.  Hense, against even bland backgrounds, checkerboards can have the same equivalent DT as a uniform target.  I-MATH originally addressed this deficiency by adapting a camouflage metric, which convolves the brightness-structured target by the point spread function of the eye (or other sensor), and then computes an equivalent DT using absolute values.  In a subsequent development of a Visual Observer Model (VOM), I-MATH incorporated a target-to-background discriminability metric based on cooccurrence metrics.  This computes a density of confusing forms (M) and a corresponding discrimination probability (P3).  In Phase I, we will evaluate several additional M and equivalent DT metrics.  A representative variety of clutter conditions will be considered, giving consideration to a recently developed taxonomy for distinguishing clutter types.  The characterization is three dimensional, with the bases related to (1) repetitiveness/fractal (dimension), (2) directionality (gradient), and (3) complexity (granularity).  For Phase I, we will use the existing P3 formulation in VOM for computing target discrimination probability.  This is an empirically derived and well validated equation for predicting operator image assessment.  In Phase II, we will repl",

Its unique combination of characteristics enable IMEC's memory to replace all types of computer memories, from registers in a CPU to magnetic disks, with a single technology. The proposed Phase I effort will design a unified memory architecture using IMEC's GMR technology for all memory/storage requirements of a computer.

The Information Collection Rule (ICR) is undertaking this task at present.  The ICR was delayedfor more than a year based on the necessity to access the adequacy of the analytical method used tocollect data on Cryptosporidium.

The assay is based on affinitychromatography, nucleic acid extraction, isothermal amplification and visual detection.  The assay willbe easy to perform, requiring little instrumentation and will be completed, on site, in about 3 hours.",

Yang, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-97ER82409\nAmount:  $74,714\n\nThe Department of Energy is responsible for developing a ten-year plan to remediate most of the radioactive and hazardous waste sites in the Nation\u00bfs nuclear weapons complex.  Effective cleanup of these sites requires technologies beyond commercially available ion-exchange and specialty sorbent systems. The main objective of this project is to incorporate a surface modification technology into the production of low cost aerogel material in order to generate a new class of commercial products for an efficient and selective removal of heavy metal ions from waste water streams.  The application utilizes the high surface area as well as the high reactivity of the surface silanol groups of a low density nanopore material, the aerogel.  Estimates suggest that such a surface-modified aerogel substrate could treat an amount of waste water up to 30,000 times it\u00bfs own volume and substantially reduce the cost of remediation.  In Phase I, investigations will be conducted to determine how to incorporate a monolayer onto the surface of an aerogel substrate.  The effectiveness of this substrate as an absorber of heavy metal ions will then be determined.  In Phase II, an overall attempt to reduce the cost of the final product will be made by optimizing processing conditions, replacing currently used solvents, and integrating processing steps.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Recent progress in the process of producing aerogel in large quantity at a low cost have created a business opportunity for this new technology in addition to addressing the needs of the Department of Energy. This technology could be marketable to waste water treatment plants, commercial nuclear utilities, and decontamination and decommissioning firms.  The high concentration of the adsorbed metal ions (silver, copper, etc.) in such a material also presents an opportunity for the recovery of precious metals. \n_",

        "abstract": "An ultrasonic Rayleigh surface wave method is proposed to evaluate residual stresses in composites.  The Rayleigh wave method has several distinct advantages, including  the ability to eliminate the effect of fiber orientation on the residual stress  determination.  Also, the Rayleigh wave approach can discriminate between tensile  and compressive residual stresses and obtain a residual stress depth profile by  altering the penetration depth of the Rayleigh wave.  The Rayleigh wave is bound to  the surface of the composite, enabling measurements on curved and other irregularly  shaped surfaces.  This program emphasizes composites; our previous experience will  help the Navy address measurement needs in metals.  This program will lead to an enhanced understanding of residual stress fields that exist in composites.  A  residual stress evaluation system, consisting of a field portable inspection system  based on a portable computer that can be operated remotely by a single user, will  also be developed.  This will enable the stress levels to be determined rapidly and  the data to be stored for later analysis.  The results obtained from this instrument  will be used for manufacturing process control and in-service inspections.   Preliminary contacts with commercial users have demonstrated significant  interest in this proposed system, simplifying the commercialization process.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this project is to determine the feasibility of developing inhibitors of the Staphylococcus aureus multidrug-efflux transporter NorA. NorA provides S. aureus with intrinsic resistance to fluoroquinolone antibiotics by reducing their concentration inside the bacterial cell. Inhibition of NorA has been demonstrated to dramatically potentiate the antibacterial action of fluoroquinolones and prevent the emergence of antibiotic-resistant variants of S. aureus. One NorA inhibitor 1 reserpine, has already been identified by the authors. Unfortunately, the use of reserpine is limited by its neurotoxicity. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that reserpine is not unique in its ability to inhibit NorA; screening of 2,500 organic compounds has yielded a number of structurally diverse molecules also capable of suppressing NorA activity. During the first, exploratory phase of the project, 7,500 more compounds will be screened for their ability to inhibit NorA. To eliminate toxic compounds, the identified inhibitors will be tested for their toxicity to a panel of human cell lines. The compounds to which NorA can become insensitive through mutations will also be eliminated. The remaining inhibitors of highest potency will be used in Phase Il of the project as lead compounds, on the basis of which we expect to develop a clinically useful NorA inhibitor. PROVIDE COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS This project is to develop nontoxic inhibitors of the S. aureus multidrug transporter NorA, the protein involved in resistance of these bacteria to fluoroquinolone antibiotics. The envisioned commercial product is a combination of such an inhibitor with fluoroquinolone. Given that staphylococcal infections are widespread and rapidly become resistant to antibiotic therapy, the market for this product is likely to be comparable to the market for major antibiotics. $ = TOTAL AWARD AMTS & NOT LIMITED TO PORTION OF PROJECT RELATED TO SUBJECT OF SEARCH SUBPROJECT $ = TOTAL AWARD AMOUNT DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF SUBPROJECTS SOURCE:  CRISP  FORMAT F    FY 97      LAST UPDATE 04-07-98 1QUERY 1536                        ID SEARCH 06/01/98   PAGE    330 --PROJECT NUMBER......1 R43 GM55462-01                 INVESTIGATOR NAME/ADDRESS FY  97    HODJAT, HOSSEIN K IRG/INTRAMURAL UNIT..ZRG3                             OMNI CHROM, INC AWARD AMOUNT.........   $100,000                      10-B HENSHAW ST WOBURN, MA 01801 PERFORMING ORGANIZATION: OMNI CHROM, INC. TITLE   DISPLACEMENT PURIFICATIONS OF ODNAS WITH NOVEL COLUMNS ABSTRACT: A novel ion-exchange stationary phase will be developed for displacement chromatography of synthetic phosphorothioate oligonucleotide. To date, this class of compounds are purified using ion-exchange and reversed phase-chromatography with non-linear elution techniques. These methods suffer from low recovery, non-predictable selectivity and very un- economical use of the stationary phases. The proposed research will focus on the optimization of the surface chemistry with the use of minimal amount of oligonucleotides. The base material will be made of non-porous polystyrene divinylbenzene with high chemical and physical stability. The surface of the polystyrene support will be coated first with a covalent, non-charged, hydroxyl rich, hydrophilic layer. The hydroxyl groups are then reacted with amine functionalities and, secondary interactions are controlled by derivatizing the resulting amines with activated glycols. The optimized surface will separate phosphorothioate oligonucleotides based exclusively on their length even at overloaded conditions. The separation power of displacement chromatography on the new columns will be demonstrated by micropreparative purification of crude synthetic phosphorothioate oligonucleotides. The proposed research will provide new test methods for analyzing chromatographic surfaces for displacement chromatography as well.",

A conceptual design for the vehicle was generated which meets the competing requirements for set-back load, launch weight and flight time while providing sufficient airspeed to sustain a prescribed search pattern through prevailing winds.  The need for high L/D and high span loading is met by a wing with inflated spars supporting a fabric skin.  The technology for this structure is proven and provides an efficient, affordable, gun-harden0d wing.  Four folding fins stabilize the vehicle in ballistic flight and generate the roll torque commanded by a simple but effective flight controller.  Propulsion is provided by a Wankel rotary engine fueled by propane and driving a pusher propeller, the rotary engine being well suited to gun hardening. The flight configuration has aspect-ratio 8 60-inch winds and 28.1 lb gross weight, for an airspeed at maximum endurance of 64 KTAS.

The proposed sensor/terrain (airport) database range correlation algorithm will be based on representing the terrain as a compact wireframe model and correlating the multispectral stereo sensor based imagery with the corresponding wireframe model based synthetic imagery extracted from the prestored airport database.  The need for multispectral sensor fusion is driven by the wide dynamic range of the ambient illumination typical of outdoor imagery.  The requirement for stereo sensors and sensor/database correlation is driven by the need to generate consistent and sufficiently precise range estimates, suitable for real time vehicle guidance and control applications.  It is anticipated that this technology will be required by the planned national airspace plane, due to crew station visibility restrictions during approach and landing operations.",

        "abstract": "Cooling and drying of feed pellets are the most important operations in the feed manufacturing industry.  These operations are carried out simultaneously, in a single machine, by passing ambient air through a moving bed of pellets.  However, simultaneous control of both these processes is very difficult.  Overdrying of pellets is a common problem that costs several million dollars to feed processing industries due to loss in the weight of the finished product.  Avoiding of overdrying can cause insufficient cooling that can lead to spoilage and spontaneous heating of pellets in the storage.  This research aims to develop a computer program for the numerical simulation of various types of coolers/dryers used in the feed processing industry.  This computational tool can be used for developing various control strategies for these coolers.  During Phase I of this research, the ability of such a computer code for process optimization and design improvments of cooler performance will be demonstrated.  During Phase II, the numerical model will be validated under actual field conditions and the capabilities of Phase I computer code will be enhanced.",

Greco, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-97ER82411\nAmount:  $74,995\n\nThere is a need for high figure of merit nonlinear crystals for harmonic generation in the infrared and for use in optical parametric oscillators to produce continuously tunable laser radiation.  CdGeAs2 single crystals have an exceptionally high nonlinear optical coefficient (351 pm/V), optical transparency from 2.5 to 16 \u00bfm and are phasematchable over the entire transparency range.  The unavailability of large optically perfect crystals with low absorption in the fundamental transparency region has precluded the use of CdGeAs2 crystals to generate intense tunable infrared radiation.  We propose to develop a crystal growth process that will yield crystals of high optical perfection.  In Phase I, a synthesis process will be developed to produce pure CdGeAs2 for use as feed-stock for crystal growth.  The horizontal gradient freeze technique will be explored for crystal growth.  Test samples will be characterized by several methods and the results used to improve the crystal growth process.  Post growth treatments will be studied to reduce optical absorption.  The results of Phase I will provide the technology base for the development of a commercial process for the growth of large high optical quality CdGeAs2 single crystals.\nIn Phase II, the crystal growth process will be scaled-up and optimized.\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  CdGeAs2 crystals have important potential applications in producing tunable infrared laser radiation from 2.5 to 16 \u00bfm and for SHG of CO2 lasers.  Applications include optical countermeasure systems, remote sensing of chemical species and contaminants in the atmosphere, and spectroscopy._",

The new technology is derived from a model of the nervous system, called Virtual Network.  The model explains and simulates human capability to perform complex real time tasks in the uncertain environment, such as flying aircrafts or controlling power plants, with the help of a fast but small capacity Short Term Memory and large capacity hut slow Long Term Memory.  According to the model, integrative processes in Long Term Memory underlie the efficiency of human performance.  Incorporating the architecture and operational principles of human memory in the decision aid allows fast approximate solution of new large -scale problems based on diverse experiences accumulated throughout the aid's history.

Case-based reasoning will be used to define a set of incident/response pairs for network and security management.  We will use our case-based reasoning tool to provide a way for network and security managers to update the case-base to match newly discovered threats, and investigate the process of automatic adaptation and decentralized updating of case-bases via an automated alert distribution process.

Recent advances in high resolutions synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology, operating at low frequencies (VHF-UHF), have demonstrated significant capability for detection and classification of such targets.  However, one of the primary difficulties is the significant amount of processing throughput and memory required to realize real-time operation.  Integrated Sensors, Inc. (ISI) proposes an implementation which leverages the high throughput of various specialized DSP devices by integrating them into a highly efficient heterogeneous parallel processor optimized for the FOPEN SAR function.  Algorithm alternatives, partitioning, and parametric trades will be evaluated with the purpose of achieving maximum algorithm-hardware synergy.  Improvements in critical processing performance areas will be demonstrated using representative hardware components, such as SHARP's BDSP 9124block floating point device, which will be integrated into ISI's Mercury based heterogeneous test bed.  By making judicious algorithm tradeoffs and carefully matching specific processing resources to different aspects of the problem, one can reasonably expect an order of magnitude improvement in performance.  A strawman design for a Phase II real-time heterogeneous processor will also be developed.",

Recent developments in process support  technologies, in general, and process modeling, in particular, have brought  this technology area to the forefront in system engineering.  However, the  engineering of complex computer-based systems imposes additional process  representation and process management requirements to those imposed by  the traditional uses of process modeling (i.e., software engineering, business  process re-engineering, human-system integration, microelectronics design,  and workflow automation).  The proposed effort is concerned with: 1)  developing a semantically correct and complete representation for modeling,  evaluating, and assessing complex computer-based systems; 2) creating a  concept prototype of a process modeling tool for system design evaluation,  and assessment; and 3) demonstrating its application on a sample Navy  problem.",

The objective of Internet access is to reduce/control costs of training.  The tools would be designed to allow asynchronous (just in time) education to be combined with synchronous (live) interaction with trainers to dramatically improve the effectiveness and timeliness of training at a distance.The resulting collaborative learning environment will include:  1. synchronous application sharing, 2. desktop video and/or audio conferencing support, 3. student polling and assessment tools, and 4. sessions controls for scheduling. At the conclusion of Phase I, ILINC will deliver a prototype where clients will be able to do synchronous audio and application conferencing over minimum network connections of 28.8 kilo baud.  With the addition of a video conferencing board, inexpensive camera, and network connection supporting 512 kilobits/sec on a multicasting network, we will be able to support audio/video/data synchronous training to over 40 sites at the same time.

Ozone   decontamination technology shall be tested on agent simulants in a   laboratory breadboard system as the overall objective of this   research proposal.  Ozone can decontaminate both biological and   chemical agents.  The biological inactivation mechanism by ozone is   directly applicable to the necrosis of biological agents.  Ozone   lyses pathogen cell walls, releasing the cytoplasm into solution,   destroying the cell in one step.  Ozone can also oxidize chemicals   rapidly and effectively, due to its high oxidation potential.  In   reaction with many organics, oxone adds to teh double or triple   bond site to yield unstable ozonides.  The unstable ozonides may   continue propogation steps dioxide and water.  This general   mechanism is the predicted mechanism for ozone reactions with   agents such as HD, VX, GD, GB and GA.  The development and control   of a means for applying ozone for the emergency decontamination of   field personnel, equipment and water supplies will provide the   Department of Defense a versatile decontamination method with   widespread utility.

Processing time is the single largest constraint on digital processing in real time.  A high speed, modular FPGA based video processing system is proposed to correct geometric lens distortions, linearize imaging arrays and interpolate dead imaging cells.  This system, while physically small can readily maintain the data rates required for real-time processing.

These optically interconnectable layers will be stacked to form a monolithic-like rugged structure with enhanced overall performance.  Proposed implementation will allow to interchange the technology of the supporting elements without any disturbance to the original integration technology.  Flexibility and the transparency of the potting medium may eliminate the need of through substrate links.  Therefore, off-the-shelf optoelectronic and electronic components can be used without any design modification, lowering the cost and enhancing the manufacturability.  Optically interconnected modules will be critical to applications that requires large among of data exchange and processing, such as optical switching, sorting and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

The proposed 3D Hyperspectral Sensor and Processor integrates a real time processing engine with the area array sensor to greatly improve the data reduction bottle neck.  In the proposed example, nearly a 1000 to 1 data compression is achieved on a hyperspectral system collecting 512 x 512 spatial pixels by 512 spectral pixel data cubes in a 2 second interval.  The low power (300 milliwatts) analog processor is mounted on the focal plane, integral with the detector array.  The processor computes the weighted sums of the acquired spectrum with a test template and outputs a correlation or fit factor of the spectrum to the template.  The processor is capable of comparing every spectra acquired against 4000 templates.  The data rate between the sensor and the processor is 7x10 (super 8) Hz.  This data rate is reduced to 1x10(super 6) Hz out of the processor and out of the dewar.  Circuit density is achieved by construction of an 8 chip stacked module.",

Treglio, Principal Investigator\nMr. Robert J. Stinner, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG03-97ER82412\nAmount:  $74,669\n\n   \nThere is a need in industry to be able to deposit hard coatings, such as titanium nitride, on non-conducting materials, such as plastics and glass for improved wear resistance, lower friction, and, in the case of glass, better optical properties -- all of which can lead to lower energy \nusage.  Adhesion of the coatings to such materials is greatly enhanced if  the surface is implanted with metal ions prior to the deposition.  However, systems are not commercially available that can metal ion implant and deposit hard coatings on insulators at the rates needed for commercial feasibility.  This project is to develop a production capable surface modification system employing metal ions rather than gas ions resulting in less blistering, greater adhesion, and improved performance.  A multi-source metal ion implantation system will be combined with a set of metal deposition sources -- sputtering, cathodic arc, et al. -- to form a high-throughput unit that can ion implant and coat a wide variety of substrates, including insulators.  The purpose of Phase I will be to demonstrate the deposition of titanium nitride, a coating used extensively on cutting tools, onto insulating substrates.  A cathodic arc source will form a titanium metal flux, which, in the presence of nitrogen, will deposit a titanium nitride coating.  Prior to the coating, the substrate surface will be sputter cleaned by a titanium ion beam, which will also bombard the surface during the deposition to control coating structure.  In Phase II, a multi-source metal ion implanter will be combined with multiple cathodic arc sources to demonstrate full commercial-scale surface treatment.\nCommercial Applications And Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Potential commercial applications include replacement of hexavalent chromium, a known carcinogen, on a large number of industrial and commercial components; deposition of hard coatings on insulators, including plastics; and large area decorative coatings.  _",

        "abstract": "Thermal control of a space satellite in orbit is usually accomplished by balancing the energy emitted by the satellite as infrared radiation against the energy dissipated by internal electrical (and other) sources plus energy absorbed from the environment. Due to changing conditions as the satellite orbits there is strong need for a simple thermal control surface operable with low electric power. Components of an electrochromic thin film structure operating in the mid-infrared (1 to 14 microns) have been demonstrated at the University of Nebraska. Preliminary data show a potential for switching of up to 70% of the emissivity in the mid-infrared. The purpose of the Phase I proposal is to test the feasibility of a electrochromically switchable large area thermal control surfaces over the spectral range 1 to 30 microns. This covers most of the Blackbody radiation spectrum of a spacecraft at a few degrees Celsius. The proposed work partners the materials preparation capability at the University of Nebraska with the extensive optical and thermal measurements experience and capability at the J. A. Woollam Co., Inc.. In Phase II we will build and test large area devices and transfer the deposition technology to a commercial optical coatings company.  The benefits of this research and development when carried through Phases I, II and III will be operating commercially available spacecraft thermal infrared optical switches. These also have application in laser defense weapons systems and infrared optoelectronics.",

Injection of an optical signal into a semiconductor laser modifies the resonant coupling between the carriers and circulating optical field.  This modification can be exploited to generate modulated output with a modulation frequency which is tunable in the microwave and millimeter-wave frequency regimes.  A phase-locked modulated signal can be constructed with a feedback loop and a stable reference.  Experimental demonstration will be combined with modeling to determine the laser parameters necessary to generate a tunable carrier frequency in the 20 to 60 GHz range.  Near monolithic integration of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers into optoelectronic circuits will be investigated.",

        "abstract": "The need to detect and locate individual landmines and minefields using man-portable or vehicle-mounted mine detectors is expected to continue, either as a stand-alone capability or a complement to remote detection.  Casualties are common, yet minimal improvements to conventional mine detectors have been realized.  This proposal introduces two new sensing capabilites that are complementary and have real potential for near term field deployability and supportability.  These are a magnetoquasistatic, inductive sensor called the Meandering Winding Magnetometer (MWM), and an electroquasistatic, capacitive sensor called an Interdigitated Electrode Dielectrometer (IDED).  The five objectives of this proposed Phase I effort are:  (1) demonstrate the potential to detect, identify, and measure depth and shape of buried metallic objects, using an MWM, (2) demonstrate potential to detect, identify, and measure depth of buried non-metallic objects, using an IDED, (3) determine the range of objects that must be detected and the surrounding compositions that must be penetrated, (4) investigate signal processing and optimization requirements, and (5) determine mission suitability.  The Phase I effort will include both model-based simulations and experimental demonstrations of capability.  The Phase II effort will also investigate synergism of the quantitative IDED and MWM mine detection capabilities with available and anticipated remote detection technologies.  Successful completion of the Phase I effort will provide the Army with an enhanced capability to detect metallic landmines, and a new ability to detect plastic or other non-metallic landmines.  This will provide quantitative characterization features for integration into multi-sensor systems.  Successful results will also enhance traditional nondestructive evaluation applications, such as aging infrastructure inspection.",

While it is generally believed that the cost of materials makes non-silicon photovoltaic cells prohibitively expensive unless one can develop thin film cells, this thesis is wrong for thermophotovoltaic cells.  Specifically for the GaSb cell, the Ga and Sb material contribution to the electric power cost is only 7.3 cents per Watt.  The real cell costs in high volume production are associated with process costs, and the GaSb cell process can be made inexpensive by copying the silicon solar cell process.  This has already been done by using diffusions for junction formation and converted silicon Czochalski pullers for crystal growth.  JX Crystals is proposing to undertake several additional process improvements imitating the simple silicon solar cell process, at every step from crystal growth to wafer sawing to wafer handling.  By imitating the silicon cell process, JX Crystals believes that Ga Sb thermophotovoltaic cells can be made in high volume production at a cost of under $1 per Watt.",

The Phase II research will demonstrate an economical manufacturing technique using a dual ion-gun system with a continuous rolling mechanism for the mass production of rolled capacitors, and will also demonstrate a packaged DLC capacitor of high energy density, smaller size, and lower weight as compared to current film capacitors.The main objective of Phase II will involve the assembly and demonstration of a manufacturing operation which combines the DLC deposition system, the capacitor rolling operation and the capacitor encapsulation processes into a single modular system housed within a 100 square foot area.  The whole operation will be assembled within a cleanroom enclosure of no more than 375 square feet.

        "abstract": "Thermal Management has become the limiting factor in the advancement of many electronic systems.  Current thermal management materials have either reached their performance limits or are impractical due to high costs.  As applications for high density, high clock rate electronics increase, new cooling techniques and materials are required to allow low cost, high reliability operation.  Technology Corporation has identified the opportunity to produce a low cost ( < $1/lbs) loaded polymer with low mass density (180 W/mK).  This loaded polymer system has the potential to produce heat sinks that cost less than one half aluminum with less mass and equivalent thermal performance.  The specific technical aspects of this proposal are considered proprietary and are discussed in detail in the technical proposal.  What is proposed is the combination of two mature technologies to produce 1) a high performance composite material at low cost and 2) polymer molding methods that are conducive to the bulk production of prismatic (e.g. heat sinks) and/or moldable geometric shapes.  The proposal identifies the enormous market potential, both military and commercial, the developed material has.  With the current packaging trends, smaller and faster, low cost high performance thermal management materials are in high demand.  Military and Aerospace, automaotive applications, and electric powered vehicles require advanced cooling techniques for both motor controllers, integrated electronics, and power supplies.",

        "abstract": "Using time-resolved digital imaging spectroscopy, we propose to implement high throughput solid phase filter assays for enzyme activity.  This will allow us to screen large numbers (> 10(6)) of enzyme variants for improved activity directly in bacterial colonies.  KAIROS' Digital Imaging Spectrophotometer (Colonylmager) will be adapted to the problem of imaging bacterial colony lifts on solid supports (i.e., filters) with colorimetric substrates for specific enzymes.  A series of such images versus time will provide information on the substrate turnover rate by each colony.  Phase I research and development will focus on improving the filter assay technique and on refining the imaging software used to obtain kinetic data.  New software will analyze intra-feature pixel statistics, so as to minimize the distribution of rates obtained from a homogeneous population of colonies.  This will enable the identification of colonies exhibiting substrate turnover rates marginally different from wild-type in subsequent mutagenesis experiments.  Filter assays and imaging techniques will be made broadly applicable to common colorimetric indicators, beginning with hydrolytic substrates such as X-glu, X-gal, and BCIP.  In Phase II, we plan to screen large numbers of enzyme variants for improved catalytic activity and adaptation to harsh conditions, such as high temperature, high/low pH, and organic solvents.  We also plan to implement larger format scanners in place of the Colonylmager's CCD camera in order to achieve still higher throughput at lower cost.",

        "abstract": "Klein Associates proposes using a decision-centered design approach to develop an advanced interface configuration for a realistic single- and multi-platform mission rehearsal system. Our approach is contrasted with the more traditional approaches of data- and system-centered design. With decision-centered design the critical and difficult judgments and decisions required for mission success for three platforms will be identified. These will be used as the basis for determining the critical concepts and design features necessary for implementation of the interface. These decision requirements will be elicited through cognitive task analysis (CTA). The results of the CTA, in conjunction with the mission rehearsal requirements by platform, will be used to outline an intelligent architecture for the system interface design. \"Intelligent\" is used to mean a system that provides crews of different platforms with the information they need, when they need it, in a format that supports their use of it, while making effective and efficient-use of the available cpu cycles and bandwidths. The deliverables for the Phase I work will be detailed in a final report describing the requirements for mission success (by platform), decision requirements tables, and design recommendations.",

Many of these difficulties can be addressed by adding more context to messages, but context itself contributes to information overload.  Simplistic solutions will not work here.  The approach proposed is to identify the cognitive requirements of the entire team.  Cognitive engineering methods will be adapted to this objective to provide a perspective on the attention, working memory, long-term memory, and metacognitive aspects of distributed teams.  This methodology will be used to study an information Warfare data collection function:  information seeking.  By studying a specific Information Warfare task in parallel with developing and shaping techniques, we will ensure that the recommended methodology can be responsive to the needs of potential users.  The output of the Phase I effort will be a methodology for capturing the cognitive requirements of distributed Information Warfare teams, the reasons for difficulty in achieving these reuqirements, types of errors that are found, and strategies and patterns used by teams that have learned to be skillful",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will create an event representation framework and generate a catalogue of reasoning mechanisms for transforming domain specific events into a convenient representational framework.  The choice of the representation scheme used to model a domain for analysis by the neural network of fuzzy logic system can make an enormous difference in the ease and efficiency of the problem analysis.  Typically, no particular paradigm is best for modeling systems -- multiple models are used to obtain useful inferences.  This strategy entails combining multiple bodies of information and establishing a framework for global interpretation of context specific information.  The absence of sound and proven techniques that facilitate integrated information modeling and create efficient, global event-in-scenario representations makes such neural network and fuzzy logic applications difficult.  The proof of concept for these methodologies will be demonstrated through a prototype for an Generalized Event Representation Modeling and Analysis Tool (GERMAT) for the new generation information processing paradigms.  The product is commercially viable -- it will popularize use of neural networks and fuzzy logic application by simplifying modeling in these paradigms, facilitating re-use of information between different neural network and fuzzy logic applications, and facilitating integrated modeling that addresses complex real world problems.  A generic framework to rapidly model neural network/fuzzy logic applications would have significant benefits in pattern recognition, forecasting modeling, decision support systems, and control systems.",

An important class of such flows occurs in the automotive industry where drag forces and cross-wind stability are of concern in the design of automotive shapes.  Although Computational Fluid Dynamics has been used with some success, the greatest unrealized  potential benefit is rapid feedback on drag and stability while concepts are being considered during the computer-aided design process.  The development of such a capability is the primary goal of this project.   Phase I will focus on achieving dramatic improvements through devising new parallel algorithms for the rapid determination of velocities computed using the Fast Multipole Method.  During Phase II the focus will be on developing commercial software enabling engineering design calculations encountered in the design of low drag, aerodynamically stable ground vehicles.  \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The proposed technology and software may be utilized in numerous applications, varying from automotive configuration design, analysis of cross-flow and wake effects on vehicles, to general aviation issues.  Small improvements in the design of such systems could lead to enormous savings in operational costs. _",

The proposed polymers will contain one or more covalently attached ligands that work cooperatively to transfer charge between them (birchromophore).

An extremely large change in absorption has been demonstrated in solution by chemically reacting similar species with strong oxidants.  Our goal I this effort is to prepare a class of polymers containing donor species (strong absorbers) with one or more charge acceptors to facilitate a rapid and reversible absorption change which would protect human eyesight or other sensitive detectors.

Enzyme expression and L-dopa production will be measured using immunochemical and biochemical assays.  This research strategy allows for characterization and optimization of the dopaminergic properties of hNT-Neurons in vitro prior to animal studies planned in Phase II.  Functional, dopaminergic, human neuronal cells are scientifically promising, technologically superior to other cell systems, and commercially viable as a treatment for Parkinson's disease. $ = TOTAL AWARD AMTS & NOT LIMITED TO PORTION OF PROJECT RELATED TO SUBJECT OF SEARCH SUBPROJECT $ = TOTAL AWARD AMOUNT DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF SUBPROJECTS SOURCE:  CRISP  FORMAT F    FY 97      LAST UPDATE 04-07-98 1QUERY 1536                        ID SEARCH 06/01/98   PAGE    502 --PROJECT NUMBER......1 R43 NS36505-01                 INVESTIGATOR NAME/ADDRESS FY  97    OZGUZ, VOLKAN IRG/INTRAMURAL UNIT..ZRG1                             IRVINE SENSORS CORPORATION AWARD AMOUNT.........    $99,572                      3001 REDHILL AVE, BLDG #3 COSTA MESA, CA  92626 PERFORMING ORGANIZATION: IRVINE SENSORS CORPORATION TITLE   A FLEXIBLE, ULTRATHIN CIRCUIT TO ANALYZE SLEEP DISORDERS ABSTRACT: Irvine Sensors Corporation proposes an ultrathin, flexible, lightweight and unobtrusive Band-Aid-like electronic suitable for the analysis of fatigue, sleep disorders and other biomedical sensing applications.  The proposed circuit would be affixed to the human eyebrow or temple to collect data from a small piezoelectric or coil-based sensor placed on the eyelid.  Ultrafine wiring will connect the sensor to the data collection unit.  A paperlike thin-film battery will provide power to the memory, A/D converter and sensor suite.  A low-power RF unit will be used to communicate with a receiver worn on a belt. Research has demonstrated a correlation between eyelid activity and fatigue, loss of alertness and loss of vigilance.  The proposed accurate, cost-effective, reliable ambulatory monitoring device would facilitate patient compliance in in-home and remote studies, contribute to the identification and treatment of undiagnosed sleep disorders and sleep loss and reduce the danger and cost of catastrophic accidents. The successful completion of the proposed effort will enable a revolutionary approach to electronic packaging.  The proposed invention will have significant commercial application is the following broad categories of technology application: (1) conformal packaging; (2) space saving, (3) heat transfer enhancement; (4) capacitance reduction; and (5) environmental reliability. $ = TOTAL AWARD AMTS & NOT LIMITED TO PORTION OF PROJECT RELATED TO SUBJECT OF SEARCH SUBPROJECT $ = TOTAL AWARD AMOUNT DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF SUBPROJECTS SOURCE:  CRISP  FORMAT F    FY 97      LAST UPDATE 04-07-98 1QUERY 1536                        ID SEARCH 06/01/98   PAGE    503 --PROJECT NUMBER......1 R43 NS36507-01                 INVESTIGATOR NAME/ADDRESS FY  97    ZHOU, LI-MING IRG/INTRAMURAL UNIT..ZRG1                             COGNETIX INC AWARD AMOUNT.........    $95,368                      807 E SOUTH TEMPLE, SUITE 310 SALT LAKE CITY, UT  84102 PERFORMING ORGANIZATION: COGNETIX, INC. TITLE   CONANTOKINS FOR TREATMENT OF EPILEPSY ABSTRACT: DESCRIPTION (Investigator's Abstract): (They) propose to characterize conantokin peptides for treatment of epilepsy. Conantokins, a family of small peptides (17-27 amino acids) isolated from the venom of fish-hunting cone snails, are specific antagonists of NMDA receptors in the mammalian central nervous system.  Conantokins inhibit NMDA-elicited currents and NMDA- stimulated cyclic GMP formation.  Their laboratories performed the first in vivo studies showing that conantokins exhibit a potent antiseizure activity in animals.  Conantokins were shown to be some of the most potent compounds ever tested in the Frings audiogenic seizure-susceptible mouse model.  In addition, conantokins showed low neurotoxicity, as determined by relating the toxic dose (rotorod performance) to the effective dose.  Therefore, conantokins represent a unique, highly potent and novel class of compounds for treatment of CNS disorders.  In Phase I, we propose to: test conantokins for antiseizure activity using three different experimental animal models; compare the in vivo antiseizure activity of conantokins with their in vitro receptor binding activity; identify and evaluate new natural conantokins; and synthesize chimeras of conantokins to initiate structure function studies.  In Phase II, more extensive in vivo characterization of conantokins for treatment of seizure disorders will be carried out.  Moreover, they will establish a program for synthesis of conantokin peptidomimetics, which should increase the bioavailability of these molecules. $ = TOTAL AWARD AMTS & NOT LIMITED TO PORTION OF PROJECT RELATED TO SUBJECT OF SEARCH SUBPROJECT $ = TOTAL AWARD AMOUNT DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF SUBPROJECTS SOURCE:  CRISP  FORMAT F    FY 97      LAST UPDATE 04-07-98 1QUERY 1536                        ID SEARCH 06/01/98   PAGE    504 --PROJECT NUMBER......1 R43 NS36520-01                 INVESTIGATOR NAME/ADDRESS FY  97    ALSTEN, CHRISTOPHER R IRG/INTRAMURAL UNIT..ZRG1                             INNER HEALTH, INC AWARD AMOUNT.........   $100,000                      PO BOX 1609 IDYLLWILD, CA  92549-1609 PERFORMING ORGANIZATION: INNER HEALTH, INC.

The treatment program is based around an audiocassette integrating relaxation techniques, cognitive restructuring, imagery and other psychological techniques along with traditional sleep hygiene and other behavioral treatment materals organized in a \"self-directed\" system.  This prototype audiocassette Program incorporates a new 3-Dimensional \"virtual reality\" like sound technology that enhances imagery, realism and, it is believed, efficacy.  Elements of the prototype program has successfully been piloted in clinical settings with psychiatric patients, and has been used to train Air Force aircrew members to sleep more effectively in spite of circadian desynchronization.   This study would be the first step leading to FDA approvable claims for the program's ability to alleviate insomnia.  This would provide an effective and easy to use alternative to sedative-hypnotics which will have significant market potential. $ = TOTAL AWARD AMTS & NOT LIMITED TO PORTION OF PROJECT RELATED TO SUBJECT OF SEARCH SUBPROJECT $ = TOTAL AWARD AMOUNT DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF SUBPROJECTS SOURCE:  CRISP  FORMAT F    FY 97      LAST UPDATE 04-07-98 1QUERY 1536                        ID SEARCH 06/01/98   PAGE    505 --PROJECT NUMBER......1 R43 NS36878-01                 INVESTIGATOR NAME/ADDRESS FY  97    MARGOLIN, LEE D IRG/INTRAMURAL UNIT..ZDA1                             FHC INC AWARD AMOUNT.........   $100,000                      9 MAIN STREET BOWDOINHAM, ME 04008 PERFORMING ORGANIZATION: FHC, INC. TITLE   TRIMODAL ELECTRODE SYSTEM FOR PALLIDOTOMY AND THALAMOTOMY ABSTRACT: Following the appearance of several promising reports in the medical literature, the use of pallidotomy and thalamotomy for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease-related movement disorders has been steadily increasing over the past few years. The resurgence in these two surgical techniques can be attributed in part to the development of more reliable microlesioning systems and more accurate brain mapping techniques. Our goal is to develop a single intracranial microelectrode system that will incorporate three key components: 1.) a trimodal (i.e., recording, stimulation, lesion) microelectrode coated with biocompatible insulating materials, 2.) appropriate electronics for the control of the trimodal microelectrode, and 3.) micropositioning elements. By combining recording, stimulation and lesioning functions with biocompatible technology and materials, the trimodal microelectrode will access target brain areas with less damage to healthy tissue. Microelectrode function will be simplified by integrating each mode into a single control module. The system will Include custom-designed micropositioners. This approach will provide a degree of safety and accuracy not currently available by simplifying surgical mapping calculations and minimizing component switching error. Offering all these features in a single package will allow its pricing to be very competitive and make its clinical use more cost effective.",

        "abstract": "The primary objective of this effort is to develop tractable techniques to automatically extract terrain and geologic features from interferometric SAR (IFSAR) imagery and Digital Terrain Elevation (DTE) data produced from IFSAR phase data. A secondary objective is to develop performance prediction techniques for the extraction process. Today terrain information extraction from aerial imagery remains mainly a labor intensive, manual practice. Leighly and Associates, Inc., believe the reasons for this lack of progress has been (1) the lack of terrain organization domain knowledge and the use of context in automated image analysis approaches and (2) the lack of data suitable for tractable and robust solutions. This effort addresses both areas of weakness. An approach will be developed which builds on methods for predicting the occurrence of a limited set of geologic landforms in any given physiographic area, and developing strategies which selectively employ terrain partitioning, identification, and attribution algorithms to three-dimensional SAR image data (IFSAR image and associated DTE data). The initial area of interest will concern southwestern U.S. regions where IFSAR data exists. Methods for predicting feature extraction performance for IFSAR data will be developed that are ajso based on the terrain organization approach to automated feature extraction. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - This effort addresses terrain analysis and in turn terrain analysis supports many dual use applications. Examples of military operations supported by terrain analysis include combat operations planning, automated weapons guidance, IFB, simulation terrain data bases, etc. Examples of civilian value include: site evaluation/engineering, remote surveying, geologica.1 surveys, flooding potential/prediction, etc. Methods and techniques developed here may evolve to processing IFSAR satellite data. Documented methods developed will be useful for training terrain analysts.",

We will investigate techniques to scale our existing laboratory OPO from its present 2.5 watt power level at 3.4um to the ten watt level.  This OPO is pumped with 13 watts from a 1064 nm. laser diode pumped Nd:YAG laser, is singly resonant at the 1.54 pm signal, and uses periodically poled iiNbO3 (PPLN) as the nonlinear crystal.  Pump energy depletion is an amazing 85%.  To obtain higher OPO outputs in the 3-5 micron range, the PPLN needs to be scaled to larger thickness so that the average power density of our present unit can be maintained.  Also, if we can drive the OPos with multi- transverse mode Nd:YAG lasers and sufficiently maintain the OPOs' spectral and spatial beam qualities then the resulting mid-infrared source will be simpler, more efficient, and hence less costly than if we used a single-transverse mode drive Nd:YAG laser.  Therefore, the Phase I program will concentrate on poling thicker PPLN crystals and building and characterizing a cw singly resonant OPO with A multi-mode pump laser.  The Phase II goal is to build a cw OPO using a 50 watt Nd:YAG laser and pumping an OPO that can deliver up to 10 watts over a large portion of the 3-5 micron wavelength range.",

We have recently conceived of a novel spectral processor based upon reduced bit depth logic.  Originally developed as a means for very rapid calculations of frequency (Doppler)  spectra for laser radar applications, it appears that the same type of hardware processor can be applied to image correlation, and hence detection of motion within images.

Since the treatment of B. microti infections (malaria-like intraerythrocytic parasite) is vastly different to Lyme disease there is a need for an accurate serology test to differentiate the two infections.

TITLE   AN AUTOMATED CHEMILUMINESCENT TEST FOR E COLI 0157:H7 ABSTRACT: DESCRIPTION: Development of rapid detection kits for viral and bacterial infectious diseases is the mission of this company. Particularly, there is an emerging need for rapid detection of E. coli O157:H7 in clinics and the food industry. A rapid, accurate, and sensitive chemiluminescence detection method for E. coli O157:H7 will be demonstrated using an automated light-sensor based luminometer with disposable plastic cassettes. The antigens of bacteria in the suspected sample will be specifically or non-specifically captured on the barriers of a pair of cassettes and the presence of O157 and H7 antigens will be determined by the output of emitted light intensity based on the binding of two specific antibodies labeled with an enzyme for both antigens. The whole procedure of the test requires only 5 minutes for each antigen to be detected. The sensitivity is sensitive to less than 10 to the 5th cells per ml or 4,000 cells per sample. The specificity of the test will reach 100% because the presence of both O157 and H7 antigens is the confirmation of E. coli O157:H7 strain in serotyping. The study of phase II will advance to analyzing clinical specimens and food samples. This detection system will be readily used in rapid and sensitive detection of any human or animal pathogens or the antigen related antibodies without requiring any advanced laboratory equipment. $ = TOTAL AWARD AMTS & NOT LIMITED TO PORTION OF PROJECT RELATED TO SUBJECT OF SEARCH SUBPROJECT $ = TOTAL AWARD AMOUNT DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF SUBPROJECTS SOURCE:  CRISP  FORMAT F    FY 97      LAST UPDATE 04-07-98 1QUERY 1536                        ID SEARCH 06/01/98   PAGE     92 --PROJECT NUMBER......1 R43 AI41862-01A1               INVESTIGATOR NAME/ADDRESS FY  97    WATANABE, KYOICHI A IRG/INTRAMURAL UNIT..ZRG3                             CODON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC AWARD AMOUNT.........   $100,000                      200 PERRY PARKWAY GAITHERSBURG, MD  20877 PERFORMING ORGANIZATION: CODON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

TITLE   PHOTODYNAMIC TREATMENT OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS INFECTIONS ABSTRACT: Staphylococcus aureus wound infections are the most common infections that occur in humans resulting in delayed and poor wound healing, sepsis and death.  They are the most common causative bacteria in acute wound infections as well as chronic wound infections. Unfortunately, Staphylococcus aureus in the general population has developed significant resistance to all commonly used oral antibiotics with over 90 percent of strains being methicilllin resistant. Furthermore, standard scrubbing techniques of wounds with povodine- iodine solutions do not affect the bacterial counts of staphylococcus aureus in open wounds. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a modality that involves the use of a photosensitizing agent and laser light to create oxygen radicals resulting in the destruction of cancer cells, bacteria, viruses as well as fungi. Several dyes commonly used in medical practice are excellent photodynamic agents ie, methylene blue and toluidene blue.  These agents in combination with the appropriate wavelength of light have resulted in the destruction of antibiotic resistant staphylococcus aureus. The proposed research will attempt to establish the feasibility of PDT treatment with topical dyes as a means to antiseptically treat acutely infected wounds in an animal model, demonstrating the effectiveness, ease and minimal morbidity of this treatment.",

        "abstract": "This proposal describes a means of leveraging the multi-billion dollar investment that has been made in GPS navigation Systems and components.  It will produce a low-cost, low-power, credit-card sized head tracking and motion capture system suitable for use with vehicle simulators, trainers and operational VR systems which is much less sensitive to occlusion, interference and multi-path contamination than existing solutions.  We have looked at the requirements for motion capture systems and concluded that the same principles of Operation that made OPS successful as a navigation system can be applied to a local area tracking and motion capture system with excellent, cost-effective results.  We also believe that integrated circuits, crystals, RF filters and algorithms developed for low-cost GPS navigation receivers can be re-purposed for motion capture systems resulting in construction of mature tracking systems inside shortened development cycles.  Such a tracking subsystem could become a workhorse for the military and commercial motion capture markets.  The online industry is actively constructing immersive virtual worlds which improve upon video conferencing because people \"enter into\" the media for interaction.  Motion capture is a cornerstone technology for this new virtual communications market.",

        "abstract": "This Phase I project pertains to the synthesis and biological evaluation of novel L-nucleoside-derived antimalarial compounds.  A major recent finding has been that during the development of the malaria parasite in the host erythrocyte, profound alterations are caused in the permeability of the host cell-membrane.  Recent investigations have discovered that a new transport pathway for nucleosides is induced by the parasite in the host cell membrane.  This system is significantly different to any transport system in the host, and has opened the way for the design of selective new antimalarial drugs which cannot enter the host cell membrane (such as L-nucleoside conjugates with cytotoxic drugs).  These compounds have the propensity to be toxic to the parasite without affecting the host cell.  The development of this new approach to malaria chemotherapy is of major significance, as these compounds act by different mechanisms of action from conventional quinoline or acridine antimalarial drugs, and therefore should show no cross-resistance.  At least thirty test compounds based on this concept will be synthesized and evaluated in Phase I studies.  Compounds will be screened for activity against Plasmodium falciparum and their transport and mechanisms of action will be studied.  Test compounds will also be submitted to the U.S. Army's antimalarial testing program.  The project will likely produce a new class of antimalarial drugs for treatment of multi-drug resistant malaria.  The disease kills over 2 million persons worldwide annually and affects over 300 million.  There is therefore a considerable humanitarian benefit as well as commercial potential upon successful completion of the project goals.",

The proposed program will demonstrate two concepts to increase the production rate of laser shock peening by almost an order of magnitude.  It integrates the application and removal of the overlay system completely into the on-line laser shock peening sequence, minimizing delays during processing and utilizing the full capacity of the laser repetition rate.  With this concept, a part would be inserted into the laser workstation and processed continuously, with the laser firing at its qualified rate until the part is completed.  There will be no special pre-peening preparation or post-peening preparation associated with the overlay system.

If  the major materials-based limitations in scope and performance of these tiles can be eliminated, then the problems of radiation resistance and response speed in the fiber optics themselves can be solved.  The Phase I work will be centered on the synthesis and characterization of one or more new green-emitting waveshifting fluorescent materials for these tiles that have unique radiation hardness as well as high speed and high quantum efficiency.  Also, a thorough study of long-wavelength scintillators and corresponding red-emitting fiber optics will be done using both conventional optical read-out elements and the promising new solid state sensors developed in the United States in recent years.

Ceramic membranes with a suitable oxide material and pore size will be selected in conjunction with the development of an operational strategy to control the fouling potential.  Biofilm formation also can be eliminated with the proposed process scheme.  Preliminary economic analysis based upon the feasibility test results indicated both capital and operating costs comparable with existing polymeric membrane systems.  More importantly, the proposed process can deliver the treated water that meets federal regulations in a single one-step operation.  The proposed Phase I study will continue the existing bench-scale study with a focus on long-term operational stability, system optimization, and operating economics.  If successfully developed, the proposed technology and process could be used at more than 37,000 small to mid-sized water utilities in the United States that provide less than 50,000 gpd of drinking water to the public.  In addition, the proposed process also can be implemented for disinfection of secondary effluent from sewage treatment plants as an alternative for post-disinfection.",

These materials offer a number of advantages over mineral (petroleum)-based oils, including excellent low temperature fluidity, very high viscosity index, and superior thermal, pressure, and oxidative stability.  In North America, more than 17 million gallons of synthetic esters valued at more than $130 million are purchased and disposed of yearly.  At present, no commercial technology is available to re-refine spent ester-based synthetic lubricants into virgin quality basestocks.  Media and Process Technology, Inc., has demonstrated that these materials can be re-refined using proprietary technology based upon a modified version of their mineral re-refining LubriClear Process.  Process feasibility has been demonstrated in recent bench treatability tests.  Recycled lubricant with near virgin quality specifications has been produced.  In the Phase I effort, bench tests will be scaled up to the pilot level to conduct various optimization and long-term performance tests. Additionally, larger volumes of finished product will be produced for finished product blending and performance testing by various lubricant packagers.",

For instance, approximately 80% of the cleaning solvents used in the screen printing industry, representing more than $50 million per year in solvent sales, are high flash solvents.  Although solvent costs range from $15 to $30 per gallon, recycling is limited because of the generally small average waste volumes generated in these highly segmented industries.  At present, conventional waste reclamation on this scale is incapable of delivering on spec recycled solvent.  In response, Media and Process Technology, Inc. (M&P) has developed an innovative low-cost, high- performance ceramic membrane technology that can recover high-quality, high flash solvents from spent material in an environmentally friendly manner.  Moreover, this technology has dual use capability and can be used to recover spent rinse waters in these industries.  Process feasibility has been demonstrated in recent bench treatability tests.

        "abstract": "This project will produce a commercial process for manufacturing a new class of cyclodextrin polymers.  After nitration these polymers have the explosives potential to produce high performance with minimal adverse environmental impact.  The polymers can form inclusion complexes with various oxidizers and energetics, thus reducing their sensitivity to detonation due to shock, fire or fragment impact.  Cyclodextrin is a commercially available but relatively new chemical produced by the enzymatic digestion of starch.  When polymerized into a nanotube, it offers a unique dual use technology opportunity.  It can be nitrated to form a safer and more processable energetic than nitrocellulose for use in advanced propulsion and power systems.  In commercial applications the nanotube polymers may be used to encapsulate a variety of materials for use in food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and chemical processing industries.  The anticipated advantages in munitions applications include:-1.3 Explosive classification vs. 1.1 for nitrocellulose-Higher energy, less sensitive explosives-Lower life cycle cost-Shock survivable explosives-Ease of demilitarization-Processable by casting or twin screw extrusion-Desensitizing inclusion complex formation with energetic plasticizers-May eliminate need for inert binders-Fewer ingredients required-Low feedstock cost",

        "abstract": "High-density reconfigurable optical routing interconnect is introduced in this SBIR program for optical signal processing. This structure is based on three key features: 1) Polarization manipulation using 2-D spatial light modulators; 2) polarization complementary geometry; and 3) the throw-away undesired optical energies design. The polarization manipulation provides the basis for \"no-moving\" parts optical routing switchings. The polarization complementary geometry provides high extinction ratio polarization conversion using polarization controlling elements. Finally, the throw-away concept achieves the high performance, low crosstalk optical signal processing units that are independent to the operating environments and conditions. To show this novel concept, a proof-of-principle 1 x 2 optical switch will be constructed. This switch has a specification of -50 dB crosstalk, -1 dB insertion loss, microsecond response times, polarization insensitive operation, wide operating spectrum, low power consumption, and insensitive to the operating temperature. It is a break through optical routing switch that achieves several high mark specifications simultaneously. The architecture proposed in this SBIR can be further extended to other type of optical signal processing units, for examples, the switchable add/drop optical filter, tunable dense-wavelength-division-multiplexing (DWDM) component, switchable WDM, and optical circulator. It is a brand new technology and the potential is enormous in the fields of optical signal processing and fiber optic communications.  The direct impact of this optical switch is that it can replace the conventional opto-mechanical switches that have relatively limited life time and consumed high power. It can be deployed to the fiber optic network for network switching application.It can also be cascaded or formed as a two-dimensional array for more complex N x M optical signal routing processing.",

        "abstract": "Numerous applications exist where cooling is desired for sensors, for only a small portion of the entire spacecraft orbit. These burst power requirements may also be coupled with a requirement to have no vibration during this data gathering period. This problem is often further complicated by the fact that the cooling temperatures are typically cryogenic.  Such cryocooling requirements are typically in the range of 10 to 180 K. Mainstream has developed an innovative approach which can provide passive cooling in this range with active system recharge and the overall specific capacity is in the range of 200 to 570 Watt-Minutes per Pound! Phase I  will provide experimental verification of this  innovative approach and experimentally derived Hard  Numbers to support the cooling capacity per unit mass  claims in this proposal. The development of a simple, rechargeable, vibration-free, lightweight, compact cooling device (for temperature ranges of 10-180K) has tremendous government and commercial spacecraft applications. In addition there are commercial applications wherever specialty gasses such as liquid nitrogen are used for cooling. Therefore the commercial applications would extend to the thousands of commercial users of liquid nitrogen and other gases which are consumed for cooling in laboratory, medical, and industrial applications.",

Mak Technologies has an extensive background in commercially successful distributed simulation products and a growing body of HLA runtime monitoring tools, so a low-risk development foundation is assured.  Our extensive experience in worldwide marketing of simulation tools will significantly further the transitioning of the software developed under this contract to the global HLA community.  During the Phase I work effort, MaK will design an open, collaborative suite of RAM tools.  MaK will also develop a tool FOM to support the interaction among the RAM components and other federates.  MaK is able to produce an initial prototype of a RAM tool suite by leveraging thier existing HLA-compliant commercial products, such as VR-Link, Stalth, and Data Logger.  Each of these tools will be modified to adhere to the RAM API and the RAM Tool FOM.  The developed prototype will not only provide a set of tools currently unavailable in the M&S community, but will also provide a strong starting point for Phase II testing, design, and further development.  MaK's proposed work effort results in an open specification for the RAM Tool Suite, a RAM Tool FOM, and a working prototype which includes the incorporation of two existing commercial HLA tools.  This not only provides a strong foundation for future development, but also provides a jump start on the incorporation of commercail tools into the RAM Tool Suite.",

A principal product of ours for microwave/millimeter wave antennas is the FLAPS phased-surface.  It uitlizes arrays of varying length dipoles to control beam shape and direction.  By dynamic variation of the dipole pattern electronic beam scanning will result.  The specific means of accomplishing this is by a programmable plasma-display -- similar in nature to plasma-display televsion and laptop computers.  The concept and preliminary paratmeters for this are given in our proposal.  The key points are as follows:  (a)  The proposed technique is a merger of two advanced but proven technologies. (b)  The plasma-display elements are highly RF conductive ionized gases. (c)  The resolution, speed and huge number of computer updatable display elements yields a highly dynamic, large RF size electronic antenna with multi-band capability.

Simultaneously, the use of such powders can also result in lower hot-pressing temperatures, aided by the tremendous driving force for densification; lower densification temperatures will be conducive to obtaining smaller grain sizes within  the densified microstructure.  Additionally, such  powders also offer excellent potential of being pressureless-sintered into net-shape bodies. This Phase I program will demonstrate feasibility of synthesizing nanocrystalline powders of SiC, B4C and TiB2 at a low cost, their densification at lower processing temperatures (compared to commercila ceramic powders) without significant grain growth, and the resultant enhancement in fracture resistance under quasistatic loading.",

        "abstract": "A liquid chemical hydride-based hydrogen storage system is proposed for high density hydrogen supply for fuel cell power generation applications.  Research works performed at MER showed that certain liquid hydrides can be catalytically dehydrogenated at temperatures as low as 150\u00bfC.  The released hydrogen gas can be withdrawn from the system through a hydrogen permeable membrane to achieve completed dehydrogenation.  The gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen capacities of these hydrides are about 7.25 wt% and 65 kg/rn3, respectively.  Compared with metal hydride (AB5 or AB2) or solid chemical hydride (LiBH4 or LiAlH4) based systems, the proposed technology has advantages of being single component liquid, high storage densities, easiness to control hydrogen releasing rate and pressure, stability at ambient conditions, recycleability, and low cost.  During the Phase I program, the feasibility of using liquid hydrides for high density hydrogen storage will be determined, i.e., the optimal catalysts for liquid hydride dehydrogenation process will be identified, the operating conditions for hydrogen releasing will be optimized, energy requirement will be estimated, and conceptual design of the liquid hydride based hydrogen storage system will be performed.  The proposed high density, low cost, recyclable hydrogen storage system based on liquid-hydride will find many applications in military and commercial sectors, such as power pack for field soldiers, hydrogen storage tank for fuel cell powered electrical vehicles, and fuel tank for hydrogen internal combustion engines",

Experimental testing has shown that these composite materials exhibit a real susceptibility to structural damage caused by low energy impact.  The resulting impact damage renders the structure unusable, therefore impacting mission readiness and increased costs associated with lost assets.  Analytical models which incorporate dynamical analysis, failure analysis, and micromechanical models appropriate for use with composites are required to fully understand impact damage phenomena and determine design enhancements for survivability.  An analytical methodology will be developed and validated to predict the development of impact damage.  Such a methodology can be used to optimize the design of composite motor cases and launch tubes with significantly improved damage tolerance.  This will greatly enhance the capability of the missile system to satisfy the Department of Defense's Insensitive Munition requirements.  Immediate benefits from this work will allow for increased reliability, mission readiness and reduced costs, consistent with DOD Operating and Support Cost Reduction (OSCR) initiatives.

G. Weiss, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG03-97ER82429\nAmount:  $75,000\nCarbon dioxide flooding is one of the most promising enhanced oil recovery technologies.  To make this process economically viable, however, the gas that accompanies the recovered oil must be treated to recover the associated natural gas liguids and pipeline gas from the carbon dioxide for the latter's reinjection.  Current gas separation systems based on a combination of conventional refrigeration and absorption technology are not readily adaptable to the significant changes in composition and flow rate of the gas that occur as a flood operation proceeds.  However, membrane systems are modular in design and can be economically scaled up and changed as the stream changes.  In fact, membranes are already being used to partially or completely replace absorption processes for carbon dioxide separation.  This project will develop a new membrane type to remove and recover the natural gas liquids  portion of the gas, thus eliminating the currently-required refrigeration plant.  A process based on such membranes is expected to cost less and to be more flexible.  In Phase I, the properties of candidate membrane materials will be determined using model gas mixtures representative of associated gas from carbon dioxide flood operations.  Based on the experimental data, the economic and operational benefits of the technology will be assessed.  In Phase II, the best membrane identified in Phase I will be further developed and the process scaled up for field demonstration.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  If successfully developed, this process will solve a number of the operational problems involved in the use of carbon dioxide flood operations for enhanced oil recovery.

The system willbe based on a site-specific one-dimensional (1-D) soil-canopy-atmospheric boundary layer numericalmodel which is coupled to a three-dimensional (3-D) mesoscale atmospheric numerical model.  Theoutput from the CWFS will be designed for input into a variety of models that provide directinformation for crop management decision-making.In this project a prototype of the system will be built and tested for the cranberry canopy.  This will bea rigorous test of the system because a cranberry bog produces its own unique microclimate which ischaracterized by rapidly changing temperature and moisture conditions.  Due to extreme conditionscranberry growers need accurate weather information to enable them to manage the water supply moreeffectively, and protect against frost damage, heat and water stresses, insects and plant diseases.The Phase I work will include (1) the assembly of the CWFS from existing components andcustomization for the cranberry canopy; (2) estimation of the accuracy of CWFS forecasts bygenerating and verifying 60 days of real-time forecasts; (3) linking the CWFS forecast data to irrigationscheduling and insect and plant disease development models and evaluating the information generatedby these algorithms when driven by CWFS forecasts; and (4) development of effective methods ofcommunicating the information to cranberry growers.",

Rapid advances in computers, printers, scanners, and copiers have made it increasingly simple to reproduce security emblems traditionally used for verification and authentication. Even holograms, once considered impenetrable, are now routinely counterfeited using techniques such as contact copying.  To circumvent the effectiveness of intensity sensitive devices to copy traditional security emblems, the use of complex phase patterns has been proposed.  An ID card is produced by bonding a phase mask to some primary identification pattern such as a fingerprint.  A nonlinear joint transform correlator is then used to match the ID card to an identical phase mask that is part of an automated reader.  Such a phase encoded ID card could, however, be copied using interferometric techniques.  To avoid this, we propose the use of an innovative holographic techniques, developed at MetroLaser, to create an ID card that is an inseparable combination of the phase mask and another complex wave front, unknown to a potential counterfeiter.  The two patterns on the card are deconvolved using a \"Key\" hologram that is of the part reader, resulting in a nearly ideal security system.",

The packaging barrier material must be waterproof, oil-proof, grease-proof, watervapor resistant, puncture-resistant, and in many cases, possess certain electrostatic or electromagnetic barrier properties.  The barrier material must be reliable, relatively inexpensive, effective in protecting a variety of object sizes.  The present system is a multilayer film composed of laminated polymer layers, some sandwiched around a central aluminum foil layer.  This technology is over 15 years old and requires a final heat-seal on-site.  Experience in field use has demonstrated a need for a new barrier material closure method which would not require electrical equipment and is tolerant of foreign material in the sealing area.  Since the inventions of the current systems, the packaging industry has made large advances in barrier materials, fabrication methods, and packaging sealing.  This SBIR Phase I project will address the stated need by surveying state-of-the-art packaging technology, both materials and closure mechanisms.

The proposed project will reassess the economics and practicability of using high-power microwave radiation as an alternative means to control insects in stored-products.  Preliminary experiments at a frequency of 10.6 GHz on Sitophilus zeamais in wheat and Tribolium castaneum in flour indicate that the selective heating of those insects increases at frequencies above 2.45 GHz and does not decrease monotonically as previously believed.  This implies that hitherto unobserved loss phenomena exist in insects and that high mortality can be induced economically at the higher microwave frequencies.  The proposed effort will extend the range of the previous experiments to confirm that a predicted optimum frequency exists in the microwave band and identify an optimum operating frequency within the constraints of CFR 47 (Part 2).  These goals will be met by performing high-power tests at selected frequencies up to 58 GHz and statistically verifying relative effectiveness in producing insect mortality.

Recent work at the supporting organizations indicates the possibility of stable robust cold-cathode emission from Diamond coated with BN at current densities above 1 A/cm2 and at pressures as high as 10-4 torr. These results significantly exceed any reported by others working with surface emitters and the robustness far exceeds what has been achieved with point emitters. The objective of this program will be to test these materials at current densities and under processing and operating conditions suitable for military electron devices riuch as microwave amplifiers, EBS devices, flat-panel displays, compact e-beam excited lasers, and high-power switches. During this project, a number of metal-ceramic diodes and triodes will be constructed, some with phospor screens and glass windows, to characterize both the uniformity and stability of the emission characteristics from these materials. It is the intent of this program to develop new information on peak emission capability, high-power CW operation, emission pressure dependence, and emission stability with lifetime.  A successful cold-emitter will lead to far more compact and robust microwave amplifiers, EBS devices, and other electron devices used in both military and commercial systems. Further to flat-panel displays that are higher efficiency, greater brightness, and a wider temperature range than possible with any competing technology. The early work on the BN/Diamond combination makes it appear as the best candidate for all of these future applications.",

Millennium Pharmaceuticals was established to meet these challenges using fungal secondary metabolites as a major drug source.  Traditionally, fungi that have been selected for drug screening are those that can be easily cultured in the laboratory; however, culturable fungi constitute only a fraction of the fungal taxa.  In this project, we propose to develop a novel technology to capture the genetic diversity from unculturable fungi through genetic engineering.  We will clone large segments of genomic DNA from selected unculturable fungi and introduce the cloned DNA into closely related, genetically amenable laboratory strain to express genes from the unculturable fungi and to produce novel secondary metabolites with biological activities. $ = TOTAL AWARD AMTS & NOT LIMITED TO PORTION OF PROJECT RELATED TO SUBJECT OF SEARCH SUBPROJECT $ = TOTAL AWARD AMOUNT DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF SUBPROJECTS SOURCE:  CRISP  FORMAT F    FY 97      LAST UPDATE 04-07-98 1QUERY 1536                        ID SEARCH 06/01/98   PAGE     71 --PROJECT NUMBER......1 R43 AI40802-01A1               INVESTIGATOR NAME/ADDRESS FY  97    JAYNES, JESSE M IRG/INTRAMURAL UNIT..ZRG5                             DEMETER BIOTECHNOLOGIES, LTD AWARD AMOUNT.........   $100,000                      905 WEST MAIN STREET, SUITE 19 DURHAM, NC 27701 PERFORMING ORGANIZATION: DEMETER BIOTECHNOLOGIES, LTD. TITLE   INTERRUPTION OF STD TRANSMISSION WITH PEPTIDYL MIMSTM ABSTRACT: DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract): The increasing incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and women's needs to protect their reproductive health are impetus for development of novel methods of STD prophylaxis. Peptidyl Membrane Interactive Molecules (Peptidyl MIMsTM) from Demeter BioTechnologies, Ltd. are unique peptide antibiotics that kill STD pathogens in vitro at low concentration, while demonstrating minimal intravaginal irritation or systemic toxicity in animal models. Phase I studies will develop gel formulations for intravaginal administration with Demeter's two lead anti-STD compounds. Formulated gels will be tested against gonorrhea and trichomoniasis in in vitro assays. These microbicides will then be tested intravaginally in murine animal models to determine their ability to interrupt gonorrhea and trichomoniasis transmission, without causing significant irritation or toxicity within the vagina. Histopathologic examinations will be conducted to determine local and systemic effects of drugs and disease progress in the animal models. Upon demonstration of significant reduction in STD transmission in the animal models, Phase II studies will be sought to conduct the necessary tests to apply for an Investigational New Drug with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Human clinical studies would follow. $ = TOTAL AWARD AMTS & NOT LIMITED TO PORTION OF PROJECT RELATED TO SUBJECT OF SEARCH SUBPROJECT $ = TOTAL AWARD AMOUNT DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF SUBPROJECTS SOURCE:  CRISP  FORMAT F    FY 97      LAST UPDATE 04-07-98 1QUERY 1536                        ID SEARCH 06/01/98   PAGE     72 --PROJECT NUMBER......1 R43 AI40821-01                 INVESTIGATOR NAME/ADDRESS FY  97    NERI, BRUCE P IRG/INTRAMURAL UNIT..ZRG5                             THIRD WAVE TECHNOLOGIES INC AWARD AMOUNT.........    $85,308                      2800 S FISH HATCHERY RD MADISON, WI  53711 PERFORMING ORGANIZATION: THIRD WAVE TECHNOLOGIES TITLE   DETECTION OF RIFAMPIN RESISTANT M TUBERCULOSIS ABSTRACT: For the past three decades, Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections have declined in the United States, and it was thought that the disease would be virtually eliminated by the year 2000.  However, the trend was reversed in 1985, and, as of 1992, an estimated 51,700 cases in excess of the 1984 projections have occurred in the United States (41).  Even more disturbing has been the commensurate rise in the isolation of M. tuberculosis strains resistant to one or more of the antibiotics commonly used to treat the infection.  While rapid detection methods based on nucleic acid amplification technologies have offered the promise of early detection of M. tuberculosis infection, to control this resurgent health problem these new diagnostic methods must be complemented by rapid tests for determining effective antibiotic therapy.  The mechanisms of resistance to several of the front line drugs in M. tuberculosis have been identified and shown to be the result of mutations in key genes.  In particular reports indicate that more than 95% of M. tuberculosis isolates exhibiting resistance to rifampin harbor specific mutations within a 69-bp region of the rpoB gene, which encodes the beta subunit of RNA polymerase.  An opportunity exists, therefore, to create a diagnostic procedure based on the rapid detection of these genetic changes which lead to drug resistance.  Because of these observations that genetic mutations play a significant role in the development of drug resistance in M. tuberculosis, methods which rapidly detect such mutations may play an important role in the clinical management of patients with tuberculosis.  In this Phase I proposal, we will develop a model system for rapidly detecting mutations which lead to rifampin-resistance in M. tuberculosis using our proprietary Cleavase(R) Fragment Length Polymorphism (CFLPTM) technology.  This work will form the foundation of genetic-based diagnostic tests for drug resistance in M. tuberculosis all of which will be based on our rapid, cost effective, and highly accurate CFLPTM technology.",

Several application opportunities are listed below.  An analysis is application-oriented requirements leads to the definition of camera capabilities described in terms of the field of view, minimum number of scene pixels, radiometer sensitivity, and frame time requirements.  Current state-of-the-art radiometric sensitivity, at the frequency of interest, exceeds that required to sample all of the scene pixels with one receiver in less than one second.  If one were able to raster scan a single receiver antenna beam over all of the scene pixels in one second, the one second camera would need only one receiver.  Present-day electronic, as well as mechanical antenna beam scanning capabilities fail to meet the required scanning rate for a single channel PMMW camera system.  We propose to modify a commercially-available, high-speed, mechanically scanned radar system antenna, and adapt it to the one-second camera.  Additional receiving channels are needed to reduce the scanning rate requirement, not to improve sensitivity.  The addition of receiver channels as a means for reducing mechanical scan rate requirements is not without problems associated with interchannel gain stability and flat field retention.  The proposed effort will provide a solution to these and other problems associated with the use of more than one receiver channel when generating PMMW images.",

The methods will be particularly useful for secure intelligence data handling, secure transmission of data over public channels, secure archival of information, and data protection. The proposed methods are based on new chaos based image cryptographic techniques developed by the principal investigator. The secret information is first encrypted and then hidden inside a digital image (the carrier) by slightly modifying the carrier. The changes are imperceptible to a human eye, and look like a random thermal noise under high magnification. The purpose of hiding secret information is to make the encrypted data file look like a normal image so that an eavesdropper does not even suspect that secret information is being sent. The methods to be developed in this proposal will be especially useful for hiding large amounts of data, such as images or digitized videotapes. Emphasis will be given to robustness so that hidden information is not corrupted by a small amount of noise or a loss of information caused by using Bossy graphic formats. Other commercial applications include marking of digital signals and image authentication.",

UWB systems have a variety of important military, as well as civilian, uses.  UWB devices will be used to provide reconnaissance both close-in and at stand-off ranges.  Such sensors will be able to \"look\" through foliage and possibly earthen surface to reveal the inner details.  This information can be used to determine the military use of a facility, as well as to provide dynamic (\"on-the-f1y\") targeting for smart bomb assets.  MRC proposes to use a dual band antenna system to cover the entire 50 to 1000 MHz band for carriage on a TIER II UAV.  The low band portion of the antenna system will operate from 50 to 100 MHz for horizontal polarization.  The high band portion will cover the remaining 100 to 1000 MHz band for both vertical and horizontal polarizations.  There is a total of three ports for the entire antenna system; low band H pol, high band H pol, and high band V pol  RF radiation at low-band V pol will be a program goal.  Each of these three ports are used for both transmit and receive.  UWB radar is capable of detecting critical manufacturing flaws in large, man-made structures such as buildings, bridges, and air/space craft.  Lifetime integrity tests can be conducted on buildings and bridges without the need to extract core samples.  UWB radars may be used to locate buried man-made objects such as pipes, tunnels, and cables.

        "abstract": "Current high-throughput DNA sequencing systems can produce sequence data at a theoretical rate of approximately 29 megabases per year. Capillary Array Electrophoresis (CAB) systems can increase the DNA sequencing throughput by an order-of-magnitude over currently available systems. A flowable separation medium is one of the key components of the CAB system, and improvements in separation media significantly lower the cost of a CAB system. The moderate-to-high viscosities of the separation media used by previous researchers makes it a formidable task to design a pressurized capillary refilling station for a commercial CAB system. The goal of Phase I of this proposal is to develop low-viscosity media which will enable single base resolution out to 1000 bases. Using low-viscosity separation media will simplify the pressure-vessel design issues of the CAB system, resulting in a substantial reduction in cost. Use of such high-throughput CAB systems will revolutionize large-scale sequencing projects, and substantially reduce the cost per base. Phase II studies will extend the utility of low-viscosity and high-resolution media with less expensive dynamically-coated capillaries by eliminating the need for high-cost covalently-coated capillaries. This will further reduce the cost per system and per base sequences.",

The large diameter of POFs helps in achieving fiber coupling with ease and  high efficiency.  Commercially available POFs suffer from optical loss, and low  maximum operating temperatures.  Therefore, there is a need for the  development of low loss, heat resistant materials and processes in order to  meet the applications in short-haul communication.  Molecular Technologies  Inc. is proposing to develop novel low loss, high heat resistant materials and  processes to fabricate step and graded index (GI) POFs.  Investigation of novel  fabrication techniques for GI POFs will be the main focus of this Phase I  program.  Design and synthesis of low loss, high Tg transparent polymers will  be performed.  Optical loss and refractive index distribution in the GI POFs will  be investigated.  The fabrication technique will be extended to make POF  amplifiers.

        "abstract": "Current tactical missile rocket nozzles provide adequate performance, but it is expected that significant improvements can be realized if the present generation nozzles are replaced with composite nozzles composed of carbon fibers and hafnium or zirconium-based ceramic matrix materials.  Present development of advanced composite nozzles has focused on costly chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) as the method of fabrication.  An alternate fabrication method based on liquid impregnation and pyrolysis is proposed here as a potentially low- cost replacement or enhancement for CVI.  A survey of appropriate liquid or liquefiable precursors for hafnium and zirconium ceramics showed that the use of relatively inexpensive acetates, chlorides, alkoxides, and colloids has the potential for reducing the cost of the composites.  Processing involves repeated cycles of vacuum impregnation of the liquid precursor into a carbon fiber preform, drying or gelation to form a solid, and pyrolysis at high temperatures in inert gas.  Hybrid processes combining CVI and liquid impregnation and pyrolysis may also be more cost-effective than CVI alone.  A 6 month Phase I program to be performed in three sequential tasks is proposed to prove the feasibility and demonstrate the potential of the liquid impregnation and pyrolysis approach.  In Task I pyrolysis experiments will be conducted to determine the yield, chemical composition, and phase constitution of ceramic products obtained from the various precursors and important precursor mixtures.  A reduced list of precursors selected on the basis of the Task 1 results will be used to fabricate small composite samples by impregnation and pyrolysis in Task 2. The nature of the matrix materials and matrix-fiber characteristics will be evaluated in Task 2 and the most promising precursors will be used to fabricate samples for mechanical testing in Task 3. An optional Task 4 is proposed for the fabrication and matrix-fiber characteristics will be evaluated in Task 2 and the most promising precursors will be used sponsor for evaluation.

The Rapid Acquisition FFT (RAFFT) approach was developed by NAVSYS initially to speed high dynamic C/A code acquisition.  This technique has since been extended, under a US Navy contract, to be applied to direct P/Y code acquisition.The effectiveness of the NAVSYS RAFFT algorithm is dictated by the speed of the FFT implementation.  High speed DSPs can perform a 1024 point FFTs in less than 128 usecs.  The performance of the RAFFT approach can be dramatically improved by using an electro-optic correlator.

Oliver, Principal Investigator\nDr. Warren C. Oliver, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-97ER82436\nAmount:  $74,993\n\n\nCurrently, there exists a broad range of applications for which the ability to produce an adherent, tribological (hard, wear-resistant), thin coating plays a critical role.  These include, but are not limited to, protective overcoats on magnetic hard disks and other magnetic recording media, protective coatings on orthopedic implants, scratch-resistant coatings for optical fibers and lenses, and coatings for both automotive engine and fascia applications.  These hardened surfaces can mitigate the effects of corrosion, a major source of energy losses for the economy.  The capacity to mechanically characterize these coatings is often paramount in evaluating their potential performance.  Quasi-static tests, such as nanoindentation, are widely used to assess the quality of these hard coatings.  However, as the thickness of the coatings decreases to less than 20 nanometers, the ability to characterize their properties using even the most advanced indentation techniques becomes increasingly difficult due to physical limitations of the indenter geometry; in addition, normal indentation tests do not always correlate well with wear properties.  Dynamic tribological properties at the nanometer scale are therefore of interest.  While no true nanometer-scale tribological systems exist, the ability to perform dynamic, nanometer-scale scratch-test experiments of a limited nature has been successfully demonstrated.  The goal of this Phase I project is to address the issues and design criteria necessary to enable dynamic tribological testing to be performed at the nanometer scale.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Commercial Benefits as described by the awardee:  The commercial benefit is the development of an instrumented, depth-sensing, dynamic tribological system capable of investigating the wear behavior of materials on the sub-micrometer-to-nanometer scale.  Given the large amounts of energy lost every year to the economy by friction and wear, development of such testing systems would have a significant economic impact._",

As a result of the milling, the particles usually have wide size distributions, high impurity levels, and large particle size. 1-3 The demand for improved metal and ceramic powder properties in order to produce smaller feature sizes in circuit boards with improved properties is increasing. Metal (Ag, Pd. Ag/Pd, Ni, Cu. Pt. Au) and ceramic (metal ruthenates) powders with well-controlled properties are needed for thick film pastes.1-3 The desired powder properties include controlled size in the micron and submicron range,controlled elemental and phase composition and high purity. These powder characteristics result in lower laydswns, better yields in manufacture of multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) and the use of less precious metal. The problem with the current technology for producing these materials is that it cannot deliver the quality needed and as a result, there is a drive towards new processes capable of producing powders with these characteristics.  This proposed research will address this problem through development of an economical and environmentally benign technique for producing composite metal powders with superior properties that may revolutiQnize the fabrication of multilayer capacitors using thick film pastes.  The success of this technology is of critical strategic importance for the united states. The best Ag/Pd and Pd Powder produced in the world are made in Japan by Shoei. Shoei does not sell to most U.S. MLCC manufacturers putting them at a great disadvantage. rhe lack of the highest quality powders now and in the future will increase our reliance Dn Japanese technology at a minimum and put the U.S. further behind in this c",

This type of fiber is expected to have great utility in high speed local area networks.  Existing Japanese production methods result in bandwidths which are three to ten times less than theoretically possible, and the bandwidth of the fiber is not stable and reproducible.  The production rate is intrinsically limited by the batch nature of the process and, or, multi-step procedure.  In the USA, the High-Speed Plastic Network (HSPN) consortium was formed in 1994, and is supported by a $5M DARPA grant.  A member of that team has licensed one of the Japanese batch technologies to fabricate the above type of fiber.  The present proposal is to develop a novel, low cost, continuous production process for the fiber.  The fiber will have a stable bandwidth of > 2 GHz.km, be stable from -40+ C to +150+ C, have low moisture uptake, attenuation of less than 150 dB/kilometer and be stable to radiation exposure up to 10(3) Rad.",

However, there are many sources of contamination other than whole bottles, which will remain in the stream using whole bottle sorting technology.  Automated flake sorting systems are becoming an essential tool for removing foreign contamination and cross-contamination from other polymers within a feed stream.  Current technologies for high speed flake sorting rely on optical identification.  Optical identification works well for contaminants that are optically different (e.g., more opaque, of different color), but is useless for cross-contamination of polymers that are optically similar.  The objective of the Phase I research project is to determine the feasibility for complimenting whole bottle sorting technologies with automated sorting of various recycle stream polymers in the flake form.",

We propose to establish animal models of arthritis in which to directly compare both the chronic GI toxicity and therapeutic activity of NSAIDs- phospholipid prodrugs to that of unmodified NSAIDs. Biochemical studies are proposed to examine the inhibitor-effects of the NSAID test- formulations on the cyclooxygenase isoenzymes of the GI mucosae. We also propose to employ analytical techniques to examine the effects of phospholipid on both the shelf-life and biological half-life of NSAlDs.

While detection of early breast cancer in women between the ages of 40 and 49 has been identified as a major societal issue by national health authorities, X-ray mammography can miss fully one quarter of cancers in patients of this age range.  One possible adjunct to mammography would be highly specific radiotracer imaging, yet this imaging is limited by two critical factors: The current generation of detection hardware is not optimal for detecting the clinically important class of early small breast cancers, and clinical studies of such small cancers are hampered by the inability to compare radiotracer images of specific cases with correlative X-ray and biopsy results.  In pilot clinical studies,  a demonstration prototype device has been used that is capable of superimposing X-ray images of specific small cancers on images created with positron-emitting radiotracers.  Image acquisition is performed on a conventional X-ray mammography platform that can provide biopsy correlations.  In Phase I, algorithms will be integrated into a real-time display package, and  limitations of the technique will be studied  using positron emitting and single-photon-emitting point sources.  Phase II technical development will include increasing the field-of-view of the demonstration cameras.  Phase II clinical trials will definitively assess medically relevant parameters such as sensitivity and specificity in the detection of early breast cancer, as well as the accuracy of the device in assisting biopsy.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The potential market for a reliable imaging device capable of direct breast biopsy is great, due to the high prevalence of breast cancer and the limitations of X-ray mammography. _",

TITLE   AUTOMATION OF LONG TERM CARE PROVIDER PROFILING TOOL ABSTRACT: The purpose of this Phase I project is to develop a prototype for a PC- based Profiling Tool for the evaluation of long-term care providers including nursing homes and home health care agencies.  To date, an automated Long-Term Care Provider Profiling Tool does not exist although such tools are used extensively in acute care.  The major aim of the proposed Profiling Tool is to enable managed care organizations (HMOs), hospitals, the state, and insures to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of long-term care providers. The Tool will provide aggregate profiling information of patterns of service use, costs, and measures, related to the effectiveness or quality of service.  It would enable comparisons across providers on key parameters; provide national \"bench marks\" on selected profiling characteristic, and HMOs to have an informed basis on which to develop long term care preferred provider organizations (PPOs) or integrate acute and long-term care network. As movement toward greater integration of acute and long-term care service continues, the need for a profiling tool to evaluate, monitor and compare long-term care providers on key utilization, cost and effectiveness measures will increase.",

        "abstract": "In response to AF95-135, we propose to determine the feasibility of enhancing the resolution of current excimer lithography systems by employing spatial filter and phase mask of novel designs.  The spatial filter (which is a diffractive optical element) will be specially designed for edge enhancement to improve on the high frequency contents of the images illuminating the photoresist and the resolution performance of the excimer lithography system.  The phase mask (which is another diffractive optical element) will be special designed for controlling the illumination direction of the mask (or reticle) in the excimer lithography system to achieve superresolution performance (or the performance of a larger effective aperture than the actual lens aperture).  These two approaches will result in low cost add-on accessories (with mechanism similar to reticle or color filter changers) readily insertable to the production lithography system, one for each system model.  They will overcome the disadvantage in the existing method of using phase shifting masks, which require custom design and fabrication specific to each integrated circuit; they will not require redesigning the lamp housing for illumination control.  To demonstrate the feasibility of resolution enhancement, NIPT will work closely with ANVIK to ensure that the designs and the fabricated spatial filter and phase mask will function properly in their excimer lithography systems.",

Hughey, Principal Investigator\nDr. Ruth E. Shefer, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-97ER82442\nAmount:  $74,999\n\nA recent Institute of Medicine report recommended that the Department of Energy establish a National Biomedical Tracer Facility (NBTF) to provide a dedicated, reliable source for research radionuclides.  It has since become apparent that an NBTF will not be built within the next decade. Consequently, other sources must be developed to fulfill the growing needs of researchers interested in the application of medium half-life research radionuclides. The overall objective of this project is to develop cyclotron target systems for the high-yield production of several potentially useful radionuclides using existing small biomedical cyclotrons installed in hospitals and research centers nationwide.  The radionuclides that will be studied in Phase I - gallium-66, bromine-76, bromine-77, yttrium-86, technetium-94, and iodine-124 - have important applications in radiopharmaceutical development, quantitative imaging, and radiotherapy. All can be produced in solid targets using 11-18 million electron volt proton beams from small biomedical cyclotrons. The goal of the Phase I program is to determine the feasibility of on-site production of these radionuclides in large quantities and with high radioisotopic purity and specific activity. Techniques for radionuclide separation and purification and recovery of the isotopically enriched target materials will also be investigated. In Phase II, targets and automated processing systems will be developed for those radionuclides that show promise for routine, high-yield production.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  If successful this  research will provide techniques to make available a series of important radionuclides to biomedical researchers throughout the United States. The development of high-yield targets and processing systems will allow these isotopes to be produced at major medical centers having on-site cyclotron facilities. Additionally, the relatively long half-lives of these isotopes make them suitable for distribution through regional centers that would serve as a \"virtual NBTF.\"\n\n_",

The current process, called electrochemical vapor deposition, represents a major roadblock to full-scale commercialization of the technology due to its high cost.  In this project, an alternative materials approach will be developed based on new technology for economically producing highly active ceramic powder dispersions.  During Phase I, the feasibility of a low-cost fabrication approach will be demonstrated.  This will entail producing active ceramic dispersions using nano-scale production technology.

        "abstract": "The ability to store and analyze a continuous sequence of high resolution images of a ballistic event has tremendous benefits in determining the ballistic limits for laminated carbon fiber materials.  When the ability to store these images in a 3-D format is introduced, the volume of data that can be extracted from each image is far more than any single photograph.  Unlike photography or direct digital imaging, holography offers the ability to store these events in a 3-D format so that high resolution images can be digitized at different depths of field and viewpoints.  To meet this need, North Dancer Labs, Inc. (NDL) proposes in Phase I to develop a unique Multiple-view Holographic Cinematography (MHC) recorder capable of capturing 3-D images and interferograms at kHz repetition rates.  These can be played back, scanned through depth, and digitized for tomographic analysis to evaluate the displacement, true trajectory and velocity of projectiles and particles, as well as target deformatin.  A holographic movie can also be played back for viewing with stereo glasses on a monitor so that the viewers can see the event in 3-D while adjusting the image to scan the event in depth.  During Phase I, NDL will conduct tests at Wright-Patterson AFB Labs of actual shots to demonstrate proof of principle of a Multiple-view Holographic Cinematography camera and establish a design for Phase II.",

        "abstract": "We propose to design and demonstrate beam cleanup for the Master Oscillator (MO) which will allow the Power Amplifier (PA) to operate efficiently and produce a high energy beam useful as a Directed Energy Weapon (DEW). The method we describe is totally new to the DEW field. Of course for low power lasers, we can focus the beam down and pass the clean part through a pinhole spatial filter. The \"noisy\" part is absorbed, so only a perfect beam emerges. The problem is that for even a few watts of laser power, metal pinholes melt and diamond pinholes shatter. At MO power levels, the pinhole method is clearly absurd. Our approach, developed with BMDO for visible light lasers up to a few watts, is to use the angular selectivity of a thick hologram to clean up the beam. It works well. Neither focusing nor absorption is required, so extension to MO power levels seems plausible. We will explore two main issues: handling of useable MO power levels and extension to nonvisible wavelengths as required by many (but not all) candidate MOs. The team includes the company which makes the holographic filters, a consultant involved in its invention, and a consultant with decades of HEL experience.",

A major limitation to accessing this information from NOAA and private vendors is the lack of well-defined, standardized methods for accessing data or running models remotely over the Internet. Northwest Research Associates proposes to develop both an open- architecture Space-Weather Model/Application Programming Interface (SWxMAPI) and a proprietary set of software tools that will allow users to provide and request Space Weather Data via this Interface. In Phase 1 of this SBIR proposal, we will develop an initial design of the SWxMAPI. We will then create prototypes of three of four modules in the envisioned system: A Space Weather Model Server (SWxMS) that accepts and serves client requests for data and model-run output; a client-side agent that can be used by non-expert personnel to formulate data requests compliant with SWxMAPI and receive data products; and a Space Weather Remote Database Agent that serves as an interface between the SWxMS and local and remote databases. The prototype system will build a generalized interface to SCINTMOD, our existing Web implementation (http://www.nwra.co/nwra/scintpred/) of a space weather model.",

The objective of the Phase I effort is to develop, define, and describe the concept for a  prototype high bandwidth communication link . Phase II would include the complete design,  fabrication, and demonstration of a high bandwidth communication link prototype subsystem  compatible with existing Navy acoustic towed line arrays.

        "abstract": "In order to examine critical data at a distant location, a requirement has been established for the transport of ALTAIR radar data from the collection site to a remote site (CONUS).  The Strand Compression Algorithm described in this proposal is designed to take advantage of several redundant components inherent in the data:  1. Radar returns are processed intra-spatially using a predictor to decorrelate information over a localized region.  2. Radar returns are processed on an intra-scan basis using a predictor to decorrelate information between scans. 3.  The data representation (code domain) is compressed to minimize data representation.  This aspect relies on the fact that the return information will seldom use the entire dynamic range of the receiver. 4.  Localized return bandwidth is evaluated and decimation is applied depending on the detected bandwidth.  This concept relies on the fact that the radar returns do not continually use the entire receiver bandwidth.  The algorithm is estimated to achieve an average efficiency of 18:1.  This represents a factor of 6.0-9.0 times improvement over published lossless techniques.  Data compression is of vital interest in the military and commercial communications community.  The primary benefit of the Strand Compression Technique is the introduction of new \"tools\" that can be incorporated into a broad range of current and emerging algorithms.  The techniques described will apply to arbitrary data, but will achieve the greatest advantage for band-limited data types including speech samples and imagery.",

        "abstract": "NOVA Scientific, Inc. proposes to develop an electron-beam lithography system capable of high throughput patterning of full-sized semiconductor wafers with minimum feature size to 0.1 um and below. NOVA's key design element is the use of a novel and robust electron source based upon field emission phenomena that is capable of delivering high current to the resist for fast, reproducible exposures. Since the design concept includes an emitter array that is somewhat larger than the wafer, patterning of the entire wafer in orthogonal directions is accomplished in only a few steps, and the total wafer travel in these steps is limited to less than 100 um. Thus, the combination of high current density and global exposure assures high wafer throughput. In addition, the traditionally poor reliability of field emission cathodes in an e-beam system is obviated by the unique design of the electron source. This design is expected to increase cathode stability and reliability by many orders of magnitude.",

        "abstract": "One highly desired improvement for neutron sensing is an imaging neutron detector with high two-dimensional spatial resolution and a large detector area. At present, achievable real-time neutron imaging detector resolution is only about 1 mm. The innovation proposed is to adapt for neutron imaging the high spatial resolution Microchannel Plate (MCP) detector technology so widely used for detecting charged particles and photons. Here, spatial resolution at the 25 micron level is routinely achieved, over formats as large as 10 x 10 cm(2). Previous attempts to use MCPs in neutron detection schemes employed either a Gd neutron-beta converter coupled to an MCP image intensifier with phosphor screen readout, or a thin Li glass scintillator optically coupled to the MCP, compromising the intrinsic MCP spatial resolution and dynamic range. In sharp contrast, this program proposes the combination of (n,\"varies as\") capture conversion and multiplication processes within the MCP bulk structure itself, fabricated using a lead glass which includes the isotope 10(B). In combination with a fast electronic readout, this innovation will result in a simple, efficient, rugged and compact imaging neutron detector with 15 to 25 um spatial resolution and high dynamic range.",

There is an urgent need for a cost effective technology that would help reduce the nitrogen oxide and particulate emissions from the exhaust of a diesel engine.  This project will utilize a plasma assisted catalyst approach to achieve greater than 80% removal of these harmful emissions.  Using novel catalytic materials, preliminary lab tests on diesel exhausts containing in excess of 10% oxygen, have demonstrated more than 70% removal of nitrogen oxide and 80% removal of particulates, using less than 7% of engine power.  Phase I of the program will demonstrate this technology on the exhaust of a 4 kilowatt diesel engine.  In addition, an understanding of the interaction of plasma with catalytic materials and the reactive species for nitrogen oxide and particulate removal will be obtained.  Phase II will involve an accurate mapping of the energy usage and system performance limitations at engine exhaust temperature.  In addition, various hardware configurations of this system will be designed and field tested for durability and long term performance. \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: This technology is applicable to all stationary and mobile diesel engines and alternate fueled vehicles, and all nitrogen oxide containing pollutant streams.

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses the fabrication of a novel uncooled pyroelectric IR detector array having significant spectrum coverage (from UV to far IR), size, weight, and cost advantages over the current ones. The innovation is based on the utilization of pyroelectric thin films of high figures of merits and monolithic integration technology. The proposed thin film membrane device structure allows the optimum IR detector array design. A substantial reduction in fabrication cost is anticipated from the elimination of both wafer thinning and solder bump bonding associated with the current state-of-art. This technology development is particularly suited to meet the applications that require broader spectrum coverage, smaller weight and size, higher resolution and sensitivity, lower power consumption, and higher reliability. This Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach by an initial growth of new pyroelectric films of PbScl/2Tal/2O3 on Si via an innovative low temperature plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) process. The PE-CVD may become the best choice to produce large IR detector arrays in sufficient qualities and at low enough cost to facilitate widespread use of infrared sensing systems. In Phase II prototype devices will be produced. Success in the Phase I effort will identify a viable manufacturing route for advanced uncooled IR imaging array fabrication. These devices have a wide range of \"dual use\" applications, from various DoD's space-based applications to commercial applications of fire fighting, law enforcement, industrial control, and drivers aid.",

Vulnerability assessment studies model the interaction of a sortie - perhaps using several weapons - with a target. A single vulnerability assessment study requires the results from lhundres or thousands of independent attack scenarios wun with varying input parameters. Vulnerability assessments can be parallelized at two levels. First, it is possible to distribute the individual scenarios required to perform a single study across a network of computers. Distributing scenarios creates a need for coordination and load balancing. Second, the loop that generates the various simulated interactions can be parallelized using several different approaches. Parallelizing the code internally may require a considerable rewriting of an existing code or even the development of new techniques specific to vulnerability assessment. The overall goal of this Phase I research is to develop a recommendaiton concerning the most beneficial approach to speeding up vulnerability assessment studies. Two approaches will be considered: distributing the scenairos of th entire study and parallelizing the interactins within a scenario. Both approaches can be implemented using a variety of technfiques. During Phase I the various techniques will be evaluated and a recommendaiton for parallelizing vulnerability assessment studies will be developed. A limited software prototype that distributes scenarios across a network of workstations will also be implemented. The prototype will rovide experience with using distributed scenarios within a study.

This approach offers an economical way to significantly improve existing sonar systems because it requires strap-on signal processing hardware without modification to the sonar array.  We estimate for a nominal 3 kHz MP bow-mounted sonar, SAS-MFP based resolutions of 0.15 m (6 inches) cross-range, 0.30 m (12 inches) slant-range, and 0.95 z (37 inches) depth can be achieved out to 3 km range and up to a 10 knot platform speed.

        "abstract": "The ultimate goal of this three phase SBIR proposal is to design, develop, fabricate, and test real- time radiography system for inspecting large CDI castings with the emphasis on the production oriented inspection system.  The proposed system takes significant advantage of detector system, data acquisition system, automated data analysis and image display software already developed by Omega.  The propose designs are based on Omega's unique and very high performance detector designs and the Tangential Scanning technique developed for the NSWC Tangential Scanner System for Rocket Motors. The Tangential data collection method has already proven it's advantages in the Rocket Motor System.  It leads to faster scanning rate, smaller data files, larger contrast due to flaws and easier yet faster data analysis.  The Tangential scanning technique will use the natural circular symmetry of the CDI casting for data collection.  In the Tangential Scanner system, the data is naturally collected at the tangent of various diameter circles.  Thus the data is naturally collected through equal amount of steel material.  This leads to mostly equal x-ray signal detected by the detector system.  In such a scanning scheme, abrupt or even slow change in the x-ray intensity is easy to recognize.  The difference in the detected x-ray intensity is usually either due to a flaw or a known feature in the casting.  Simple image analysis techniques like Thresholding, Differentiation, Low Order Curve Fitting, Mask Subtraction and other Convolutions can be used in automated mode to detect flaws and unwanted features in the CDI castings.",

Hirshfield, Principal Investigator\nMr. George P.

However, the FEL is inherently inefficient.  As a result recovery of unused energy from the electron beam that powers the device is an important consideration in reducing the number of components and therefore cost and in reducing radiation doses. Energy recovery from the 1 MW, 200 MeV electron beam powering the FEL can be accomplished by causing the spent beam to decelerate and induce radio frequency (RF) power in superconducting cavities.  This RF power must be extracted and rectified, so allowing it to be recirculated, thus increasing the electrical efficiency of the FEL.  This project will perform computations and tests leading to a demonstration of efficient rectification of MW-level RF power using a cyclotron autoresonance accelerator (CARA) with a depressed collector.  Preliminary estimates indicate that a ten-fold increase in FEL operating efficiency could result.  During Phase I, tests of this CARA at power levels below its normal range of operation will be undertaken to determine if high conversion efficiency can be obtained.  Calculations will also be carried out to enable a beam collector to be designed that can decelerate and intercept the CARA beam.  In Phase II an appropriate depressed collector will be built and installed on the Omega-P CARA.  \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Operation of an FEL for industrial processing can become much more efficient if effective beam power recovery can be incorporated.  Annual cost savings from electricity conservation could thereby reach $0.5 million per 1 MW-hrs of energy used.  Design of an efficient single-stage beam collector operating at a depressed potential can allow other devices using CARA beams such as those using high-power microwaves, to enjoy enhanced efficiency as well._",

This technique will couple adaptive position control techniques with force control of the end-effector to enable mobile robotic arms to carry out complex tasks requiring close interaction with the environment.  A candidate hybrid adaptive control scheme is designed which has dual adaptive mechanisms, one for the position control subsystem, and another for the force control subsystem.  The presence of an adaptation mechanism for both the position and the force loop will allow the robot to handle a range of tasks in semi-structured and unstructured environments.  Analytical and simulation studies are carried out to evaluate the stability, robustness, and performance of the proposed scheme.  The feasibility of the proposed control strategy will be evaluated for possible experimental prototype development and commercialization during Phase II.  Commercially, there are a lot potential opportunities for growth for high-end robotic systems capable of performing complex tasks for a range of applications which require a degree of dexterity and accuracy not currently available in mobile robotic systems.

The lasing transition of Nd3+ in YAG at 946nm will be investigated, since it can be doubled to 488 nm. A wide range of useful CWGL operating from the UV to the IR could be prepared if we succeed in defining process parameters to overcome remaining stress birefringence parallel to the interfaces of the laser-active core. Attractive features will be negligible losses due to scatter, multimode or single mode lasing, lengths of CWGL ranging from microns to about 200 mm, low lasting thresholds, high power output, high efficiency, resulting in devices of improved performance over any exitsting CWGL.",

Furthermore, assuming a cooled detector, the lens will need to be 100% cold stop efficient, and other factors such as narcissus will need to be taken into account.  The goal for the distortion of the lenses is that an object subending a small incremental angle to the system shall be imaged to the same size or extent on the image plane regardless of where it is located in the full 180 degree field of view.

        "abstract": "Critical issues associated with the design of a rugged, compact \"real time\" sampling system using photoconductive switches as the signal generator and sample will be investigated. The design concept is based upon an optoelectronic equivalent time sampling principle developed by the Principal Investigator. It involves first the phase locking of the temporal waveform to be measured to the optical pulses and subsequent sampling of the locked waveform. The photoconductive switches are used both as optical-microwave mixer and sampler. The optical-microwave intermixing process generates a low frequency replica of the high frequency waveform to be sampled. The frequency ratio of these waves is the time expansion factor. Since there is no electro-mechanical moving part involved, the sampling is done at a fast rate. The record acquisition time of 10 s per sweep can be achieved. Other issues concerning electronic sampling delay, epoch time, number of sampling points per epoch, resolution time, photoconductor carrier lifetime, sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range, etc., will also be investigated. A preliminary experiment demonstrating the operation principle of the equivalent time sampling will be carried out. A complete Phase II system design of a pulse parameter testing instrument which will meet most requirements as specified in Subtopic 8.7.3T will be presented at the end of Phase 1.",

A large compression factor will permit UAVs and space borne sensors to gather and store far more data than before.  This will not only reduce the operational costs of acquiring hyperspectral imagery drastically but also increasing the strategic significance of hyperspectral imaging technology.  The computational requierements of the algorithm are of the order of several billion operations per second for data rates of 100MBits/s.  Since no single current available processor is capable of handling the problem in real-time, dedicated hardware will be built using commercial off the shelf technology for real-time implementation.  The architecture will exploit algorithm's inherent parallelism and combine an array of digital signal processors (DSPs) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to perform the task.  The multiprocessor platform will be reconfigurable and can therefore be used to implement the entire class of parallel algorithms that fall within the single instruction multiple data (SIMD) paradigm.",

SNL has demonstrated the ability of the LENSTM technology to produce near net shape stainless steel components, with excellent material properties, directly from computer-aided design files. This technology, which uses a high power laser to fuse metallic powder injected through a nozzle into the laser beams focus, seems uniquely appropriate for the challenge of integrating sensors into metal structures. Optomec proposes during Phase I, through its unique relationship with SNL and the commercial RP&M industry, to use LENSTM technology to conduct simple experiments on selected sensor elements to determine the feasibility of using the LENSTM technology to embed sensors into otherwise homogeneous metal structural elements. These simple experiments must necessarily precede Phase II fabrication and evaluation of actual functioning embedded sensors.  The potential for this technology lies in its ability to integrate sensors into otherwise homogeneous metal structures thereby producing cost savings over external attachment and protection of sensor elements. Commercial industries which could benefit from this technology include the commercial aircraft, automotive, and construction industries.",

        "abstract": "High speed electronics suffer from an increased vulnerability regarding electromagnetic interference.  The problem is even more acerbated by an environment of extreme electromagnetic pollution.  Wide band shielding against electromagnetic interference is therefore crucial if reliability of electronic devices is to be maintained.  A conventional and very effective solution to this problem is to put a shielding gasket over electronic offenders and victims alike.  The shield is easily installed but suffers from being cumbersome and environmentally exposed; a damaged shield basically does not work.  An alternative, direct approach is to shield potential electromagnetic emitters and receivers at the circuit board level, thereby reducing space, material, cost., and weight.  An additional advantage is the. Increased integrity owing to the environmental seal.  Although, shielding on the circuit board level can he provided by some conductive inks, shielding effectiveness is currently limited by their comparatively low conductivity and reliability.  If shielding performance is to match that of shielding gaskets, both areas need to be improved considerably.  This proposal offers a novel conductive ink approach based on transient-liquid-phase sintering.  It addresses in particular the need for electromagnetic shielding on the board level with a highly conductive and stable ink.  We anticipate development of a new transient-liquid-phase sintering ink for electromagnetic shielding in electronic packaging.  Markets include aerospace, automotive and electronic devices in general.  US market size for electromagnetic shielding materials is expected to increase to $270 million in 1997.",

        "abstract": "Using distributed interactive simulation (DIS) to conduct effective training, analyses, or mission support in a tactical nuclear weapons effects (NWE) environment requires realistic computer generated forces (CGF) that are sensitive to such effects.  This level of sensitivity requires CGF to apply valid and reliable speed-accuracy measures of environmental effects on human performance within the DIS environment.  a major deficiency in DIS and CGF is that they do not currently simulate the interaction between response time and accuracy that is so characteristic of the performance of humans under stress.  Our proposed effort will address that void to enable a more realistic representation of this dynamic dimension of human performance.  To fully characterize human behavior in quantitative terms, we need better expressions of task performance accuracy.  Unlike response time, operational definitions of accuracy vary for each type of task (e.g., cognitive, psychomotor, and physical).  In addition, response time and accuracy measures are not independent.  Often the human op0erator must decide which aspect of the task is more important and then trade speed of response for accuracy as required.  To develop such a speed-accuracy model (SAM) PSR will analyze human response to NWE based on our in-depth studies of human behavior.  We will also investigate the extensive literature on speed-accuracy interaction and compare the utility of alternate modeling approaches to specific human response requirements.  Finally, PSR will plan a feasibility demonstration of our SAM algorithms for use within DIS.  In air traffic control simulations, SAMs of pilot, crew, and controller responses under high stress would provide a more credible environment for training controllers.  In nuclear power plants or other process control facilities, SAMs of control room personnel performance during emergencies could be used to train managers or analyze incidents for lessons learned.  In the entertainment industry, opponents would be more challenging if they exhibited a wider variety of behaviors and stress-induced performance decrements.",

A $10,000 3-D graphics PC outperforms a $100,000 UNIX 3-D graphics workstation in virtually all aspects, in particular the 3-D rendering speed.  We have an opportunity to exploit this new technology so every analyst or war-fighter can use their desktop PC to visualize in real-time 3-D urban and terrain data.  In the past, DoD users have relied on shared or limited access to real-time 3-D graphics computer systems.  Our objective is to design, prototype, and demonstrate a distributed, 3-D virtual \"white-board\", where the background is unlimited imagery draped terrain and the markings are complex 3-D models that make up an urban scene.  By using mainstream technology, the virtual white-board will be as easy to use as a conventional electronic white-board.  There are two major technical objectives: 1) design a client/server architecture, where unlimited terrain and urban data, and behavioral information are distributed to clients for real-time 3-D visualization; and 2) rapidly prototype the designed system with two different PC based clients served by a single data server.",

The key fluid/thermal features are innovative capillary cross-connects and recuperative heat transfer (between the outflow line and the return flow line from the radiator).  This configuration and approach can be used with CPLs or mechanically pumped two-phase thermal management systems.  Good thermal control and high reliability will be provided at low mass.  In Phase I we will build a proof-of-concept radiator component using readily available materials and demonstrate it integrated with a CPL.  In Phase II we will construct a brassboard CPL thermal management system with this radiator component and demonstrate the system behavior over a wide range of conditions.  Expected results include a radiator component able to passively start up from a frozen shutdown condition, as well as superior redundancy and a factor of two savings in weight compared with heat pipe or once-through radiators.",

        "abstract": "The design and fabrication of milli-teleoperated robots for remote surgery requires the development of new design concepts which are different from those employed in macro-scale systems.  Two key differences are the scale of the interaction forces and the required response characteristics of the force-reflecting systems.  Previous researchers have shown that impedance-based control systems for telerobots provide passivity and guarantee stability in the presence of time delays (which are the primary cause of limited performance for teleoperated robots).  The innovation we propose is a telerobot control system design tool that will enable the rapid development of impedance-based control systems for motion and force scaling telerobots in the presence of time delays.  The proposed control system design tool will use descriptions of master and slave manipulator hardware, the communications link, and the required level of motion and force scaling in order to facilitate the generation of controllers for both the master and slave manipulators.  During Phase I of this project, we will demonstrate the use of the proposed hierarchidal control system architecture using a haptic display and computer-generated remote manipulator and communications link.  During Phase II, we will develop a prototype telerobotic system employing the proposed control algorithm.  The proposed control development system will have immediate application for the design of telerobotic systems used in microscopic manipulation.  Examples include:  vascular microsurgery, manipulation of individual cells, the interrogation of atomic surfaces, and the inspection and repair of micro-mechanical or electrical devices.",

Force feedback will be instrumental in o btaining high fidelity information exchange between the simulation and the user.  However, one significant problem with providing force feedback between a simulation and a user is that time delays associated with computational requirements or finite bandwidth communication links between the haptic display and distributed simulation processors and databaases can cause instability.  Creare's innovation is to convert the kinematic information that is typically transferred between the haptic display and simulations into the mathematical equivalent of a transmission line.  We will demonstrate that this results in a system that is guaranteed to be stable, regardless of the length or structure of the time delay.  This results because transmission lines can be shown to be passive and passive systems, by definition, are guaranteed to be stable.  During Phase I, Creare will incorporate our algorighm into a federated object model and demonstrate a real-time implementation.  During Phase II, we will build and demonstrate multiple federated object models and provide real-time haptic feedback while interacting with a distributed simulation and database.",

High-power double-cladded fiber lasers which emit at 1.06 microns are now available.  To develop high-power, eye-safe fiber lasers such as Er-doped fiber lasers involving a three-level interaction, the key problem, which must be addressed, is the relatively low pumping efficiency of these rare-earth ions residing in a very small core region as compared with the four-level Nd-doped or quasi-four-level Yb-doped laser systems.  In Phase I, a detailed investigation of three new double-cladded fiber structures which are designed and configured to enhance the pumping efficiency is proposed.  In addition, we propose the use of Yb:Er codoping to form the core.  Configurations to be explored include (1) a corrugated inner cladding, (2) enlarged doping profile, and (3) a multicore fiber bundle.  The Phase I effort will be focused on the development of scalable models, which can provide quantitative results on the performance of these lasers and their limitations.  By using these models involving new double-cladded Yb:Er-codoped fibers, an optimum design of a low-cost, diode-pumped, high-power fiber laser oscillating at an eye-safe wavelength will be established.  Based on this optimum design, a prototype will be built, demonstrated and evaluated in Phase II.",

CMP is an important technology to support multilayer interconnect.  Since the results of CMP is dependent on the topography of the chip, systematic spatial variations due to layout pattern dependencies are, today, unavoidable.  Since CMP variation dominate interconnect dielectric variation, these systematic spatial dependence can have a significant impact on speed variations and potential race conditions.  By leveraging from existing research at MIT, as well as PDF's background in TCAD frameworks and statistical modeling, we propose to determine the requirements software and engineering methods which couple CMP equipment, chip and feature level simulation.  The eventual goal is to provide an environment for predicting the variations in interconnect capacitance as a function of CMP equipment settings.  Such a system would help defray the costs of applying CMP to low volume products.  This project will have widespread impact on CMP tool and sensor improvement; process design, optimization and control; and integrated circuit design for manufacturability.  Development of software which makes CMP techniques more affordable and reliable is of great interest to most commercial and military manufacturers.  Moreover, only physically-based simulation will render CMP viable for low-volume applications such as those common in the defense community.",

Plasmepsin II, an aspartyl protease, is involved in the digestion of hemoglobin which is the major nutrient source for the parasite. Inhibition of hemoglobin degradation has been shown to cause parasite death. At Pharmacopeia, combinatorial libraries of small organic molecules are synthesized on beads and after each synthetic step an encoding molecule or tag is attached to the bead which allows for rapid identification of the structures of compounds having inhibitory activity. By screening two combinatorial libraries targeted for aspartyl proteases (32,000 compounds) for inhibition of plasmepsin II and cathepsin D, we have obtained structure-activity information as well as identified a competitive inhibitor of plasmepsin II with a Ki value of 110 nM that is selective over the structurally related aspartyl protease, cathepsin D. To reduce the peptiditic characteristics of our current inhibitors to further our knowledge of structure-activity relationships and to identify additional selective inhibitors of plasmepsin II, we will synthesize two additional libraries resulting in at least 25,000 compounds. This additional information will help to design libraries to be synthesized in Phase II which will have increased potency, selectivity and efficacy in cell culture which are required prior to further drug development.",

In comparison to an explosive acoustic source the SD is safe, reusable, can provide pulse trains and has controllable acoustic output. The originator of the Surface Discharge acoustic source proposes to evaluate the use of SD technology for \"A1\" size sonobuoy applications. Existing SD acoustic source technology, developed for surveillance arrays, has novel features attractive for use in sonobuoys. The SD has high efficiency in converting electrical into acoustic energy and a compact transducer design that translate into a powerful impulsive acoustic source with the potential to supplement or replace explosive acoustic sources currently in use. Controllability includes both the ability to determine the peak in the acoustic spectrum as well as precise electronic timing of pressure waveforms. Unlike explosives, an SD system can ping many times, and will eliminate the safety and environmental concerns of explosives. Phoenix Science & Technology (PS&T) proposes to apply its unique knowledge of low frequency impulsive SD sources in a design study to determine the SD's Energy Source Level (ESL) and acoustic spectral capabilities in an \"A\" size sonobuoy, in comparison to a four pound SUS charge. We will trade-off the maximum ESL as a function of number of pings and ping repetition rate, and use existing experimental data to determine the timing accuracy capability for producing programmable wavetrains. In addition, we will design single and 3 element SD systems for fabrication and testing in Phase II.",

One of the major challenges facing any image sensor is the ability to handle scenes with wide variation in illumination. Space-based sensors are particularly challenged by this requirement since objects are often sunlit with significant portions in deep shadow. Conventiona charge-coupled devices (CCDs) have relatively-limited intrascene detail is lost in the noise. The proposed ultra-high dynamic range CMOS APS can achieve intrascene dynamic range of the order of 110 dB. Additiona features such as on-chip analog-to-digital converter and on-chip timing and control electronics enable system miniaturization and focal-plane lightweighting.  In Phase I, the ultra high dynamic range concept will be explored. Experiments using existing Photobit sensors will be performed to verify achievement of ultra-high dynamic range concepts. In Phase II, implementation of a ultra-high dynamic range sensor with integrated on-chip timing and control circuitry, and ADC, will be performed.  Benefits to BMDO include enhanced performance of visible spectrum sensors, and enhanced system performance due to lower power, miniaturizationr and lightweighting.

        "abstract": "This work addresses the development of ultra high resolution CMOS APS imagers.  The recent development of the CMOS active pixel sensor (APS) by the proposers during their former employment at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has, for the first time, permitted large scale integration of electronics on the same chip as a high performance image sensor.  A major challenge facing any high resolution imager is the readout of vast amounts of data at reasonably high frame rates.  The CMOS ABS is well positioned to address this issue since it is an X-Y readout sensor (charge transfer at high rates through many pixels is not required).  Second, the APS permits on-chip analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) which enables high speed low power parallel readout of digital -data without concern about crosstalk, imbalance between amplifiers, and amplifier setting time.  In Phase I, approaches to achieving ultra high resolution CMOS APS arrays will be explored.  Low power high speed on-chip ADC and digital readout circuit techniques will be addressed.  Foundries where such sensors could be fabricated will be identified.  Key circuits will be designed, fabricated and tested on small scale sensors.  In Phase II, an ultra high resolution sensor will be designed, fabricated and tested.  The commercial appeal of high resolution, high speed camera is in its potential ability to replace film for many applications which move to the digital domain after developing.  Cameras for special effects in motion pictures, X-ray imaging, and microscopy would benefit greatly.  Defense applications include aerial photography in reconnaissance, and missile and other weapons testing applications.",

        "abstract": "We propose to design and characterize an array of potential candidate reference sources suitable for infrared, visible and near-ultraviolet wavelength sensors that can be used to perform in-flight calibrations of DoD's signatures measurements assets.  At Present, no flight-qualified reference sources exist for performing absolute radiometric calibration of these sensors while airborne.  To accomplish this task we will first perform a study of DoD's airborne sensors that operate in the 0.2um to 15um wavelength regime and thus determine their in-flight calibration requirements.  The instrument operating characteristics determined in this work will serve to define the reference sources needed which, in all probability, will include extended, point and intensity-modulated types.  The proposed calibrators will be designed such that they can be installed into a standard SU-16 aircraft instrumentation pod and flown on (or along-side) the target aircraft whose signatures are to be investigated. The principal elements that are to comprise this prototype Airborne Common Calibration System (ACCS) are presented herein.  Its design includes provisions for stand-alone operation (no pilot intervention required) and for recording of the important local atmospheric properties needed for post-flight interpretations of the calibration data acquired during airborne operations.  This common reference system will fulfill a technology shortfall that presently exists in the evaluation of new and existing sersors intended for use onboard airborne platforms.",

These filters are usually large in size compared to the chip package and can be expensive.  We are proposing a solution to these problems by integrating all external functions and components such as filters, the Oscillator tank circuitry, and the DSP engine onto a single substrate, reducing the size and cost.  Because this chip would be CMOS, adding a digital demodulator will be trivial.  In addition, we will add programmability to the GPS receiver that will allow it to demodulate all aspects of the GPS signals in both RF bands.  We can achieve  these goals through an innovative architecture and state-of-the-art circuit design.  This level of integration has not yet been achieved because the necessary circuits and techniques have only been pioneered and demonstrated in the past few years by our design team.",

        "abstract": "Physical Sciences, Inc. (PSI) and our subcontractor Textron Systems Division (TSD) propose to develop multifunctional, compact (thin), yet low-mass, composites for applications to space systems on small satellites.  In addition to providing mechanical strength for structural enclosures, these materials will be significantly more effective in shielding against ionizing space radiation than traditional composites on a unit volume basis and traditional metals on a unit mass basis.  Starting with graphite-epoxy composite as the baseline (control) material, our idea is to embed into the epoxy powders of materials which efficiently increase the attenuation (scattering and absorption) of protons and electrons.  For EMI shielding, we  will consider high electrical conductance metal foils (or vapor deposits) on the inner face of the composite panel.  The outer, space-exposed face of the panel, coated with proper surface treatments, will provide thermal control as well as protection against atomic oxygen.  Phase I program will include stopping power calculations for representative embedded composites, and for selected cases, Monte-Carlo modeling of proton an electron scattering to determine their radiation absorption characteristics.  We will process and fabricate of samples of radiation-hardened composites; measure proton beam attenuation through the samples at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, and conduct preliminary high frequency EMI attenuation testing.|  Benefits:  Compare, low mass radiation hardened shields, made of high strength-to-weight ratio composites, have wide application as structural enclosures for spacecraft and payload systems on military and commercial satellites, resulting in substantial reductions in total spacecraft weight.  The technology can be directly and effectively adapted to commercial applications which require shielding against neutrons, e.g. hazardous nuclear environments.|",

        "abstract": "Physical Sciences, Inc. (PSI) proposes to develop an etching tool based upon its patented Fast Atom Sample Tester (FAST) technology that addresses a critical processing problem faced by manufacturers of Bonded wafers.  The fabrication process for bonded wafers results in a 5 mm wide strip of partially delaminated silicon along the perimeter of the 8-in. wafer which can serve as a source of unacceptable particle contamination.  This 25\u00c2\u00bfm thick damage area must be removed by a fast (5 min/wafer), all-dry method which does not remove the underlying Si02 layer.  The proposed etching tool employs the FAST technology to generate a uniform, hyperthermal (2 to 15 eV translational energy) fluorine atom beam, concentrated over the delaminated film.  The unique characteristics of the FAST technology including its tunable translational energy range, low ion content, and pulsed nature enable high rate, selective, damage-free, and controlled removal of the delaminated film which meets the stated processing goals.  The technology is demonstrated on 8-in. bonded wafers in the Phase I program.  In Phase II, a commercial prototype etching tool would be fabricated.  The proposed effort includes a collaboration with SiBond, a leading producer of bonded wafers that will assure the etching tool meets industry requirements.",

In PDT, a laser is used to initiate a photochemical reaction that causes cancer cell necrosis.  Since early trials in 1977, more than 5000 patients world wide have received PDT treatment with promising results.  One of the most attractive features of PDT is that the process is specific to cancer cells and healthy cells are essentially unaffected.  Many studies have concluded that excited metastable oxygen O{sub 2} (a{super 1}delta) is the active species in the cancer cell destruction.  Dosimetry is extremely important, and at the present time there is no reliable technique for real time monitoring of the O{sub 2}[a{super 1}delta] during the treatment process.  Physical Sciences Inc.

Legner, Principal Investigator\nMr. George E. Caledonia, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-97ER82455\nAmount:  $74,973\n\nThe processing of chemical waste is an important technological problem for the Department of Energy with far-reaching environmental and economic benefits.  In particular, thermal plasma processing is becoming an important method to treat chemical waste, as well as being a promising technique to induce high-temperature chemical reactions.  However, the chemistry of this technique can be quite complex and accurate computational tools to evaluate these processes are currently unavailable.  The focus of the project is the development of a simulation technique that leads to a thorough understanding of plasma chemical reactors.  A novel computer code will be developed to improve this situation by combining two existing models into a new user friendly tool.   In the Phase I effort, an initial version of the simulation code linking the aforementioned models will be developed.  The combined model will enable the assessment of chemical kinetics for candidate waste constituents from the plasma discharge source to the processing zone.  The operation of the code will be validated by comparing computations against available experimental data and analytical model results for a specific chemical waste system: hydrogen sulfide dissociation.  The Phase II effort will focus upon the continued development of the simulation code including chemical reaction models for several waste systems of interest.  Code comparisons with additional model validation experiments, using existing plasma sources, would also be undertaken.\n\nCommercial Applications and the Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A validated simulation code that includes all of the principal elements of thermal plasma-driven chemistry would be extremely useful in effectively and economically assessing chemical waste processing systems, and in designing experimental tests.  In addition to waste reduction, the code could also be applied to reactive and non-reactive plasma spraying and plasma-based materials processing in the semiconductor and chemical industries.

Kimble, Principal Investigator\nMr. George E. Caledonia, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-97ER82454\nAmount:  $74,989\n\n\nFuel cells offer a potential replacement for the internal combustion engine in vehicles because they are clean, energy efficient, and can use more than one type of fuel.  For this reason the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, in which the Department of Energy plays a key role, is particularly interested in supporting research to develop corrosion-resistant bipolar plates, which are key components in proton exchange membrane fuel cells.  Traditionally, graphite bipolar plates have been used in fuel cells to separate each cell in a stack, and  machined or molded flow fields (channels) are placed in these plates to allow the hydrogen and air to mix and react with other materials.  Not only are these flow fields costly to manufacture, but the bipolar plates themselves also contribute to about 75 percent of the weight of the stack of fuel cells.  The high cost and large mass and volume of these graphite bipolar plates prevent the proton exchange membrane fuel cell from currently being commercialized for vehicular applications.  To address these problems, Phase I will be devoted to constructing thin and lightweight bipolar plates from aluminum that has been electrodeposited with metal layers to impart corrosion resistance.  Bipolar plate corrosion will be reduced through the control of ductility, tensile strength, porosity, and grain size, among other properties in the desposition process will be optimized to.  The mechanical properties of the deposited metal layers will be optimized to obtain high electrical conductivity while maintaining similar coefficients of thermal expansion between the aluminum and coating.  This will allow thin metal bipolar plates to be easily stamped for channels, coated, and incorporated in the proton exchange membrane fuel cell stack.  A Phase II project will examine longer durability testing of these bipolar plates.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: This process for fabricating bipolar plates uses inexpensive materials, uses established electrodeposition technology, and has high-volume manufacturability capabilities using low-cost capital equipment.  These attributes improve the chances for successful introduction of vehicles powered by fuel cells in the marketplace._",

There  is considerable use, and considerably greater potential for use, of piezoelectric  actuators, positioners, and sensors in precision manufacturing, and  specifically precision machining.  In such applications the piezo element is not  dynamically controlled.  The speed of operation, settling time, and accuracy of  the piezoelectric element could be dramatically improved with an improved  control system.  PIEZOMAX Company's proposed piezoelectric feedback  system will be much more effective than presently available methods.  Such a  system has none of the drawbacks of existing technology and is easily  implemented.  The approach can in principle be engineered for use with a  variety of precision machining and other manufacturing applications in which  piezoelectric components are used: piezoelectric tool or workpiece  positioning systems, piezoelectric platform dynamometers, piezoelectric  drilling dynamometers, piezoelectric single-point diamond tools for nanometric  cutting, accelerometers, micropneumazic controllers, ultrasonic motors, and  micromechanical linear-to-rotary motion -Transducers.  In the feasibility study,  the controller concept will be developed for a generic piezoelectrictioner.   Speed, accuracy, and settling time of the positioner and performance  improvement relative to conventional piezoelectric control will be determined.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I project will investigate the feasibility of an improved control strategy for piezoelectric positioners used in scanned-probe microscopes (SPMs) to increase their speed and reliability for nanocharacterization.  Rapid nanocharacterization requires fast motion of the scanned piezo probe with sub-Angstrom vertical resolution and with frequent rapid changes in its axial position.  Settling time after a change in the position has been commanded is a serious issue that currently places severe limits on speed and reliability: under present control schemes SPMs cannot be operated anywhere near the resonant frequencies of the piezo element.  PIEZOMAX Technologies, Inc. proposes to test the feasibility of an improved control scheme that should allow an order of magnitude increase in scan speed of SPMs by reducing settling time.  In the feasibility study the control strategy will be designed, implemented digitally, and tested on a variety of piezoelectric positioners used in SPMs.  The effect of noise,passive damping, and detuning of the controller will be investigated and comparisons established with the performance of conventional SPMs.  The approach should be applicable to a variety of piezoelectric positioners and thus to a broad range of applications in characterization, inspection, and nanopatterning involving scanned probes.",

The Fleet TMA algorithms process active measurements of range and bearing as observed relative to an ownship moving platform.  The techniques which offer significant improvement in solution quality include doppler enhancement, acoustic sensor weighting by SNR, variable averaging periods, overlapping averaging periods, assigning solution qualities, and independent parameter verifications.  There is no easy way to incorporate all of the enhancements in any one of the TMA algorithms without changing the basic assumptions that were used to derive each of the TMA algorithms.  We propose to modify an existing TMA algorithm that is based on a more general target motion model.  This algorithm has been used primarily in a passive environment to do post-exercise reconstruction, but it can also operate in    real- time.  Within each time window, this algorithm assumes that the target is traveling at constant acceleration and turn rate, rather than constant course and speed. All of the enhancement techniques are already available within this algorithm. This TMA algorithm degenerates to a standard Kalman filter under certain assumptions.",

Currently, the cost of wide-band control is prohibitive for lightly damped systems such as precision structures or highly reverberant acoustic spaces, even if the system has just one canceling actuator and one error sensor.  The problem is compounded powerfully when multiple actuators and sensors must be coordinated.  We propose to greatly reduce the computation cost and widen the applicability of adaptive cancellation by developing algorithms that require far fewer parameters to be adjusted, using infinite impulse response (IIR) system models and controllers.While the vast majority of work has been focused on finite-impulse response (FIR) modeling, IIR models have long been recognized as a potential solution to the high computational burden associated with FIR models. Many approaches have been tried, but their successful use has generally been restricted to systems with significant damping.  We propose to solve the numerical ill conditioning and slow, unreliable convergence problems of current IIR methods by transformations of the system inputs and outputs that orthogonalize the correlation matrix of the inputs to the adaptive IIR system.",

Recent high heat flux testing has shown that when large bonded tiles develop high thermal stresses, the bonds break.  Finite element modeling has shown that the thermal stresses between the low expansion armor and the high expansion copper heat sinks are lowered significantly as tile size of the armor is decreased.  The theoretical solution is to fabricate a brush structure for the armor.  Therefore, the objective of this Phase I project is to develop and fabricate small-scale plasma-facing component armor of tungsten and beryllium to demonstrate brush armor fabrication and properties.  The individual brush filaments or bristles can be made 3 millimeters and smaller and packed together such that the heat sink is protected from the fusion plasma better than machining complex tile breaks.  Thermal stresses will be minimized by the brush structure as the individual brush members can expand and contract with the heat sink.  Using conical tips on the bonded end of the brush members, three-dimensional bond joints will be produced.  Increased armor life at high heat flux will then be realized with the brush structure.  During Phase II, the fabrication techniques developed during Phase I will be optimized.  Finite element modeling of the brush structure will be performed, on tip design and stress concentration at the brush joint.  These optimized techniques will then be used to fabricate a medium-scale mockup for high heat flux testing.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This research may  have commercial applications in the following areas: fusion reactor plasma-facing components, furnace heat sinks, rocket and jet engines, radiators, satellite thermal management, high-voltage electrical contacts, heat sinks, beam targets, and welding electrodes._",

The application of many hard materials of  potential interest (e.g. cubic boron nitride, hard carbon, silicon carbide) require bombardment by high fluxes of energetic particles during growth to produce high quality films.  While plasma deposition processes are widely used, none is satisfactory for these materials and applications because of high cost and lack of precise deposition control. This project is to develop a high-density plasma ion source suitable for high-rate deposition of hard coatings over large areas.  The ion source will be based on permanent magnet electron cyclotron technology in order to reduce cost. This source should be capable of generating uniform high-density plasmas over a 14 in. diameter region.  Phase I will concentrate on the design, development, and demonstration of the plasma ion source.  This phase will demonstrate the deposition process, but would not concentrate on deposition of hard coatings. Phase II will focus on ion-enhanced deposition of films such as cubic boron nitride, C3 N4, fluorinated hard carbon films and diamond like carbon.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: This source would not only enable novel processes, but act as a link between laboratory and commercial application of ion assisted, hard coating deposition processes.

A new approach that offers the possibility of higher critical current density at higher magnetic fields is the continuous-rapid-quench method.    This method also offers the potential of forming nonsuperconducting wire that can be twisted, bent, or wound and then subjected to a moderate but quick heat treatment to make it superconducting as well as the potential to apply a copper stabilizer after the rapid quench but before the final heat treatment.

To increase the understanding of CNS function, it is essential that we can visualize the action of microdomains of molecules or even single molecules in living systems.  Near-Field Scanning Optical Microscopy (NSOM) has revolutionized optical microscopy in the physical sciences by permitting investigations of single molecules with visible wavelengths of light.  Recently, the applicant's collaborator, Dr.  Haydon, has made modifications to such instrumentation and has demonstrated its utility in biological studies of living systems.  The goal of this Phase I proposal is to determine the feasibility of developing turn-key instrumentation for sub- diffraction resolution of living cells.  They will develop and evaluate an automated photon feedback (PDF) instrument that was recently invented at Iowa State University, to achieve sub-diffraction optical resolution for studies of living cells.

The proposed test of feasibility will focus on two crucial questions regarding communication on the World Wide Web: Can authoritative, reliable information be provided through this medium? Will such a medium prove to be a useful forum for the scientific community? Because it is a multidisciplinary field crucial to the AIDS epidemic and remains underserved, neuro-AIDS has been selected for the Phase I test of feasibility. A Web site will be developed focusing on key questions in neuro-AIDS, as selected by a Scientific Advisory Panel of outstanding investigators in the field. The site will be aimed at researchers currently in neuro-AIDS, in other AIDS-related areas, non-AIDS researchers with neuro-AIDS-relevant expertise, clinicians who treat individuals living with HIV, and young investigators in fields such as neuroscience or molecular biology who may consider neuro-AIDS research.",

The detector will employ a lithium fluoride bolometer in which lithium-6 serves as the neutron absorber.   Only conventional cryostat cooling is needed.  This detection method also allows neutron spectroscopy to be performed using simple techniques similar to those employed in X- and gamma-ray spectroscopy.  In the first phase of the program, a prototype detector will be designed and fabricated and its performance will be evaluated.  Phase II will optimize detector design and fabrication.  A completed unit, including the detector, electronics and the associated cryogenic components, will be developed during Phase II of the program.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This unique neutron detector combines high detection efficiency with high energy resolution.  It would find many applications in high energy physics and nuclear physics as well as in neutron radiography and environmental neutron monitoring.\n\n\n  _",

        "abstract": "It is well known that Gen III image intensifiers based on Negative Electron Affinity (NEA) photocathodes and micromechanical plates suffer from a major limitation of having the long wavelength cutoff limited only to about 950 nm.  For that reason, it has poor modulation transfer function and correspondingly lower performance in starlight and in the overcast starlight levels.  To develop a new type of night vision system with much approved capability in the moonless or overcast starlight illumination, a few sensor is needed with long wavelength cutoff extended to about 2\u00c2\u00bf. A focal plane array incorporating a solid state type of detector in a digital camera system will be desirable as it will have the ability to integrate with the rest of the digital battlefield of the future.  However, some Gen III image intensifiers have 60 deg field of view and has resolution of 70 1p/mm at higher light levels.  To get similar field view and resolution performance out of the low light level camera at much lower light levels, one will require a large size array of 1024x1024 pixels.  Fabrication of such large array of detectors is a formidable task considering the present state of the technology of InGaAs. To fabricate such large size array at reasonable cost, very small pixel size (8\u00c2\u00bf) with InGaAs layers grown/bonded on  silicon readout circuits. An 128x128 detector array with 8\u00c2\u00bf pixel size will be fabricated and tested for its performance in Phase I. We propose to develop the InGaAs detector based FPA technology further in phase II to fabricate an 1024x1024 density focal plane array, which will be the basis for an extremely high performance, low cost night vision system with digital interface and display capability.",

Hard x-ray imaging of supra-thermal electrons and tangential imaging of soft x-rays are two diagnostics of particular value in detecting and measuring these instabilities. These X-ray diagnostics are currently limited by the data acquisition rate. Increasing the rate of the x-ray image acquisition would markedly improve the study of  instabilities that have frequencies in the range from 1 to 500 kilo Hertz.  This project is to develop an x-ray camera to provide ultra high frame rate imaging.  The design permits the read out of the image sensor at a slow frame rate convenient for digital archiving and display with standard microcomputer and television hardware.  The camera system should be less expensive than current technology. In Phase I an x-ray imaging system capable of capturing high spatial resolution images at frame rates up to 1,000,000 frames per second will be investigated, based on combining a large format x-ray converter tube with a unique solid state imager. The goal is to increase the frame capacity of the image sensor from 32 to~300 frames, to better match the requirements for plasma x-ray diagnostics as well as other commercial applications.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This ultra-high frame rate solid state camera would find numerous commercial application in industry, defense, nuclear testing and scientific applications needing such high frame rate imaging instrumentation._",

        "abstract": "Advances in laser based weapons constitute a real threat to military aircraft. Detection of incident laser beam illumination early enough to allow an active response is vital. A laser beamrider detection system must have a high probability of detection with a low false alarm rate. This proposal addresses the difficult problem of detecting hostile  laser illumination against bright daylight backgrounds over a wide field of view without knowledge of the laser's wavelength or pulse repetition rate. A high resolution imaging  sensor is proposed capable of running at  1,000,000 frames/sec, thus combining high spatial and temporal resolution to reduce the ambient background signal without  attenuating the sub-microsecond pulsed laser signal.  With this sensor, background  noise can be reduced to a level where knowledge of the laser's wavelength is not needed and narrow band optical filtering not necessary in order to detect incident low-intensity laser beams in the daytime, over a wide field of view.  The proposed detector employs \"smart pixels\u00c2\u00bf to avoid the impossible burden of reading out the image a million times a second, and thus provides a high duty factor for detecting pulses from threat laser systems.",

Many of today's systems have become dead-ended due to architecture and  hardware evolutions.  As the technology curve has steepened, system  components become dated in an ever-decreasing period of time.  End-of-life  issues are generally solved by wholesale replacement.  However, if discipline is  applied in design, the anticipated, future migration effort for even differing  architecture systems can be significantly minimized. The intent of this effort is to provide infusion assessment and management  tools, strategies, and methodologies for creating resilient system designs.   Although recent reform has enabled COTS deployment within defense systems,   the approach to developing these systems relies on \"Specialized\" high end  components to meet requirements. This stategy, albeit significantly more cost  effective than full military development, has some significant disadvantages  due to the relatively small user base. However, as the demand for desktop  processing and throughput continues to pace technology growth, a  convergence of capability is likely to be realized in the near future.

Mechanism-based drug design will be applied to develop peptide-derived inhibitors of these proteases.  At the same time, experiments to develop non-peptide templates for creating orally active or injectable inhibitors of these proteases will begin, based on use of combinatorial chemistry on known orally active inhibitors of metalloproteases.  During Phase, I we will characterize inhibitor activity with a set of 10 15 lead compounds using a procedure based on incubation of various toxin proteolytic substrates with clostridial neurotoxins.  These substrates are cleaved by the toxin metalloprotease generating fragments with an electrophoretic mobility different from those of the uncleaved substrates.  These compounds are expected to function as pharmacological antagonists and to serve as important probes useful for neurobiological research as adjuncts for reversing effects of BoTx in treating achalasia and related disorders in humans, and as important lead compounds in antitoxin drug development.

Foreign items (e.g., radiolucent shrapnel) embedded in the body can also be imaged.

Major scanner functions' size, weight, and power must be significantly reduced for portable operation.  The beamformer dynamically focuses, apodizes, and steers both transmitted and received ultrasonic wave forms.  Modern beamformers typically utilized an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) at each element, followed by digital memory and signal processing circuitry.  The beamformer is amenable to the extensive size, weight, and power reduction possible using charge-couple device (CCD) technology.  This  technology is integrable with conventional CMOS.  The proposed beamformer provides the same functionality as digital designs but at 1% their size, weight, power, and for 10% their cost, while increasing resolution ten-fold.  During Phase I, the CCD/CMOS beamformer's feasibility will be assessed.  A preliminary beamformer design will be developed in coordination with TRP and industry personnel.  A prototype beamformer will be fabricated and evaluated during Phase II.  During Phase III, the beamformer will transition to production in military and commercial ultrasound scanners.

During Phase 1 we plan to evaluate three different approaches termed direct, active, and passive.  In the direct approach, motion sensors attached to the antenna will be used to determine the position of each element in the array.  The active approach uses one or more radiators to illuminate the array to measure phase variations proportional to position for each element.  In the passive approach, statistical properties of the scene under observation are exploited to directly measure phase errors between adjacent elements in the array.  This technique, currently in use to focus phased array radars, can be extended to synthetic aperture radiometers with minimal modification.

Radiant Research, Inc., proposes a drastically new idea to solve this problem by introducing a mode-matched waveguide to significantly alleviate the existing coupling losses among various optoelectronic components. Based on our in-depth investigation. the compression-molded polymer waveguide proposed herein is the only solution to bridge huge dynamic range of different optoelectronic device depths. There is no other waveguide fabrication method that is capable of providing the waveguide depth needed to cover the required dynamic range of depth which may vary from few um to hundreds of um. The idea is aimed at providing a cost-effective, reliable and low-loss optoelectronic packaging. All the transparent optical polymeric (TOP) materials are either thermosetts or thermoplastics. Both can be molded into a specific shape as desired. It is therefore best-suited to integrate different optoelectronic devices with a different device size and spacing.

        "abstract": "To further enhance the bandwidth promised by optics, wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) scheme is becoming one of the major thrusts in photonics research. Most of the WDMs demonstrated are made out of glass and III-V compound semiconductor. The non-multiplexibility and the small index modulation of these inorganic materials result in severe restrictions that make WDM systems incapable of handling such needed functions as l-to-many fanout at the same WDM node, surface normal packaging to increase reliabilitv. and two-dimensional fanout flexibility.  Radiant Research, Inc., (RRI), proposes a dispersion-enhanced multiplexed photopolymer graft for multiwavelength distribution networks. The basic material research is aimed at providing all the needed features that can not be achieved through employing glass and III-V compound semiconductor. High density WDM and l-to-many fanouts will be demonstrated using the dispersion-enhanced multiplexed photopolvmer graft. In contrast to the existing WDMs that have a surface-relief grating pattern due to the small intrinsic index modulation, the photopolymer films have an index modulation as large as 0.2. As a result, tilted grating profiles with high spatial resolutions can be made for surface-normal fanouts that is able to achieve a 2D fanout structure, realizing the full advantages of optics, that is not achievable through conventional approaches.  A critical product that can be generated out of this program is the high spatial resolution multiplexed gratings for WDM system integration. The gratings to be fabricated in this program has a myriad of applications other than the proposed one. The photopolymer employed is transparent from 400 nm to 1.6 mm. Therefore, the 2D WDM-fanout device can be used for almost any interconnection network using visible and near IR as the signal carriers. Further applications such as bit-parallel optical interconnects (developed at JPL), optical sensors, optical spectrum analyzers, and ground-to-satellite and satellite-to-satellite laser communications are all feasible.",

The 2 MB/s to 600 MB/s data rates will be provided by the direct modulation of a laser diode.  Unlike any conventional approach where one TTD line can provide only one delay signal at a time, the proposed true-time-delay module is capable of generating all required optical true-time delay signals simultaneously to all antenna elements.  Th application of the wavelength-division-multiplexing technique makes the formation of a twin-beam phased array an easy task without increasing the payload of an airborne or spaceborne platform.By the end of Phase I, we will demonstrate all the after mentioned unique features to build a solid cornerstone for the success of the Phase II program.",

Karpuk, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG03-97ER82497\nAmount:  $75,000\n\nCoal is an abundant and low-cost resource, primarily used in the generation of electricity.  The use of coal as a feedstock for the production of fuels and chemicals is expected to grow as petroleum  and natural gas feedstocks become more expensive.  Syngas from coal gasification is used in the synthesis of high value and strategic chemicals, the production of which exceeds 7 million tons per year.  Alkene hydroformylation is used to produce these chemicals by means of using cobalt and rhodium carbonyl catalysts in the reaction of an alkene with syngas to form aldehydes.  However, since the catalysts and the products of the reaction are in the same phase, catalyst recovery can be accomplished only by energy-intensive distillation processes.  This problem may be avoided if the reaction is carried out in vapor phase over a solid catalyst.  A novel class of catalysts whose activity and selectivity for vapor phase alkene hydroformylation is comparable to those of conventionally used catalysts will be synthesized in Phase I of the project.  The catalysts will be characterized and their activity toward alkene hydroformylation and aldehyde selectivity will be investigated.  An engineering analysis will be performed to determine the economic and environmental benefits derived from using these novel catalysts.  In Phase II a pilot plant will be built and operated to determine the commercial potential of this technology. \n\nCommercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The development of an active and highly selective heterogeneous hydroformylation catalyst would provide both economic and environmental advantages to existing homogeneous processes and would eliminate catalyst recovery and losses.  The process may also be applicable to methanol carbonylation.\n\n\n\n_",

        "abstract": "The U.S. demand for chlorinated hydrocarbons exceeds 15 million tons annually.  The production of these chemicals requires chlorine (Cl2) and produces HCl as an unavoidable by-product.  Stringent environmental regulations limit the shipment of hazardous wastes like HCl, and the disposal of HCl by neutralization is costly.  A consortium of 15 companies is developing an in-process recycling system to oxidize the waste HCl into chlorine, which is internally recycled to the chlorinator.  Unfortunately, due to equilibrium constraints, even when pure O2 is used as the oxidant, not all of the HCl can be converted back to Cl2.  Thus, the process incorporates a second stage sorbent, CuO, which removes the residual HCl and recycles it back to the oxidizer.  Because the Cl2 loading on the current sorbent is low, contribution of the sorbent to the process cost is high. TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) has developed long-life sorbents with high loadings of the chemically active materials for hot gas and flue gas cleanup applications.  In this Phase I project, TDA will apply its technology to improve the CuO sorbent.  During Phase I, TDA will develop a new sorbent for the conversion of HCl to Cl2.  Several formulations will be evaluated, and one sorbent will be exposed to several cycles in the Product Development Unit (PDU).  TDA also will evaluate the economics of the approach.  It is anticipated that the sorbent loading will be improved by a factor of five over the current sorbent.  This improvement will reduce the sorbent replacement cost by a factor of five and the cost of chlorine recovery by about a factor of two, greatly improving the economics of the chlorine recovery process.",

        "abstract": "RIA scientists have developed a numerical scheme for the detection and classification of complicated signals in highly noisy environments (negative SNR).  This method performs DIC using nonlinear signal information based on techniques developed from the theory of Chaotic dynamics.  Preliminary tests on real-world data sets, recently supplied by Navy personnel, indicate that this method will likely outperform most current linear classification methods, provided the signal of interest contains some nonlinear correlations.  In addition, this method has been modified to perform DIC on transient signals (e.g. active pulses), with correspondingly good performance.  These algorithms are quite computationally efficient and can be implemented on any standard workstation environment.  This research program will further refine these methods, measure operating characteristics, characterize performance on a variety of real-world data sets, and especially to modify the basic scheme for a variety of other problems of interest to the Army.  Anticipated benefits to the Army will be electronic signal recognition and classification technologies with significantly improved performance characteristics especially suited to high noise environments.  Commercial applications can be directly made to signal and image processing, forecasting of economic and geophysical systems (e.g. earthquakes), voice recognition, and biomedical technology (e.g. recognizing and characterizing physiological states.)  Immediate application can likely be made to a variety of DoD and commercial application including secure voice communications, detection of precursors to heart attacks, detection of precursors to earthquakes, classification of economic trends, and classification of military/geopolitical modeling systems (e.g. self-organization in force deployments).",

        "abstract": "While much of the data involved in product and order definition has been captured in standard electronic structures such as IGES and EDI, material and process specifications are still handled as amorphous, paper-based documents. The use of manual, text-based specifications is an extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Specifications are an integral part of the product and order definition effort and the lack of integration between specification content and MRP/JIT is a major obstacle in achieving an agile manufacturing enterprise. During this Phase 1 research, Renaissance Engineering (with the assistance of the Industrial Technology Institute) proposes: (1) develop a rough draft of a STEP Application Protocol for specifications; (2) define an approach for using CORBA services and facilities as the basis for software integration; and (3) create a conceptual design for integrating the STEP/CORBA approach with existing MRP systems such as SAP, BAAN, and Cincom. The resulting approach would be developed to be easily incorporated with other reference models such as those created by SEMATECH and MIIP. Instead of treating the design requirements in specifications as simple textual narrative, the proposed approach recognizes that specifications are an integral part of product data and product data exchange.",

Craig Derbidge, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG03-97ER82468\nAmount:  $74,949\nLiquefied natural gas (LNG) use in heavy-duty vehicles provides important air quality and energy security benefits over gasoline and diesel fuels.  However, high efficiency (e.g., direct-injection) natural gas engines are needed for economic viability, and some, like those employing direct injection, will require a high-pressure gas supply.  This project will develop and evaluate the design of a 3000-psi LNG fuel system.  The system stores LNG at conventionally-low pressures and utilizes an innovative waste-heat-driver reciprocating pump that minimizes cavitation, but can process liquid-vapor mixtures when necessary.  The pump drive utilizes the higher temperature of the engine coolant; this makes the system self-powered because it requires no engine driveshaft connections and thus consumes no engine power.  Phase I will include design analyses and tradeoff studies to determine the best suited configurations and operating conditions.  Bench tests of critical components will be conducted, and a preliminary system design will be established.  Prototype system fabrication, laboratory testing, and on-road demonstration is anticipated in Phase II.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This LNG fuel system solves the fuel supply pressure problem faced by heavy-duty vehicles using high-efficiency, low-emissions direct-injection natural gas engines.

The proposed IOuA is based on an integrated optics glass-on-silicon waveguide architecture, hence it presents a rugged, compact alternative to other technologies.  It is a completely passive interferometer device, with no moving parts.  The distinct advantage of the IOuA over piezo and silicon micromachined components is that it can survive high G forces during a satellite launch phase, yet requires no calibration on-orbit.  It is potentially much more sensitive than micromachined components, with a wider dynamic range.  Its signal processing is trivial in that it requires no crystal oscilator.  The key innovation here is the development of a low cost, mass-producible integrated optics sensor which can perform on-orbit with a minimum of weight, size, and power requirements.  The outcome of Phase I will be a set of design specifications for the construction, in Phase II, of a space qualified prototype IOuA, based on our experience with the integrated optics accelerometers and gyroscopes we are developing for medical, navigation, and automotive applications.",

The device merges novel patented technology with new patent pending technology to provide a sensor platform that is capable of moving a sensor within a full horizon-to-horizon 180 degree hemispherical range of motion. This requires a mount capable of a full 180 degree horizon-to-horizon movement without incurring the downtime caused by singularities (voids in the range of motion available to the sensor mount). Low weight and zero-backlash enhance positioning speed and accuracy. Ships, amphibious or four-wheel drive vehicles, and other platforms which move in three-dimensional space induce pitch, yaw, and roll motion to the sensor mount. Maintaining sensor lock in rough seas on stationary targets such as geosynchronous satellites, beacons, or other fixed objects is difficult, if not at times impossible, when using current sensor mounts technologies.

        "abstract": "The current market for fast switching frequency sythesizers is growing rapidly.  Most synthesizers available today will not meet the stringent requirements for switching quickly, providing spectrally pure RF outputs and minimizing physical size and cost.  As part of a current SBIR program, S.T. Research has developed a wideband, fast switching synthesizer, based on the use of broadband phase-locked loops (PLLs) and direct RF generation.  This synthesis technique produces coherent outputs of exceptional spectral purity, and can switch and settle over the full .5-18.5 GHz range in under 300 nsec.  The proposed SBIR program will miniaturize this demonstrated technology using the latest micro-wave monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC) parts and technology to produce a wideband,fast-switching, spectrally pure synthesizer of minimal size weight, and power consumption.  Mass production techniques will be considered allowing the unit to be mass produced for a fraction of the cost of currently available synthesizer units.  The performance features of this synthesizer design in conjunction with the lowered size, weight, and cost of this proposed unit result in efficient, cost-effective government and commercial microwave systems requiring stability, low phase noise, and fast switching speed.  Examples of such systems include: Satellite and terrestrial communications, both fixed and mobile.  Airborne and man-portable tactical systems such as electronic warfare intercepept and signal analysis systems, ECM jamming set-on receivers, LPI phase-coherent radars, active missle seeker systems.

A reliable means of detecting and monitoring operator mental states would allow an intelligent system to alert the operator in the case of mental lapses, or it could adaptively automate a subset of control functions in the case of operator overload.  Physiological and neurophysiological signals such as eye movements, the electroencephalogram, heart rate, and respiration can be used to classify operator mental states.  Indeed, laboratory research has demonstrated that such measures can be used to identify which of several cognitive tasks an operator is engaged in, the level of cognitive load an operator is being subjected to, and whether he or she is fatigued or otherwise impared.  Improved technology for research by professional psychophysiologists is needed to develop such measures to the point where they could be used in operational settings.

        "abstract": "Magnetic bearings will dramatically improve performance of gas turbine engines by permitting high rotor speeds and combustion temperatures.  Lubrication systems are also eliminated, reducing weight and logistic support.  These huge potential benefits are essential to the Integrated High Performance Turbine Engine Technology Program (IHPTET).  SatCon Technology Corporation's magnetic bearings have been tested to 36,000 RPM under contract with the Army's Power Systems Division.  However, several key issues remain.  No magnetic bearing system (MBS) has auxiliary bearings and control software that allow touchdown and recovery at engine operating speeds of 50,000 RPM, or is built with high temperature materials that will withstand 1,100F.  In addition, actuators and power electronics must be designed for low losses and minimal power dissipation.  In Phase I, SatCon will perform the initial analyses necessary to design a MBS that can satisfy the JTAGG II and III operating environment.  This design will address the key remaining issues. An integral part of this design effort will be test and validation on an existing gas turbine test rig, upgraded to operate at the JTAGG II speed of 50,000 RPM in Phase II.  Phase III will entail combining SatCon's magnetic and auxiliary bearing configurations with a JTAGG II or III engine.",

        "abstract": "The BMDO as part of its kinetic energy systems development requires an expendable, inertial guidance package. SatCon is proposing to develop an angular rate sensor combined with an accelerometer which are microfabricated on a single \"chip\" using the LIGA lithographic process.  The accelerometer element employs a rebalanced cantilever, oriented orthogonally to the substrate, while the rate sensor uses a vibrating cylinder sensitive to rotation through Coriolis effects. The topology is simple but well-suited for moderate sensitivity, high shock performance. Acceleration can be sensed in two axes parallel to the substrate, while angular rate is detectable along the perpendicular axis. Only one structural layer is required, eliminating the complexity of overhanging features or structure-to-structure bonding.  During Phase I, a suitable set of geometries for the combined sensor will be designed at SatCon and fabricated into test structures by our microfabrication foundry, LSU/CAMD. This will demonstrate a proof-of-principle for the mechanical and fabrication process. The designs and test results will be provided to the BMDO at tlle end of this project. A Phase I option will include production of a full set cf masks and fabrication of electrically testable structures as well as an examination of the response to electrostatic actuation. From these results an optimized mechanical and electronics design will be developed.  In Phase II, prototype versions of the accelerometer structures will be fabricated from a i11 set of masks, operated with drive and sensing electronics and made available to the BMDO.  The micro-fabricated inertial sensor has a simple topology, is inherently resistant to high shock, can be operated with a minimum of electronics, and is amenable to low cost production. It is an excellent solution as a key element in an inertial package wherever rugged, compact, inexpensive, moderately sensitive, or expendable devices are needed, e.g., automobile navigation systems and suspension control, robotics, in-vivo medical applications, high speed machining, and electronic parts placement machines.",

The proposed development and demonstration effort would provide an innovative solution to a problem which is becoming more and more important to organizations which must provide space based optical systems for the defense of the Nation and advancement of understanding of space.Both the Department of Defense and NASA face dramatic new challenges about the way they conduct space based optical sensor programs.  On one hand, costs must be reduced by factors of many.  But on the other hand, there are strong pressures for ever improved performance.The first and most obvious way to reduce space systems costs is to reduce spacecraft size and mass so that smaller, cheaper launch vehicles (e.g. Delta or Atlas) may be used.  However, in the case of optical systems, increased performance usually implies directly an increased size of the payload.  Development and demonstration of novel and unique optical-structural concepts to resolve this inherent dichotomy is the subject of WJSA's SBIR proposal.  We will demonstrate how modern technology can be directly applied to reduce cost and weight, without sacrificing performance.",

More than 800 man-years of laser experience can be brought together in a cohesive effort to define all the parameters, develop a model of the total system, and then do the trade-off studies of all viable alternatives.  From this will come a definitive to design and specification for the airborne slant range system. The SEO team is most capable in conversion of military products and R&D into commercial products.  A proven record of accomplishments in successful translation of SBIR efforts into complete commercial business operations - such as the Autosense traffic system has been demonstrated by SEO's Sensors Division.  The Model 1-2-3 laser in the Medical and Solid State Laser Division, and the Tri-Lase for tattoo removal in the Medical Division are examples of ability to convert R&D into commercial markets.

The adaptation of Multi- User Domains (MUDs), software that implements a virtual world accessible over a computer network to many remote users, for educational purposes has given some educators more flexibility in developing educational applications for computers. Existing MUDs have several serious limitations.  There is a very steep learning curve for educators due to the need for programming.  Also, MUDs provide text-only output making it difficult for some users who have learning disabilities.  These limitations have been addressed by efforts which included overlaying a web-based MUD client over existing text-only MUDs.  However, these solutions are still inadequate in increasing the accessibility of MUDs to less technically sophisticated educators. Scientific Digital Visions proposes to research the development of a software suite that integrates all of the functionality of existing MUDs within software that uses web technology exclusively, overcoming the limitations of its predecessors.

The objectives of the proposed program are:  1) to develop a real-time monitoring capability for gas turbine engines, 2) to demonstrate the capability to:  (a) track performance variations, (b) monitor component health, and (c) predict creep and fatigue life and the life consumption of critical parts.  A proof-of-concept demonstration based on simulation will be conducted in Phase I.  The detailed development and prototype testing will be conducted in Phase II.",

This test set will be used to diagnose faulty radio communications equipment while installed in the aircraft.  The investigation of the development of the OARTS will focus on producing a test set that is compact, rugged, lightweight (i.e., on-man carry), self-contained, and user-friendly.  The OARTS will be capable of testing the pertinent radio frequency (RF) performance characteristics of a variety of aircraft communications equipment.  The primary purpose of the proposed test set will be to determine if the Unit Under TEst (UUT) needs to be transported to a central maintenance depot for further testing and/or possible repair.  The types of communications equipment the OARTS will be capable of testing will include, but not be limited to the following:  the NA/ARC-164(V) UHF Transceiver, the AN/ARC-186(V) VHF Transceiver, and the AN/ARC-190 HF Transceiver.",

This project will utilize the informational bits provided by the fields to support QoS and priority level acknowledgment.2. Design of an ATM application that utilizes the ABR service via an application programmers interface (API).

Extension of the Air Force Survivable ATM system to incorporate ABR as an aid in providing network link information back to the end systems. One of the key components of the Survivable ATM system is the Transmission Error Control Subsystem (TECS).

        "abstract": "Future weapon platforms will require highly precise pointing and tracking capabilities in the presence of unpredictable terrain motions, unmodeled gun barrel flexure, nonlinear and time-varying parasitics such as backlash, friction. saturation and recoil shocks etc.  It is thus necessary to develop controllers that achieve rapid and precise tracking capabilities in presence of all these hard nonlinearities and unmodeled dynamics.  The proposed effort will be directed towards developing controllers and analyzing the possible improvements in performance that can be achieved for the gun turret system using the following three approaches: (a) Robust Adaptive Nonlinear Control (RANC), (b) Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) and (c) Nonlinear Robust Servo Control (NRSC).  The key advantages of these approaches are: RANC - using this approach one can directly and non-conservatively incorporate the qualitative knowledge of the structure of the nonlinearities (such as backlash) into the design, even without accurate knowledge of the model parameters; NMPC - in this framework it is possible to handle the known nonlinearities, constraints in states and inputs (e.g. saturation, limit on rate of variations etc.) and time variations of the system; NRSC - this approach provides a methodology' for control design to achieve accurate tracking in the presence or significant modeling uncertainty.  Specific Phase I tasks are: (1) Modeling of the system nonlinearities and the overall system dynamics, (2) Robust Adaptive Nonlinear Control. design, (3) Nonlinear Model Predictive Control design, (4) Nonlinear Robust Servo Control design, and (5) Testing and comparison of these three approaches on a simulated model of the gun turret system.  Prof. S. Sastry from UC Berkeley and Dr. S. Jain from Polytechnic University Brooklyn will serve as consultants on the project.  The commercial applications of this technology are enormous and exist in areas such as the production of optical instruments and devices. electronics industry, high precision machine tools, and other computer controlled machinery such as robotic manipulators.",

        "abstract": "Satellite trajectory control and optimization are complicated due to several factors:  nonlinear dynamics with time delays, modeling and parameter uncertainties; flexible modes due to fuel slosh and appendages; constraints on propulsive force and torque inputs; and constraints on acceptable angular rates and attitudes.  Existing control approaches based on LTI frequency domain methods trade simplicity and ease of analysis at the expense of performance and efficiency, which translates to increased fuel payload and power requirements.  Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimal control approach based directly on system models and on-line optimization to follow a desired trajectory, subject to control, safety and mission constraints.  Scientific Systems has successfully applied nonlinear MPC to simplified spacecraft attitude control problems.  The proposed Phase I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of using advanced Nonlinear MPC for satellite trajectory control/optimization, and quantify the advantages of using NMPC in terms of improved accuracy, reduced propellant usage, and overall mission success.  Satellite trajectory and attitude control problems will be formulated for missions of interest to the AFSPC, e.g. orbit insertion, precision pointing/slewing, orbit correction, raising or repositioning.  Algorithms will be developed and tested on problems using satellite and planetary models, simulation requirements and mission/task specifics supplied by AFSPC.

        "abstract": "Technological advances have altered the nature of air warfare.  In the past, air combat was frequently examined in the context of large scale air battles governed by attrition rates and quantity-quality trade-offs.  Modern air combat has changed with the introduction of technologies such as stealth, advanced avionics, high off-boresight missiles, and helmet displays.  Adequate exploration of combat maneuver possibilities requires some form of automated search and optimization process.  Off-line methods are needed to define and evaluate optimal combat tactics efficiently and systematically.  This, the area of tactics optimization is fertile for the application of genetic algorithms and machine learning approaches.  This Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of tactics and maneuver optimization using genetic algorithms (GAs) and machine learning.  This project team has developed pioneering state-of-the-art algorithms in the areas of differential game theory, Markov decision problems, machine learning), genetic algorithms and classifier systems, reinforcement learning, and min-max problems.  Specific Phase I tasks are:  1) Acquire or develop a simulation of one on one air combat engagement.  2)  Develop novel fighter combat maneuvers using genetic algorithms and machine learning.  3)  Test and evaluate new fighter combat maneuvers on advanced one on one air engagement scenario.  4)  Submit final report and Phase II recommendations Phase II will extend the air to air engagement to a M vs N model, specifically the MIL-AASPEM II model.  Tehcnical support will be provided by leading experts from the fields of GAs and classifier systems (Goldberg,Smith) and differential games (Basar).

In the absence of  moon and starlight, the primary radiance is from night glow in the 1-2 \u00c2\u00bfm band peaking at 1.6 \u00c2\u00bfm.  During this program, we will develop and deliver an InxGa1-xAs-based low-light level camera featuring a 1280x960 element InGaAs focal plane array (FPA) whose alloy composition provides optimum detectivity of 1-2 \u00c2\u00bfm night glow and low-noise camera electronics.  During Phase I, we will model the detectivity trade-off resulting from extending the wavelength band of  the InGaAs beyond the lattice-matched 1.7 \u00c2\u00bfm cutoff which will increase the night glow signal detected but will also increase the dark noise of the FPA.  We will use the Sensors Unlimited/Rockwell International buffered gate modulated CMOS multiplexer readout to provide 128x128 FPAS from both lattice-matched and extended wavelength InxGa1-xAs.  Low-noise support electronics will be developed to allow quantitative characterization of the FPAs.  The Phase I deliverable will include test results from both 128x128 FPAS in the 1-2 \u00c2\u00bfm band.

The large free spectral range (FSR) of vertical cavities implies that VCSELs can operate inherently in a stable single-mode.  Also, they can be easily fabricated to emit low-divergence circular beams.  In Phase I, we will deliver individual VCSELs operating in a single mode at 1.55\u00c2\u00bfm-wavelength.  This will include complete characterization of the device including operating wavelength, threshold current, output power, far-field pattern and thermal and current tuning of the lasers.  The dependence of laser threshold upon the nature of the Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR)  mirrors will also be studied.  In Phase II, we will complete the optimization of the device in terms of the lasing threshold and wall-plug efficiency.  We will also fabricate and deliver an 8x8 array of VCSELs.  Prof. S. R. Forrest (Princeton University) and R. J. Menna (David Sarnoff Research Center)will consult on this project.",

        "abstract": "Conventional shielding techniques for an electromagnetic pulse use high permeability magnetic materials. Such materials have limited effectiveness once they are saturated. A new approach for shielding has been identified using a layered film structure where the shielding actually increases after the magnetic film saturates.  These results are based on the use of a new computer code which predicts the attenuation in a multilayer, non-linear system. This allows modeling of the shielding effectiveness for the complex case of high conductivity and high permeability layers in which the high permeability film reaches saturation.  Using this computer code in combination with a multilayer film, it was found that it is possible to design a profile to increase the attenuation even at magnetic fields that saturate the magnetic layers. This is a surprising result and indicates the importance of such a code that treats nonlinear, multilayer media.  This Phase I program will model and demonstrate various layered structures with the object of producing and marketing a new profiled shielding material for high magnetic fields. As part of the Phase I program, a user-friendly version of the multilayer code will also be developed and marketed.  A lightweight material that shields in a high field environment can protect against an electromagnetic pulse/ In addition, a computer code is being developed which models non-linear electromagnetic attenuation and can be used for electromagnetic modeling.",

Conventional systems are achieving this progress by moving to network infrastructure models, distributed systems, and finer granularity that is object-oriented. Analogous architectures are needed for Knowledge-Based Systems so boundaries can be crossed and new knowledge-based modules can be added as a system evolves. Our goal is to develop an intelligent agent architecture for continuously evolving large-scale knowledge-based, as well as hybrid, systems. The objectives are to show the feasibility of the architecture by designing the agent constructs that are at the core of the concept. This will be accomplished by building on our fault-tolerant agent work with enhancements to address the large-scale knowledge base requirements.  Our proposed agent architecture is an enabling technological advance that can act as a catalyst for the evolution of large-scale knowledge-based systems and conventional and hybrid systems.

Feasibility assessment, based on simulations and studies described in this proposal includes evaluation of the design versus existing and planned burst communication links, determination of the effectiveness of coding and interleaving and synchronization, achievement of coherence of the first bit, and \"burst learning curves\" of BER versus time from burst-start.  Secondary objectives of the project include preparation of specifications for a modem to be designed and fabricated in Phase I, including an ASIC implementation of a RADD demodulator, and definition of a detailed implementation plan for Phase II and III.  As currently envisioned, the RADD demodulator will accommodate QPSK, 8PSK, and 16QAM, will support 155 Mbps data links, and achieve a 10 to the 10th bit-error-rate with a 7 dB SNR.

These communications will include 155 Mbps wireless links which will utilize ATM cell-based (burst) technology toward which the RADD modem is targeted.  For the tactical battlefield, it is vitally important to transmit and receive data with burst transmissions at high rates; the associated features of low-probability-of-detection and anti-jam operation are crucial for survival.

        "abstract": "Diffraction and non-ideal sampling severely limit the spatial resolution of an imaging seeker.  The diffraction limit is imposed by both the nominal wavelength and the physical size of the optics, typically limited by the submunition body diameter for a passive millimeter wave imaging seeker.  Non-ideal sampling is imposed by detector technology and sensor design trade-offs.  Focal-plane sampling often deviate from ideal sampling in two ways:  first the array elements do not usually acquire ideal point samples, but instead integrate the image intensity over a finite spatial region; and second, the sample spacing is often greater than that required for critical sampling, at the Nyquist frequency.We propose to develop a novel integrated two stage solution incorporating image reconstruction techniques coupled with microscanning to possible achieve as much as a 5X increase in resolution when compared to a conventional sensor without corresponding loss of field of view.  This is possible because microscanning allows us to build a single oversampled image having no loss in field of view and with reduced aliasing.  Typical super-resolution approach require oversampling in the image plane which in turn reduces the field of view by the amount of oversample.In this Phase I effort we are proposing to create a system level simulation, to develop microscanning algorithms, to look at system and algorithm trade-offs, and to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach using measured passive millimeter wave imagery (PMMW).",

        "abstract": "To obtain high quality or multi-spectral imagery from moving airborne platforms power- ful processing techniques are employed to remove the effects of aircraft forward velocity. A dynamically moveable imaging system which compensates for aircraft motion would greatly simplify these corrective requirements, and allow post processing systems to focus on target identification rather than \"cleaning up\" images.  Low light levels encountered in airborne reconnaissance missions typically require the use of an image intensifier which not only degrades image quality, but increases the mass of the camera system. This large mass makes it difficult or impossible to compensate for motion and platform vibration beyond a few 10's of hertz.  An imaging solution is needed which combines the high optical sensitivity needed for reconnaissance with the low mass needed to perform dynamic motion correction. SMD proposes to develop a motion compensated airborne imaging system for multispectral imaging applications.  The camera system utilizes a unique, high-gain CCD to achieve sensitivity over 1000 times higher than conventional CCD's, but without the need for a bulky image intensifier unit.  Since the new CCD sensor element is no larger than a postage stamp, dynamic correction for aircraft forward motion and vibration can easily be accomplished through electromechanical means.

Current high-speed cameras are based upon rotating prism/mirror assemblies which require a time delay for start-up and synchronization.  Because of the mechanical inertia involved, the camera must trigger the experiment (rather than the other way around), and only fixed interframe periods are possible.  Silicon Mountain Design proposes a completely solid-state alternative which allows for film quality imagery with asynchronous triggering capability.  A user selectable interframe period combined with asynchronous triggering and fast gating control allows for random access to temporal image data with nanosecond temporal resolution, and provides for stereo photogrammetry through the use of common, precision triggering of multiple cameras.Under this Phase I development , SMD proposes to build a proof of concept camera to demonstrate the variable interframe period on a lower resolution (256 X256) camera running at frame rates up to 10 million frames per second (MFPS).

Currently, both military and  commercial requirements for low-light-level applications are met with image  intensifiers coupled to charge-coupled devices (CCDs).  These systems do  not provide color images and suffer from degradation of contrast, resolution,  and signal-to-noise ratio.  Moreover, adding color to existing image  intensifiers would result in a bulky and expensive solution to the low light  imaging need.  SMD proposes development of a 3 chip color camera using a new type of  sensor based on operating a CCD in the Electron Bombarded CCD (EBCCD)  mode.  Three dichroic color filters would decompose the input image into red,  green, and blue components and direct the components to 3 EBCCD focal  plane array sensors.  The resulting imagery of an EBCCD is superior to that of  image intensifier tubes and would be compatible with existing commercial off  the shelf (COTS) video camera systems and software.  The EBCCD offers  high-contrast, low-light-level images.  This performance is achieved by  offering nearly noiseless gain (gain of greater than several thousand is  possible).

Because the actual processing literally occurs at the speed of light, the I/O interface creates a system bottle-neck which limits overall system throughput.  High frame rate spatial light modulators capable of independently modulating both phase and amplitude are key to addressing this problem.  SMD proposes the development of a pixelated Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) array, where each pixel independently modulates both phase and amplitude.

Bealll, Principal Investigator\nMr. Mark W. Bealll, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-97ER82476\nAmount:  $72,769\n\nTwo technologies are needed for the reliable simulation of physically and geometrically complex engineering and scientific problems.  Parallel computing is needed to effectively deal with the large problem sizes, while adaptive methods are required to ensure the reliability of the calculation. Current efforts to join these two technologies suffer because there are disparate views of the computational processes which make their integration difficult.  This project will combine a suite of geometry-based procedures with a new geometry-based, object-oriented, adaptive analysis framework to produce a product that can perform parallel adaptive finite element analysis in a real world environment.   The Phase I project will develop the procedures needed for the analysis framework to work in a parallel computing environment. An investigation of the efficiency of the parallel adaptive analysis framework in a variety of parallel environments will be carried out.  Emphasis will be placed on the application of the procedures on cost effective workstation networks.   The Phase II project will concentrate on extending the Phase I system to address more complex non-linear problems and on improving the performance and robustness of the code to make it a viable commercial product. This will include building one or more full scale demonstration analysis products using the framework to help attract Phase III funding.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The framework developed in this project would be used to build parallel, adaptive finite element analysis codes that run efficiently on machines ranging from single workstations, to clusters of workstations, to massively parallel supercomputers.  The immediate benefit would be that these codes would be commercially available to allow users to design engineered products that are more efficient and less expensive.  The object-oriented design of the framework allows new analysis capabilities to be quickly implemented and brought to market to help satisfy the ever growing need for simulation._",

The high turn-on voltage has been a major hurdle for the field emitter to be widely used in Flat Panel Display (FPD) market.

        "abstract": "Recruitment of leukocytes to injured tissue and their migration out of the vasculature is mediated in part by expression of cell adhesion molecules, including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (vCAM-1), on the surface of endothelial cells. Prolonged elevation of these substances is associated with a number of pathologies involving inflammation and may contribute to tissue damage through increased trafficking of leukocytes to the diseased tissue. This research aims to develop new therapeutic tools to control undesirable inflammation through down-regulation of VCAM-1. We plan to employ a novel variant of antisense therapy that directly blocks translation through an unusually strong sense-antisense interaction, allowing the targeting of coding regions of mRNAs, where existing antisense approaches are not generally effective, apparently due to disruption of the sense-antisense complex by translocating ribosomes. The new technique permits delivery of the antisense agent by a gene therapy approach as well as direct delivery of RNA using cationic lipid carriers. We will design antisense constructs targeted to regions of VCAM-1 mRNA that appear to be accessible in the cell based on published results, and deliver them using cationic lipids to HUVEC cells, assaying for their ability to down-regulate VCAM-1. If successful, this approach, which can be extended to any antisense target, is likely to increase both the effectiveness of antisense therapy in general and the number of sequences that can be targeted. The technique can also be adapted to antigene strategies. In this case, a triplex is formed in which the added third strand is tightly bound to the target duplex DNA.",

These techniques are grouped into methods for modeling trajectories by conversion to a mathematical programming problem, and methods for solving mathematical programming problems.  The first group includes parallel shooting, high-order collocation and differential inclusion.  Parallel shooting provides a general method of solving orbit transfer problems without path constraints whereas high-order collocation methods are very effective in solving problems with complex path constraints.  Differential inclusion may be used to reduce the total problem size, potentially increasing the speed and robustness of a solution process.  The second group includes sparse nonlinear programming, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms.  Sparse nonlinear programming may be used to very rapidly find a locally optimizing solution.  Simulated annealing and genetic algorithms may be used to find multiple regions where locally optimizing solutions exist, and are capable of solving problems with both discrete and continuous parameters.  These six techniques will be studied keeping in mind the particular characteristics of advanced space systems employing high performance, low-thrust propulsion systems and multiple launches aboard a single launch vehicle.",

This project is to develop a high speed and throughput DNA sequence that will significantly reduce technican labor.  It will be based on a laboratory-grade instrument that now requires a team of well-trained personnel with substained technical knowledge to operate.  The objective is to develop a user friendly instrument with the required features at an attractive cost.

A sample introduction method will be developed along with automatic control and data processing software.  Finally the complete system will be integrated.

Great interest has also recently been shown for sequencing the DNA of commercially significant plants and animals for improved crop quality and yield.  The use of 96 capillaries configured to directly interface with the 96-tube trays (almost universially employed by labs for DNA preparation) provides a practical economic advantage; this DNA sequencer is able to integrate directly with commercial front-end instrumentation._",

The module is designed to maximize the network throughput and minimize the chance for data loss.  The Phase I effort is focused on the design, development and testing of the module.

        "abstract": "New and improved low-cost flame monitoring systems are needed that can quickly and reliably detect a fast-spreading fire.  The most reliable fire monitors today are based on solar-blind UV detection systms with Geiger counter-type tubes that are costly, fragile, and require high voltage.  Spire has recently demonstrated feasibility of hydrogen flame monitors based on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) UV photodiodes.  In the SOI structure, active layer thickness is chosen so that UV is detected within the device, while longer wavelengths are absorbed in the electrically isolated substrate.  Spire proposes new and improved fire monitors based an low-cost filterless solar-blind UV photodiodes built on novel SiC-On-Insulator (SICOI) structure.  We will investigate detectors with superior UV selectivity based on SiCOI structures capable of operating at elevated temperatures (up to 500\u00c2\u00bfC) . Cubic SiC has a bandgap of about 2.2 eV, twice that of Si, which makes it ideal for absorbing UV photons while transmitting much of the visible wavelengths.  Spire recently demonstrated that crystalline Sic layers can be grown epitaxially by high temperature carbonization of ultrathin Si layers on Sol wafers to form SiCOI structures.  In Phase I, we plan to fabricate PN junction UV photodiodes on SiCOI substrates and compare their performance to similar devices fabricated on bulk Si, bulk SiC and SOI wafers.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the selective optical responsivity in the 200 to 400 nm wavelength range (critical for flame detection) as a function of temperature.  In Phase II, we will optimize device process parameters and prototype fire monitors integrated with an audible warning system will be tested and delivered.  Solar-blind UV detectors and image sensors have a wide range of military and commercial applications.  These devices could be used for detecting fires in munitions depots, aircraft engines and the UV signature from rocket plumes or residual cannon-bore fire.  Other applications of these photodiodes include, atomospheric ozone density measurements, flame monitoring of residential land industrial boilers and furnaces, and UV imaging and dosimetry in medical applications",

Based on this unified framework, the imaging algorithms will have consistent performance in  terms of  resolution  limit, sensitivity, and computational structures.

In microwave imaging, the key characteristics of the target is  distributed  not  only  in  the space-domain images, but also in the complex-wavefield signatures in  the  temporal-spectral  domain.   Because   the   generalized backward-propagation   techniques   decompose  the  wavefield  in space-time  domain  into   coherent   components   for   parallel processing,  the  spatial as well as temporal-spectral variations of  the  target  will  be  readily  available  during  the  image formation  process  and  can  be  utilized effectively for target recognition.",

        "abstract": "Increasingly, fiber optic links are being extended into the K-Band frequency  regime and beyond for communications and signal processing applications.  Higher operating frequencies put stringent demands upon the RC  time-constants of photodetectors and receiving electronics.  High bandwidth  demands very short RC time-constants and thus small active areas for the  photodetectors.  Unfortunately, such small photodetectors saturate at only one  or two milliwatts of received optical power, severely limiting the available  dynamic range.  Presently, it is relatively easy to provide optical carrier powers  in excess of 100 mW, but the wideband detectors that can benefit from this  power level do not exist.  High frequency analog modulation systems require  small modulation depths to avoid distortion and intermodulation products, also  putting severe constraints on the dynamic range.  This proposal addresses a technique for enhancing the dynamic range by as  much as 20 dB.  A tunable optical filter is used to suppress the carrier power to  lower the mean optical power at the photodetector without affecting the  sidebands.  A dynamic range greater than 40 dB is possible for system  bandwidths as large as 20 GHz.  This technique is applicable to both direct  analog intensity modulation of laser diodes and external analog modulation by  a Mach-Zehnder intensity modulator.",

The STP orbit transfer vehicle has requirements of multiple-burn operation adding to the complexity of the design.  A significant improvement in the simulation of a STP system can be achieved by the addition of a propellant storage and delivery system for use in propulsion tests at the Solar Laboratory .  Research in Phase I will allow design and test planning for propellant storage and delivery concepts for validation in the SOTV program.  Research includes development of a propellant system design matched to the requirements of a solar absorber.  Feasibility testing is planned to occur in Phase I with representative components.  An assessment of a propellant refrigeration cycle with no moving parts is also proposed.  This system, if feasible, could provide long term storage of propellant for a variety of extended missions.Proposed components in the technology will strengthen the capabilities for development and flight of an upperstage in the near future.

Although attractive and effective, these methods have resulted in leaky roofs, inefficient energy use, condensation, security and breakage risks, and other construction and lifestyle problems.   A novel solution to these problems is to integrate structural insulated panels with fiber optics to pipe the daylight deep inside the building.  In Phase I, the project will combine existing fiber optic transmission technologies with structural insulated panel manufacturing techniques. Additionally experiments will be conducted using passive light-concentrating technologies to verify that viable daylighting solutions can be achieved in buildings.  Phase II activities will include the production of full-scale panels containing fiber optic networks and testing of the integrated assemblies.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This integrated technology will enable the transmission of daylight deep into the interiors of residential and commercial buildings and will obviate the need for electricity-powered lighting during daylight hours.  If one-quarter of all new homes alone used this technology, the energy savings would equal 500 million kilowatt-hours per year, a significant energy impact.  \n_",

The primary goal of this research is to improve the predictability and increase the overall utility of FETAX as a screen for developmental toxicants that pose a hazard to human health.  Since Xenopus laevis embryos lack mixed-fliriction oxidase metabolism (cytochrome P-450) prior to 96 hours of development, the first specific aim is to explore the use of phenobarbital, b-naphthoflavone, and isoniazid-induced rat liver microsomes as an exogenous metabolic activation system.  This particular inducing system would supplant the presently used Aroclor 1254 system which has recently proven to be somewhat unreliable and needs to be replaced based on long-term considerations.  Post-isolation mixtures of these microsomes would represent a broader spectrum of P-450 isozymes, and thus, bioactivate/inactivate a wider range of compounds.  The second specific objective is to demonstrate the utility of FETAX as an alternative test for rapidly identifying developmental toxicants.  The FETAX test may be easily commercialized and used by most environmental and biomedical testing laboratories across the U.S.  Industries producing drugs and chemicals can quickly screen their products for developmental toxicity and save considerable arnounts of time and money once this test has been validated.  Use of FETAX will enable the U.S. Army to evaluate potential developmental toxicity hazards both in the field and work place in a rapid, cost-effective manner.",

These data are processed to estimate physical, chemical, biological parameters of interest.  Often these investigative records are processed more or less independently, even though one data type may be correlated with another.  This project focuses on a rapid method for joint inversion and imaging of geophysical and geotechnical data.  Drilling, fluid, core, seismic, and electromagnetic records will be incorporated.

The Joint Environmental Data Imaging and Inversion (JEDII) software technology is devised for joint, fully three-dimensional data analysis and interpretation.  During Phase I, the JEDII software technology will be breadboarded, a minimum of two differing types of geophysical or geotechnical signals will be jointly assimilated, and partners for Phase II, including Phase III customers, will be identified.  Phase II will expand on the number and types of signals that are jointly processed, will \u00c2\u00bfruggedize\u00c2\u00bf the software for commercial applications, and pursue demonstrations and potential customer sites to solidify financial support for Phase III.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Imaging and inversion play important roles in discovery, characterization, simulation, and performance evaluation for subsurface mineral, energy, and environmental remediation projects.

Engine seals, pumps, bearings, overhead components, and other contact surfaces are known to be problematic as temperatures are increased into the LHR range.  Improved tribomaterials will be selected for these components and incorporated into the engine system, to further improve engine performance and longevity.  Novel sensors will be developed, to directly determine the degree to which the liquid lubricant is contaminated by soot, dirt, wear particles and sludge precursors.  The new sensors will be arrayed with other available sensors that measure acid and viscosity increases, to achieve optimum total condition monitoring.  Advanced diesel engines will achieve large increases in fuel efficiency, durability, and trouble-free life, with targeted and lower levels of maintenance, by using the improved high-temperature lubricants and engine tribomaterials with real-time oil condition monitoring. Commercial heavy-duty truck diesel engines will benefit from these advances as much as military diesel engines, as will automobile engines.",

Under Phase I of an SBIR contract, we will investigate feasibility of an LWIR imaging spectrometer, explore its specific NDI applications, and develop a preliminary design for the instrument. Under Phase II, the instrument will be designed in detail and then built and tested.  Surface Optics Corporation has already developed a unique system based on a common processor unit and multiple imaging heads.  By virtue of its patents, it is the only byperspectral system capable of real-time acquisition combined with real-time spectral processing available on the market. VIS-NIR heads have been built, and a SWIR-MWIR head is under development for the U.S  Army ARDEC.  Under the proposed program, LWIR imaging spectroradiometry capability will be provided in a cost-effective manner to ARDEC by developing an LWIR head for the system already to be delivered under the in-place SWIR-MWIR contract.  The system has high commercialization potential, as demonstrated by a number of specific applications - both NDI and non-NDI - being explored by SOC and others.  BENEFITS:  Efficient spectral imaging, with real-time; processing and decision making, to solve numerous NDI problems, including surface contamination in manufacturing or repair processes, paint and coating quality control, variations in material composition and microstructure on a production line, and maintenance-depot inspection of low-observable surface treatments.  Non-NDI potential applications include remote sensing, geophysics, target discrimination, environmental monitoring, and land mine clearing.",

The study specifically addresses acoustically induced vibration in an airborne optical train.  Two approaches will be studied.  (1) The first approach is to inertially instrument each optical element, sensing the motion causing optical jitter.  The array of vibration measurements are used with a robust feedback control law and with an adaptive feed forward algorithm to precisely cancel the optical jitter.  (2) The second approach is to adapt an SVS active sound barrier concept to the airborne problem.  The active sound barrier uses a combination of feed back and adaptive feed forward control to attenuate the sound passing through the barrier.  For both approaches, robust control will be applied to the multiple input, multiple output feed back problem.  Also advanced techniques of multiple input, multiple output adaptive feed forward control will be evaluated. Performance improvements will be determined using acoustic simulation.  Cost for the various approaches will be developed. Based on the risk, cost, and performance benefits, a proof of concept experiment will be defined for the Phase II effort.",

This SBIR would address intelligent HMD display tailoring methodologies that would take advantage of the unfolding information flow within a modern MEP.  This intelligent decluttering approach would then continually provide the aircrew with most relevant and important information.  SYMVIONICS terms this approach as Information Leveling.  Information Leveling, as applied to the HMD, will enhance mission effectiveness and crew safety, minimize crew workload, and maximize situational awareness. For Phase I, a variety of mission analyses for a typical Army aviation mission will be performed.  Next, an information/action requirements analysis will be performed.  Next, an information/action requirements analysis will be accomplished, accounting for the type of HMD (and its symbology set) and the MEP for the selected rotocraft.

The proposed computer program will greatly reduce the time and effort required to setup a test.  With this tool various \"what if?\" scenarios can be efficiently simulated prior to actual testing.

An additional innovation that is introduced to reduce cost and complexity of the FOG configuration includes the implementation of a Glass Integrated Optics Circuit (GIOC) Module that integrates the traditional FOG discrete components (source, detector, Integrated Optics Circuit and coupler) into a single glass integrated circuit.  The GIOC will mount the source & detector and eliminate the need for a separate coupler.  It accesses the low cost and highly reliable technologies used in optical communication applications.  Electronic complexity is reduced by implementing a novel synthetic heterodyne signal processing architecture.

Transducer materials that are highly sensitive and can be operated under the harsh conditions typical of furnaces, boilers, distillation columns and food processing are especially desirable.  Early transition metal carbides and nitrides hold great promise for use in chemical sensors.  They are thermally stable at elevated temperatures, are chemically stable upon exposure to corrosive gases, adsorb a variety of gases, and have high electronic conductivities.  Furthermore, they can be made in the form of high surface area films.  During the Phase I effort, the feasibility of using vanadium carbide and nitride based transducers for the selective detection of saturated, unsaturated and/or oxygenated hydrocarbons will be demonstrated.  Changes in the transducer electrical resistivity caused by exposure to these analytes will be used to assess the sensitivity and selectivity.  Responses to thermal treatments during exposure to the analytes will establish the thermal and chemical stability limits.  Phase II will optimize the performance of the vanadium carbides and nitrides and extend the approach by developing microsensor arrays based on a variety of related materials.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This project would lead to the new class of transducer materials for quantitative on-line analysis of multicomponent streams under harsh conditions.  Process control and continuous emissions monitoring represent two broad areas of potential commercial application.

        "abstract": "A program for the investigation of a novel man-machine interface technology employed for reliable and robust decision processes is proposed. The proposed technology is based upon the inherent causal inference and knowledge synthesis properties of the fuzzy cognitive maps which provide a nonlinear feedback dynamical system for modeling a fuzzy causal knowledge process. Furthermore, a fuzzy cognitive map allows the synthesis of various different knowledge bases from different domain experts to generate a better and more robust knowledge representation. Based on the knowledge embedded in the predefined fuzzy cognitive maps, appropriate causal inference processes can be performed to enhance the decision making processes on various information fusion systems. Investigations are proposed on the following areas: (1) methods to map the received information data into the node states of a fuzzy cognitive map, (2) algorithms to transfer the knowledge of various domain experts to the node links of a fuzzy cognitive map, and (3) causal inference rules and evolution algorithms for data discrimination and status prediction.  With the results of these investigations, a prototype decision making software module will be created to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept of using fuzzy cognitive maps for reliable and robust decision processes.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this work is to develop novel high polar order, high chromophore density, thermally robust ferroelectric liquid crystalline polymers for electro-optic device applications.  The second-order nonlinear optical property of a polymer is a combination of three factors:  the number density, the molecular hyperpolarizability, and the polar order of the chromophore assembly.  Most of the previous effects concentrated on incorporating highly active chromophores into isotropic polymer matrix.  In this proposal, TACAN Corporation and its collaborator at the University of Dayton propose a different synthetic approach to optimize both number density and polar order of the chromophore assembly.  The proposed liquid crystalline polymer system will also incorporate crosslinking sites for materials hardening and high thermal stability.  A successful material development will result in an up to 5-fold enhancement of nonlinearity when compared with a poled isotropic polymer.  The highly active chromophores can be readily incorporated into the optimized polymer system for further enhancement.  Material synthesis schemes and characterization methods are presented in this Phase I feasibility study.  All the research results, during Phase I, will contribute directly to the scaled up synthesis, further material test, and electro-optic device fabrication in Phase II and future commercialization.",

The selected system components can obtain accurate point or field measurements of pressures and heat release rates in a combusting flowfield without disturbing the flow.  The proposed system consists of three major components:  sensor, system identification and controller, and actuator.  Micro-opto-mechanical pressure sensors and silicon carbide photodiode sensors can detect instantaneous chamber pressure and heat release even in the presence of droplets and soot particles in high-temperature environments.  The signals are then processed by a congtroller for engine health monitoring and system identification.  In addition to conventional fuel injectors, a novel hydrodynamic pulsing injector capable of producing high-frequency pulsing liquid sprays is proposed to generate secondary fuel injection and alleviate undesired unsteady motions.  The proposed system has high spatial resolution and rapid frequency response, and requires minimal pre- and post-calibration.  This approach to the detection and control of combustion dynamics is generic and can be applied to ramjets and scramjets, as well as other propulsion systems.",

The novel features of these sensors are that they physically move with the production substrates inside the deposition chamber, and that they use substrate materials identical to those used in production.  The data from these two sensors will be combined to give a measurement of the mechanical stress in the film as the film is being fabricated.  Since the relationship between film stress and processing conditions already is well-documented for magnetron sputter deposition, this stress measurement can be used as input for intelligent film deposition.  A preliminary wavelet-based denoising and feature extraction algorithm will be developed.

        "abstract": "The growing threat to Navy ships from low flyers, coupled with the increasing importance of brown watery, littoral, scenarios in Navy planning, heightens the need for high fidelity propagation modeling.  Such modeling is essential not only to the understanding of ship's sensors performance, but also for the assessment of threat behavior - e.g., RF missile seekers. Traditional propagation models used within the Navy community are valid only for a standard atmosphere, and homogeneous sea environment.  New propagation models, which account for terrain and non-standard propagation conditions are far more complex and computationally intensive. To overcome the throughput hurdle within the context of real-time sensor/environment simulations, TSC is proposing to extend an existing interpolative scheme.  It is supported by the off-line generation of mass stored propagation databases using existing high fidelity models.  During a simulation run, propagation is modeled via interpolation algorithms relative to a database segment loaded into random access memory during initialization. This approach can bring high fidelity propagation modeling, under any environmental condition, into the real-time simulation world.  It will also decouple the on-line simulation software from the propagation models specifics.",

This OM motor will implement MM computations in innovative, TSC developed, high-speed digital signal processing (DSP) hardware and software.  The measurement output in delayed only by the time required to process the raw data, which is a small fraction of a second, and is shorter than the data acquisition time.

(3) the opportunity to improve component, unit or system performance by enabling the user to observe, in real time. the impact of adjusting the operating parameters of a device or assembly.

        "abstract": "Currently deployed radar systems have limited capability to maintain tracks on targets in a dense target environment.  Dropped tracks and track switching difficulties often arise as a result of infrequent track updates, inadequate resolution, inaccurately extrapolated tracks and detection position errors that greatly exceed the distance between the target of interest and other vehicles in close proximity.  Terrain cover and road information automatically derived from coregistered SAR, however, has the potential to dramatically reduce these problems.  TSC proposes to implement and demonstrate techniques that exploit contextual information, automatically extracted from SAR imagery, to aid in tracking ground moving targets.  TSC will:  1) execute existing software to automatically classify SAR images, 2) develop and test road identification algorithms, 3) implement a contextual tracker, 4) refine the techniques, quantify their performance improvement and 5) demonstrate them in key situations of conflict.  TSC will leverage off existing SAR imagery, automatic terrain classification software developed for DARPA, SAR and MTI experience gained from numerous radar efforts, and extensive knowledge-based engineering and NCTI software and techniques.  Existing SAR, together with simulated MTI data as well as co-registered SAR/MTI data obtained from either Northrop Grumman Joint STARS or Hughes Aircraft Co., will be employed.  The contextual tracking algorithms to be developed on this effort have an immediate DoD application to time critical target tracking in several existing radar surveillance systems.  Commercial applications of the technology include both air- and ship-tracking by ground-, air-, and space-based sensors.  Applications of terrain classification and road identification algorithms include city planning, forest monitoring, and resource exploration.",

The proposed system will also provide a very efficient API to the application tool developers such that detailed knowledge of the VCE and the heterogeneous underlying hardware and software architectures is hidden from users. Thus, for any collaboration developer, the development of an application collaboration system can be as simple as developing a conventional non collaboration system. For example, the API should provide a collaborative synchronous message passing interface, which will provide an API to users in the same way as that of a conventional MPI, while the capability of collaboration will be incorporated automatically.

        "abstract": "Recent laboratory demonstrations have shown that time-domain persistent spectral holeburning memory can achieve record areal densities and density-bandwidth products. The same work has shown that many kilobits of data can be spectrally multiplexed within single spatial storage locations. These factors, taken together, open the door to an entirely new class of optical data storage, i.e., read/write Optical Random Access Memory (ORAM). ORAM is expected to provide 10-100 Gigabyte single-unit storage capacities, data transfer rates in the Gigabit/sec range, and achieve microsecond-scale random access latency through entirely non-mechanical operation. As the name implies, ORAM resembles semi-conductor memory in terms of its speed. However, ORAM resembles magnetic disk memory in terms of single-unit capacity. ORAM provides a unique joining of the attributes normally associated with semiconductor and magnetic disk storage, and, at the Gigabyte capacity levels of interest, ORAM should be at a distinct cost advantage relative to semiconductor RAM. ORAM offers the potential for development to speeds even beyond those afforded by semiconductor devices. Furthermore, the optical foundation of ORAM allows for the incorporation of holographic parallelism in later evolution of the technology.  This proposal is aimed at the development of high speed (Gigabit/sec serial transfer rates) 10-100 Gigabyte capacity Optical Random Access Memory devices. These devices will greatly enhance the computational capabilities in cases where simultaneous speed and capacity are required.",

The resulting combinatorial library will be assayed for specific antibodies.  The diversity of the library will also be determined using the polyrnerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme analysis.  The specific goal of the proposed Phase I effort will be to optimize the cloning protocols used to construct large libraries and to demonstrate our ability to analyze the diversity and screen these libraries.  During Phase I of the project, screening protocols, analysis of library diversity, and immunoassay protocols would be developed to support these goals.  The very large naive antibody library that we propose to create could be used in many laboratories to generate antibodies of any specificity without the need for immunization. Antibodies cloned from the very large naive antibody library could be used in a many defense and civilian medical applications.  Due to the high interest in antibody-based therapeutics and diagnostics rapid commercialization of this technology is extremely likely",

Tera Systems, Inc. proposes to bridge the design gap by developing a register-transfer-level (RTL) design and analysis system that will enable IC designers to automate structured-custom design.The current generation of top-down IC design tools were developed to solve issues of design complexity and functional verification without giving adequate consideration to physical implementation details.  With DSM processes, wire-parasitic delays rather than gate delays dominate, causing top-down design tools to create sub-optimal designs. Engineers must use manual techniques at the expense of productivity to get high performance silicon.  Our proposed system includes a new class of RTL analysis and optimization tools that will enhance existing top-down IC design systems by implementing a performance-driven design paradigm.  Our methodology will enable users to enter, analyze, debug, optimize, and implement their designs by working exclusively with RTL models.  Full-chip design, analysis, and optimization will run orders-of-magnitude faster than conventional gate-level tools, thereby enabling truly interactive design.",

        "abstract": "Superconducting light modulator is proposed which uses the physical properties of superconductors to greatly increase the transmission capacity of currently installed fiber optic lines Increased transmission capacity is required to make new services, such as video-on-demand, widely available at a reasonable cost The key inhibitor of fiber transmission capacity is the rate at which optical data can be modulated Current state of the art optical modulation techniques include direct modulation, electro-absorption modulation, and Mach-Zender modulation These modulation techniques are limited to transmission rates of 20 GHz Alternatively, a layer of superconducting material can be placed in the path of an optical beam and used to modulate light at THz speeds. Superconducting materials are non-transmitting in the superconducting state and partially transmitting in the non-superconducting state. Superconducting materials can be switched between these states at rates up to 1000 GHz using electrical current. A superconducting switch based on these principles has the potential for modulating light 50 times faster than the state of the art. The goal of the proposed work is to construct a simple device to demonstrate the feasibility of this superconducting modulator.  The proposed modulator increases the transmission capacity of currently installed fiber optic lines making high bandwidth services available without installing new optical fiber.

        "abstract": "Wide acceptance of spoken language interfaces with automated equipment is contingent upon its continued accurate performance in adverse noise environments.  Significant to the research is the ability to perform Natural Language Speech (NLS) recognition and synthesis in both a high and variable noise environment.  The noise environment may contain varying amounts of non-stationary, stationary and impulse components or even competing speech.  A practical small self-contained and portable module containing the necessary micro-processor and software plus standard connectors for speech enabling other automated computer systems wiil perform speech recognition and voice response in real-time.  The goal NLS module for high noise environments would also contain a display and acoustic man-machine interface for application flexibility.  The research of multiple noise abatement and speaker voice tracking technologies is implemented in the system together with state-of-the-art speech recognition, synthesis and natural language understanding.  The combination of these emerging technologies are expected to be very resistant to accuracy degradation caused by both continuous and impulse noises present in military armored vehicles and on factory floors, as well as in the presence of other voices.  An integrated micro-miniature system will be designed that is able to understand spoken statements, speak responses in dialog fashion, display all input and output on an internal display and exchange data with an external computer.

It is not cost effective to continually upgrade legacy equipment to meet the lastest shift in protocol standards, but the new standards are necessary if the DoD is to leverage new technology which is being developed by the telecom (and other) industries in a cost effective manner.  This problem can be addressed economically with an UDWDM network which provides a large number of separate optiical channels so that each protocol, and possible each piece of equipment, can have its own dedicated optical channel which provides a large electrical bandwidth that is free of constraints imposed by other protocols.  A novel narrowband filter configuration utilizing a fiber Bragg grating and a low cost all-fiber circulator being developed at Tetra Tech Data Systems will provide the UDWDM filtering.  Additionally, mixed signal buses will be enabled by isolating fragile analog signals from ditital signals with a combination of polarization and wavelength filtering (an extra 20 - 50 dB of isolation).",

        "abstract": "The goal of this program is to apply recent advancements in the growth of piezoelectric single  crystal materials to build ultrasound transducers with very broad bandwidth, which can improve  and simplify ultrasound imaging for combat casualty care.  Relaxor-based ferroelectric  materials of PZN-PT and PMN-PT have been shown to have coupling factors for some modes  of over 90%.  Transducer modeling shows that these properties can theoretically lead to  transducers with exceptionally wide bandwidth (over 120%).  The set of procedures which  would be useful for external imaging during triage in a combat casualty care would take up to  three transducers of standard construction ranging from 3.5 MHZ to 7.5 MHZ in center  frequency.  If a transducer with 120% bandwidth can be constructed, that single transducer can  perform all of those imaging functions.  Tetrad will work with TRS Ceramics and Crystal  Associates who are the leading U.S. manufacturers of high-coupling single crystal material.   In  Phase I, methods for surface preparation, grinding, metalizing for electrode attachment,  bonding of polymers, and processes for building 2-2 and 1-3 composite materials will be  investigated.  Samples of these materials will be used to build subapertures of medical  imaging arrays demonstrating broad bandwidth in the water tank.

        "abstract": "Flight deck maintenance crews frequently remove and replace aircraft access panels just  prior to takeoff.  Complete and rapid sealing of these panels is critical to corrosion prevention.   Fasteners are currently sealed with a two component formulation which is often incompletely cured at  takeoff.  During the flight, air flow pushes the uncured sealant away, and corrosion protection is  compromised.  Mixing the current sealant is slow and cumbersome, and the sealing operation is often  eliminated.  Typical one component sealants rely on the diffusion of moisture or air throughout the  sealant to achieve cure.  This makes it extremely difficult to formulate a one component sealant that  can cure rapidly in tight spaces.  Texas Research Institute Austin, Inc.

During the Phase I effort, a number of candidate heat activated  sealants will be formulated, tested, and compared with existing sealant military specifications.  Two  methods of heat activation will be evaluated and tested with the candidate sealants.

        "abstract": "An experimental development program is proposed to design, fabricate, and performance test a compact two stage centrifligal compressor.  The design is based on the extensive experience of the Principal Investigator and other team members with over 125 years of collective demonstrated turbomachinery knowledge.  Specifically, anention has been focused on the aerodynamic design that eliminates use of complex cross-over ducting with turning vanes and will feature high specific speed mixed-flow first-stage and a moderately low specific speed centriftigal second stage with efficient diffbsion.  Compactness will be achieved by reducing the diameter ratio, OD/Impeller Tip Diameter, while maintaining an equal level of performance.  The Phase I investigation will provide aerodynamic and mechanical designs together with preliminary layout drawings and a Phase II demonstration plan.  Cost estirnates will be obtained for components using the layout drawings in order to establish realistic assessment of the costs for the Phase II effort.  State-of-the-art, demonstrated codes will be used to assist in the design process together with the hands-on experience of the proposed team.  The proposed effort has the potential to improve performance of small turbomachinery such as auxiliary power units, main propulsion engines, and natural gas compressors for both military and commercial applications.  Platforms would consist of small aircraft, helicopters, UAV's, missiles, turbojets, turboprops, turbofans, and combinations thereof.",

Government agencies have been sponsoring independent signature code development programs for several years resulting in very specialized analysis tools.  This proposed effort will directly support the integration of the PRISM/MuSES, SPIRITS, and GTSIMS models with particular emphasis on a suitable exhaust plume model.  Phase I activities include tasks that will enhance the state-of-the-art in image based systems (lBS) radiation view factor codes.  Two specific applications of direct interest include an air-to-ground engagement simulation where PRISM/MUSES will be the primary ground vehicle target model (augmented by this new plume code for engine exhaust components) GTSIMS, particularly DISAMS, will provide the missile sensor-dynamics.  The second application is a ground-to-air engagement where SPIRITS is the primary target model that will be augmented with the plume code for rotary wing vehicles in which rotor downwash creates a full three-dimensional or \"bent\" plume.  GTSIMS (DISAMS) will again be the missile seeker model.  The primary functional interfaces for these designated common modules will be defined in Phase I.  The modification and integration of these military computer codes will make this technology accessible to the auto industry for solving their heat management problems.  PRISM/MuSES and SPIRITS in conjunction with GTSIMS will provide a simulation capability for measuring the performance of an automobile or aircraft collision avoidance system using passive infrared sensors.",

Marion, Business Official\nDOE Grant No.  DE-FG03-97ER82502\nAmount:  $74,997\n     \nImproved recovery of oil and gas from mature domestic fields depends on the detailed characterization of reservoir structure and continuity.  Crosswell seismic is a new technology that addresses this need by allowing the generation of reservoir images showing a level of detail at least ten times higher than what can be achieved with standard surface seismic methods.  Although the promise of crosswell seismic has already been demonstrated, full realization of its potential depends on the ability of the data processing methods and algorithms to handle the real-world complexities.  In particular, current crosswell data processing algorithms operate under the simplifying assumptions that the wells are vertical, or only slightly deviated, and that the geologic layers are nearly horizontal (not significantly dipping).  The objective of the work in this project is to overcome these restricting assumptions by extending to three dimensions the basic crosswell imaging algorithms (traveltime tomography and reflection imaging).  This will be achieved by generalizing the methods of tracing seismic rays from sources to receivers so that they work accurately and effectively, even for cases of significantly deviated wells and large \nstructural dips, and then by making modifications to the tomography and reflection imaging algorithms to take advantage of the improved ray tracing functionality.  In Phase I, the above approach will be implemented and tested for relatively simple geologic models (continuous horizons, no faulting, folding or pinchouts).  In Phase II, the algorithms will be further extended \nso that they remain valid for more complex geologic models, and the focus of the work will shift to the three-dimensional visualization of crosswell results and the use of a combination of deterministic and geostatistical techniques for building reservoir models based on large multi-profile data sets.\n     \nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The software that will be produced from this project will be of value to crosswell service contractors, as well as to geoscientists and engineers interpreting crosswell data.  More generally, the technology developed under this project will enable the successful introduction of high-resolution borehole seismics and specifically crosswell seismics to the gas and oil exploitation and exploration marketplace.\n_",

The majority of these fish are reared in areas where infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) virus is endemic.  Unfortunately, mortalities are highest before the fish are fully immunocompetent, making vaccination a less effective tool in disease prevention.  Increasing the natural resistance of trout through genetic selection is the only feasible method for increasing productivity in the commercial sector and increasing survivability for fish destined for the natural resource.  Many animal husbandry industries have been successful in breeding disease resistant strains.  Although only limited selected breeding for disease resistance in salmonids has been performed, evidence exists for the heritability of resistance to several disease agents, including IPN.\n\nThis proposal seeks to use quantitative genetics to select for a domesticated strain of rainbow trout with substantial resistance to IPN.  Phase I is designed to standardize a quantitative IPN challenge system and make a preliminary assessment of the variability of response to virus challenge between selected crosses of rainbow trout.\n\nPhase II will be aimed at conducting family selection for disease resistance.",

But when the vehicles are moving, they are distorted in the SAR imagery and thus cannot be recognized.  High resolution MTI radars can be used to obtain range profiles of moving ground vehicles for use in classification.  In similar fashion, it may be possible to obtain high-resolution profiles of moving ground vehicles which are illuminated by SAR radar, while at the same time, SAR imagery is generated.  This will allow for the ability to detect and classify both stationary and moving vehicles illuminated by the radar.  We propose to investigate the feasibility of using the illumination of moving ground vehicles by SAR radar for the propose of obtaining range profiles.  We have performed a systems analysis of this concept, showing a significant advantage for an architecture which assumes that radars can operate in this fashion.

This limits their use  for improving antenna isolation on airborne systems, such as towed decoys.  Fortunately, for antenna isolation problems, the angles of incidence are known.  A new absorber is proposed that uses this fact to full advantage.  It is proposed that a very thin layer of metallization, containing a pattern of small  resistively loaded elements, be added to an existing thin iron-loaded rubber  type of absorber.  The orientation and loading of the elements provide the  additional degree of freedom needed for better absorption of arbitrarily  polarized waves at near-grazing incidence.  The advantages of adding this layer are twofold.  First, since the absorption  takes place in a very thin layer instead of over a volume, it is inherently  lightweight.  And second, the orientation of the elements provide  directionality that can be optimized to capitalize on the fact that, for isolation  problems, the incidence angles are known.  The type of absorber proposed  is sufficiently pliable to be easily cut and wrapped to cover the surface of  cylinders and cones that form large portions of the outside surface on towed  decoys.",

The DEA process is a method of attaching a thermoplastic layer to a thermoset composite during the cure cycle.  Induction heating of the thermoplastic layer then enables thermoplastic fusion bonding of thermoset composite components.

In the Phase I program Triton will optimize the susceptor design and induction coil parameters for effective bonding.  The marriage of the two technologies will then be demostrated using a thermoplastic/thermoset system previously demonstrated with the DEA process.  The successful Phase I demonstration will lay the ground work for the Phase II program in which a thermoset matrix structure will be fabricated.  Successful development of the thermoset matrix induction bonding technologies will provide the Army with a method to make reliable low cost bonds between thermoset matrix composite component:; which are easily repairable in the field.

The synthesis and processing of PolyArylene Ether (PAE) materials will be the focus of this study because of their high optical transparency, glass transition temperatures in the 250-350C range, and Triton Systems expertise with these types of polymers.  The Phase I program will lead to a solvent free synthetic and processing method for a range of high temperature and optically transparent PAE compositions.  This process optimizes low operating cost and rapid cycle with high use temperature PAE materials.",

This technique will be further modified to increase the ion content of the sputtered flux hopefully improving the texturing.

One rapidly growing application requiring such powders is metal injection molding, a powder metallurgy process for forming near-net-shape components with higher dimensional accuracy than earlier processes. A significant need also exists for micrometer size soft magnetic alloy powders for use in low mass radar absorption coatings. In addition, the speed at which compacts are sintered in conventional powder metallurgy is increased as powder dimensions are reduced, and the sintering temperature is reduced, leading to faster, cheaper manufacturing of advanced materials. The finer microstructure which results can also improve the physical properties of parts made from finer powders. An innovative new approach to producing 1-10 um sized metal powders is proposed with the potential to dramatically decrease the cost of production. The process uses a repetitively pulsed high stagnation pressure gas jet to atomize a continuous melt stream. In Phase I, a Proof-of-Principle experiment will be performed making copper powder and an engineering design for a Phase II laboratory pre-production prototype will be made.",

To date, the precise and systematic characterization of centralized and distributed security policies, which is composed on independently specified policies, remains an elusive goal. Furthermore, a precise analysis of the relative advantages of different system architectures in the policy composition area has not been available to date; e.g., none of the commercially available microkernel-based operating systems implement security policies in a modular manner that would facilitate policy composition.

        "abstract": "The Army, and other military and civilian organizations, have a need for large shelters that are air-transportable and rapidly erected in austere conditions.  For example, the Army requires an Aviation Maintenance Shelter (AMS) having approximately 75 ft span.  Recent advances in high pressure inflatable structures use a braiding process to fabricate seamless airbeams and to make curved airbeams economically on straight mandrels.  Examples of this type of construction to date have been shown to be structurally efficient, robust and relatively economical.  Airbeams of up to 30 ft span have been successfully demonstrated and a beam of 60 ft span is currently under development.  The object of this research is to extend current techniques and designs to wider span structures.  The proposed research includes investigations in six key areas of shelter loads, airbeam design, and shelter system elements.  The scope of the research is bounded by applying the requirements published for the Army's Aviation Maintenance Shelter (AMS) as a baseline.  The results are brought together in a design for an AMS structural module and the construction of a reduced-scale structural module to demonstrate the design and its characteristics.  Wide span shelters have a number of military and civilian uses. These include vehicle and aircraft maintenance, disaster relief material storage, and personnel environmental shelter.  This technology is needed for aircraft evacuation slides for tall aircraft, and could also be used for temporary bridges.",

Specifically, we will address the potential of combining the polarimetric aspects of the foliage penetrating (FOPEN) SARs with interferometric technology.  Expected benefits will be improved ATR algorithms and new techniques for mapping terrain under trees, as well as potentially measuring some parameters related to tree height and density.  Sensors capable of producing such data are expected to become operational in the near future for both military and civilian applications.  While there has been a considerable amount of research conducted in the area of ATR using SAR data, most has focused on the application to more traditional military radar systems, specifically higher frequency systems.  Some research into polarimetric aspects of the data have been carried out, as well as investigations into UWB ATR applications.  To exploit the new dimensions of this data, we impose important calibration requirements on the sensor data.  Specifically, we will investigate the use of calibrated phase and amplitude information available in the polarimetric scattering matrix measurements.  This is required to perform accurate polarization synthesis.  Throughout this work, we will focus on the eventual operational implementation of the identified new algorithms.  Specific real-time applications to UWB sensors will serve as examples.",

Orders of magnitude in performance are expected.  PSP is now becoming feasible due to the rapidly increasing computational power and decreasing price of modern digital technology.  The PSP adaptive algorithms will be developed and simulated to verify these performance gains in dense urban environments with mobile users, multipath and co-channel interference.  Both the CDMA and TDMA digital cellular standards will be addressed.  Comparisons will be made to conventional adaptive array approaches as well as cellular performance without adaptive antenna processing.  A high level design will then be derived to validate the tractability of the approach as well as provide size, power, and cost estimates.",

        "abstract": "In many applications signal acquisition and data decoding must be carried out in the presence of unknown, possibly time-varying channel parameters.  When the Signal-to-Noise Ration (SNR) is medium or rapidly varying, ad hoc, methods for acquisition and data decoding do not perform well and there is a need for more sophisticated solutions.  PSP allows unaided estimation of the channel where the channel is unknown due to geometry, doppler, interference/jamming or noise.  In essence a multitude of estimates are tracked via a Viterbi trellis type algorithm to determine the optimum channel estimate in conjunction with the optimum communications decision.  This, in turn, can provide substantial gains over ad hoc methods in the performance of communication systems.  We propose to:  1) look in greater depth at PSP application to real world blind channel estimation problems, 2) size implementation of PSP and assess it's tractability today, and 3) extend the PSP theory in new areas as required.  Areas to be investigated include co-channel interference mitigation, antijam enhancements, improved acquisition and tracking, and increased data rates in time varying bandlimited channels.

TITLE   RAPID IDENTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS BACTERIA ABSTRACT: DESCRIPTION: (adapted from investigator's abstract) The problem of rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria in the environment remains unsolved. The CDC estimates that each year 4,000 Americans die, and millions become sick, from poultry and meat tainted by bacteria, such as E.  coli or Salmonella.  Recent E.  coli outbreaks in Japan, and at Jack-in-the-Box restaurants, show that lives could be saved if rapid identification was possible, in order to: (1) eliminate the pathogen source, and (2) take appropriate medical countermeasures. Recently, the Army's ERDEC published that MALDI-TOF-MS of either proteinaceous extracts, or of entire cells, has a high potential for specific identification of bacteria feared as biowarfare agents.  Genus-, species-, and strain- specific protein biomarkers in the MALDI-TOF spectra were reported for Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, and Brucella melitensis.  MALDI-TOF-MS measurements per se take less than 1 minute. Thus, bacteria identification can be fast provided the sample preparation protocol is rapid. ProteiGene, Inc.  will research MALDI-TOF-MS for rapid protein biomarker identification of pathogenic bacteria - in Phase I particularly E.  coli. ProteiGene will determine the optimal sample preparation and measurement conditions for obtaining reliable biomarker identification, and determine a pattern of MALDI-TOF-MS peaks which uniquely identify E.  coli, and distinguish it from other bacterial species.",

Several sophistcated software tools are avialable for three dimensional modeling and dynamic visual and numeric anaylsis of complex surfaces.  This proposal presents a practical and logical approach to utilizing state-of-the-art tools and techniques for accurate facial modeling and simulation.  The same methodology used to model the human face will be applied to develop and dynamis model of the M40 mask based on existing physical data.  The M40 model will be integrated with the face model.  Dynamic facial controls based on collected data for various facial expressions will be used to manipulate the three-dimensional facial model so that the response and fit of the M40 mask can be studied in both a static and dynamic sense.  The interrelationship between the mask model and the face model will be evaluated both graphically and numerically.  The designer will be able to observe and monitor the degree of contact at the seal between the mask and the face.  The results of this work will clearly demonstrate the ability of the model to be used to study the interrelationship between protective masks and the human face.",

Achieving noise robustness is amust before ASR is widely deployed by the Air Force or becomes accepted in the consumer electronics market.Current approaches to noise-robustness rechniques modify traditional front ends and back ends, such as cepstra and hidden Markov models (HMMs).  Only incremental improvements in performance have been obtained.We will adapt two recent inventions for use with ASR.  The first is a front end (preprocessor):  the Stabilized AuditoryImage (SAI) is a state-of-the-art model of the human auditory system that faithfully replicates human perception in many cases where traditional spectral models fail.  It will be used as a basis for more robust feature extraction.  The seecond is a back end (recognizer):  the method of manifold linearization has been applied to handwritten character recognition (HCR), outperforming other methods while keeping the computational load low.  A number of similarities between HCR and ASR make this approach very promising for use in ASR.The processors we develop will be evaluated by comparison with traditional implementations (in-house simulations), as well as to state-of-the-art systems described in the literature.",

        "abstract": "A quasi-optical phased array architecture is widely regarded as the most promising candidate for electronically scanning antennas. The key components of phased arrays are tunable phase-shifters or true time delay elements. One antenna may contain dozens to thousands of these elements which are very expensive and make a typical phased array unaffordable for most applications. In addition, at MMW frequencies those components still present a challenging technical problem.  A different approach has been developed by WaveBand Corporation. The approach is based on using a reconfigurable plasma grating excited in a semiconductor. MMW radiation passing through the grating experiences diffraction. By patterning the grating one can send the MMW beam in a desired direction. In this approach the antenna does not contain tunable phase-shifting or time delay elements and is thus dramatically less expensive than phased arrays.  In our previously designed antennas plasma was generated by photo-injection. We propose a new design where plasma is excited by current injection. The main advantage of this new antenna is its compatibility with MMIC technology that will result in a significant cost reduction. The Phase I goal is to demonstrate the operation of a laboratory prototype of the new MMW scanning antenna.  Anticipated benefits of the proposed project lie in the dramatic cost reduction of scanning antennas. Commercial applications include MMW imaging radar, aircraft landing systems, and anti-collision systems for the huge auto market.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this effort is to develop high efficiency optical switching systems based on free space switchable gratings. The use of switched gratings as an enabling technology to arbitrarily steer RF modulated optical carriers from 1 to any of N channels or alternatively from among N input to N output channels has several distinct advantages over other photonic switching systems including: 1) low insertion loss; 2) uniform delay for all routes; 3) miniature micro optic packaging; 4) low crosstalk; 5) reduced complexity; and 6) suitability for rugged monolithic packaging. Further, these systems are scalable for large N. Low insertion loss is obtained utilizing high efficiency switchable diffractive elements to effectively steer each input optical carrier to the desired output channel, with switching times in the microsecond regime. The inherent switch purity of the diffractive elements can be augmented with inclusion of a nonlinear noise suppressor. These diffractive switches also have the potential to be low cost systems. The Phase I effort will result in a feasibility demonstration based on modeling and on a 2 x 2 experimental optical switch testbed. The follow-on Phase II effort will produce a larger dimension switch that is miniaturized and monolithically packaged with minimized losses and crosstalk.",

Both macro-optical and micro-optical techniques are investigated.  Emphasis is placed on ruggedness and relaxing the alignment tolerances required in the physical implementations.

These resources will be made available on the World Wide Web under the name \"Sleep Home Pages.\" The Sleep Home Pages will constitute what is called a Web Storefront or Mall that will provide \"one- stop shopping\" for all sleep and sleep-related information. Included within the Sleep Home Pages will be Discussion Forums, a Placement Service, a Calendar of Events, Reviews of Current Literature, etc.  All major Sleep Societies in every part of the world will have their own \"Section\" as will sleep support groups, such as the National Sleep Foundation.  Individuals will be able to register for meetings and submit their abstracts via the Sleep Home Page; they will also be able to view abstracts prior to the meeting.  Updated bibliographic data will be made available each week, and specialized search engines will be developed for retrospective literature retrieval.  Individual laboratories and clinics will also be able to present information about their activities, publications, personnel, etc., as part of the Sleep Home Pages.  \"Sections\" of the Sleep Home Page will be linked to each other and to sleep-related information on other computers throughout the world.  Thus, the Sleep Home Page will be a single source gateway on the World Wide Web for the field of sleep. A determination will be made of the \"feasibility\" of presenting the Sleep Home Pages on the World Wide Web, and an evaluation of their \"technical merit\" and the quality of performance will be performed.  The successful completion of Phase I will be the basis for a Phase II SBIR application in which the Sleep Home Pages will be evaluated and developed vis-a-vis their ability to generate income sufficient to sustain their commercial independence.  In the future, the applicant hopes that the prototype of a scientific Web Storefront that is being developed for the sleep field can be used for other scientific fields.  For example, WebSciences already has presented a substantial site for the Society for Light Treatment and Biological Rhythms.  WebScience has also received a request from the International Bureau for Epilepsy and the International League Against Epilepsy to submit a comprehensive proposal for the field of epilepsy that would mirror that described in this proposal for the Sleep Home Pages.  Thus, the applicant hopes that the successes of the Sleep Home Pages will lead to the generation of similar projects and services in other scientific fields.",

        "abstract": "Currently, the measurement of environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, shock and vibration are used to monitor the integrity of stored missile and associated electronic support equipment.  Unfortunately, it is generally a complex combination of these environmental parameters, accumulated over an extended period of time, that leads to deterioration in the performance of equipment.  We propose a missile health monitoring system (which in addition to measuring temperature, humidity and shock) uses \"early warning\" modules (independent of the missile) to assess the degradation in performance of key missile components due to the combined affects of environmental exposure.  This system will utilize an ultra-low-power, military-qualified, munitions-safe transceiver system to transmit data and receive commands.  This communications unit will be capable of supporting interrogation and alarm modes of operation with the health monitoring system.  Results from the accelerated testing of an \"early warning optics module\" are presented to demonstrate feasibility of the concept.  Commercial applications include early indication of failure in critical medical and electrical systems such as heart pacemakers and electric power generation systems.  Additionally, the system may be used to remotely monitor the health of infrastructure such as pipelines, bridges, tunnels and nuclear reactors that may be damaged by natural disasters.",

        "abstract": "Strait pointing accuracy for the antenna and reflector of spacecraft requires structural materials with excellent stiffness and dimensional stability. Carbon-carbon (C/C) composites are prime materials for space applications because of their unique properties. Current C/C processing techniques are very expensive and time consuming. This Phase I research proposes a new class, low-cost graphitic microcellular C/C composites. The graphitic microcellular foams and microcellular C/C composites will be processed from mesophase pitch using the principle of thermodynamic instability. The blowing process will align the graphitic planes along the struts of the foamed matrix so that they are similar to graphite fibers. The micron to sub-micron bubbles will form a strong network between graphite fibers and foamed graphite matrix. Excellent specific stiffness and specific strength (higher than the conventional C/C), near zero therm; l expansion coefficients, no out-gassing make this class of microcellular C/C composites ideal for space structure applications. Samples with unidirectional fibers or woven fabrics as reinforcements will be processed; mechanical tests and SEM analyses will be performed to evaluate the material properties and morphology of the samples. The proposed processing technique could reduce the cost of C/C structures over 70%.  The proposed low-cost microcellular C/C composites will have many potential commercial applications include satellite structures, propulsion system structures and leading edges of commercial supersonic aircraft, truck brake, high speed train brake, piston, battery electrode, printed wiring board and electronic packaging for thermoplanes, multi-layer PWBS, multichip modules, chip carriers and chip on board.",

The antenna system will be based on the optical commutator, a device that is capable of switching fiber optic delay lines in an ordered sequence, to provide exact timing necessary to steer antenna arrays in two dimensions.  The phase shifters and corporate feed structures, commonly found in phased arrays, can be eliminated thereby saving considerable cost and weight  During phase I, detailed Army requirements for an antenna system will be determined and a specification established.  An optically controlled transmitting and receiving antenna array system will be designed to meet those specifications using as many commercially available electrical and optical components as possible.  Computer simulation will be employed to predict the antenna beam performance  The goal is to design an easily manufactured and inexpensive system.  The final system design will be capable of precise steering and able to form narrow beams at frequencies above 18 GHz.  This work will provide the necessary design details to allow a prototype transmitting and receiving system to be constructed and demonstrated during phase II.  Witb a very simple means of steering antenna arrays resulting from this development, a highly cost-effective situation will be created.  All military and civilian radar and communication systems which employ electronically steerable antenna arrays will become much more affordable.

Nelson, Principal Investigator\nDr. William K. Warburton, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG03-97ER82510\nAmount:  $75,000\n\nArrays of germanium detectors are used in nuclear physics experiments, at DOE supported facilities such as the GAMMASPHERE, to observe excited nuclear states that decay by emitting multiple gamma rays.  These experiments currently reject so-called \"Compton scatter\" events, in which a gamma ray is not completely absorbed in one detector.  An experiment called Gamma Ray Energy Tracking Array (GRETA) is being proposed that will use energy and position measurements within multiple detectors to reconstruct Compton scatter events, thereby increasing the efficiency for observing complex decays by as much as 1,000 times.  However GRETA will require significantly more sophisticated pulse measurement electronics and computation than is currently employed. The Phase I of this project will develop a digital signal processing unit capable of measuring both energy and position of gamma rays in a detector array by analyzing the pulse shapes.  In Phase II the end product will be a computer-controlled unit in the VXI instrument standard, which handles 12 or more detector channels. \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The first commercial application will be a unit for use in germanium detector array experiments.  With only modest algorithm changes, this application can be extended to making pulse-shape corrections in arrays of mercuric iodide or cadmium zinc telluride room-temperature gamma-ray detectors, such as are used in nuclear inspection and nonproliferation detection work.  Single channels of the instrument would make an excellent low-cost gamma-ray spectrometer, particularly for portable applications._",

Cote, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-97ER82511\nAmount:  $75,000\n\n\nGlobal climate, local weather, and human economic activity all depend on the balance of energy gained from the sun and lost to space.  Because minute changes in this balance could cause dramatic shifts in climate, it is crucial to measure these radiation budgets accurately.  Currently available atmospheric radiation instrumentation has limited stability and accuracy that prevent routine measurements having uncertainties of less than about +5 percent.  This project seeks to develop a new approach to radiation measurement in which the energy received by the sensor surface is actively removed and measured in order to maintain the surface at a constant temperature instead of allowing the surface to heat up as in current instruments.  The isothermal detector thus eliminates inaccuracies due to temperature differences and can potentially reduce uncertainties in routine field measurements by an order of magnitude beyond the current state of the art.  Phase I work will demonstrate the validity of the isothermal detector concept and build a prototype having demonstrably improved performance.  A mathematical model of the detector will be developed to predict performance and guide the design of a prototype.  Results from the prototype will validate the modeling and give valuable experience with the technology.  In Phase II any shortcomings of the prototype will be identified and corrected with the goal of producing a modest number of improved prototypes for beta testing and subsequent commercialization.  A significant part of the effort will center on an improved calibration methodology.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new radiation detector, if successfully developed, represents a significant improvement in the performance of commercial radiometric instrumentation such as pyranometers and pyrheliometers.  It should be valuable to scientific climate studies such as the Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program and NASA's Mission to Planet Earth.  It would therefore have a significant commercial potential in the scientific instrumentation marketplace._",

CO2 has been known to pass into the atmosphere polluting the environment, but it has also been linked with ocean pollution as the ocean acts as a massive CO2 sink.  The single most important factor in further understanding the role of oceans in the control of global warming is the capacity to make direct, in-situ measurements of CO2.  No unattended, in-situ method of CO2 measurement suitable for marine applications exists.  This project is to develop a CO2 sensor for the long term monitoring of CO2 in ocean waters, based on a fluorescent fiber optic sensing system.  In the Phase I research program, we will concentrate on the sensor chemistry and the mechanical design of the sensor for the fluorescent fiber optic sensing system of CO2, as well as the optical and electronic systems associated with the sensor.  This includes selection of the appropriate fluorescent dye molecule in the optimum buffer system and the appropriate membrane material to achieve the necessary sensitivity.

Furthermore, this would provide a good business opportunity, potentially up to $26 million annually.

If successful, the novel approach proposed here can be applied to a variety of commercial instructional applications. $ = TOTAL AWARD AMTS & NOT LIMITED TO PORTION OF PROJECT RELATED TO SUBJECT OF SEARCH SUBPROJECT $ = TOTAL AWARD AMOUNT DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF SUBPROJECTS SOURCE:  CRISP  FORMAT F    FY 97      LAST UPDATE 04-07-98 1QUERY 1536                        ID SEARCH 06/01/98   PAGE    423 --PROJECT NUMBER......1 R43 HL57738-01                 INVESTIGATOR NAME/ADDRESS FY  97    DOERR, RONALD J IRG/INTRAMURAL UNIT..ZRG7                             DATA SPECTRUM CORP AWARD AMOUNT.........    $99,500                      437 DIMMOCKS MILL RD HILLSBOROUGH, NC 27278 PERFORMING ORGANIZATION: DATA SPECTRUM CORPORATION TITLE   DYNAMIC CARDIAC VENTRICULAR PHANTOM FOR MEDICAL IMAGING ABSTRACT: Three million myocardial infarctions are recorded annually in the United States, with an accompanying mortality rate of approximately 15%. The annual medical costs for screening of patients at risk for cardiac diseases using nuclear medicine imaging are estimated at greater than $500,000,000. A reduction in mortality is expected with improved diagnostic imaging procedures.  However, it is difficult to develop and evaluate improved cardiac imaging protocols without a realistic beating heart phantom.  The long term goal of this project is the development and marketing of a Dynamic Cardiac Ventricular Phantom (DCVP) system for use in clinical protocol evaluation, quality assurance and training. Phase I specific aims are to: (l) determine the average three-dimensional configuration of the beating myocardial ventricles, (2) incorporate this information into the preliminary design of a DCVP and design a test fixture system using computer aided design, (3) construct the test fixture system, and (4) evaluate and determine materials and system components suitable for use in the DCVP. The phantom will be designed primarily for nuclear cardiac imaging using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), but could be adapted for other cardiovascular imaging technologies such as ultrasound, magnetic resonance, and computed tomography.",

        "abstract": "There are many military, commercial, and medical applications for a small, rugged, and inexpensive infrared (IR) spectrometer. A Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer would be an ideal tool for such measurements; however, FT-IR spectrometers are very sensitive to vibration and subject to misalignment from mechanically or thermally induced forces. To help overcome these barriers, BMDO provided Phase I and Phase II SBIR support to Advanced Fuel Research, Inc. (AFR), between 1992 and 1994 which resulted in a very rugged, fast, and compact FT-IR spectrometer. While there are a significant number of commercial and military applications for a spectrometer with these specifications, (sales of several thousand units/year), a market in the 100 thousand to million units per year could evolve if the price, weight, and power consumption could be reduced by a factor of 10. This is the objective of the proposed project. The overall objective of this project is to design a 0.5 wavenumber resolution, multi-function FT-IR instrument with a spectral range of 1.5 to 25 1lm, a total weight of 10 to 15 Ibs. (including the electronics and computer), a total price of under $3,000 and a power consumption of 30 watts for commercial and DoD applications. The objectives of Phase I are to demonstrate the improvements in key components, determine the specifications, and design a prototype to be fabricated in Phase II. Phase I, to be performed in four tasks, will explore three technology changes to the present design which can save weight, cost, and power consumption. By appropriately modifying and incorporating the innovations into a new design, a low weight, low cost, low volume, low power consumption, multi-function FT-IR instrument can be developed.  Applications for portable light weight, low power consumption, and low cost systems include: i) sensors for detecting chemical hazards at fires or other disasters; ii) analysis of human respiration in rescue situations; iii) ambient air or work place ambient monitoring; iv) auto exhaust sensors, v) smoke stack monitors, vi) illegal drug detection, vii) battlefield hazard monitors, viii) military target identification, ix) rocket launch monitor, x) blood analysis, and m",

        "abstract": "Improved clutter suppression in Infrared Surveillance Sensors is acheived by reprocessing the data fields in the vicinity of detected Targets to distinquish between true Target responses and leak through Clutter responses that arise from clutter \"Microgradients\" hidden well below the primary clutter flucuations. The clutter \"Microgradients\" may exhibit rapid spatial changes in gradient properties; determined by processing the data values in a small radius Annulus centered on each detected Target position. The proposed Phase 1 program compares alternative algorithms for effectiveness of clutter suppression and complexity of implementation. The proposed \"Annulus Clutter Filter\" operates on local data fields and is largely independent of the global Wiener spectrum of the clutter. Amplitude distributions of the clutter errors are expected to be non-gaussian,so a new definition of Signal-to Noise Ratio (SNR|,and related \"Process Gain', is advocated.  Infrared sensors used in Military and Commercial applications will be less affected by background clutter, thereby giving improved Target detection and improved Target measurements accuracy.",

This is especially true of USAF which is trying to keep operational several time-tested airplanes.  The DoD Automated Data Conversion System (ADCS) project addresses this issue.  A key objective of this project has been the conversion of vectorized CAD drawings to feature based CAD models so that they can then be used to automatically generate NC machine code - in other words, help with automated manufacturing.  Our proposal directly addresses this conversion.  We have a unique approach in that we perform feature extraction in the 2D domain.  Feature extraction is a crucial aspect of the conversion process and there has been little success within this is attempted directly in the 3D domain.  Having performed many experiments with our approach we are confident in proposing our architecture called FlexiCAD to solve the conversion problem.  Our Phase I proposal will complete an architectual validation study that will prove that when implemented it will a) semiautomatically correct errors in the vectorized data and b) automatically convert vectorized drawings to feature based output in a format that the Air Logistics Centers can use for automated production of spares.",

Phase I of the VR BMC3 Net Tool Project will consist of four major activities -C3 Network Analysis,  Communication Model Selection, Virtual Reality Prototype Development, and Feasibility Report Generation. The VR BMC3 Net Tool has several anticipated benefits and commercial applications.  The strongest benefit is an improved C3 net analysis capability for the commander in the field, whether a simulated battle field or a real battle field.

The Archive - entitled Archive of Effective Drug Abuse Prevention Programs for Youth - will build on the Program Archive on Sexuality, Health, & Adolescence (PASHA), a highly successful collection of Effective teen pregnancy and teen STD/HIV/AIDS prevention programs. Each program package in the proposed Archive will include everything needed to replicate and re-evaluate the promising program: (1) a complete set of program materials such as Instructor's Manual, workbook, video, etc.; (2) an accompanying evaluation packet for reassessing the effectiveness of the program in a new site; and (3) a User's Guide and multimedia CD-ROM prepared by Archive staff describing the program/evaluation package and providing program implementation guidelines and tips. The investigators will also develop a compendium in book format that describes each archived program package evaluates the state of the field, and explains how to select from the Archive an appropriate program package for review, adaptation, and implementation. In addition, Archive staff will provide purchasers of included programs with free and ongoing technical assistance on program implementation and evaluation. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Drug use, especially among Youth, has plagued this country for decades. Many Drug Abuse prevention programs, with a variety of approaches and assumptions, have been developed and implemented. The products to be created by the proposed project will facilitate cost-effective replication of programs that have the potential of reducing use of tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs, prevent wasted effort spent \"reinventing the wheel\"; and encourage ongoing scientific evaluation of programs to ascertain the robustness of each program's effectiveness (or lack thereof) across different study populations. National, indeed global, concern with the problems addressed by the products to be created suggests a widespread demand for these products. ",

        "abstract": "We propose to characterize the early stage of consolidation of non-spherical powders to further the development of process models to enable simulation of powder metallurgy manufacturing for the consumer market, especially the automotive industry. Typically, spherical powders with a narrow size distribution are used for aerospace applications, while low-cost powders with irregular shapes and a wide powder size distribution are used for the consumer market. Ashby and colleagues have developed models for powder consolidation which rely on an assumed ideal packing of spherical monosized particles, with a uniform initial relative density around 0.64. For low-cost, irregular shape powders, the initial relative density is low (typically around 0.40) and varies within a component. It is the ultimate objective to expand the applicability of existing consolidation models which have proved extremely useful for net shape forming in the aerospace industry. The objectives of Phase 1 are (1) full characterization of die filling operation and identification of potential improvements; and (2) characterization of powder compaction/rearrangement for non-spherical particles and identification of critical parameters for use as model inputs. The results can be used to develop a complete set of experimentally validated models to simulate compaction of non-spherical powders.",

Automation of the design process would allow the maximum input sampling bandwidth for a given channel tramission bandwigdth, allow faster design turnaround, and reduce the dependency on experts for the evaluating automated frame generation algorithms and investigate one or more prototype frame generation algorithms.

This miniaturized state-of-the-art system integrates current battery technology, proven sensors, a powerful processing capability, variable gain amplifiers, programmable filters and analog-to-digital converters to capture and store six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) motion of the seat in non-volatile solid-state memory.  The proposed architecture not only provides a user friendly system that can be configured for installation on a wide variety of seat designs but can be easily enhanced by re-programming.",

        "abstract": "One of the most serious obstacles to the practical implementation of biosensor technology for BW and CW detection onto UAV 5 and other remote deployment applications is the need for miniaturization of the sensor systems.  To meet this need, Systems & Processes Engineering Corporation (SPEC) proposes to develop a miniaturized biosensor system which is essentially reagentless.  The proposed system will use a novel fluorescence quenching strategy with no antibody separation steps or sophisticated multiple-fluid injection steps.  The proposed system will be implemented into a MEM package which will include a telemetry system for remote deployment applications.  The MEM package will include submodules for electronics, microfluidics, optics and air intake and sample preparation and will be designed to be less than 2\"x2\"x1\" in size.  The proposed antibody engineering for a fluorescence quenching immunoassay, will be done using novel mutagenesis and antibody expression methods recently developed by Drs. Iverson and Georgiou's.  To implement the proposed fluorescence quenching immunoassay into a MEMS, SPEC has developed a teaming arrangement with the MEMS foundry at MCNC.  The proposed microfluidic design will be developed by SPEC and MCNC design tool technology will be used to implement the micro-biosensor design in Phase II.  The development of the fluorescence quenching immunoassay will provide a technology for clinical applications which is reagentless.  The MEM biosensor system permits the developrnent of small, highly portable diagnostic systems.  The use of Drs. Iverson and Georgiou's patented process for systematic optimization of antibody affinity by saturation mutagenesis will allow the development of high specificity, high affinity antibodies where none currently exist.  These technologies, both in combination and individually have significant use in warfare, environmental, agricultural and medical applications.",

In order to make this technology feasible, miniature wide bandwidth transmit/receive switches, transmitter/receiver isolation or limiting techniques, high speed analog-to-digital converters, and signal processing techniques must be developed.  Radar pulses are approaching minimum pulse widths of 100 picoseconds with a 20 nanosecond pulse repetition interval (PRI).  To capture such pulses, sample rates as high as 20 giga samples per second (GSPS) are desired.Systems & Processes Engineering Corporation (SPEC) proposes to development a Radar Data Acquisition Module (RDAM) for capture of received pulses produced by a high performance radar fuze sensor.  The module design uses state-of-the-art Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) analog-to-digital converter and control/multiplexer(s), and high speed memory integrated circuits integrated into a Multi-Chip Module (MCM) to meet the stringent volume, performance, power, thermal, and shock requirements.

For this technology to gain acceptance, systems must recognize speech quickly and accurately in an adverse environment.Human speech perception is strongly influenced by vision.  When visual and auditory cues conflict, listeners' perceptions may be different than with either channel alone (the so-called McGurk effect).  Researchers have added lipreading information to audio-based automatic recognizers and reported significant improvements in performance.  However, lipreading has not been used in commercial recognizers because of two problems:  first, it is difficult to interpret the video signal in real-time; and second, certain applications-such as recognition over telephone lines-preclude the use of video.The oxygen mask of the fighter cockpit simplifies the video-interpretation problem.  Both an imager and an illuminator-to precisely control lighting-may be incorporated into the mask.  Also, because the mask is head-mounted, alignment will be much less of a problem.In this Phase I effort we will incorporate lipreading into a conventional speech recognizer, and we will design and build an experimental mask-mounted imager.  In Phase II, we will collect data with a prototype mask, and add lipreading to our own recognizer.",

During the project, interface software will be developed to provide automatic translation of network security related parameters into VRML scene data.

This system will consist of a vortex manipulation device, Innovative Dynamics, Inc.'s vortex sensor array and processing unit.  The Phase I effort will emphasize a controllable vane vortex generator made of SMA.

J. Won, Principal Investigator\nMr. Steven J. Daib, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-97ER82386\nAmount:  $74,988\nDetection and characterization of illicit underground facilities (UGF) has become one of the major national security issues in recent years.  The task ranges from finding hidden weapons of mass destruction to detecting drug-trafficking tunnels across the U.S.-Mexican border.  Human activity in these facilities gives off electromagnetic (EM) signals from a variety of sources, such as drilling machinery.  This project will develop (1) a passive airborne sensor for measuring the broadband electromagnetic (EM) spectrum covering a bandwidth of 10 Hz to 50 kHz and  (2) an active EM induction sensor that can measure spectral response of a suspected UGF.  The passive sensor is intended for a wide area search in order to detect specific EM radiation with known spectral contents that may be uniquely related to particular machinery in a UGF.  Once a suspect UGF has been located, an active EM source may illuminate the UGF and measure its spectral response.  In Phase I a prototype passive Low Frequency Electromagnetic Spectroscopy (LFEMS) system will be designed, fabricated and laboratory tested.  The sensor will also undergo limited field testing.  A fully field-deployable LFEMS system will be built in Phase II.  Work on an active sensor will also be undertaken in this latter phase.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In addition to detecting and characterizing UGFs, the proposed technology also would be applicable to detecting other buried objects, natural or man-made, such as mineral resources, sink holes, underground storage tanks, utility pipes, power lines, and forgotten hazardous landfills._",
