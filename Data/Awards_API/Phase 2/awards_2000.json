        "abstract": "Global Aerospace Corporation is proposing to develop a totally new concept for latitude trajectory control system (TCS) for NASA s Ultra Long Duration (ULDB) Balloons. The advantages of the TCS concept are that it uses little power, operates at night, is lightweight, does not require detailed knowledge of the wind field, and allows the balloon to fly at a constant altitude. The TCS enables the balloon to avoid populous areas and hazards to payload recovery, reach desirable targets, steer around no-fly zones and select convenient landing sites. Currently, when a balloon deviates significantly from a desired flight path, cut down often occurs, sometimes before mission objectives have been met. With a TCS, fewer flights will be terminated early. Furthermore, it will be easier to obtain permission to launch since the planned flight path can be achieved in a greater range of conditions. No longer will balloons be at the mercy of the winds.",

        "abstract": "People with disabilities, the elderly, and those who are non-disabled desire the development of bathroom vanity and sink designs that incorporate universal design. Developers of federally subsidized housing (HUD) and assisted living facilities have similar design needs for affordably meeting the needs of residents and accessibility laws. Phase I research found that conventional bathroom sink and vanity designs fail to meet the needs of disabled end-users. From their perspective, and the perspective of their tenants, property owners cite significant shortcomings with current designs. Current designs fail to provide -- counter space, accessible storage space, secure wall-mounted installations, and adequate design for wheelchair user anthropometrics. Phase I research determined the social and technical feasibility of vanity and sink designs that are equally usable by wheelchair users and others. To address these research findings, AD*AS designed and prototyped four technical solutions. Three of the solutions use proprietary height-adjustable mechanisms; one solution is a fixed-height design. In the Phase II work plan, AD*AS will: 1) conduct comprehensive technical evaluations of four prototypes, 2) conduct systematic consumer evaluation and testing, 3) perform business and market evaluations, and 4) integrate research findings into pre-production prototypes to offer a migration path from concept to commercial success (Phase III).",

This system will exclude animals from areas, or contain them within defined boundaries, where it is impractical or inefficient to build fence to achieve this objective. These needs arise in a variety of contexts, including the exclusion of livestock from riparian and other environmentally sensitive areas and the relocation of animals in managed intensive grazing. The Phase I research project conducted by AgriTech explored and confirmed the feasibility of a GPS-based system that would achieve these objectives. In the proposed Phase II project, the system will be redesigned and improved to (1) reduce the size of the ear tag units; (2) improve the accuracy of the system by Differential GPS (DGPS); and (3) reduce power consumption for increased battery life. The Phase II project will also include research on key animal behavior issues, including (1) improving response to audible stimulation; (2) further analyzing response to electric shock stimulation; (3) exploring herd behavior implications of the system; and (4) investigating consistency of animal response and learning behavior.",

Texas A&M University (TAMU) has tested a lime pretreatment process that is effective and low-cost. A significant element of the pretreatment cost is the lime regeneration system. To reduce costs, Altex has identified the Low Cost Lime Regenerator (LCLR). The LCLR is more compact, less costly and more efficient than conventional regeneration systems. Based on equipment supplier inputs, the LCLR can reduce lime regeneration costs by 55 percent. Under the Phase II program, TAMU and Altex will work together to demonstrate the lime pretreatment and LCLR lime regeneration concepts in a 2 TPD test system. Also, with input from equipment suppliers, full-scale system designs and capital and operating costs will be refined. System performance and costs will then be compared to those for conventional systems. This will show the benefits of the biomass lime pretreatment and LCLR approaches over existing method.",

The objective of such a tool is to provide a generic, flexible and user-friendly platform for developing species-specific models that allow planners and managers to explore the viability of an endangered species under alternative forest management and conservation options. The proposed software tool will combine a landscape model that predicts changes in the structure of a species' habitat, with a spatially structured, stochastic metapopulation model that estimates the extinction risk of the species. Such a tool will enable more realistic evaluation of the conservation practices and management options, such as schedule and type of timber harvest, design of nature reserves, reintroductions and translocations. It will also enable more accurate assessment of the impact of human activities (such as forestry practices, road building, agricultural expansion, and dam construction) on the fate of endangered and threatened species. The research will involve developing, integrating and testing algorithms for producing, exporting and interpreting habitat maps and for building models for species which live in multiple patches that change through time, such as in fragmented habitats.",

        "abstract": "Brazzein is a sweet plant protein recently discovered at the University of Wisconsin. It is the subject of four issued U.S. patents. The protein is 500 to 2000 times sweeter than sucrose and has the functional characteristics, such as taste and stability, required to be a leading commercial sweetener. Expression of the Brazzein gene in maize should yield the equivalent \u00bf ton of sugar per ton of maize, providing the basis for a range of economical high and low intensity sweeteners with benefits to agriculture, the food industry and the consumer. ProdiGene has the technical capability to develop commercial maize varieties for the production of the Brazzein sweetener. Commercial success requires the achievement of relatively high levels of Brazzein expression in maize. Research conducted during Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of maize for Brazzein production, resulting in levels of Brazzein in excess of 0.8% of total soluble protein. Phase II research will seek to enhance these levels using a variety of promoters, targeting signals and gene modifications. In addition, process technology will be developed and evaluated to mill, extract and purify Brazzein from maize, and purified Brazzein will be used in taste tests to determine the most suitable formulations for commercial applications.",

        "abstract": "Providing objective information about trail conditions, such as grade and width, will increase access and safety for all users, including people with disabilities. Through a collaborative process, the Universal Trail Assessment Process (UTAP) was developed to provide access information to trail users. Trail managers use the process to determine compliance with accessibility design guidelines. UTAP trainings are limited, particularly in rural areas, by the small number of UTAP Trainers. This research project will develop a training program to create a large, geographically diverse pool of UTAP Trainers. An increase in UTAP Trainers will ensure that more land management agencies, like the USDA Forest Service, will have the opportunity to use the UTAP. Phase I began the process of developing training materials through the establishment of a Project Advisory Board, drafting materials for Train-the-Trainer workshops, identifying training candidates, and developing a preliminary national implementation strategy. Phase II will refine the training materials and evaluate their effectiveness, and finalize the national implementation plan. Widespread availability of the UTAP will enhance access for all Americans, including people with disabilities, parents with young children, older adults, and inexperienced hikers, by enabling individuals to make informed decisions about trails appropriate for their interests and abilities.",

        "abstract": "A low value by-product of flour milling--midds--shows great potential as a bioprocessing feedstock to produce high protein feed. Phase I research demonstrated ability to upgrade 18% protein midds to 47% protein concentrate, in part, by hydrolyzing hemicellulose to pentose for high protein yeast propagation, instead of leaving it as an inexpensive source of fiber. In the U.S. 224 flour mills produce 5.13 million tons of midds annually, which, if processed, represent $1.1 billion in sales and $190 million net income potential. The price of midds would rise. A $20/ton increase translates to $.10/bushel, or nearly $235 million more value for American wheat. Equally important are prospects that such processing could be a pretreatment ?bridge' to more economical cellulosic biomass-to-ethanol processing. Recovering a significant co-product feed credit greatly improves biomass potential. Wheat screenings could also be processed, helping improve wheat quality and value. Research in Phase II focuses on a prototype plant large enough to provide product samples for feed trials necessary to support commercial expansion of the bioprocess. The prototype plant will also establish operational costs for determining profit potential in commercial plants.",

In the Phase I project the ability of pervaporation to recover onion and garlic flavors from evaporator condensate and crushed onion juice was demonstrated in field trials at an onion/garlic processing plant. The recovered flavors were rated very highly in taste panel tests. Process economics are expected to be very competitive. In the Phase II project additional tests will be performed at a garlic/onion plant, a citrus processing plant and a tomato processing plant. The pilot systems used in these Phase II tests will incorporate a number of improvements suggested by the Phase I experience.",

        "abstract": "ORBITEC proposes an advanced vortex combustion ramjet (VCRJ) featuring an innovative, vortex-flow, wall surface burning combustor, having improved combustion efficiency with cleaner burning and an extended operating range. Full-wall, liquid-fuel injection is expected to permit wide throttling without flame holders because the combustion is anchored at the wall as in a hybrid rocket engine. ORBITEC has been developing a similar device as a hybrid rocket engine with solid fuel walls. The unique co-axial vortex promotes combustion, with an extended flow path and thorough mixing. Benefits include: simplicity, low cost, and improved combustion to provide enhanced performance, with extended range and flight ceiling for the vehicle. In Phase I, a small prototype ramjet will be designed, built and tested. In Phase II, a larger engine will be flown in an RPV. NASA applications may include a research RPV, providing design and operational data for SST propulsion. Early commercial applications include RPV s to be used in forest fire surveillance, traffic and accident viewing, search and rescue and weather observations, government use may include RPV s for border surveillance, cruise weapon systems, target drones, and forward observation aircraft. These uses also support continued development of the engine cycle for SST applications, including fractional orbit vehicles. ",

        "abstract": "The overall goal of this Phase II program is the develop an efficient adsorbent technology for removal of nitrates and other agricultural-based contaminants in ground water, urban water supplies, and other water sources. Agricultural chemicals are a major source of pollution of surface water and aquifers rendering water supplies in many agricultural areas unsuitable for human consumption. The presence of nitrates and other contaminants in drinking water is a major health concern throughout the world, and agriculture is one of the largest contributors to this problem. In the Phase I program we developed a new class of materials that demonstrated rapid sorption kinetics, high capacity, and favorable selectivity for nitrates. A preliminary economic analysis indicated that the proposed process can significantly reduce the cost of water treatment, and will be applicable to numerous other separation technologies. All Phase I goals were met. The focus of this Phase II program is to 1) continue development and optimization of the new separation media; 2) design, fabrication and laboratory testing of prototype systems; 3) field-test of prototype system; and 4) an economic and engineering analysis of the process. The goal of the Phase II program is to bring the technology to the point where it can be commercialized. Based on the Phase I results, we have already attracted interest from sector firms that are interested in pursuing its final scale-up and commercialization.",

The new FGD material resulted in significantly more groundcover yield than commercial agricultural lime when applied at equivalent rates and resulted in plants with significantly greater rooting. In Phase II, these encouraging greenhouse results will be scaled up to field tests. Because the results were so positive, agricultural mini-plot field-tests will also be performed on quality farmland, in addition to reclamation trails at an actual abandoned mine site. The reclamation site trials will examine the possibility of lowering topsoil requirements by using the new FGD material. The agricultural field-tests will seek to increase the yield of alfalfa and soybeans in excess of that provided by currently- commercial products, while decreasing associated runoff pollution.",

Xtrana, Inc. is developing a low complexity genetic- based assay for sensitive and specific detection of L. monocytogenes. The successful development and validation of our assay will provide for confirmed detection of Listeria monocytogenes with vastly improved turnaround times. We anticipate that following minimal enrichment times, the assay will be run directly without the usual selective culture and subculture. In Phase I feasibility of extraction of RNA, capture onto a solid phase, isothermal amplification, and visual result detection was demonstrated. We are now ready to proceed with more rigorous sensitivity and specificity confirmation, interface with all of the food types required for AOAC approval, and confirmation that the assay will be specific to only viable Listeria monocytogenes.",

The current manual inspection process for internal defects is slow, subjective, and inaccurate. While automated systems have been developed for color, size, and surface defect inspection, no system is available for automatic internal defect detection in apples. This proposed project will develop an automated x-ray based imaging system for inspection of internal defects in apples. The results of our Phase I study prove the feasibility of the process. The work will be conducted to test and integrate the four components of the system - image capture, image analysis, transport, and system software. We will determine the x-ray exposure duration, synchronize the amorphous panel to the x-ray generator and conveyor, and refine image analysis algorithms to detect internal apple defects in real-time.",
