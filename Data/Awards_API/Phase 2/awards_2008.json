        "abstract": "This Phase II SBIR project addresses the need to develop a treatment for toxic shock induced by staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB), which may be disseminated as an aerosol in a biowarfare scenario.  Specifically, we seek to develop a hyperimmune human polyclonal antibody that neutralizes the toxic activity of SEB.   SEB has been weaponized and can cause incapacitation and lethality within military and civilian populations.  Integrated BioTherapeutics (IBT) has developed a proprietary, cGMP SEB vaccine (STEBVax) that is entering clinical trial sponsored by NIH in summer 2008.  In the current proposal, we will use STEBVax to produce hyperimmune globulin (SEB-HIG) in healthy individuals.  Feasibility was demonstrated in Phase I in surrogate models.  Phase II \u2013 a collaborative effort by IBT, Omrix Biopharmaceuticals, and the University of Maryland \u2013 involves donor stimulation, plasmapheresis, the purification of SEB-HIG, and tests of therapeutic efficacy in animals.  The outcome will be a therapeutic candidate for clinical development.  We expect SEB-HIG to reduce the rate of SEB-induced incapacitation and death by >50%, which should make SEB-HIG an essential component of the Strategic National Stockpile.  The market could be expanded into the public health sector by combining the product with HIG against other toxins currently in development at IBT.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this proposal is to produce a prototype 3D software tool for precision RF modeling/visualization of multi-path and attenuation in urban environments to optimize sensor placement.   State-of-the-art 3D gaming technology and original mathematical/graphical approaches will be employed to accurately model and visualize complex RF behaviors in a highly usable graphics representation providing a virtually training-free software application targeted for operational/field users in low bandwidth, limited data, restricted time and require C4ISR RF modeling.   The core technical milestone is to develop features that allow field operators to easily import geomorphometric/topographical (USGS) maps and integrate this data with existing propagation algorithms and model overlays that can be viewed in a deployable, intuitively simple game-like graphical environment.  This project will integrate emitter models with terrestrial, maritime and airborne ISR sensors to contextually illustrate RF signal propagation, multi-sensor spatial physics and the cause and effect of varying platform/sensor placement.  In addition to addressing the prevalent problem of sensor sub-optimization, improving force protection, and addressing the Joint \u201cFind-fix-finish\u201d doctrine, the successful development of this application will provide an indispensable planning and operational tool for C4ISR Organizations, Information Operations, RF/C4ISR Training, homeland security entities, FEMA/First Responders, Law Enforcement and commercial communication businesses.",

        "abstract": "The Phase II objective is to demonstrate technology that will provide IM solutions to bullet and fragment impact threats in large diameter solid rocket motors. We have taken a comprehensive approach in which a number of IM mitigation techniques are combined into a design that reduces the violence of the response to BI and FI.   These techniques, which were assessed and evaluated in Phase I, are integrated into the analog motor for the Phase II demonstration.   The principal elements in this approach are: Ignition delay liner(IDL), Tough Propellant, and Bore Mitigant.  Each element contributes to reducing the overall pressurization rate generated by the projectile impact.  For instance,  the IDL delays ignition of the grain  burning surface, the tough propellant minimizes the  fragmentation and debris thereby reducing burning surface, and the bore mitigant retards exposure of the grain surface to combustion gases and reduces the pressurization rate.   Our design also incorporates a graphite composite case which is known to reduce the violence of rocket motor response to IM stimuli. The evaluation of HTPB and HTPE in the analog motors will provide a comparison of the IM performance in a common configuration. We will also measure detailed internal pressure, stress - time response to the impact events at critical locations in the analog motor.  This will provide an understanding of the ignition process and the pressure rise rates that lead to the violent responses typically observed.",

It is planned for an FY10 IOC.   One of program\u2019s objectives is to reduce the Reception, Staging, Onward movement and Integration (RSO&I) burden in theater.  Although the JHSV will be small enough to provide austere port accessibility, SOCOM units are often deployed covertly along coastlines away from populous port areas.  Consequently, as these units move inland, their logistical resupply requirements include unique challenges such as maintaining covert operations, thus eliminating the option of using powered aircraft near the SOF operational area.  Terrestrial conditions (bluffs, trees, swamps, etc.) between the shoreline and nearby roads may also preclude or slow the resupply line via ground vehicles.  A cost effective stealth unmanned aircraft is needed that can be carried by and deployed by the JHSV and covertly replenish SOF units who are operating on the ground with ammunition, food, water and medical supplies.",

Furthermore, we have performed a detailed study of the ability of the PLADAR system to see parts of a scene that are not visible under intensity-only imaging.  We have also shown how the PLADAR system can distinguish between parts of a scene that appear indistinguishable under intensity-only imaging.  Finally, we have illustrated the development of a rudimentary database of the polarimetric properties of various surfaces that can be used for surface discrimination and object recognition using a PLADAR system.  Under the Phase II project, we will develop further the PLADAR system for potential integration into Naval platforms such as the Firescout, a Vertical-Takeoff UAV.  The specific tasks we would carry out under the Base project include: (a) High-Speed Operation of the PLADAR,  (b) Automated Source Polarization Control for the PLADAR, (c) Development of Optimization Techniques for Compensating Residual Nonlinearity and Cross Talk, (d) Development of a Navy-Relevant Polarimetric Database, and (e) Development of a Portable Prototype for the PLADAR and Performing Field Tests.  The Navy is currently developing a 3-D Ladar for FireScout, which will be evaluated under an ONR FNC program.  The system developed under the Base project  would be tested with this hardware.

Time reversal (TR) is a recent method for focusing acoustic energy at a point using pairs of source and receive arrays. The TR focus provides a measure of propagation channel stability, allowing one to determine when the medium is disrupted as would occur when a scatterer such as a submarine target passes between the two arrays. In Phase II we propose to implement a TR barrier using SSQ-125-XN1 and SSQ-77C DVLA buoys in a controlled experiment. The purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate a TR barrier under typical at-sea conditions using realistic sonobuoy hardware. Using the data from this experiment we will (1) quantify the performance of the system in terms of probability of detection and detection range, (2) develop a procedure to automate target detection in the presence of noise and environmental fluctuations, and (3) validate and improve the models developed in Phase I for predicting TR performance.",

In such an environment, traditional data-access mechanisms\u2014which have almost universally been developed on the assumption of broadband network access\u2014cannot function.  As an ironic and often tragic result, the military personnel most in need of urgent information are thus frequently the least-able to access that information.

The major focus of this effort will be to develop a low cost, single-chip security device that uses verifiable partitioning methods to prevent intermingling of differently classified information.

This may lead to decrements in learning outcomes due to the lack of an affective learning component in those systems.  If training systems are to be effective, they must consider the user\u2019s affective state as a key component in learning.

This is demonstrated by overstressed suspension systems, higher vehicle center of gravity, increased rollovers, and reduced performance on all tactical vehicles. It has been especially prevalent in the HMMWV platform. Therefore, GS Engineering proposes a detailed parametric study of the M1165 HMMWV to develop lightweight components using advanced materials and manufacturing techniques for near term implementation.  These lightweight body components will save over 500 pounds of mass with equal or improved performance over the heavy steel or cast iron components. Also, the Titanium Armor B-3 Kit has potential weight savings on the order of 2350#. BENEFITS: The successful completion of the design, analysis and testing of the lightweight prototypes during Phase II will demonstrate both the feasibility of using advanced  lightweight materials on ground vehicles and the dynamic performance increase of the vehicle with reduced weight.  These solutions will be practical and affordable, and ready for immediate implementation. The effort on the titanium armor solution will be an expensive weight reduction item, but will serve to demonstrate the feasibility and the required manufacturing processes.  Furthermore, this will provide data for costing analyses with the \u201clow cost armor development program\u201d funded by DARPA.  Therefore, this program will provide actual test data on low cost immediate solutions along with longer term solutions. Following the completion of the Phase II work, the prototype solutions will have seen the full range of testing and therefore a high confidence of success will lead into a Phase III effort.

The final Phase II hardware deliverable will be a nanocomposite carbon-fiber pressure vessel that demonstrates 30% improved impact mitigation when compared to its conventional counterpart.  As demonstrated in Phase I, the nanocomposite will consist of 60% carbon fiber volume as well as energy dissipating nanofiber\u2014the presence of which will not increase weight or pressure vessel thickness.   Fabrication processing steps will be developed for large-scale manufacturing of nanocomposite coupons.  A test matrix will be executed including different characterization approaches crossed with conventional and nanocomposite coupons before and after damage.  This matrix is to demonstrate AMRDEC and RMS component compatibility where flow down of requirements is expected for several RMS programs including Joint Air to Ground Missile (JAGM), Laser Guided Rocket (LGR) and Active Protection System (APS).  Analytical models will be developed that describe and predict the energy dissipation potential at matrix nanoscale interfaces such as the potential energy of absorption and surface energy of nanofibers.  Additionally, investigations into passive identification of damage will be explored.",

        "abstract": "A recent increase in the occurrence of pilot parachute deployment hesitation events during training has focused attention on the flow field about parachutists in freefall. An improved understanding of this flow will contribute to better equipment and improved safety.  Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis is a powerful technique for exploring such flows. Once validated against experimental data, CFD solutions may be used to probe the flow in detail and to evaluate the effects of changes in body position or equipment configurations.  In Phase I of this project, we demonstrated each step of a simplified modeling approach and validated it against a detailed CFD model and against published experimental data. In Phase II we will implement an innovative Freefall Toolkit that separates the expensive and time-intensive CFD flow solution generation process from the trajectory simulation process. The result is a front end Simulator Tool that may be used interactively to explore the freefall dynamics of specific configurations while detailed solutions are generated off-line in a batch process. We will conduct a detailed validation of our solution process for a number of specific cases before extending the parameter space to cover a wide range of drop conditions and configurations. Our Freefall Toolkit, to be delivered at the end of the Phase II project, will enable researchers, designers, and freefall instructors to better understand the complex flow field about a parachutist in freefall and hence contribute to improved equipment designs and safer freefall practices.",

Even data that is currently well-organized and \u201cpre-positioned\u201d, is confronted with the possibility that critical information never rises to the attention of analysts because it is obfuscated by traditional labeling or keyword search deficiencies.

Situational awareness in a littoral environment requires radars to not only detect and track surface vessels, but also to discriminate and, if possible, perform classification. While existing radars have these individual modes, they cannot run them simultaneously. This can severely degrade situational awareness because MTI tracks maybe dropped while executing the ISAR mode which may take several 10s of seconds to perhaps 1 minute to form an image beneficial to the operator. The results of the studies produced an architecture that will be implemented with firmware and software changes only in Phase II, and through simulation and testing will verify the operation and performance benefit.",

In this project, Phoenix Integration will work with the Applied Research Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University to develop and demonstrate an uncertainty management software framework and apply it to the design of a realistic undersea weapon design problem. This software framework will provide engineers with the means to create and execute multi-disciplinary system models, define input variable uncertainties, utilize Gaussian Process metamodels to efficiently perform a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis, interpret the results, and make informed design decisions.

A simple experiment will be performed using low-power Thulium fiber lasers to demonstrate the applicability of this technology at eye-safe wavelengths.  The SF technology is, to our knowledge, the only technology that can be directly scaled to a weapon-class system using commercially available fiber lasers with a full-scale weapon system demonstration achievable in less than 5 years.  This project will demonstrate the full potential of this technology in a single monolithic structure consisting of a multicore fiber laser fused to the Self-Fourier cavity.

        "abstract": "Stottler Henke proposes an integrated approach to document classification and dissemination termed InfoAssist. We will build upon the state-of-the-art technologies developed in Phase I to provide intelligent dirty word detection methods as well as techniques based on historical documents that help detect secure content in documents slated for dissemination. These techniques allow document authors and reviewers to make use of the release and publication history of all content in a particular document when assigning security classifications. Users will benefit from integrated tracking of a documents classification while they combine content from multiple sources, all without modification to their existing workflow. Furthermore, InfoAssist will provide an opportunity to solicit the input of document reviewers regarding enhancements to existing policy. This input can be carefully considered and\u2014if suitable\u2014gradually adopted into a semi-automated dissemination process through a rigorous testing and evaluation procedure.    The Phase I development of InfoAssist provides a solid foundation of intelligent classification algorithms upon which we will build the Phase II implementation of the InfoAssist system. This system will integrate seamlessly with existing reviewing and dissemination tools, such as the Work-flow Enforcement Server, reducing the cost of adoption and ensuring immediate rewards.",

The heart of the system will use a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) wireless mesh networking IC platform for low-power and low-cost communications. By using a wireless mesh network, low-power wireless transceivers can be used because messages do not need to be sent directly to a site commander, rather, they can be passed from node to node.

        "abstract": "Directing a high-power laser (HPL) beam through the atmosphere onto a distant target is limited by atmospheric absorption of the laser light, which causes thermal blooming and wavefront distortions that are difficult to correct. In the near-IR there are three atmospheric windows, in which atmospheric absorption is relatively weak, at wavelengths near 1 micron, 1.6 micron and 2.2 microns. The selection of the operating wavelength and requisite power level of an HPL that is designed to be directed through the atmosphere  requires detailed measurement of atmospheric absorption as a function of wavelength by both molecules and aerosols.  SRL proposes to develop an absorptometer that accurately measures the absorption of laser beams in the atmosphere in these windows and is insensitive to scattering losses.  The instrument, which will utilize sensitive interferometry, will be capable of measuring both gas constituents and naturally occurring aerosols in both laboratory anid field experiments, with the objective of delivering a measurement system that can be used on a shore-based site and on a seagoing vessel. In Phase I SRL completed a conceptual formulation and design of a system that can measure the absorption of a laser beam by atmospheric gases and naturally occurring aerosols in a laboratory and maritime environment.

During Phase I the new electrolytes demonstrated excellent low temperature rate capabilities in well-engineered Li-ion cells.  During Phase II the new electrolyte formulations will be further evaluated in Li-ion cells and batteries over a broad spectrum of temperatures.

To address this issue, this project proposes to develop and implement a prototype Robotic Nursing Assistant (RNA) to assist nurses with patient lifting and transport responsibilities. Our goal in creating the RNA is to match or exceed the performance of existing patient moving technologies, including portable and overhead hoist and stand assist lifts. Our system will be an extremely portable lifting system capable of working anywhere within the hospital, operating at heights from floor to bed level, and able to be used by multiple trained personnel. In Phase I, several preliminary designs of varying complexity were developed, and various intuitive control strategies were tested for the user interface. Our goals in Phase II are to design a working prototype of the RNA system, work with industry experts to develop intuitive control interfaces, and refine the commercialization approach to create a realistic market strategy for the introduction of this technology into hospital settings.",

The use of radio frequency modulation in underwater imaging applications has been suggested to discriminate against the volume backscatter clutter. Recent publications  on this Hybrid Lidar-Radar (HLR) indicate that seawater behaves as a low-pass filter and therefore, if the Lidar output pulses are modulated at radio frequencies (500\u20131500 MHz), the effect of backscatter can be reduced, thereby improving target recognition and discrimination. In addition, it has been also shown that spatial effects of multiple forward scattering do not detrimentally affect the temporal characteristics of encoded data in a communications link. Hence the same HLR system is capable of not only identifying the threat, but also communicate to those in danger or those who can neutralize the threat.",

OCHYMO is based on measuring the plasma omolality by non-invasively measuring the osmolality of the aqueous humor. The hand-held, battery operated Phase I prototype with custom analysis software was capable of determining hydration levels within 3% of TBW using artificially prepared aqueous humor. The robust measurement modality of OCHYMO has resulted in accuracies consistent with the gold standard in measuring hydration status, namely, invasive plasma osmolality measurements. Furthermore, OCHYMO measurements are independent of physical posture, skin temperature/moisture.  Following the successful demonstration of feasibility of the OCHYMO technology, in Phase II, CL plans to develop a more robust prototype that will enable rapid instrument positioning and data acquisition. Also in Phase II, CL will perform detailed human clinical studies through a subcontract with Syracuse University.",

Improving durability, corrosion resistance, acoustic insulation and life cycle cost of the air cushioned vehicle (ACV) structure at minimum weight is paramount to achieving operational goals of future platforms such as the Joint Maritime Assault Connector (JMAC). The innovation and opportunity offered in this proposal is an approach for simultaneously reducing the weight, improving the durability and corrosion resistance of ACV hull and superstructure using fiber reinforced composite materials. To accomplish this objective, an integrated Product Team (IPT) of composite designers and fabricators has been assembled to develop lightweight, advanced material solutions and joint designs for a typical ACV hull configuration. We are proposing to concurrently engineer the material, structural, and manufacturing efforts to meet the weight, durability and life-cycle cost goals.

The primary objective of this Phase II effort is to test an ALB on a USV hull while towing a Navy tow body simulator. Early testing will be performed without towing a body to show that the ALB will decrease the motions of the USV. To accomplish this the propulsion system will be upgraded to include two 430 hp diesel engines and Arneson drive, which will be contributed by Navatek. Success with this early testing justify further testing (Option I) with a Navy tow body simulator.

Interestingly, preliminary analysis of in vitro primary human osteoblasts suggest that PC-NSAIDs may have favorable effects on bone remodeling compared with unmodified NSAIDs Based upon these studies, we propose to investigate in Phase II the therapeutic actions of the most effective PC-NSAID we have identified, Indomethacin-PC (vs. unmodified indomethacin) in rodent models of joint and nerve inflammation, post-operative incisional pain (to both mechanical and thermal stimulation) and bone healing. We also propose to evaluate the GI toxicity of the test NSAIDs in the above in vivo model systems to confirm Indomethacin-PC\u2019s superior GI safety. The parenteral and oral formulations of Indomethacin-PC will be optimized by the scientists at PLx Pharma in close consultation with our industrial advisors and our Co-investigators at the two University of Texas institutions.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR is aimed at developing an advanced and unified rotorcraft flight control system design and testing tool that can account for the effects of both the ship motion and the ship airwake. The development will integrate the various aspects of the shipboard simulation and analysis to provide a unified sea-based rotorcraft flight control design and evaluation environment. The unified control design and evaluation environment will facilitate (1) an accurate generation of the control plant model, (2) the development of a shipboard disturbance model in order to take into account the effect of the turbulent ship airwake in the control design, (3) the performance of advanced control options design, and (4) the comprehensive testing and validation of the flight control system through both non-real time engineering analysis and pilot-in-the-loop real time simulation.  The initial Phase I results demonstrate that advanced flight control options can be developed to effectively enhance shipboard rotorcraft controls with significantly reduced pilot workload. The initial development also shows that a unified shipboard control option design programming environment can be created by integrating the control design functions and algorithms into an existing comprehensive rotorcraft simulation program, FLIGHTLAB. The unified control design environment thus formed can effectively support a full cycle of rotorcraft shipboard control design and test and evaluation through non-real time analysis and real time pilot-in-the-loop simulation.  The proposed Phase II work will implement the Phase I prototype and thoroughly test it on both single main rotor helicopter and on modern tiltrotors under shipboard operating conditions.",

        "abstract": "The objective of the proposed research is to improve vehicle and crew protection from landmine and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). This will be done by developing a new computational design methodology and an innovative reactive deflector concept that can be installed in current and future tactical vehicle systems. The innovative idea is based on a novel functionally-graded Negative Poisson\u00a1\u00afs Ratio (NPR) material concept developed at MKP, which has an imbedded reactive mechanism that can morph deflector\u00a1\u00afs shape and concentrate material into the area where is most needed utilizing the blast energy for improving blast mitigation and crew protection. This idea will be combined together with the optimal morphing shape design and optimal NPR material distribution to further improve the protection while minimizing the weight of the deflector. Structures fabricated using this new concept (combining material configuration, shape and reactivity) can react to the explosion and reconfigure themselves under the blast force to provide maximum blast protection. The dynamic reconfiguration includes both shape morphing and material reorganization under blast loads (mechanical triggers) and potentially other non-blast impulses (thermal, electrical triggers). The proposed research consists of two basic approaches to deflector design: Morphing structure with optimized shape and material reconfiguration with our innovative reactive mechanism.",

Current and future thermal battery packaging and performance requirements are being pushed to the limits, demanding higher power levels over longer operating times (hence, higher usable energy output) in smaller, lighter packages. These increases are required for:  (1) advanced munitions and strategic defense applications employing multifunctional seeker and sensor packages, (2) active data links supporting a net-centric capability and/or (3) increased maneuvering capability. In order to meet these demands, ENSER has proposed development of new cathode materials and demonstrated significant improvements in performance in single cell tests and in prototype batteries during Phase I.  During Phase II, ENSER is proposing to optimize the synthesis and manufacturing of the most promising cathode material(s) and demonstrate their processing in battery components and their improved performance in practical batteries.

        "abstract": "A submarine immersed in seawater behaves like a short-circuited galvanic cell which, because of variations in resistance (as a function of propeller shaft angle) between the rotating propeller shaft and its bearings, may produce an electric current that is modulated at the shaft rate.  Corrosion currents arise from differences in electrical potential among the interconnected dissimilar metals on the outside of a submarine: copper (in the bronze propeller), iron (in the steel hull), and zinc (in the hull-protecting sacrificial electrodes).  Generally, the largest currents flow between the propeller and the nearest zincs giving rise to a current which flows from the propeller through the submarine into the water back to the propeller.  Modulation of the submarine\u2019s corrosion currents gives rise to ELF emissions. A fixed-site ELF sensor offers the relative advantages of freedom from platform and geological noise, much longer integration times, the ability to exploit the vector nature of the signature, and a much larger separation in frequency between the Extremely Low Frequency Emission (ELFE) signal and the ferromagnetic signal.  During Phase 1, Navmar identified a design concept for the ELF buoy.  During phase 2, design details will be refined, and units will be fabricated for concept demonstration testing.",

        "abstract": "At the present time there is no system to monitor the progress of medical shipments to and within the combat theater other than those pallets that are tagged with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags in compliance with the current DoD mandate for tagging pallets and cases. Full implementation of the DoD mandate to tag all pallets and cases of Class VIII (Medical) materiel is not expected to occur before the end of 2008. The DoD mandate not withstanding, most Class VIII shipments are of less than pallet or case quantity and therefore are not subject to this requirement. Many of these medical shipments are time sensitive and are often subject to damage from rough handling and/or environmental exposure. Very often the timely delivery of these items, in good condition, is necessary to save human life or limb or to alleviate human suffering. Thus, an RFID system with the ability to monitor the condition of the medical shipments in transit is of vital importance. In the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Contract W81XWH-08-C-0014, Eigent conducted a technology feasibility study and considered alternative strategies for an AIT enabled system to provide tracking/in-transit visibility (ITV) of less than pallet/case quantity medical shipments from the point of origin, or from an intermediate shipping point such as a military medical depot, to the point of use. This research demonstrated that RFID sensor tags have the potential to: 1. monitor the condition of sensitive medical shipments in transit; 2. report temperature, humidity, vibration and/or shock; 3. be compact in size; 4. be low cost and disposable; 5. require no battery replacement over their useful life; 6. provide early notification of possible damage to essential medical materiel; 7. require minimal human intervention; and 8. be capable of being integrated into the Defense Medical Logistics system(s).",

        "abstract": "A full Stokes, passive MMW imaging polarimeter has been designed that is capable of being deployed on an unmanned aerial vehicle. The system is a linear phased array, pushbroom system operating in the W band. In full Stokes mode, the predicted NEDT is 0.13 K, resulting in a polarimetric noise level of 0.1%; polarimetric noise of this order is shown to be required to distinguish various materials. Fewer Stokes parameters can be collected to reduce the noise level even further. The antenna will view the ground at 45a to collect Stokes imagery, but can collect at nadir for higher resolution radiometric imaging. The stringent radiometric and polarimetric calibration procedures that are required for polarimetric imaging have been developed, and the associated hardware has been designed. For Phase II, it is recommended to partially populate the systems feedhorns, amplifiers and detectors, and to demonstrate the system on a manned aircraft that will fly lower than the designed altitude. This will maintain the ground sampling distance and noise performance of the Phase III system, but with 1/4 the ground swath coverage. This system can then be fully populated once funding is secured for Phase III.",

        "abstract": "Vector borne diseases have posed a significant threat to soldier health in past and present foreign deployments. Currently deployed troops face several severe illnesses such as Leishmaniasis and Sand Fly Fever Virus that are transmitted by insects. There are no prophylactic vaccines available for these diseases. Soldiers must integrate multiple personal protective equipment (PPE) measures to minimize likelihood of infection; however 100% compliance is often not achievable in the battlefield due to several complicating factors. Essential to soldier heath is the rapid deployment of new technologies that reduce the hindrance of PPE measures and enhance protection against insects that transmit disease. In this Phase II program, Infoscitex will continue development of a new controlled release technology that will repel insects from lightweight camouflage structural netting such as the ULCANS and LCSS. A significant amount of testing with relevant vectors will take place to optimize performance and demonstrate efficacy. This technology is inexpensive and readily applicable to the civilian population in regions where mortality is high due to the prevalence of vector borne diseases.",

To meet this need, InfinID Technologies, Inc. proposes a new system for item tagging called Ad hoc Networked Tags (ANT), based on the use of active RFID tags that self-organize to create a reliable communications network for interrogation of many closely packed medical items. In the ANT system, the RFID tags not only periodically transmit their ID and sensor readings at low duty cycle, but are also capable of relaying the IDs and sensor readings of other tags within range. Required infrastructure to implement the ANT system is minimal. In Phase I, we developed a demonstration system consisting of 1 gateway unit and 5 ANT tags. We also developed simulations that showed our system to be 2.4 times more reliable than the tags currently on the market today. In Phase II we propose continued development to create a compact, secure, robust and durable $40 ANT tag with open sensor bus and $99 ANT gateway unit. The Phase II ANT tags will meet the requirements of US MRMC and many other Army supply tracking applications.",

        "abstract": "Heat loads due to on-board power, combined with hot environments imposed on military ground vehicles, have resulted in situations where vehicle performance is limited by thermal management issues. To counteract this, the cooling system must be optimized, preferably early in the design process. Current modeling practices make it difficult for an analyst find an optimal system configuration from many design options in a timely manner. ThermoAnalytics is proposing to create a modeling tool that will allow an analyst to rapidly assess the performance of a cooling system based on the evaluation of multiple approaches and parametric studies for a vehicle in different environments and load scenarios. Our approach is to adopt a component model paradigm that uses pre-built models of cooling system components as building blocks for system analyses. We will modify the thermal and IR signature code MuSES to interface with a database of component models, and streamline and semi-automate the process of importing and integrating a component into a parent model. This will reduce the time required to find and assign critical performance data to models, and allows a modeler the flexibility to apply geometric detail to models only when and where it is needed.",

We will investigate the comparative feasibility and technical merits of S-band (2998 MHz) and X-band (9303 MHz) linac designs for the IMAXS. In Phase I, the optimal design characteristics will be described, essential variables will be defined, and the IMAXS design will be developed. In Phase II, at least one linac prototype will be developed and tested with a high-energy X-ray inspection system produced for cargo inspection operations: the Rapiscan Eagle System.",

These two objectives are achieved through development of the advocated FCS using two proven robust adaptive high performance control schemes, namely Theta-D and Nonlinear Adaptive Control (NAC) architectures. The efficacy of these controllers in providing robustness to parametric and functional uncertainties in the system dynamics was shown during Phase I  on a simplified model of rotorcraft operating near ships. In addition, the proposed Theta-D/NAC design concept also offers several attractive  features including: (1) ease of implementation and low processing requirements, (2) works in concert with existing V-22 FSW, (3) reliable adaptation capability through direct adaptive paradigm without requiring onboard parameter estimator.  The Phase II extensive testing and evaluation of proposed Theta-D/NAC concept will be carried out using  tilt-rotor aircraft high-fidelity simulations (via comparative evaluation of results produced by the  simulation packages of NAVAIR, IMI, and Boeing).",

The core technology comprises a Matrix Laser Vibrometer (MLV) which enables high-speed capture of spatial vibration patterns including random or transient processes. This feature of the MLV is unparalleled by existing optical methods, significantly exceeding their operational capabilities in terms of speed, resolution and sensitivity.

The key aspects of this component integration and reliability prediction \u201croll-up\u201d concept are the individual component life analysis modules, probabilistic analysis with uncertainly management and model updating, subsystem interaction models and the necessary framework that can analyze a defined hierarchy of components for assessing overall subsystem reliability.

Impact will leverage its experience with ground vehicle suspension/propulsion systems, corrosion fatigue modeling, DADS vehicle level dynamics modeling, structural NASTRAN/ANSYS modeling and relationship with GDLS, to create the integrated probabilistic fatigue life modules.  The modules will be developed and validated within the Matlab/Simulnk\u2122 environment with interfaces to the TARDEC computing environment and GDLS computing clusters.

Shafts are exposed to severe environments including constant salt spray, sand particles, and extreme dynamic loading. The next generation ACV, Joint Maritime Assault Connector (JMAC), will require greater lift capacity, with power transmission needs increasing up to 65%. Scaling current steel shafts to accommodate increased JMAC requirements would add considerable weight, unacceptably reducing useful payload. During Phase I KaZaK identified two different design and manufacturing approaches for making composite replacements for the two sets of six different shaft configurations used on the current LCAC. Depending on individual shaft details, some LCAC shafts are most appropriately made with a conventional shaft/coupling arrangement, while others can benefit from an integrated shaft/coupling solution. Both approaches save more than 50% weight, and are estimated to be approximately the same acquisition cost as baseline steel. Life cycle costs should be lower. Phase II funding is sufficient for the KaZaK team to design, fabricate, test and deliver examples of four of the six LCAC shafts. Because they are easily installed and removed, composite shafting provides a low risk path to significant weight and cost reduction in current and future ACVs.",

This new interest in composite materials is due to the increased need for corrosion-free, lightweight, low cost structural components that enable technology insertion into these platforms, however the technical requirement that has limited composite use inside Navy submarine/ships is smoke and toxic gas emissions of polymer matrix composite material systems.The MSI/PEI/ARIS/EB team will investigate advances in polymer matrix materials and core materials in the areas of strength and FST performance to develop a composite sandwich panel which will meet the current FST standards and be of high strength, shock hardened, and cost competitive while still meeting the atmospheric requirements for use inside submarine pressure hulls.    At the completion of testing and qualification the resulting product will be ready to transition to production of sandwich panel composite parts.

This requires recognizing groups of facets that collectively represent higher-order surfaces such as cylinders, spheres, cones, and lofted curved surfaces; mathematically fitting surface equations to those facets to determine the characteristic shape parameters; and exporting the high-order representations to formats that modeling, simulation, and analysis tools can process. These techniques will enable smooth surface CAD models to be created automatically from roughly triangulated input geometries.",

        "abstract": "A set of vocoder translation methods will be developed for use in voice communications applications where different vocoder algorithms are being used across the application. The translation methods will provide reduced complexity and increased performance from that of digital tandem approach. The translations will address system configurations involving both speech model parametric based vocoders and direct waveform representation types of vocoder. The complexity of a translation method for a given configuration will be targeted to be less than that of the corresponding tandem for that configuration. The goal for the performance of the voice communication for a given configuration will be greater than or equal to that of the corresponding digital tandem. Previous research has demonstrated that by adjusting for parametric vocoder algorithm differences in procedures such as pre-emphasis and characteristics such as analysis window size, an increased performance can be achieved by transcoding. In a transcode, the model parameters from the source vocoder are translated to the model parameters of the destination vocoder. For those parametric vocoders that do not incorporate acoustic noise reduction techniques, the performance of specific configuration is limited to that of the lower data rate coder of the configuration. With waveform types of vocoders, with no parametric basis, it is not possible to use a true transcode approach to translation. For theses configurations, smart tandem approaches will be developed. The smart tandems will match the digital speech streams for best performance while reducing complexity with mixed synthesis approaches.",

        "abstract": "The technical problem being addressed by Chesapeake Technology International (CTI) for this Phase 2 SBIR is to provide a helicopter (or fixed wing) pilot with a tactile (touch feeling) situational awareness (SA) system during periods of high mission tasking (landing or hovering) and low visibility (night, poor weather, brown-out due to debris blow-up).  Helicopter pilots have a unique scan requirement complexity that is not required for fixed wing pilots.  In VFR (Visual Flight Rules) conditions, when close to the ground during the landing or hover phases of a mission, a helicopter pilot\u2019s scan is made up of three components:  front (visible horizon), lateral (obstacles), and down (landing zone).  If visibility is degraded (night or IFR conditions), add into his scan an instrument scan that has been developed by and for fixed wing aircraft that lacks the precise visual cues needed for low speed, hovering , and landing.  During periods of high stress, if you take away any of the helicopter pilot\u2019s comfort areas (visual horizon, where the obstacles are, or where the ground is); he is left in a potentially dangerous situation.   TSAS will augment the visual instruments during these critical low visibility scenarios and restore helicopter pilot cues for low speed, hovering, and landing. TSAS will provide the pilot with a tactile SA system that will indicate to the pilot when he/she is entering into a potentially dangerous hover or up-and-away situation.  This will be done by sending signals to \u201ctactors\u201d that will encircle the pilot\u2019s torso in an air conditioned vest that will be worn outside flight suit clothing and under survival equipment.     With this Phase 2 SBIR, CTI will leverage the concepts developed in the Phase 1 SBIR and by the Naval Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory (NAMRL) for the development of a prototype Tactile Display Processor (TDP) and Tactile Display System (TDS) which will be tested and demonstrated within a commercial helicopter environment.  The focus of this Phase 2 SBIR is to develop the prototype system that will be used as the baseline configuration for a production system in commercial and Navy/USMC helicopters. Additionally, CTI will integrate a prototype TSAS system into the Manned Flight Simulator located at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland.",

These models are employed at the start of the battery development, adding value early while saving time and cost as well as reducing technical risk. Mechanical anomalies would typically not be seen until very late in the development (Design Verification Test Phase). As development times and budgets decrease and performance expectations increase, the thermal battery design process can be greatly enhanced with reliable mechanical analysis tools.

However, technical and user acceptance barriers caused in part by a lack of mature theory currently hinder the exploitation of foveated imagery on the battlefield.

TAFAT Phase 2 builds on these successes to mature the theory and algorithms that let foveated sensors outperform uniform-resolution sensors. We will mature our methodology for quantifying the relative performance of foveated and uniform-resolution systems, and we will deliver a reusable evaluation framework with which AFRL can evaluate foveated exploitation approaches developed long after TAFAT. We will use our new theoretical developments to develop robust and flexible foveated acquisition, tracking, and recognition algorithms. We emphasize adaptive foveation techniques that automatically tune foveation characteristics to optimize acquisition and tracking, given current target and background characteristics.

During Phase I, we designed innovative Pn-N detectors and established the feasibility of growing the required HgCdTe-based structures by molecular beam epitaxy. Using this approach in a collaborative effort with the Army Research Laboratory and DRS Technologies, we demonstrated Auger suppression and high operating temperature devices based on LWIR MBE-grown HgCdTe. By employing a model similar to that previously developed, we propose to analyze two new approaches in Phase II to further reduce the dark currents: the implementation of novel PP+n-N+N and PP+p-N+N structures, and using p-type layers as absorbers. PP+n-N+N and PP+p-N+N structures benefit from reduced carrier injection into the absorber layers due to higher bandgap and higher doped barrier layers. Pp-N devices benefit from the slower Auger recombination in the absorber layers. The relative benefits and challenges of the four device architectures (Pn-N, Pp-N, PP+n-N+N and PP+p-N+N) will be evaluated.

Current penetrator materials and designs suffer from high levels of frictional drag, unbalanced resistance due to lateral forces and localized melting of the warhead leading to shape change and further instability. General Sciences, Inc. (GSI) has developed a method for enhanced penetration performance of Deep Earth Penetrating Warheads (EPWs) based on reactive materials, specifically the release and combustion of hydrogen form a solid state metal hydride carrier. In addition, GSI has identified two processes to manufacture metal hydrides not commercially available, one involving direct hydrogenation of the target metal and the other involving transfer hydrogen from a hydride to a metal, a significant safety advantage. Lab scale experiments have been performed demonstrating the validity of this approach by evaluating different reactive materials ballistically launched into concrete target blocks. In addition to the experimental effort, GSI has worked with General Dynamics-OTI (GD-OTI) to create computer simulations showing the penetration event in sand/concrete targets and the enhancement possible by the creation of a low-friction gas zone between the penetrator and the earthen overburden. GSI will evaluate new reactive materials, manufacture and analyze tantalum hydride by direct and transfer hydrogenation, fabricate scaled penetrators for evaluation at General Dynamic\u2019s sled test facility and will culminate this Phase II program with the construction of a prototype Deep Earth Penetrating warhead.",

        "abstract": "The U.S. Army is evaluating laser peening technology in support of major helicopter programs, including the AH-64 Apache, UH-60 Black Hawk, and CH-47 Chinook fleets.   The Army has a critical need to boost the engine horsepower for these helicopters, especially when operating in high altitude theaters such as Iraq and Afghanistan.  Laser peening offers a method of increasing the fatigue performance and damage tolerance of these components without increasing the size or the weight of the propulsion system.  Laser shock peening has been demonstrated to significantly increase the fatigue life of metallic components by the introduction of deep compressive residual stresses.  The U.S. Army utilizes numerous fatigue-critical components, which potentially could be improved by laser peening.  The overall objective of the work proposed in this SBIR II program is to develop, optimize, and demonstrate laser peening technology specifically for rotorcraft materials and components, such as carburized steels for gear applications.  The results from the Phase I program and the LSPT\u2019s subsequent work with bend fatigue tests and component tests indicate that a very significant benefit from laser peening can be achieved when laser peening gears, and is driving the extension of this work to advanced rotorcraft gear steels.",

Illicit removal of this material from storage could result in construction of a Radiological Dispersal Device or \"Dirty Bomb.\" A pervasive means of securing radiological materials and\nidentifying breaches in security is required. Ideally, existing passive surveillance technology would be used, thereby enabling rapid and cost effective deployment. Advanced Fuel Research (AFR) developed and is commercializing a software solution designed to reduce the likelihood of malicious use of radiological materials. Analytical software (U.S. Patent number 7,391,028) evaluates images from security cameras to search for the characteristic small \"spots\" that appear in images when a radiological source is nearby. AFR's Radiation Event Detection System: Tracking And Recognition (RedStar (TM)) software detects these image artifacts. The software's data\ncapture and analysis routines feed an alert messaging engine. When the software detects radiological sources, it sends alert messages using a variety of open protocols. Under the Phase 1 project, RedStar data flexibility was upgraded and tested at Hartford Hospital.  During the week-long test, it detected the radiation source each time it was used, detected the source while it was still in its shielded container, and produced zero false alarms.",

        "abstract": "Proliferation of the weapons of mass destruction such as nuclear weapons is a serious threat in the world today.\nPreventing the spread of nuclear weapons has reached a state of heightened urgency in recent years, especially since the events on September 11, 2001 and its aftermath. One way to passively determine the presence of nuclear weapons is to detect and identify characteristic signatures of highly enriched uranium and weapons grade plutonium. Neutrons and gamma rays are two signatures of these materials. Gamma ray detection techniques are useful because the presence of gamma rays of specific energies can confirm the presence of a particular isotope.  This technique however, has one significant drawback: In the presence of dense surrounding material such as lead, gamma ray attenuation can be significant. This can mask the gamma signatures of these special nuclear materials(SNM). Neutrons, on the other hand, easily penetrate dense, high atomic number materials compared to gamma-rays.\nUnder these circumstances, passive assay techniques based on neutron detection can provide valuable information.  When detected, neutrons are direct indicator of presence of spontaneously fissioning isotopes (plutonium and californium) and induced fissions (uranium). At present, there is a real need for a compact, efficient detection system that would allow neutron detection with an ability to discriminate gamma events from neutron events. The\ngoal of the proposed effort is to address this need.",

Carbon nanotubes (CNT) have a high aspect ratio structure (they are long and narrow) that induces high electric field concentration, thus they are ideal choices for electron field emission, electron field desorption and field ionization applications. In Phase I, the ANI team demonstrated the feasibility of a field ionization CNT-based ion source for neutron generator applications. We demonstrated an ion source that can generate about 1 microamp/cm2 with variable pulse width and short pulse cut-off time (less than 4 microseconds). In addition we demonstrated neutron generation using this approach with count rates greater than 3 sigma above background levels. This Phase II program is intended to improve the ion source by achieving higher current densities (needed to make the source small to be competitive with existing COTS neutron sources), longer life and high atomic ion ratio. The program is also intended to design, build and demonstrate a neutron source with a yield of at least 107 n/sec, sufficient yield to show that this source approach can be scaled to higher yields with a design that is simple and inexpensive to manufacture.",

The task involves identifying objects in the scene, describing their inter-relations, and detecting events of interests. The project addresses this need by developing algorithms to extract syntactic, semantic and conceptual information from visual data. We adopted the modeling and conceptualization framework of stochastic attribute image grammar. In this framework, a visual vocabulary is defined from pixels, primitives, parts, objects and scenes. The image grammar provides a principled mechanism to list visual elements and objects present in the scene and describe their relations. A bottom-up top-down strategy is used for inference to provide a description of the scene and its constituent elements. A text generation system then converts the semantic information to text report. The Phase I study has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In Phase II, we plan to extend the technology to handle more complex scene and achieve the following objectives: (1) classification of more than 20 types of scene elements; (2) data fusion with data from multiple cameras and other modalities; (3) complex events detection; and (4) enhanced text report generation and forensic analysis.",

The Galvo mirror system can be triggered externally by the rocket sled as it travels down the track. This gives it an advantage over other rotating systems such as those with spinning polygonal mirrors. In addition, the number of lines exposed simultaneously can be controlled by adjusting the entrance slit, which is a necessary feature for focusing schlieren using the scanning method. In Phase 1, we developed an optical model of the system, tested the speed and linearity of Galvo motors, and built a breadboard system, which we used to capture an image of moving objects.  In Phase 2, we will seek to improve the optical model and build a full-scale prototype using commercially available lenses, sensors, and Galvo motors.

The system will keep the communication wire from fouling the submarine's propeller and control surfaces during all phases of torpedo deployment including the wire clearance maneuver, transition, steady-state tow, and postlaunch maneuvers.  NEAR will use numerical simulations and sea trial development tests to optimize both of the systems during an 18-month development program.  At the conclusion of this program, NEAR and Navy personnel will select the one design that best meets all of the operational requirements.  During the last 6 months of the contract, NEAR will refine the selected design, select a manufacturing/commercialization partner, and develop a cost model that includes development, production, and life cycle costs.

To obtain Schlieren photography with 0.05 inch spatial resolution a 3000x1 pixel array will be required. To obtain this resolution, on a Mach 10 (11,000 ft/sec) rocket sled, the exposure time must be < ~400 ns, resulting in a data acquisition rate of ~8 gigapixels per second. The program objective is to develop a Digital Schlieren Camera System to replace film-based techniques to optically record high resolution images of rocket sleds and their test articles at velocities up to 11,000 feet per second.

        "abstract": "Reduction of combustion-generated noise is one of the most significant challenges in the development of advanced gas turbine engines. Several processes contribute to the noise, but combustion instabilities pose the most serious threat to engine operation and safety. In Phase I, highly porous open-cell foam structures were employed to modify the combustor flow field and passively suppress unsteady flow fluctuations, thereby reducing noise. Use of structural foam inserts in gas turbine engines offers an effective, simple, and reliable approach for combustion control and noise reduction. Material development and component fabrication were conducted by Ultramet, and design, analysis, and component testing were performed by the University of Alabama. Two approaches were explored. In the first, the foam insert was located downstream of the reaction zone to dissipate the combustion noise and instability generated upstream. In the second, the vortex shedding mechanism of combustion instability was curtailed by placing the foam insert within the recirculation region of the reaction zone. The porous insert media were experimentally demonstrated to reduce combustion noise by up to 15 dB, depending on the operating conditions and test configuration. In Phase II, Ultramet will team with the University of Alabama and Solar Turbines (a subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc.), the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of small- and medium-sized (1 to 5 MW) industrial gas turbines, to perform comprehensive component design and material optimization, ultimately leading to performance demonstration of open-cell foam noise reduction components through hot-fire testing under realistic turbine operating conditions using gaseous methane propellant.",

As the system evolves and is maintained, the need to repeat the certification process represents a significant contributor to the life cycle cost structure.   The WW Technology Group proposes an innovative solution to these challenges called Design for Certification.  The innovation that lies at the heart of Design for Certification is a model-driven engineering approach that integrates the information and analyses required to support certification through open and flexible means.  This approach enables diverse stakeholders to effectively communicate and share information throughout the system lifecycle and provides tools that enable required analyses to be performed efficiently.    These improvements result in significant development and life cycle cost savings associated with reducing safety certification efforts and improving performance certification efforts. They also improve risk management by identifying and tracking issues as early as possible and improve overall system quality.",

Phase II of this proposal is for qualification of battery separators for the military BA-5590 batteries.

Furthermore, this novel semiconductor scintillator also has a high gamma-ray absorption, fast decay without afterglow, emission in the wavelength range most suitable for readout sensors, and orders of magnitude higher radiation resistance, than current scintillators.

During Phase II, the unique IFOS team of experts will develop and test a robust, ultra-high-speed, low-cost, real-time remote monitoring system for concrete based on embedded optical FBG sensor networks.  The system will make use of multiple color-coded FBG sensors can be cascaded in a single fiber to form a natural \u201cself-contained\u201d sensor network, providing synchronized and correlated sensing. The sensors will make precise measurements of sequence of impact and timing of penetration, while smart algorithms make correction and determining given penetration depths for varying structure densities according to real-time data.  This system developed in Phase II will be validated during live-fire tests on 10\u2019x10\u2019x6\u2019 concrete targets with 0.3 scale BLU-109 penetrators.  The proposed system will provide significant cost-savings over current techniques, while improving measurement accuracy.",

Michigan Aerospace Corporation, in collaboration with Professor James Ryan and his group at University of New Hampshire (UNH), proposes to develop a compact, lightweight neutron spectroscopy (NSPECT) instrument based on the completed NSPECT Phase I SBIR.  During Phase I, modeling, design and tests demonstrated the feasibility of developing a portable and field-ready fast neutron imaging spectroscope that detects neutrons from < 1 to 10 MeV, weighs less than 30 lbs and can operate on battery power for more than 8 hours. The spectroscope can operate as a stand-alone instrument for passive interrogation or with a neutron source for active interrogation. An instrument prototype will be fabricated, assembled and tested during the Phase II effort, during which all issues inherent to the instrument will be addressed and resolved, paving the way for the completion of a fieldable product during the commercialization phase of the project.",

USVs are less vulnerable operating on the water's surface than unmanned aerial and submersible vehicles in their respective areas. Unmanned systems are increasingly being used to provide persistent littoral surveillance for a broad range of missions, including reconnaissance, force protection, mine detection, special operations, antisubmarine warfare (ASW), and intelligence collection. The ability for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) to autonomously operate in a collaborative manner will significantly enhance mission capabilities. During Phase II, Robotic Research, LLC in partnership with General Dynamics Robotic Systems (GDRS), will develop the Multi-vehicle Planning and Coordination (MPAC) system.  MPAC is a multi-vehicle control architecture that reduces the burden on the unmanned system operators while increasing both the effectiveness and efficiency of unmanned systems.

The human operators provide innate pattern recognition skills, guiding the system in acquiring dismounts, and directing the system on saliency of its target fingerprint features.The operator, viewing stabilized sensor streams,  exercises command and control through a touchscreen data table. SET\u2019s unique, patented target fingerprinting techniques include the Double Helical Signature gait analysis, providing a capability to recognize distinguishing features such as gait frequency, stride length, and object-carrying activity. The techniques also employ pose-robust appearance recognition, based upon shape matching and geometric transform to aid in recognizing and tracking pedestrians as they maneuver and change their relative pose.  Our systems approach leverages SET\u2019s expertise in dynamic sensor management and robust-performance dismount and vehicle tracking algorithms, in combination with extensive guidance, navigation, control and simulation capabilities of our partner, Brigham Young University (BYU).

The aim of this effort to develop, test, demonstrate and deploy a working encoding/decoding system that facilitates the generation and subsequent real time consumption of highly-compressed and accurate terrain data.  A prime focus of the development is to generate DEM representations that can be used within a wide array of industry standard GIS software.

For example, processing of LiDAR data to produce DEM files is inherently lossy.  The prototype developed will comprise an end-to-end solution by which input data (such as LiDAR) may be directly processed and compressed, leading to more compact and accurate representations.

VID includes attribute measurements provided by some sensors in air defense that could improve the credibility of combat identification especially in the absence of IFF.  Examples of attribute data include ESM and RWR observations.  Alternatively, VID could be 2-D kinematic measurements provided by a sensor with a very slow target revisit rate.  The time between arrivals of VID from a sensor might be fractions of an hour rather than a typical sensor that is factions of a minute.  Processing VID would be simple and easy to design in the absence of close targets, false signals, and target maneuvers.  Traditional processing would lead to misassociations of VID that would substantially degrade performance of fusion track and classification processing.  Even advanced fusion processors as currently designed, such as multiple hypothesis trackers, would be too computation intensive if adjusted to accommodate the target revisit rate of VID.",

The software will overcome those weaknesses typically found in the use of agent based modeling technology including the difficulty in solving the model for optimality. The OptAgent software will function in three stages.  In the first stage a diverse set of solutions will be created and a Markov blanket-based feature selection methodology will identify the most influential variables.  In the second stage the agent-based model optimization search process will be performed.  This process will be enhanced by classification and discrimination rules developed from the initial solution set using satisfiability data mining.  In the final stage the best combination of agent and environment parameters will be presented along with statistics providing insights into the behavior of the model across the myriad possible combinations of inputs.",

Orbital Research Inc, in collaboration with the University of Toledo, proposes to continue the development of an innovative Actuator Integrated Missile Steering System (AIMSS) for aerodynamic control of subsonic-to-hypersonic cruise missiles using active flow control and micro-actuator technologies. The AIMSS will utilize small, deployable and/or activatable devices with innovative flow control techniques to provide controls for missile maneuvering and trimming. The main objectives of the proposed system are to: (a) provide and maintain sustainable control authority over a wide range of flow speeds from subsonic to supersonic flows (Mach 0.1 to 4), (b) reduce the design complexity, weight, drag, cost and power requirements of the conventional control actuation subsystems through efficient employment of microactuators and advanced control approaches, and (c) reduce or eliminate the need for movable fins or wings on supersonic cruise missiles which will also allow the system to be integrated into and launched from various platforms. Other potential benefits of the AIMSS include increased range, payload capacity, aero-structural efficiency and endgame maneuvering.",

In Phase II, POC will develop a compact handheld version of MPLaWS with ruggedized packaging that includes an air filter to filter the fumes emitted from the stripping process.  This prototype will meet the NAVAIR safety requirements for operation on the flight line, including fueled aircraft and electromagnetically controlled environments, and will be sized for on-aircraft operation.

To develop a robust, high power, and broad bandwidth d36 shear mode projector array and bring it to a usable stage, we propose the following tasks for the phase II project: 1) Measure and establish full set material properties for selected crystals. Accurate material properties are critical to transducer design and optimization because inaccuracy in material property directly affect the outcomes of transducer modeling; 2) Refine the d36 transducer design and optimize transducer performance characteristics based on the measured property values; 3) Validate transducer design with in situ transducer tests.

We propose a budget of $749,763 to carry out the proposed works in a period of 24 months.

They are a mechanically robust material\u2014100 times stronger than high-strength steel and six times lighter. Carbon nanotubes can stretch beyond 20% of their resting length without damaging their structure or conductivity. Carbon nanotubes have extremely high aspect ratios (length/diameter), and thus form conductive percolation networks through materials more easily than other conductive fillers such as carbon fiber or carbon black. Because they form conductive composites at such low loading ratios, carbon nanotubes could be a key component in EMI shielding. However, current manufacturing process for carbon nanotube EMI shielding is expensive, scales poorly, and makes use of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These limitations are a related to the process for dispersing the carbon nanotubes in the polymers. A rapid expansion of supercritical solutions (RESS) process for dispersing carbon nanotubes in polymers has the potential to overcome these limitations. Under this Phase II SBIR effort, Minnesota Defense, Arizona State University, and Lockheed Martin propose to develop a robust method of dispersing carbon nanotubes in polymer composite shielding/coating material processed via rapid expansion from supercritical fluid solution (RESS).",

        "abstract": "A prototype adaptive flight control concept was developed in Phase I which better compensates for dis-turbances on the rotorcraft due to ship airwake effects and the moving ship deck during helicopter or tiltrotor shipboard operations.  It is proposed to further mature the algorithms associated with this control approach in a limited-scope Phase II program.  A parameter identification algorithm and an on-line learning approach will be further matured to deliver in-flight estimates of important effects of the ship airwake and ship motion.  The system identifies both the statistical properties of the apparently random characteristics of the airwake as well as the repeatable and deterministic disturbances of the airwake due to the ship\u2019s geometry and motion.  The Phase I flight controller was designed to use the information from the on-line identification/learning algorithms to improve disturbance rejection properties of the aircraft.  The system provides enhanced feedback compensation to improve rejection of disturbances due to random airwake forces impinging on the vehicle, and feed-forward compensation to help compensate for deterministic airwake disturbances.  We will focus application on a tilt-rotor UAV model.  However, the flight controller could also be applied to manned rotorcraft.",

However, WR systems typically utilize a condenser, which cannot condense sufficient water at ambient temperatures >~40C.  Hence in real-world scenarios, water must carried with the fuel adding weight and reducing the energy density advantage promised by fuel cells.  UltraCell has developed a design for a novel, ultra compact, water recovery (WR) system for man portable fuel cells, which can operate at high >55C ambient temperatures (WR-HAT), withstand below freezing storage and which is orientation independent.  This WR system will be first integrated into UltraCell's GEN II, 20W Reformed Methanol Fuel Cell (RMFC) , and will result in a 3-day energy density of ~800 Whr/Kg, and provide a >30% improvement when compared to the GEN II system without WR.  The WR system can also be applied to UltraCell's proven, TRL-7, Mil Spec tested, XX25 man portable to increase its energy density from ~360Whr/Kg to ~485Whr/Kg.   The WR-HAT is lightweight so that the GEN-RW will have high energy density even for short missions (~150 & ~280 Whr/Kg for 6 or 12-hr missions.)",

        "abstract": "U.S. Army helicopter fatigue sensitive dynamic components are required to maintain structural integrity throughout their operational life cycle.  Typical metal alloy fatigue sensitive dynamic components require the presence of surface compressive residual stresses to inhibit the initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks.  However, some of these components are susceptible to localized mechanical and corrosion surface damage that must be removed by blending.  The surface blending process results in the requirement to reintroduce compressive residual stresses, normally by shot peening.  The shot peening operation is currently performed at military depots and commercial facilities using non-portable peening equipment.  Army Aviation has the potential for increasing reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM), while reducing Operation & Support (O&S) cost by deploying a portable capability to reliably restore the structural integrity of fatigue sensitive dynamic components that have experienced usage related surface defects.  Avion (Prime) and Sonats (Sub) have teamed to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a portable, field-deployable Stressonic\u00ae shot peening capability that reliably reintroduces compressive residual stresses in Army helicopter fatigue sensitive dynamic components that have had localized surface damage blended out.",

The transducer should have a high coupling coefficient and power factor allowing a small power amplifier.

Wide band results are obtained through this unique transducer design which provides motion over a uniform radiating area driven from lever coupled dual cantilever drivers yielding both a low resonance frequency and a mechanical Q.

This device is purely mechanical without any smart electronic indicators, ability to provide information about the fluid condition and temperature, data storage capability, or intelligent prognostics. The current indicator is not reliable since it is sensitive to vibrations, which may cause it to issue premature or no alarm signals. In turn, these inaccurate alarms may result in either premature or overdue fluid replacement. The military wastes time and money by unnecessarily replacing fluids when an alarm sounds prematurely, or by replacing damaged critical components due to a high fluid contamination level when the alarm does not sound at all. MultiSENS provides the Army with an automated and smart solution to enable specific maintenance for each aircraft to be completed based on fluid and filter states.

Rotor induced vibrations contribute significantly to airframe fatigue, electronic component failure, and pilot workload. In current generation rotorcraft, vibration attenuation is achieved through either airframe mounted tuned-absorbers or active vibration control (AVC) systems. Typical AVC systems use a number of narrow band force generators to reduce accelerations measured at multiple locations in aircraft fuselage. Although current AVC systems are effective at reducing vibration in steady flight, advanced control algorithms are needed to achieve similar results for transient maneuvers. To address deficiencies of current AVC algorithms, Materials Technologies Corp. has formed an exceptionally talented team with experience in rotorcraft modeling, modern control algorithm development, and AVC system development. During the Phase-I effort this team developed state-of-the-art time domain control technologies that addressed known deficiencies in production control algorithms and demonstrated the performance using a high fidelity fuselage model developed in coordination with Sikorsky Aircraft. Lessons learned in Phase I will be leveraged in Phase II to further refine and optimize these control algorithms.

Next-generation intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) ladar systems will tackle the difficult problem of detecting, identifying and imaging targets at great range. Ladar based ISR systems may also serve a critical role in detecting underground facilities by sensing chemical and biological effluents or performing battle damage assessment by sensing changes in the target signature (before and after strike) or by measuring a target\u2019s vibration (i.e. engine on or off). Future missile defense systems, such as the Airborne Laser (ABL) or next-generation Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicles (EKV), will rely on very long range ladar sensors to detect and track targets and discriminate targets from decoys. All of these applications require advances in the ladar technology to improve performance, reliability, cost, size, weight and power. In this program, Aret\u00e9 Associates will develop an adaptive multi-waveform ladar approach based on our proprietary high time-bandwidth product unambiguous ladar waveforms. The effort will specifically focus on the refining the waveform to include an interrogation component and features that will allow adaptive waveform operation for closed-loop target detection augmentation.",

        "abstract": "The atomization of liquid fuels is a key process in gas turbine engines and augmentors, directly influencing combustion and thus engine performance. While adequate models exist for the secondary atomization, the crucial initial breakup is not well understood and predictive numerical simulation tools to analyze the process in detail do not exist. In this project, we propose to apply the recently developed Refined Level Set Grid (RLSG) to the primary atomization problem. This method, in a detached code, resolves and tracks all relevant phase interface length scales on a separate, locally refined grid. The RLSG code is coupled to the flow solver via a multi-code coupling environment, thereby ensuring easy portability and expandability. The resulting software package has been successfully applied to several two-phase flow benchmarks. In the project\u2019s initial phase, we have accessed the capability of the proposed software framework to predict the atomization of liquid jets in cross-flow under conditions relevant to gas turbines. In the next phase, the capability will be enhanced to include more complicated atomizer geometries as well as evaporation and phase change relevant to operating conditions of augmentors  In conjunction with leading military engine manufacture, and by using relevant   experimental data in the near- and far-field, the codes and the methodology will be validated. Another possible outcome of the proposed work is derivation of appropriate sub-grid models in the context of  Large Eddy Simulation of  primary atomization.",

        "abstract": "Affective environments may be developed using VE technology to further enhance learning and training transfer to real-world tasks. However, training in such environments has shown limited transfer effects for emotionally-charged tasks, which may be due to inadequate representation of the appropriate affective environment. Thus, there is a need to determine how multisensory information can be used to create stress and invoke affective responses similar to responses experienced in live operations.  The Affective Virtual Environment Training System (A-VETS) proposed software tool addresses this identified opportunity by guiding system designers and trainers through the process of adding negative affective components to VE training systems to enhance trainee performance, decrease training time and enhance training transfer of cognitive and psychomotor learning objectives. A complimentary effort proposed by VRSonic will develop the Real-time Affective Detection Induction System (RADIS). A-VETS will provide affect scenario design, including upfront scenario settings and a matrix for real-time adaptation based on emotion state and performance to RADIS, which will interact directly with the VE training system to capture emotional state of teams of up to 4 trainees affect during training. Captured emotional state will be compared to expected state, and RADIS will respond to mismatches in states by adjusting affective parameters for individual team members as guided by A-VETS training strategy matrix.",

        "abstract": "Helicopter blade systems are constructed to tight tolerances, but slight manufacturing variations cause lift to vary from blade to blade at certain specific flight conditions.  The resulting unbalanced lift forces cause undesirable 1/rev vibration.  The current practice calls for adjustments to be made by ground crew maintenance personnel; pitch control rod, aluminum trim tabs, and rotor head mass balancing.  The track and balance adjustments are costly in terms of labor and fuel costs because of the flight time needed to verify that the adjustments were made correctly.  Under this Phase I SBIR funding from the US Army, Mid\u00e9 developed systems to make these adjustments automatically.  Specifically, systems to change the length of the pitch rod and to adjust the rotor mass balance by translating a mass were demonstrated to be feasible.  The ultimate capability of in-flight adjustments can be achieved by basing the feedback on information from a HUMS system.  In Phase II, the system will be designed to minimize the impact of the added mass on the rotor hub and provide a valuable capability that is not currently available.  Automating these adjustments eliminates significant downtime of the helicopter, saving a considerable amount of money for all helicopter operators.",

Furthermore, the backlighting produced is \u201csmart\u201d in that the brightness produced by the LEDs is precisely modulated by electronic control. The project\u2019s device consists of two parts: the front plane containing the photonics, the LEDs that illuminate the LCD; and the back plane containing the electronics, the circuitry that controls the front plane. The picture signal that creates the LCD imagery is also read by the backplane electronics, enabling it to control the backlighting so the brightness is synchronously compatible with the imagery being displayed. In the LED front plane, electricity is efficiently converted into visible light. In the back plane, the high switching speed of electronics tightly control front plane pixels. \u201cSmart\u201d backlighting means advanced technology that enhances performance and significantly improves image sharpness. Clear pictures with high contrast are produced. The proposed device fits snugly in back of the LCDs. Power requirements are lower than currently available products, and less heat is produced.",

        "abstract": "Identification and Significance of the Problem  In the last 20 years, the use of personal, wireless communications devices by society has exploded. Nearly every adult (and many children) in developed and developing countries carries at least one communications device usually in the form of a mobile phone. In addition to mobile phones, a host of other wireless technologies such as Bluetooth, FRS/GMRS radios, and Wi-Fi have widespread deployment such that the world population has multiple paths to achieving a nearly constant wireless connection for voice and data traffic. Besides the ability to provide voice and data connectivity, many mobile phones have digital camera functions. This universal connectivity and photographic capability poses a significant challenge to the task of providing both information and physical security within sensitive facilities. At risk facilities include military installations, prisons, national intelligence centers, government and corporate research facilities, and places where confidential business meetings occur. Whether intentional or unintentional, malicious or benign in nature, the act of personnel bringing wireless devices into a secure area represents a potential breach of security. Depending on the facility, this breach could result in loss of national security information or the conduction of criminal activity. Current security measures to address this issue rely primarily on posted signs and personnel queries to control the entry of RF communications devices into a secure area. These measures do not provide an active deterrence capability, thus limiting their effectiveness. Development of an Active, RF Transceiver Detection System The ability to rapidly and unobtrusively scan individuals entering a facility or moving through a constrained area (hallway, doorway, etc.) to determine if they possess a wireless device would be a valuable tool for security personnel. In the proposed effort, Vadum will develop a prototype active RF transceiver detection system based on an existing internal program in addition to the results obtained from the ongoing Phase I activities. The key goal of Phase I was improving the transceiver sensing function through hardware architecture choices. Additional benefits to be gained through signal processing can only be achieved after maximizing the performance of the hardware component of the proposed detection technique.  The objectives of the proposed program focus on the implementation and test of the prototype system architecture developed during Phase I. Tests of the prototype system will utilize representative RF targets including mobile phones and two-way radios under realistic scenarios for personnel transiting through a walk-through portal form-factor implementation. An important element of the proposed program will consist of a brief target characterization study to enable the estimation of statistics of target responses to the active detection technique employed. This study will aid the refinement and optimization of the prototype design to meet the objectives of a low-cost, human-safe system that has a development path from fixed stand-alone portal, to unobtrusive emplacement, to a man-portable unit for mobile detection applications. The Phase II effort will leverage Vadum\u2019s experience in developing the active detection technique and the initial pre-production mobile phone detection prototype developed prior to the Phase I program. Vadum rapid electronics prototyping and electronic test equipment resources will be employed to realize the prototype implementation and validate successful construction. The detection prototype application testing and mobile phone characterization efforts will utilize Vadum\u2019s large inventory of mobile phone and personal wireless communications devices to thoroughly map the target response space and prototype performance for the selected architecture and detection technique embodiment. The test and characterization activities will reduce the risk of developing a successful detection system that can transition readily to government and commercial applications.",

Demonstration of the wake modeling methodology has been performed, and continuing development during Phase II will lead to an advanced real-time rotorcraft induced velocity module, including full and partial ground effect models for moving ground planes (ship decks) and coupled rotorcraft/ship airwake models, suitable for generic flight simulation architectures.  Software modules will be developed for integration and demonstration in a U.S. Navy flight simulation (CASTLE-based) environment.",

This Micro-Furnace combustor will be the core of the flameless personal water heater.  This combustor is fast-starting and delivers its heat via radiation and convection.  The Micro-Furnace will be used to heat cup-sized portions of water.  The system will prevent JP-8 contamination of the water yet provide intimate contact between heated surfaces and the water to be heated.  In addition, this system will incorporate a small power converter between the Micro-Furnace and the water to make it self-powered after a short start-up time allowing the personal water heater to be used repeatedly without external power and requiring only fuel to continue operating reliably.",

Improvements in erosion resistance (e.g., cavitation, rain, and sand), impact durability and high-cycle fatigue are of particular interest.  During Phase I, Composite Technology Development (CTD) pursued a multidisciplinary approach to develop and qualify new classes of composite materials for propulsor blades which possess significant erosion resistant and impact durable characteristics.  Under the proposed Phase II program, CTD will expand on the Phase I results to develop, demonstrate and qualify composite materials for propulsor blade applications.  Extensive static and dynamic material testing will be performed in combination with cavitation testing to establish greater insight into the cavitation erosion, high-rate impact and high-cycle fatigue behavior of composite materials.  Furthermore, these efforts will used to guide the development efforts toward composite materials meeting the requirements of propulsor blades.  The latter stages of the proposed Phase II program will focus on development and manufacture of composite propulsor blade breadboard models.  Evaluation of this breadboard model in a relevant environment showcasing technology capability is envisioned as the program\u2019s capstone effort.",

For high-speed forward flight, about 3% power-saving using trailing-edge deflection and about 3% improvement in the rotor lift-to-drag ratio using active twist was demonstrated. For the high-thrust case, about 7% power-saving was obtained using leading-edge nose droop on the retreating side. A novel, comprehensive analysis approach using full CFD has been developed and shown to work efficiently in modeling morphing rotor dynamics. In the proposed Phase-II study we seek to complete this investigation, leading to a full rounded understanding of morphing rotorcraft design. We will address a broader set of flight conditions and morphing concepts. Full CFD-CSD analyses will be supplemented with industry standard comprehensive analyses coupled with acoustics, vibrations and aero-elastic effects thus accentuating the impact of this work.

Two different modalities have been developed to obtain the color information.  One mode uses a knowledge based material identification algorithm adapted specifically for night vision imagery, and the other uses color values obtained from a true-color night vision camera.  In addition to color values, in both cases, the images from the multiple cameras must be fused together in an optimal manner to provide brightness detail that improves scene understanding and object identification.

        "abstract": "As technology feature sizes decrease, single event upset (SEU), digital single event transient (DSET), and multiple bit upset (MBU) effects dominate the radiation response of microcircuits.  Recent test circuits and test methods have quantified the pulse widths of DSETs generated from heavy-ion strikes on critical microcircuit nodes.  These pulse widths have proven to be much larger than previously thought, which substantiates the importance of DSET induced errors to the soft error rate (SER) of modern microcircuits.  In Phase II, we will extend our Phase I single event effect (SEE) circuit modeling approaches which couple the circuit response to the charge collection mechanisms.  This new work will incorporate second order recombination and diffusion effects and enable efficient and cost effective SEE simulation of advanced microcircuits.  New test structures and test circuits will be designed, fabricated, and characterized in order to evaluate emerging SEE mitigation approaches based on process modifications, design hardening techniques, and substrate engineering approaches.",

        "abstract": "Next generation liquid rocket systems envision novel designs for turbopumps that can operate at high suction speeds (i.e. low inlet pressures), and can be throttled over a wide range of low, off-design flow conditions.  This is an extremely demanding flow regime where performance loss and damage from cavitation instabilities can be catastrophic since they can generate large amplitude pressure fluctuations.  However, the ability of current analytical or CFD tools to reliably predict unsteady cavitation dynamics is not mature particularly for cryogens where temperature fluctuations can couple with the pressure variations.  The innovation proposed here is to extend current computational capabilities to analyze mean solutions and head drop-off, to an unsteady framework that can predict amplitudes and frequencies of dynamic pressure loads within a cryogenic fluid environment with temperature fluctuations.  A key aspect of this proposal is an extensive test program that will be conducted in the Phase II effort to provide dynamic load magnitudes in a regime where thermal effects are important.  Hence, the resulting product will be a well-validated and reliable analysis tool, CRUNCH CFD\u00ae, that can be used to predict unsteady, off-design performance of liquid rocket turbopumps.",

The accurate prediction of cryogenic propellant cavitation offers a significant opportunity for improvements in turbopump performance and reliability. Cryogenic propellant turbopumps are typically limited in performance capability and design life due to an inability to accurately model and predict cavitation. With a renewed interest in smaller turbopumps for upper stage engines a better understanding of propellant cavitation is needed to optimize turbopump performance, weight and reliability. Phase I of this SBIR has identified and demonstrated methodologies for detailed cryogenic propellant cavitation testing and designed a cavitation test rig for water and cryogens.  Phase II will include fabrication of the test rig and a test program that will acquire benchmark quality cavitation data for water and an LH2 surrogate fluid. The data will then be used to implement cavitation model improvements in several CFD and Pump Design Codes.",

In Phase I of the program, a conceptual design of the PFOG was developed and its feasibility affirmed.  The PFOG under development is a closed loop gyro.  The key feature of the design is a functionally isolated multi-integrated optics chip (MIOC) mounted on a silicon substrate providing the electronics. The design incorporates a high degree of operational symmetry -- in optical, mechanical and electronic areas.  The gyro operation at the highest point of sensitivity is ensured via a differential bias phase modulator (DBPM). For the closed-loop operation, a digitally synthesized phase ramp generator nulls the rotation rate induced Sagnac phase shift via a differential Sagnac phase modulator (DSPM).  Six different methods of phase modulation for DBPM and DSPM were analyzed and the optimal one was selected for first fab iteration of the MIOC.  The selected design yields four MIOC devices per 76mm LiNbO3 wafer.  In Phase II, the PFOG prototype will be built to size using component design finalized during Phase I analysis and trade-off studies.  It will be made up of a fiber spool and an electro-optics hybrid package. The hybrid package will consist of a LiNbO3 MIOC and a silicon substrate.  Upon completing the development, a PFOG prototype unit will be built, tested, and delivered to AFRL at WPAFB for further evaluation.",

Grit blasting of Navy ships, a routine surface preparation methodology, is expensive and generates a large amount of hazardous waste. Alternative surface preparation techniques that can provide excellent adhesion to corrosion resistant coatings applied over metallic surfaces are needed.  In the Phase I program, aluminum alloy and mild steel panels were treated with a thin nanocomposite non-chromate pretreatment as a feasible alternative to abrasion (or grit) blasting. Corrosion test results and preliminarily cost analysis indicated that nanocomposite pretreatment is a viable solution as a replacement for grit blasting. In Phase II, technical challenges in implementing the nanocomposite pretreatment technology on a large scale will be addressed.  Optimization of the pretreatment chemistry will also be conducted in the Phase II program along with a detailed analysis of the corrosion performance on both mild steel and aluminum alloy surfaces.  The Phase II program will lay the foundation for a commercialization effort where we will initiate large scale production of the pretreatment to cater to the needs of the Navy and other industrial applications.",

Code     Hawk uses the mathematical technique of abstract interpretation to     accurately determine potential variable values (including pointers).  Code     Hawk uses state of the art algorithms, customizability, and careful     engineering to achieve analysis effiency and precision.  Code Hawk has     been used to perform sophisticated analysis of deployed open source code.   - The tool will be integrated into the Eclipse platform.  Eclipse is a     widely used open development platform comprised of extensible frameworks,     tools, and runtimes for building, deploying, and managing software across     the lifecycle.  It includes components for developing software in various     languages, and incorporates a framework for testing.   - The tool will support lightweight verification, testing, and program     understanding activities and will be based on a testing metaphor.  Users     will be able to specify input conditions (values, value ranges,     initialization code, and usage scenarios) and expected outputs.  In     addition, the tool will make available the results of analysis in a form     that will facilitate reasoning about the analyzed code.  There will be no     a priori constraints on which inputs or outputs may be specified.  There     will be no a priori constraints on the granularity of analysis (it     may operate at the unit, subsystem, or whole program level). This tool will serve a number of constituencies.

McQ has defined a system development approach for a Phase II program that will develop prototype room dimensioning nodes, anchor nodes, and handheld displays based on the results of the Phase I research.  McQ has over 10 years experience with the design and development of advanced unattended ground sensors (UGS) systems and associated algorithm development and simulation.  During Phase II we will develop the hardware and software required to ultrasonically characterize a building with the added benefit of friendly personnel and UMS identification and tracking.  Prototypes will be tested in real world scenarios to assess the capabilities of the system.  A Production Readiness Review will be presented upon completion of the project.",

The heater will react air and JP-8 in an enclosed flow path and transfer the heat generated to water.  The device will be packaged into an immersion-style heater. The heater will come with a matching cup, but it will fit any generic insulated cup. The key innovations required for the development of the heater are in the areas of catalysis, fuel addition, and mixing. Use of a highly active, stable catalyst will allow clean operation at conditions that favor high efficiency. The method of fuel addition does not require high fuel pressure or exotic hardware. The design results in full combustion with clean exhaust. The final packaged device will incorporate features that allow the theater to be used safely, effectively, and easily. It will be suitable for use indoors with no health hazards or irritants produced.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an innovative high speed metallic  interconnects technology for chip-to-chip interconnects utilizing standard material (e.g. FR4). With the continued growth in the integration density of CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) and clock frequency of microprocessors (on-chip), the aggregate bandwidth required between future-generation microprocessors and chipsets will increase sharply. Driving serial or parallel data at high speed over copper on FR4 based printed-circuit boards (PCBs) (off-chip) is becoming a severe design constraint and must be overcome to fully utilize the chip performance and significantly enhance the system-performance. The proposed electrical interconnects technology can be implemented into standard FR4-PCB, thereby utilizing standard manufacturing processes, and could increase the signal carrying capacity over 20 Gb/s, more than 5 times that of standard interconnects technology. Implementing the proposed metallic interconnect technology will eliminate the need to use non-standard material(s) in PCB or active components  inside integrated circuits (IC) to obtain similar results, which will in turn decrease the complexity, cost, and total power-budget of the system. The purpose of this project is to develop high speed metallic interconnects by using standard-PCB friendly to manufacturing processes, which can be utilized as a common platform technology for a wide range of electronic applications and can extend the usage life-cycle of standard FR4 material and standard manufacturing processes for the next 20 years.   The proposed high speed metallic interconnects will have enormous advantages for various next generation applications, including high speed PCs, servers, networking systems, gaming machines, communication systems, imaging and video systems, etc. The U.S. faces an unknown set of challenges in the area of high speed interconnects (PCB). Most board-level and related product-oriented work is being shifted offshore; therefore, no development efforts are being undertaken in U.S. industries. The U.S. share of the $45 billion world market dropped from 62 to 8 percent in the last 10 years. This project will develop the electrical interconnects on FR4-based printed circuit board (PCB) to drive the signal more than 10 Gb/s per channel, which will have profound influence on the competitiveness of U.S. industry. The development of the proposed interconnect technology will enable a large number of end users to take advantage of economies of scale by inexpensively manufacturing this high speed board and to leverage development costs to create the general software, analysis, and information technology infrastructure that will make such systems powerful, inexpensive, and deployable in huge numbers. Banpil\u2019s goal is to create and develop high speed metallic interconnect technology for such a platform. This project will enable the development of this proposed high speed electrical interconnect solution in FR4 based PCB to meet industry needs in a timely manner. Banpil has the opportunity to lead the industry in development work through Phase II project and create global leaders in the area of high speed electrical interconnects.",

HUNTED gives small units direct control over a coordinated team of two or more unmanned systems (UMS) to perform superior search, detection, and tracking of elusive pedestrian targets in an urban environment. Our novel approach combines 3D environment knowledge with a unique non-linear target behavior prediction method. HUNTED applies the game theory tenant that the target\u2019s behavior can be actively shaped by the pursuer\u2019s behavior, and provides a novel solution to the problem that achieves superior operational performance with lower operator workload. Using our approach, HUNTED proactively places collaborating UMSs to cover each other\u2019s blind spots, cooperatively hunt a target instead of merely tracking it, and corral and drive the target towards a desired location. This enables teams of UMSs to succeed in tracking tasks at which a single UMS would fail. By doing so, HUNTED will surpass the operational performance of today\u2019s approaches to tracking elusive pedestrian targets in urban areas.  HUNTED Phase 2 culminates in a staged field demonstration where ACR Silver Fox\u2122 UAVs fly HUNTED-computed goals and flight paths to demonstrate a superior ability to maintain eyes on target.",

In order to provide a correct solution, a TA/FC system needs accurate range information to their target. This information is provided by a laser range finder (LRF), but it is up to the soldier to accurately aim the laser range finder. The current problem is that threat targets are moving and seek cover behind objects (in defilade). Moreover, sixty percent of the aiming involves a soldier standing in an unsupported firing position. These conditions make it extremely difficult for a soldier to obtain an accurate range to a target.  The purpose of this proposed project is to develop a TA/FC system platform with an integrated auto-tracking steerable range finder. Two main areas of development will be the focus of our efforts: to upgrade the hardware performance and to improve the target detection and tracking performance. In addition, a key objective of the proposed project is to endow the proposed TA/FC system with the capability to interface with the CDAS network.

MET Tech, Inc (www.mettechnology.com) has recently developed novel angular acceleration sensors that promise to fulfill all the requirements for guidance of such munitions: high accuracy, small size and weight, low power consumption, and high sensitivity; and, because they have no proof mass or moving parts, MET Tech sensors are able to withstand extremely high forces such as those experienced during gun firing, without any degradation of operability.

In the proposed program, nLIGHT will continue the development of high power, single-lateral-mode tapered diode lasers.  nLIGHT has identified fundamental limitations to the operation of tapered diode lasers and proposes novel design and fabrication process improvements which directly address these limitations.  Prof. Eric Johnson at the University of North Carolina \u2013 Charlotte (UNCC) made significant progress towards the development of the MOPA phase-locked array in Phase 1.  Using tilted gratings to couple laser emission out-of-plane while simultaneously providing single-mode laser operation, UNCC demonstrated coherent emission from multiple surface-emitting out-couplers in the master oscillator design.  This collaboration will be continued, and proof-of-concept phase locking of multiple tapered power amplifiers will be demonstrated by Prof. Johnson\u2019s group.  nLIGHT also believes the development of high-power, single-transverse-mode tapered diode lasers will enable a new generation of high brightness pump sources for a variety of applications, such as pumping kilowatt-level single-mode fiber lasers.  Therefore, leveraging the results of the development proposed herein, nLIGHT will deliver to DARPA a prototype wavelength-stabilized pump module operating at 976 nm, capable of delivering 50 W in a 100-micron-core fiber.",

This will be coupled to a carbon nanotube-based, electrochemical sensor featuring high sensitivity and specificity along with easy integration and read-out for field deployment purposes. In Phase I, using multi-physics simulations, preliminary concepts for DNA separation and concentration using nanofluidic channels were developed. Designs were fabricated using volume-production friendly standard lithography techniques. Electrokinetic sample injection and separation in these nanochannels was successfully demonstrated. During Phase II, the nanofluidic pre-concentration and separation components will be further developed and tested with a variety of genomic samples. In parallel, we will also develop and characterize a label-free, highly sensitive electrochemical DNA sensor employing a nanocomposite layer of conductive polymers and carbon nano-tubes. The preparation and sensing components will subsequently be integrated, ultimately leading to a compact and portable, nanofluidic-based biological threat agent detector that will consume little power, be ruggedly constructed, use small sample volumes, and be UAV-mountable.

Phase 2 efforts will build out the full VRAI processing chain.  We will test and verify performance against realistic bistatic visible and IR field video, which we will collect.  To insure Phase 3 transition, we will organize and engage a User Working Group, garnering feedback from testing with interactive VRAI demonstrations.

        "abstract": "Defense acquisition programs have difficulty estimating manufacturing costs during development.   This is particularly acute for MDA because their systems use leading edge technologies that push the envelope for performance reasons.   In addition, MDA is developing new technologies for spiral upgrades, so the total lifecycle cost for the portfolio of systems must be managed, along with the cost of engineering changes.    The cost modeling software integrated with the other business and engineering tools developed under this program will increase the ease of use and speed of estimation, which will allow a wider range of trade-offs to be performed and increase accuracy.   Using the interoperability standards and enterprise mash-up technology CostVision is developing along with its partners will lower the total cost of software deployment and maintenance, and ensure that the software will be adaptable to multiple contractors\u2019 legacy and future software infrastructure investments.     At the end of Phase II, CostVision will demonstrate at leading MDA manufacturers a prototype cost modeling framework that integrates with the engineering and business software infrastructure, such as manufacturing planning and cost estimating applications.

This algorithm schedules multiple diverse and distributed sensors to perform time-critical tasks relating to multiple moving targets; specifically, to detect, classify, localize, track, support the interception of, and conduct BDA for ballistic missiles throughout their trajectories.   Our technique generalizes Brown\u2019s algorithm, which allocates search effort in order to maximize the probability of task success.  The first iteration uses a myopic approach to optimally schedule the sensors at each successive time step; subsequent iterations incorporate both future and past information to account for long-term conditions.  Each target is modeled by a collection of \u201csub-targets\u201d (or \u201cparticles\u201d), which represent potential target paths.  During Phase I, we developed the algorithm\u2019s operating framework, including models for Phased Array Radar and Infrared-like sensor classes.  Then, our Matlab demonstration verified algorithm computational tractability and showed that the long-term schedules utilize sensor resources more efficiently, even given the short timeframes involved.

Installation and calibration must be tailored to each airframe, and airframe modifications may require recalibration of the air data system. This can be costly and time consuming. At high angles of attack the air data is significantly degraded. Rotorcrafts are particularly susceptible to the degradation in capability below 40 knots due to sensitivity issues and the effect of rotor downwash. All of these faults become highly evident during low speed maneuvers, automatic flight control support and weapons delivery. Michigan Aerospace Corporation proposes to determine and demonstrate the performance of a Rotorcraft Optical Air Data System (ROADS) capable of three-axis airspeed measurements at speeds below and above 40 knots. The system will be capable of measurements in longitudinal, vertical and lateral flight with no degradation. The measurement region will be outside of the rotor down wash, minimizing the effect of the downwash on the wind speed measurement. In addition, the proposed system can be produced at a much lower cost than even five years ago due to significant advances at Michigan Aerospace and its laser and detector vendors.",

Background is remapped to provide enhanced context for verification. Modular development implemented on a COTS PC platform provides for a man-portable system that is interoperable with a variety of UAV and strike platforms.

        "abstract": "Currently used wire harness technology consisting of Teflon-Kapton-Teflon (TKT) composite tape has significant performance issues such as hydrolysis and inadequate abrasion resistance. Engineers at V-22 primes have said one issue with kapton composite is centering \u2013 it starts to unravel and kapton becomes susceptible to hydrolysis. When  pulled through conduits or been installed tape insulation edges tend to catch on even small protrusions. This can be solved with extruded insulation, but extruded insulations in the past have not met temperature requirements. A significant worry for engineers at primes is the cost of TKT composite tape and the fact that it has a single supplier \u2013 Dupont.   Linden Photonics proposes the use of a new class of high temperature, high strength materials for use as extruded wire harness insulation, with the following properties: no thermal degradation up to 450 deg.C; very high tensile strength; excellent chemical stability; no hydrolysis problems even at elevated temperatures; no known arc tracking problems; extrudes well therefore low cost;  Phase 1 results show that Linden\u2019s extruded insulation passes wet arc tracking, cut through, flammability, corrosion, solvent compatibility tests as contained in the relevant SAE documents. Electrical properties, measured at AFRL, are excellent \u2013 dielectric breakdown voltage is 90 kV/mm vs. about 25 kV/mm for Teflon and kapton. High tensile strength has the potential to reduce harness weight by reducing insulation thickness. Finally extrusion is a much simpler process than tape construction and may reduce harness cost by 50%.",

Phase I research demonstrated the feasibility of patterned self-assembled Metal Rubber\u2122 thin film materials as sensor elements for the detection of corrosion processes in standard aircraft aluminum alloys.  Initial sensor material chemistry, sensor data acquisition electronics, and remote wireless RF detection concepts were proven through benchtop hardware tests.  The Phase II program would build directly on that work and include 1) optimization of the chemical design of the nanostructured sensor materials and analysis using salt-fog chamber accelerated corrosion tests, 2) development of both wire-interconnected and remote wireless RF-interrogated sensor electronic systems, and 3) sensor and system evaluation on both laboratory test articles and representative aircraft structural materials.

However, titanium aerospace components are notoriously expensive and difficult to machine at high speeds, driving up per-part costs, and limiting application of this material where it could be of substantial benefit to the warfighter.  During this project, we developed a unique approach to cool cutting tools called the Indirect Cooling System (ICS).  We have demonstrated that our ICS approach greatly extends tool life and enables substantial processing speed increases, which are critical to reduce cycle time and cost.  We demonstrated the viability of our ICS approach and developed strategies to integrate our innovation with commercial machine tools.

        "abstract": "Typically, the electro-optical Mach-Zehnder interferometric intensity modulator is the key optical component that determines the ultimate performance of an externally-modulated high-performance analog RF fiber-optic link.  Intrinsically, the device has a symmetric structure and has a transmission peak at zero bias.  In order to operate at the maximum linearity quadrature point, the optical symmetry has to be broken and a DC bias voltage needs to be applied and maintained to create a differential 90 degree phase shift between the two arms of the MZ.  The spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) of a wideband analog fiber optic link is critically dependent on the accuracy of the bias control.  This DC bias point is dependent on a variety of issues such as operating wavelength and polarization crosstalk.  Furthermore, lithium niobate exhibits undesirable properties in addition to the desired linear electro-optic effect including pyro-electric, piezo-electric and photo-refractive effects.  These other effects can also cause the bias point of the modulator to change.  Under this SBIR program, EOSPACE intends to significantly reduce this modulator bias control problem through two paths including both improved device designs and novel electronic feedback bias control techniques.",

However, as device dimensions continue to progress into the sub-100-nm regime, scaling of the traditional SiO2 gate dielectric led to issues with reliability, dopant penetration and excessive gate leakage current. Overall, these issues have culminated with the abandonment of SiO2/polysilicon-based systems altogether starting as early as the 45-nm generation of process technologies. At this node, several companies intend to introduce high-k/metal-gate systems. In order to search this complex space effectively, a new type of PVD deposition tool is required. Although this tool is ideal for depositing the comprehensive arrays of materials necessary to address the work function engineering problem, the productivity of the tool in this application is limited by the lack of in-situ, non-contact diagnostics that enable the characterization of each material immediately following the material deposition in a throughput-matched manner.

The EPM contains thrusters, power processors and conditioners, a propellant storage and distribution system, and a structure for mounting the hardware inside the ESPA ring.

The proposed EPM includes hydrazine thrusters for responsive maneuvering, and xenon Hall Effect Thrusters (HETs) for fuel efficient maneuvering.  A near-COTS system would carry four BHT-200 thrusters, capitalizing on the success of TacSat-2.  A more capable but lower TRL system would carry two BHT-1500 thrusters.

The approach will capitalize on the design concepts developed during the successful Phase I effort to create a 9-channel imager based on a single focal plane array.  The resulting PSI sensor will operate in the visible band, incorporate a 3\u00b43 array of micro-lenses, and use a 2048\u00b42048 staring imager to capture nine 676\u00b4676 images during each integration time: four different polarization directions in each of two spectral bands, and one broadband image.  The new sensor will have no moving parts, occupy a small physical form factor, and run on a laptop computer.  The design and development of this sensor represents a unique opportunity in hyperspectral and polarimetric sensing and imaging. This effort will benefit the development of algorithms for exploiting polarimetric image processing techniques for static scenes and temporally evolving polarized events.  This PSI will sample the object scene at rates up to 15 spectro-polarimetric images per second with minimal computational requirements.  The sensor concept is scalable to larger or smaller imaging formats, and the number of channels available for both spectral and polarimetric images can be adjusted to increase the spatial sampling for specific applications.  In addition, the sensor can be configured so that the spectral and polarimetric combinations are optimized around phenomenologically important spectral regions.",

Multicolor capabilities, high detectivity, and quick response are highly important for advanced infrared sensor systems. Photodiodes made of narrow-band semiconductors are widely used in such applications. However, the photodiodes require cryogenic temperatures and are expensive. Less expensive uncooled bolometric detectors are less sensitive, slower, and have no multicolor capability. Based upon the detailed analysis and findings of Phase I, NanoCVD proposes developing uncooled high-speed detectors consisting of a microstrip-patch-antenna or dielectric-rod-antenna in conjunction with a nanoscale metal-insulator-metal tunnel diode (MIMTD), which can be efficiently used in LWIR and VLWIR staring missile seekers and commercial applications.  In these assemblies, a microantenna amplifies the incident electromagnetic radiation, and the induced IR frequency voltage is rectified by the MIMTD generating a useful signal. NanoCVD has a strong capability to complete successfully the proposed project by combining efforts of both academic researchers and engineers having expertise in both ultrahigh frequency RF applications and nanotechnology.  Successful development of uncooled nanoscale infrared high-speed sensors, in accordance with the proposed effort, will open up a variety of applications ranging from missile seeker to driver's night vision enhancement.",

        "abstract": "The Phase I effort demonstrated the ability of a ground-insertable probe to extend the reach of LIBS technology to buried targets and that all the components can be made completely portable. Phase II will complete a ruggedized probe design and develop the rest of the field-portable LIBS system to improve the discrimination speed of manual demining activities.  To allow sampling and identification of buried targets, the probe tip will have a retractable cover to protect the lens during probe insertion and extraction.  The cover will also create and maintain a clear optical path between the tip optics and the target.  All core system components, including the laser, spectrometer and computer, will mount inside a lightweight, rugged enclosure that can then be mounted on different platforms for different applications.  The accuracy and relative hardware simplicity of the LIBS process render it applicable to a variety of different missions and system configurations where the goal is rapid identification of unknown substances.  The modular design of the proposed system simplifies the development of product variants, including remotely operated versions for use on robotic or armored vehicles.",

        "abstract": "A critical need for the U.S. forces operating in hostile urban environments, e.g. in MOUT, is the development of an innovative smart acoustic sensor system that provides capability to  accurately detect, localize and identify battlefield transient events such as gunshots, RPG and artillery fires as well as other sources of interest including vehicles.  A system-level solution for distributed fixed-site and/or portable acoustic sensors is sought that can provide soldiers with real-time assessment of commonly occurring transient events in complex battlefield environments. The algorithms should be able to handle a wide range of transient events exploiting their  muzzle blast, ballistic shockwave or both components.  Based upon our successful Phase I research, Information System Technologies, Inc. (ISTI) will further develop and fine-tune our innovative distributed sensor processing algorithms to (a) dynamically and adaptively form an optimal local distributed sensor network for a specific military situation, (b) accurately and rapidly self-localize the sensor nodes,  (c)  detect and agree on different transient events in presence of ambient noise and urban multipath effects, (d) perform accurate real-time collaborative transient event localization using time difference of arrival (TDOA) , time of arrival (TOA), and/or Direction of arrival (DOA) methods robust to non-line-of sight and multipath problems, (e) restore transient signals from noisy and faded signatures, (f) extract salient time-frequency features, (g) perform multi-expert transient event recognition, (h) and develop an overall battlefield transient event assessment system.  This research will also lead to the design, development, prototyping, and extensive testing of dedicated sensor boards using the existing low-cost low-power wireless sensors, e.g. motes, with the overall targeted cost of $300 per sensor node.

This level of performance is uniquely obtained using a high alkali-metal vapor density manipulated by a modulated single beam of light and controlled by an advanced signal processor.

Due to the challenges of the design, the inlet will likely require some form of active flow control to maintain an acceptably low level of fan face distortion. In order to be effective, any closed loop control system will require a sensing scheme that can accurately measure the level of fan face distortion. It was with this motivation that the team of Techsburg, Inc. and AVEC, Inc. proposed the development of a non-intrusive, microphone based distortion sensor as a Phase I effort to the US Air Force. The result of the Phase I effort confirms the potential of the sensing technology and provides the groundwork for the proposed Phase II effort. In the first year of the proposed Phase II effort, the development of the sensing scheme will continue with sub-scale tests using inlets representative of the technology being developed in the HiBRID program. These tests will be designed to refine both the sensing technology before committing to engine tests in the second year of the proposed effort.",

        "abstract": "The United States Navy (USN) uses a number of high strength steels, primarily AerMet100, in demanding landing gear structural applications. Unfortunately AerMet100 is expensive and, despite impressive mechanical properties, is subject to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and requires plating operations for corrosion resistance. In a recently completed Phase I SBIR program QuesTek Innovations applied its proven Materials by Design\u00ae methodology to demonstrate feasibility of a low-cost, high-strength, high-fracture-tough, SCC resistant alloy. Modeling and simulation technologies were used to design the composition and processing of the new alloy. In the Phase I program a prototype alloy demonstrated strength, fracture toughness, and SCC resistance as good as or better than the current AerMet100 alloy at approximately half the procurement cost of AerMet100. The Phase II program proposed herein details a plan to scale-up this technology to full-scale multi-ton ingots appropriate for landing gear production. While the target platform for this program is the Presidential Helicopter; QuesTek envisions performance, cost, and reliability benefits for landing gear systems throughout the USN and commercial aviation.",

        "abstract": "The Triton Systems Inc., with C.S. Draper Labs and Carpenter Steel proposes to continue the Phase I efforts developing a ricochet grille for the EFV, ultimately installing two pre-production grilles in a SDD vehicle for operational testing.  The ricochet grille concept will thereby reach TRL 7, and be ready for introduction into production EFVs. Triton\u2019s team will ensure that performance and cost requirements are met through parallel design analysis and testing.  Following Preliminary Design Review (PDR), a prototype configuration will be fabricated and tested at EFV IPT.  Following a Critical Design Review (CDR), and incorporation of any necessary design modifications, pre-production port and starboard grilles will be tested on an EFV.   Triton\u2019s approach in the Phase II is to combine high fidelity design analyses with testing of successively more representative mockups, pre-prototypes, and prototype grilles.  The Phase I ballistic testing will be expanded to a pre-prototype configuration, providing representative three-row baffle configurations for multiple-ricochet testing.  A grille mockup will be constructed to provide realistic airflow testing, providing correlations with the CFD analysis and evaluating the effects of realistic construction details on the mass flow and pressure drop.  Two pre-production grilles will be fabricated for installation into an EFV SDD vehicle.",

These radars support the capability to identify, assess, and engage threats to the U.S., deployed forces, and allies.  The current radar deployments utilize single-instance, symmetric multiprocessor machines.  Both HP and SGI SMP processors have become or are becoming obsolete and the radars will require an upgrade to a scalable computing architecture.  Future radar developments require a new computing architecture due to the limited availability of the existing HP platforms.  The next generation architecture is envisioned to be a heterogeneous cluster of blade processors connected by a high bandwidth fabric, like InfiniBand.  This new cluster computing architecture must meet stringent real-time computing requirements, and be highly scalable.  This Phase II SBIR provides a better understanding of this technology and the complete implications of its use.  Additionally, it will provide the Government with the most viable and cost effective approach to migrate to a scalable, distributed computing architecture.  The specific focus of this Phase II SBIR is the development of a tactically-representative distributed Raytheon Radar Tracker prototype.

These have important applications to sensitive and flexible satellite communication (SATCOM) systems, and prototype SATCOM receivers directly digitizing RF signals above 20 GHz with impressive performance have recently been demonstrated.  Several paths to further performance improvement have already been identified, including fabrication of smaller Josephson junctions and higher-order modulator designs.  In the present Phase II project, a novel approach will be investigated that incorporates a multi-threshold quantizer. This is an independent and complementary direction for further enhancement of the ADC dynamic range. Preliminary simulations for a seven-threshold quantizer indicate an increase of 17 dB (almost 3 bits) of dynamic range while maintaining superior device linearity.  This multi-bit ADC will require a corresponding multi-bit digital downconverter (DDC) and digital channelizer.  The present project will design, fabricate, and test a multi-bit quantizer, with on-chip integration with DDC and channelizer included as Phase II Options.

The approach to sensor resource management (SRM) must address a number of key needs including: sensor dynamics and their limitations, uncertainties in sensor and target behaviors, responsiveness to a changing scenario, and the ability to prioritize according to the importance of engagement needs such as discrimination and fire control quality tracks.  To address these issues, Numerica proposes the development of a partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) framework for sensor resource management.  Such a framework provides a flexible modeling capability, is non-myopic, addresses uncertainty in a changing dynamic environment, accommodates runtime controls, and, due to recent advances in algorithm development, is computationally feasible. Numerica will prototype and test its SRM system in the BMD Benchmark and will work with Raytheon to improve the design as it may work with future sensors.

        "abstract": "In the Phase 1 Feasibility Study, we examined weapon-target engagement scheduling problem, and developed a rapid software prototype to demonstrate automated, optimized, scheduling with the use of simulated realistic missile battle scenarios. Scheduling of an intercept launch was predicated on the engageability and lethality of the weapon-target pairings: Lethal intercept opportunities for all weapon-target pairs were determined first, the data were then used in scheduling.  A scheduler assigns, for each target, the optimal time slot for the launch of the most effective interceptor by de-conflicting the weapon resource and time requirements among all intercept possibilities, based on target priority, weapon availability, intercept lethality and cost.  The schedulers utilized in the Phase 1 operate in batch mode, the schedules generated are static and are not responsive to the dynamics of the battle environment. They are useful for non-real-time battle planning, but not for real time battle management operations.  For Phase 2, we propose to develop a incremental scheduler system for the fast changing and uncertain real time missile battle environment. The scheduling software will be developed with real time incremental schedule updates triggered by threat target events or task execution feedback. The software architecture will enable schedule coordination among distributed command centers. Human machine interface will be developed to allow user modification of a schedule in parallel with automated scheduling. The problem model will be expanded to address sensor-resource allocation/scheduling to support the weapon-target engagement events.

        "abstract": "The objectives for this Phase II effort follow logically from the Phase I proposal and the ground work laid in Phase I. The overarching goal is to prove a radically different approach to sensor packaging which offers a quantum leap in cost reduction and manufacturability improvement. Preliminary testing results from Phase I indicate that the alternative technical approach to telemetry packaging and construction is feasible. In Phase II we propose to substantiate this concept through more extensive test and evaluation. 3Pi proposes that a substantial number of complete composite canister assemblies, including an all-up operational Vector Sensor Node (VSN) telemetry module with appropriate header/cable subassemblies be constructed and subjected to the full series of tests imposed upon current distributed sensor systems, to ensure that the proposed technical approach meets all stated operational requirements and results in a sufficiently rugged packaging solution that can be deployed in the field. 3Pi proposes to further this research by designing a new 8-channel VSN disk sensor array package and proving the concept in test in the Option tasking.",

        "abstract": "The major drawback to the use of fuel cells as electric generators in unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs) is their inability to directly use battlefield fuels.  In order to efficiently use heavy hydrocarbon fuels (e.g., JP-8, diesel, dodecane) in an air independent environment, the fuel must first be reformed to a hydrogen-rich synthesis gas stream in a highly energy intensive process which is inherently inefficient. TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes to develop a novel fuel processor that allows the heat generated in the Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) stacks to be utilized to drive the endothermic steam reforming process.  Due to the better heat management by coupling the reformer with the SOFC stacks, TDA\u2019s fuel processor operates very efficiently and minimizes the amount of fuel and oxidant storage needed to support the operation of the fuel cell.   In Phase I, we showed that our fuel processing approach is a viable solution for a high energy density power generator that could meet the future requirements of the UUVs (the proposed system could achieve a specific energy of 372 W-hr/kg and an energy density of 428 W-hr/L, meeting NUWC\u2019s requirements of 350 W-hr/kg and 350 W-hr/L.  We demonstrated the performance capabilities of a commercial reforming catalyst under representative conditions and carried out the system design, showing favorable weight and volume characteristics.   In Phase II, the key objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of all fuel processing system components at full-scale first in a stand-alone manner and then in combination with a fuel cell.  In achieving this goal, we will develop a follow a breadboard fuel processor to demonstrate the key aspects of the novel fuel processor. The concept demonstrations will be carried out on a breadboard system that will not be designed for compactness and lightweight; nevertheless it will serve as an excellent platform to support future design and development.  Finally, in our collaboration with a leading SOFC manufacturer, we will demonstrate the full potential of the integrated power generation system.",

EMMFT will use the IMaQS-compensated magnetic field data to detect and continually improve localization on the target throughout any maneuvers, exploiting electric dipole signatures in addition to the traditional magnetic dipole moment.

Composite damage resulting from impact or thermal events can be difficult to visually detect by personnel servicing the aircraft.  Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods can be effective but are also time consuming and expensive for frequent routine inspections.  The damage indicator paint developed by Luna will allow visual inspection of the aircraft to detect potential composite damage quickly in the field without the use of expensive equipment.  Areas of damage highlighted by the paint can then be more closely inspected to determine needed repairs.  This technology will help to prevent structural failure and will reduce the time and expense of instrumented NDE testing.",

Various approaches have been investigated in Phase I of this SBIR program, with a focus on approaches that are consistent with implementations utilizing state-of-the-art technology to provide capabilities against the high chirp rates and bandwidths needed to support the SAR sensor range resolution. Current implementations are limited in their capabilities to produce multiple reflection points due to constraints imposed through the limited flexibility of the architecture. This manifests itself in the complexities of the implementation hardware, and the difficulties experienced in adding reflection points and generating the necessary modulation coefficients to address changes in the sensor waveform. The evolution of developmental sensors to larger bandwidths and frequency agility when using compressed waveforms also drives the focus on real-time implementation and wide bandwidth capabilities.

        "abstract": "Silicon Space Technology (SST) demonstrated during Phase I that astute modifications to a commercial CMOS process can yield significant improvement to a Texas Instruments (TI) 1394B FireWire circuit's radiation hardness.  SST developed a practical approach for Harden By Isolation (HBI) integration into an existing TI 1394B IC product (180nm TSB82AA2 Link Layer Controller [LLC]).  The resulting conclusion is that SST's HBI approach can be integrated via relatively minor changes to the circuit layout in combination with SST's process modules.  This proposed program will use this methodology to produce radiation hardened versions of two 180nm 1394B's--TSB82AA2 LLC and TSB81BA3D PHY.  It is expected the resultant RH circuits will be hardened to a total ionizing dose level >300 Krad, a dose rate of 7e9 rad(Si)/sec, and be latch-up immune--all without the large cost in area, speed and resources required by incumbent \"Harden By Design\" (HBD) approaches.  If successful, these products will demonstrate that families of TI products can be made available for space and military use through qualification of RH processes rather than individual HBD parts.  A radiation-hardened process capability at Texas Instruments will enable a broad supply of radiation-hardened ASIC's, memories and standard products required for systems being developed for MDA.",

The potential of this coating has been demonstrated for attenuating vibration and resisting erosion with a survivability temperature of >600C (1100F). The expected outcome of the program is the engineering demonstration of a prototype damping/erosion coating for application in compressor components of high performance military gas turbine engines. In addition to optimizing the damping response, high cycle fatigue, impact and erosion/corrosion of laboratory specimens, the pilot lot manufacture of airfoil coatings on engine compressor components will be demonstrated. These coated blades will be further evaluated in high force shakers and spin rotors for structural integrity, damping and fatigue durability.

RBS Technologies proposes to develop an Anti-jam (AJ) ASIC with robust STAP interference suppression techniques that is compatible with handheld GPS size and power constraints.  STAP architectures were analyzed in the Phase I to identify potential low power candidates which are able to meet interference suppression and performance requirements. Also as part of the phase I, the power dissipation of key ASIC subsystems that are needed for an ASIC implementation of STAP (SFAP) was characterized and the key IC subsystems were integrated to develop preliminary system level VHDL designs for the selected AJ ASIC architecture.

        "abstract": "We propose to continue our Phase I efforts by demonstrating the benefits of active management of distributed sensors and their tracking and fusion algorithms using on-line performance monitoring and prediction in Phase II. A bottom-up approach is set forth along the signal and data processing chain and sensor and network hierarchy. An extended target model will be used to facilitate ground target tracking with road constraining and feature aiding. High resolution range-Doppler processing of target returns will permit simultaneous measurement of target ID and kinematic state (i.e., position, velocity, and turn rate). On-line performance monitoring of tracking filters and fusion rules will enable adaptive tuning and active management of algorithms so as to maximize the overall performance for the given operating conditions. This will involve probabilistic vs. evidential combining of dissimilar features to assist target ID and data association as well as track fusion with memory vs. memoryless of distributed sensors. Furthermore, a local cooperative resource management policy will complement a network-wise competitive resource management strategy. The former is for specific formation coordination while the latter attempts to obtain balanced sensor-target assignments using the game theory to achieve mission success and long-term survivability. In Phase II, the computational algorithms developed in Phase I will be implemented into well-structured software tools as part of the Phase II deliverable and a \u201cmarketable\u201d product to pursue after Phase II. At the same time, we will arrange possible tests of the proposed technology with operational tracker/fuser of a third party for demo as initial steps toward technology transition.",

Scientific Systems Company, Inc. of Woburn MA and its subcontractor, Lockheed Martin MS2 Tactical Systems (LMTS) of Eagan MN, propose a foundational, control-theoretic approach that is based on four innovations:  (1) a multisensor-multitarget likelihood function which encapsulates all relevant information regarding the characteristics of the various sensors; (2) a \"dynamic situational significance map\" that mathematically specifies the meaning of \"tactical significance\" for a given theater at a given moment; (3) an intuitively meaningful and potentially computationally tractable objective function, namely the expected number of targets of tactical significance; and (4) integration of these concepts with approximate multitarget filters. Phase I showed the feasibility assessment by simulating satellite trajectories, and demonstrated: (1) a tractable search and sensor management (SM) objective function for the Space-Based Visible (SBV) sensor, (2) objective functions can be expressed in terms of the azimuth-elevation angles of the satellites streaks, and (3) excellent search and SM performance for the reduced complexity scenarios considered.

However, a key roadblock to successfully executing EBPs is a lack of consideration of socio-cultural factors and their impact on meeting plan objectives.    To address this deficiency Securboration is developing the Cultural Awareness Trainer for Operational Planners (CATOP). Ultimately CATOP will provide the core interactive training software for a full scale curriculum on applying socio-cultural considerations to the effects-based planning process. CATOP allows students to make adjustments to an EBP based on socio-cultural considerations, and then provides students immediate feedback on the impact those changes have in terms of compressing or expanding phases of the plan.",

This MIRSF LADAR imager/sensor is based on sum frequency generation (SFG) in periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN), in which the MWIR signals are frequency up-converted to the visible and detected by silicon sensors, eliminating the need for cryogenically-cooled HgCdTe focal-plane arrays (FPA). In Phase I, Luminit experimentally demonstrated frequency up-conversion of a 3.64 micron MWIR signal to 772 nm in a PPLN crystal using a 980 nm pump diode laser and successfully detected the 772 nm SFG signal using a low cost silicon photodiode detector. In Phase II, Luminit will optimize the SFG efficiency, broaden the MWIR coverage to the entire 3 to 5 micron band, enhance the detection sensitivity, develop a fully-functioning prototype MIRSF imager, and demonstrate the detection of real-time broadband MWIR images of distant targets using highly sensitive non-cryogenically-cooled silicon sensors.",

These material systems must meet various requirements such as weight, erosion/ablation performance, component survivability, and cost. Integration of the airframe and TPS components into a single unit has the potential to minimize weight, complexity, and cost. Ultramet has developed a melt infiltration process for rapid fabrication of refractory ceramic matrix composites (CMC) including matrices of zirconium carbide (ZrC), hafnium carbide (HfC), silicon carbide (SiC), and ceramic alloys comprising two or more of these. Substantial ultrahigh temperature hot gas testing of these composites has been performed with extremely good results, including testing under the MDA/SMDC/AMRDEC Composites and Advanced Materials (CAM) program. Ultramet has also developed and tested high temperature, low-cost insulators composed of open-cell carbon foam that is filled with a low thermal conductivity carbon aerogel insulator. The potential exists to combine and optimize melt infiltrated CMCs with foam-based insulators that meet the demanding requirements of hypersonic airframes while demonstrating affordable processing. The Phase I project combined detailed thermal and structural analysis of advanced composite structures by Materials Research and Design, low-cost and scalable air-dried aerogel insulation materials produced by Ocellus, and ultrahigh temperature structural CMC and foam insulator materials produced by Ultramet to demonstrate the initial feasibility of a fully integrated, non-eroding, load-carrying aerostructure/TPS that can operate under high heat flux and shear conditions. In Phase II, Ultramet will team with Raytheon for optimization of materials and structures, supporting Raytheon development of an integrated nosetip/insulator for the hypersonic Kinetic Energy Interceptor (KEI) vehicle. Team members will include Materials Research and Design, which will perform comprehensive thermostructural analysis based on requirements defined by Raytheon, and Ocellus, which will continue aerogel insulation optimization in combination with Ultramet structural foam insulators and high temperature CMC aerostructure development.

Current technologies providing these functions are not integrated into a rad-hard, light-weight, low-cost, power-efficient instrument suitable for on-gimbal placement. Applied Technology Associates (ATA) proposes to develop a prototype its innovative Rad-Hard Inertial Measurement Unit (RHIMU) based on our MDA sponsored Phase I preliminary design. The RHIMU includes the ability to provide high performance inertial attitude rate sensing in a small yet modular package, via the innovative combination of an ATA developed magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) rate sensor with a high performance MEMS gyro. This hybrid triad is combined with a compact accelerometer triad to produce an IMU which is compatible with the stringent RHIMU performance goals.  To realize the innovative hybrid rate sensing capability, complementary sensor-blending algorithms have been developed and implemented within rad-hard FPGA based computational electronics. The on-gimbal compatible strap-down design proposed by ATA offers reduced power, size, weight, and cost with the goal of adherence to the recently released Missile Defense Agency Common Inertial Measurement Unit Standard (MDA-STD-005 Revision 1.0). This effort offers the potential of a path to even smaller IMU development which would be compatible with micro-satellite platforms and other high performance applications wherein the ability to support long duration missions is critical.",

Impact flash spectroscopy (IFS) has the potential to identify the presence of special nuclear materials based on radiation emitted during the impact flash phase of hypervelocity interceptor-missile collisions.  Utilization of IFS as a reliable approach for missile defense engagement analysis requires a well-developed understanding of the evolution of the gas and particulate environment created during the impact.  This can be accomplished with the use of well-tested codes that simulate both the hydrodynamic breakup and expansion of the target and interceptor debris and the spectral line emission originating during the impact flash phase.  During Phase II, we will:  develop and benchmark advanced physics models that more accurately treat multi-phase phenomena in expanding debris clouds; further develop our radiation physics packages to support rapid material identification and determination of vapor conditions based on measured emission spectra; and validate shock physics and radiation physics models by benchmarking against data obtained in hypervelocity gas-gun experiments.

During Phase II we will develop comprehensive modules for treatment of thoracic and abdominal injuries. We propose to integrate visual 3-D computer models, video recording of the actual treatments, and an interactive virtual patient to develop a comprehensive, effective training tool military surgical teams. The proposed system should be highly effective given the nature of the visual component This system will include state of the art medically correct and realistic interactive visualization of patients at multiple levels (whole patient, organ systems, individual organs, etc.) superimposed upon video and still images of actual procedures. The superimposed internal anatomy, visualized during the procedure reinforces the identification of critical external anatomical landmarks and illustrates the proper guidance of instruments within the body. Additionally, a virtual patient will allow additional instructor led training simulation. The resultant system will include the input.  Throughout the development cycle we will provide early versions of the software to trainees and staff at the Army Trauma Training Center to obtain formative and qualitative feedback.  Phase II will culminate with a evaluation of knowledge gain in trauma residents who use the system.",

        "abstract": "The severity and spectrum of battlefield injuries seen in military conflict is rarely encountered in the civilian sector. It is exceedingly difficult to achieve adequate training for these complex battlefield injuries (e.g., blast injuries) in the civilian sector. There exists a need for a situation-specific training tool for physicians deploying to combat zones. We propose a low-cost, widely deployable, scalable multimodal training solution. A personal computer (PC)-based, multimodal training system to promote skill acquisition and maintenance in life saving resuscitative, procedural, and operative management of battlefield injuries would provide deploying careproviders a relevant, vivid, and concise training tool. The Combat Injury Training System is composed of three components. These include: (1) real video case-based tutorials, (2) an interactive image visualization library of injury patterns derived from volumetric CT data, and (3) hands-on virtual ultrasound procedural training. This multimodal trainer will provide a level of instruction not possible using traditional and mannequin-based teaching methods. It will also provide users with an independent learning tool providing real-time feedback and performance tracking. The structure of the educational platform will meet SCORM compliance standards and be compatible with future ADL systems.",

        "abstract": "This Phase II proposal describes a Trusted Radar concept, which is an innovative concept developed by Torch Technologies to support a key BMDS C2BMC function called Sensor Registration Health & Status Monitoring (SRHSM).  The Trusted Radar concept is designed to address the significant problems associated with relying on High Accuracy Ephemeris (HAE) satellites as reference targets for performing SRHSM.   Torch Technologies proposes the utilization of refined Low Accuracy Ephemeris (LAE) satellites as an alternative to HAE satellites.  Torch develops the rationale for a goal for LAE satellite ephemeris refinement, in this proposal, that must be met by the Trusted Radar concept in order to allow the SRHSM function to meet its objectives.  Successful completion of the Phase II SBIR will validate that the Trusted Radar concept can meet this goal by creating a well-registered (trusted) networked radar.  The Trusted Radar concept is also capable of providing BMDS Space Catalog services to BMDS networked radars.  The BMDS Space Catalog essentially provides significant numbers of refined ephemeris satellites that can be used in support of local radar sensor registration, thereby reducing the reliance on HAE satellites.  The work plan for demonstrating and validating the Trusted Radar concept is described in detail.  This work plan focuses on experimentation at the Missile Defense Integration and Operations Center (MDIOC) which will include participation by BMDS networked representative radars.",

By the end of Phase II, the iPTK will have been matured to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6. Extensive testing and performance evaluations will be included in Phase II, to enhance and demonstrate the capabilities of the iPTK. The evaluations will be performed using datasets of interest to the MDA and to its prime contractors, so that the performance of the developed iPTK can be compared with that of existing software.",

        "abstract": "The potentially catastrophic results of entering the flutter regime mean that flutter flight testing of aircraft carries significant risk, and accurate predictions of flutter behavior are highly valuable.  Recent advances have yielded aeroelastic models that are quite accurate, but these models are highly complex and very computationally intensive.  Using these models to analyze uncertainty has thus been difficult, and the impact of uncertainty on quantities of interest, such as the probability of flutter, is not well understood.  New tools are needed to provide the desired understanding of the impact of uncertainty on flutter behavior.   The proposed Phase II research will develop the needed analysis tools based on a generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) representation of uncertainty.  The team will leverage recent advances in reduced-order modeling approaches, which provide improved accuracy, and will develop an efficient experimental design methodology for characterizing how uncertainty propagates from underlying sources in the high-fidelity simulation to the reduced-order models.  After reduced-order models that characterize uncertainty have been developed, outputs of interest such as probabilistic flutter bounds can be readily characterized, and sensitivity to specific uncertainties can be quantified.  The ultimate result of the research will be an efficient testing methodology that minimizes risk.",

        "abstract": "Airborne chemical and biological (CB) agents released in one section of a building travel via the building\u2019s heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and disperse throughout the building, while undergoing deposition and resuspension recurrently. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been employed to simulate dispersion of CB agents in a building through HVAC systems. How well the simulation result would match the actual dispersion profile of CB agents depends on the accuracies of models describing the physical phenomena such as aerodynamic characteristics of CB agents and fluid motion through the HVAC systems. One of the important, but not well established, factors is the resuspension mechanism of fine particles. Currently, resuspension models used are simple and, especially, not adequate for describing short-term resuspension which is important in indoor environments. Triton Systems, Inc. proposes to further improve and validate the resuspension models developed in Phase I by performing well-designed and controlled resuspension experiments and demonstrating the improvement in prediction of particle transport and dispersion in indoor environments.",

The time-stamp of an event is thus an unknown, subject to constraints that we can extract from the text.  These constraints can form a basis for inference over events and times mentioned in a document.  We propose to develop a system to extract temporal constraints from text and collect them in a Temporal Constraint Store, from which we can derive new constraints by inference and constraint satisfaction techniques, test for inconsistency, and ultimately derive as refined an Event Network as possible, given information available in the text.  We will leverage the resources available to us, especially the TimeBank corpus, to exhaustively survey and classify the various contexts in which event-event relationships are expressed in texts.  Descriptions of these contexts will be formalized and implemented as recognizers for those contexts, from which we will derive temporal constraints to add to the store.  Once the constraints in the constraint store have been reduced as far as possible, the resulting distilled information will be added to the World Model constructed by our Information Extraction engine. From there it can be used to drive visualization applications and other intelligence analysis tools.",

Track before detect modes have been developed and implemented to mitigate the problem of false targets due to strong sea clutter returns.  Recent studies such as the Office of Naval Research\u2019s (ONR\u2019s) Uncluttered Tactical Picture (UTP) have demonstrated that significant small signal detection performance improvements can be achieved by use of innovative clutter thresholding tools/algorithms.  These capabilities are directly applicable to radars that perform Automatic Radar Periscope Detection and Discrimination (ARPDD) processing (e.g., USN AN/APS-147 upgrade).  The planned transition of the ARPDD capability to the fleet offers an opportunity to exploit this new knowledge.  LSI\u2019s approach is to accurately model the AN/APS-147 ARPDD processing to assess the detection processing performance improvement that would be gained by implementing these advanced thresholding algorithms.  LSI will leverage our state of the art knowledge and expertise of the two primary aspects of the solution space: (i) sea clutter phenomenology and sea clutter filtering, (ii) utilization of advanced radar detection and tracking techniques to exploit the differences between sea clutter backscatter, periscopes and small craft target signatures.",

Compared to early augmentor designs, the distance between the point of fuel injection and the flameholder has become progressively shorter in modern augmentors.  These so called close-coupled designs help avoid autoignition issues associated with higher augmentor inlet temperatures.  A negative aspect of such close-coupled designs is that the fuel is not optimally mixed in the flame holding region, leading to static and dynamic stability issues.  Creare and our partners propose a new close-coupled augmentor flameholder design that will greatly extend stability margins, especially in the high altitude, low Mach (Ma) number part of the flight envelope where stability issues are of greatest concern.  During Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of our flameholder concept in an augmentor test facility.  In Phase II, we will adapt the design so that it can be practically implemented in a real engine.  We will then optimize our flameholder design and demonstrate performance both experimentally and numerically.",

The waveform class will employ direct sequence pseudo-noise spread spectrum (DS-PNSS) modulation with time-varying characteristics to inhibit an adversary\u2019s ability to detect, disrupt, intercept or exploit the transmissions. The proposed waveform class also employs turbocodes as its forward error correction mechanism. The character of the waveform is governed by a set of parameters that will change to compensate for increasing free space loss over the duration of an interceptor fly-out. Welkin Sciences also proposes to design the Advanced Interceptor Data Link with new ground-based and flight-vehicle transceivers utilizing the proposed new waveform type.

However, conventional Li-ion batteries experience loss of capacity and increased impedance and poor cycle life when they are charged/discharged at high rates over C-rate. These problems are magnified at low temperature operation. The limitations in the high rate capability of Li-ion batteries are mainly caused by slow solid-state diffusion of Li+ within the electrode materials Yardney/Lithion Inc., the world leader in cutting edge Li-ion battery technology proposes to investigate new non-toxic nano-engineered electrodes that significantly shortens the Li+ diffusion length within the electrode materials and increases the rate capability of Li-ion batteries. The goal of this Phase II project is to manufacture rapid recharge Li-ion battery for aerospace application. Yardney will manufacture 5 prototype cells capable of recharge at less than 15 min at room temperature. During the phase I we found that the nanoengineered anode showed excellent rate capabilities compared to planar electrode. Nanoarchitectured current collector provides higher safety due to large surface area contact with the active material and that acts as heat sink in high rate applications and also lower impedance.",

In phase I we have developed a protective coating for the titanium foil that has made it compatible with our low cost process for fabricating high efficiency CIGS cells.  The insulating nature of this coating will enable us to fabricate high efficiency modules using standard monolithic integration techniques. The proposed work is aimed at increasing the cell efficiency from 10% to over 15% by way of gallium redistribution in the absorber films, enabling achievement of specific power densities >1500 W/Kg.  In addition, significant effort will be focused on optimization of the module fabrication process and minimization of performance losses during monolithic integration of the cells.  Success in this project will ready the technology for larger scale testing and production on the pilot line currently being established at ISET.",

The AT memory will also include an electrically programmed rapid bulk erase capability, as well as a signal line to indicate that a tampering event has been detected.  The device, called an anti-tamper magnetic random access memory (AT-MRAM) is intended for volume protection of military electronics systems by providing the capability to detect and respond to invasive tampering of a protected volume by irrecoverably erasing a long unique code stored within the AT-MRAM.  The AT-MRAM prototype will be implemented as a stand-alone 256-bit cryptokey memory for volumetric anti-tamper applications, and with further research and development the memory capacity could be increased to hold data other than encryption keys.",

The use of an effective decision-support mission planning tool that provides an interface for mission planners as to the risk associated with particular mission profiles would be invaluable for providing safer mission route planning.  In considering this problem, Infoscitex applied the Phase I research into evaluating the feasibility of the RAFT (Risk Assessment of Frontline Troops) application, which has at its core a Bayesian Belief Network approach to risk assessment that is based on the input of, and interaction between, past and recent mission information and incident reports, field intelligence, and cultural factors that all play a role in determining the inherent risk to our troops while executing day to day missions.

        "abstract": "Long-duration wide-area surveillance missions increasingly are space-based. MEO orbits offer space-based radar systems more time on station, but require very large array apertures on the order of 100m in diameter. Achieving larger apertures with smaller, lighter launch packages and stable on-orbit pointing is a challenge that E-Textiles promises to meet. Textile processes can be used to achieve a low-cost, lightweight array capable of being stowed in a launch vehicle and deployed in orbit.    During Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of E-Textile antennas by constructing and testing an assortment of multilayer antenna and feed modules. Copper wire and stainless steel yarns were hand-embroidered onto codura, vinyl coated canvas and fiberglass and stitched together with foam and knit spacer fabrics to form textile-based microstrip patch antennas. Our Phase II work will build this E-textile technique using computer-controlled industrial embroidering machines to build up more sophisticated arrays with tolerances and repeatability afforded by a computer-automated textile process. We will also investigate alternative E-textile methods such as nonwovens and custom metallic knits for building space-based antennas. The design will culminate in the construction of a 1m x 1m subarray that can be used to form a 4m x 100m array in a tile-architecture.",

In this SBIR, CFDRC, teamed with Merrill Beckstead of Brigham Young University (BYU) and ATK Launch Systems, proposes to develop a software toolkit for simulating the response of solid rocket motors (SRM) to fast cook-off events. The complete software package will include multiple codes with different fidelity levels and dimensionality (1D, 2D, and 3D). Include in the software package will be the 1D BYU cook-off code with detailed and reduced kinetics for AP/HTPB, CFDRC\u2019s 3D structural mechanics code named COBI, and ATK\u2019s thermal code incorporating composite case materials. The software\u2019s modularity will enable other codes to be attached as desired, such as ALE3D.  In Phase I, feasibility of the software was demonstrated by comparing predictions of the software with initial thermal cook-off data from China Lake. Good agreement was seen. In Phase II, the software will be further enhanced for efficiency (i.e. reduced run times) and accuracy. The improved software package will be extensively validated and calibrated against sub-scale China Lake data and NOSSA data. Scalability will then be demonstrated by validating against full-scale MDA SRM data. To ensure technology transfer of the software to OEMs, CFDRC has acquired the services of ATK to be a beta tester of the software, followed by ATK performing cook-off simulations on real SRM applications.",

This programmability greatly decreases development costs and time-to-market compared to Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs).   Almost all commercial designs using FPGAs treat the configurable logic as static in the deployed product.   Previous research on Run-Time Reconfiguration (RTR) has demonstrated performance benefits from partially or fully reconfiguring an FPGA during operation.  Unfortunately, developing RTR applications has been a difficult undertaking.  FPGA design tools share a lineage with ASIC tools, with both assuming static hardware.  What little vendor support that has been available forced the designer to do much of the low-level implementation manually.  Commercial tools in the form of design capture methodologies and simulators are non-existent.   The objective of this project is to define an architecture-agnostic RTR application development methodology, incorporating the latest advances and trends in configurable computing.  Addressing the deficiencies in previous research, the proposed research enables the use of commercial design entry and simulation tools, fully incorporates embedded processors into the computational and programming models, and permits partial reconfiguration of one or more FPGAs through automatic generation of custom configuration controllers.",

Meeting the booster performance goals with innovative materials technologies is a much lower system level cost approach than by increasing the booster diameter or length.  In Phase I, higher temperature rocket motor cases resins were shown to be a technology that is capable of delivering the improved burn out velocity by reducing the propulsion inert weight of the thermal protection system.  The volume and mass saved by the higher operating temperature case can be filled with propellant to achieve increased burn-out velocities or quicker time to target.  In the Phase II program, the manufacturing of a rocket motor case using a wet wind system will be demonstrated.

        "abstract": "RCI has developed one JSF clutch friction material system whose performance exceeds by more than 50%, the original JSF design goal for total engagements. This wear life is a factor of 3 to 4 times the current C/C clutch material being used for the STOVL version of JSF (F-35B).  The experimental testing performed in Phase I has been done at full scale conditions (full speed and full inertial mass or engagement energy) using a custom built single rotor-single stator clutch test machine.  This full scale, full speed, full energy Phase I testing has eliminated the technical risk associated with extrapolating results from lower surface speed subscale test approaches that have previously been used.  In addition, RCI has one other friction material system also tested under full scale conditions whose friction behavior (dynamic coefficient of friction) is significantly higher than the current C/C friction material.  Higher COF values at high speed engagement conditions can greatly reduce clutch clamp load forces which will extend clutch rotating equipment (bearings, gears, etc.)life.  These advancements will be optimized early in Phase II and full up clutch test and demonstration work will be performed at Rolls Royce Corporation, Indianapolis, IN during the second half of the Phase II program.  The pay-off for the JSF program in both enhanced STOVL system durability, flight & maintenance operations safety and the reduced cost of ownership is very large-in excess of $70M.",

From that effort we determined that context was a key missing element that made that collaboration difficult to establish and maintain.  Based on our work in Deep Situational Reasoning, we derived a framework from which an agent can maintain context with the human as an integral part of the user interface.  Specifically, it combined the classical Model-View-Controller interface paradigm with our newer Object-Network-Semantic paradigm.  The combination provided an interesting fusion of meaning, relationship, situated state, environment and intentions.  It is our goal in this phase to build a working prototype of this framework and demonstrate it in a limited problem domain",

Our approach eliminates the catastrophic failures that can result from exceeding those underlying limits and assures timely reaction to cyber threats.  Cybercraft developers and operators can use the Cybercraft Architecture Reasoner Inferring Network and Application Environments (CARINAE) throughout the cybercraft lifecycle to resolve multiple scalability limitations introduced by diversity in physical and logical network topologies, systems, and missions, by application resource loads and criticality, and by cybercraft architecture and resource requirements.

        "abstract": "Providing a dominant response to terrorism and insurgent-driven asymmetric wars is a complex problem and is accelerating demand for high-quality multi-INT fused Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) products. Soar Technology, Inc. and the Lockheed Martin Co. propose to significantly advance the state of the art in level 1 multi-INT data fusion by developing a novel technology that will significantly extend the length of high purity, multi-INT, fusion tracks for both real-time and forensic applications. The proposed Cognitive Fusion technology is a hybrid fusion system that provides long tracks at high purity with high confidence. We will achieve this innovation by integrating quantitative observations (such as those produced by typical kinematic trackers) and qualitative abstractions of the environment. This hybrid computation is achieved by balancing relatively slow, but contextually rich, cognitive agent reasoning with a fast, but knowledge poor, fusion algorithm. An agent imbued with rich knowledge of the domain, mission, and analyst hypotheses will bring more knowledge and algorithms to multi-INT fusion in comparison to strictly quantitative kinematic processors. Our primary technical deliverable will be a hybrid fusion system for real-time and forensic multi-track correlation and data association. The centerpiece of this fusion system will be a Cognitive Fusion Module that incorporates a software agent and data manager to implement a novel knowledge representation and reasoning algorithm for adversarial behavior recognition.",

Successful completion of Phase I demonstrated cipherDB\u2019s ability to manage content, process data with flexible querying, and enable assay design using plague infected non-human primates as an example. The Phase II effort will build off of Phase I by expanding the scope and capability of cipherDB. Phase II will begin with improvements to the Data, Logic, and Presentation Tiers with the goal of maximizing the value of the resultant software to USAMRIID research efforts.  Data Tier improvements include the addition of multiple Minimum Information About (MIA)-type data representations.  Other additions include biological sample tracking and DNA microarray probe management to enable targeted array development.  Logic Tier improvements include addition of data security and the capture of an \u2018analysis pipeline\u2019 to enable automation and sharing of computations.  Finally, Presentation Tier improvements include the creation of user home pages containing relevant data, analysis pipelines, and links to online databases. A suite of bioinformatics and systems biology tools will also be developed as part of the Phase II effort. Bioconductor will provide the basic analysis capability, while advanced systems biology and bioinformatics methods will be developed with the goal of objectively ranking the relative importance of specific genes/proteins within a complex biological network. Successful completion of the Phase II effort will generate a DBMS containing a critical set of analysis tools that will ultimately provide a rational basis for the design of diagnostic assays for human exposure to biological threat agents.",

The F-PAS (Field-Programmable Automation System) application simplifies the FPGA design flow while intelligently producing the best implementation solution for the specific design requirements.  The intelligent automation of the F-PAS solution simulates the design process of experts for every stage of the implementation process and leverages expertise gained only by experience, empowering even a novice engineer to implement effective designs with the option of user input or intervention at any stage of the design process.  Phase I efforts produced a prototype system that streamlines the design process and finds the best synthesis implementation.

        "abstract": "High-performance turbine engines are an attractive means to power high speed aircraft and missiles.  Although the basic turbine generates substantial thrust, an augmentor (or afterburner) provides even greater thrust margin and can accelerate the vehicle to much higher cruise Mach number.  Unfortunately, achieving stable combustion in the augmentor can be difficult, especially when the inlet flow pressure and temperature are both low such as at low Mach or high altitude flight conditions.  Further, the flow into the augmentor will be partially depleted of oxygen by the primary combustor upstream of the turbine, reducing the kinetic rates and substantially narrowing both the ignition and flammability limits.  Catalysts can dramatically increase kinetic rates by causing combustion to occur along a pathway with much lower activation energy, but they often deactivate at high temperature.  Fortunately, TDA has developed stable combustion catalysts with long life at high temperature.  In Phase I we conducted laboratory experiments to demonstrate catalytic combustion of fuel-air mixtures at augmentor flow conditions.  Then, we coated a flameholder with our catalyst and extended the combustor operating range.  In this Phase II project we will coat augmentor flameholder and pilot surfaces with our catalyst to improve combustor performance and operability.",

Although these methods are based on rigorous integral or partial differential equation formulations, they cannot presently solve electrically large problems of EM radiation pattern and coupling prediction associated with antennas on aircraft at higher frequencies (S/X/Ku/Ka bands). On the other hand, asymptotic high frequency (HF) methods, whose accuracy increases with frequency, such as the physical optics (PO) method and its modifications based on the physical theory of diffraction (PTD), require an integration of the surface currents over the lit portion of the platform, so they also do not scale with frequency. At those frequencies uniform geometrical theory of diffraction (UTD) is very efficient and provides a physical picture for antenna radiation mechanisms and EM interactions with the aircraft platform in terms of rays at high frequencies. However, simulation of the platform using UTD so far is accomplished using a combination of canonical objects, limiting the use of codes based on UTD for complex structures such as fight aircraft etc. Applied EM along with its team members is proposing an advanced tool based on UTD applicable to CAD geometries along with interface to various antenna modeling tools. Proposed tool will be capable of analyzing fully or partially material coated realistic aircraft platforms. Antenna pattern computations and coupling between other antennas present on the airframe.

BCS must be smaller, lighter and more stable to fully realize the potential of new laser device technologies.  Phase I of this SBIR, entitled OTHELA (Optimized Tactical HEL Architecture), provided an on-gimbal beam control system (OGBCS) concept, complete with a ZMAX optical layout, a composite structural design, and innovative beam control concepts, which established the feasibility of performing all beam control functions completely on-gimbal.  The specified system exhibits lightweight, minimal footprint, minimal high power mirror count and superior stabilization characteristics. In addition to clever optical and structural design, OTHELA required innovative beam control concepts in order to perform all conventional beam control functions on gimbal.  This Phase II effort performs the necessary laboratory demonstrations to provide risk reduction of the innovative adaptive optics and the innovative tracking alignment and stabilization concepts that are necessary to implement the OGBCS concept.",

        "abstract": "MZA partnered with the University of Notre Dame proposes a Phase II laboratory demonstration of a beacon formation, wavefront sensing, and HEL compensation for mitigation of aero-optical disturbances.  We demonstrated the formation of an air-breakdown laser spark in close proximity to an aircraft platform of sufficient signal brightness for wavefront sensing.  We evaluated application of optimal estimation techniques to the beacon measurements giving HEL compensation anisoplanatism similar to a reference placed at a much greater range.  We propose to integrate a suitable illuminator laser into our existing laboratory optical train, form laser spark beacons within a wind tunnel test section, and measure the disturbance beacon wavefront while simultaneously measuring a collimated beam through the same aero-optics volume.  We will characterize the wavefront data to evaluate the potential for implementing HEL phase estimation from the actual beacon signal.  Laboratory measurements will include differing flow speeds, variable forcing for flow regularization, and off-axis beacon pointing into the flow.  These measurements will be used in wave-optics simulation to assess hardware mitigation techniques, both with laboratory equipment and for military aircraft lasers.  We will simulate and implement in the laboratory a suitable aero-optics mitigation demonstration using previously-tested wavefront control methods.",

These materials have applications as sensor windows and domes as well as transparent armor.  One drawback to these materials is the cost of optical finishing which can easily be 1/3 the cost of the finished dome.  Significant reductions in the cost of optical finishing these domes could save the Department of Defense millions of dollars in procurement costs. During the Phase I effort, Surmet has identified opportunities for reduction in the cost of finishing ALON domes.  Opportunities include near net shape ALON blanks, low cost tooling, and improved generating, grinding, and polishing processes.  Deterministic processes for final figure correction may also lower the cost of domes with demanding optical requirements.  Initial demonstrations on sub-scale flat and curved surfaces have been completed under the Phase I effort and have demonstrated process time reductions.  Additional demonstration tasks are underway. The proposed Phase II effort, will further develop these processes and technologies, culminating in the manufacture of full scale dome prototypes and qualification of the optical and mechanical characteristics of the domes.",

Under the Phase II effort, Surmet proposes a two pronged approach.  The most promising of the results from the Phase I effort will be further developed and refined.

When compared to edge-emitting laser arrays, VCSELs offer (1) lower power density at the exit aperture, reducing hotspots, (2) simplified optics, (3) a single solder interface, (4) arbitrary array shape, (5)lower wavelength drift over temperature, and (6) a lower inherent production cost due to their ease of processing and testing. At the end of a successful Phase II, Aerius will deliver arrays with an emission wavelength of 808 nm and an output power of greater than 1000W per bar stack and demonstrating high reliability in a high vacuum environment. In Phase I, they performed baseline reliability studies of kilowatt-capable VCSEL arrays in vacuum and demonstrated their compatibility with space environments.

        "abstract": "The purpose of this program is to provide a technology that enables the deployment of constellations of satellite based, coherent, RF sparse arrays.  Such sparse arrays would have higher resolution than conventional approaches and would provide superior remote sensing capabilities at a fraction of today\u2019s cost.  The key enabling mechanisms are 1) the ability to accurately measure the distance between individual satellites, and 2) the ability to distribute a coherent clock among satellites in a given constellation. The Phase 1 program conducted an early assessment of UWB technology to determine if it offered the basis to develop a coherent clock distribution system capable of supporting a 10 GHz sparse array.  This assessment was performed by conducting both clock distribution and range accuracy tests.  These tests employed our standard off the shelf UWB P210\u00ae platform in a static test configuration.    The tests demonstrated that our standard UWB platform was capable of synchronizing clocks to within 5ps and ranging over hundreds of meters with an accuracy of a few millimeters (13.5mm standard deviation).  Analysis of these encouraging results led us to conclude that additional platform development and optimization would lead to even better performance.  Due to the promise of this technology and to ensure continuity with succeeding Phase II and Phase III efforts, Phase I concluded with the development of top-level mission and spacecraft system design requirements. The Phase II program proposes to optimize Time Domain Corporation\u2019s (TDC) emerging P400p platform for use in a sparse array application.  Multiple P400ps representing individual elements of a sparse array will be deployed in a series of static and dynamic tests conducted on an optical breadboard.  The precision metrology provided by the optical breadboard will enable us to establish \u201ctruth\u201d position data for comparison against the positions provided by the UWB system.  This approach will allow us to verify that the system can provide the timing synchronization and position accuracy required to support a 10 GHz sparse array.

        "abstract": "FIRST RF proposes a compact, broadband, highly integrated VHF SAR antenna array which consists of several key enabling technologies demonstrated during Phase I of this program.  FIRST RF took an aggressive design approach in Phase I to prove that the conformal wideband antenna array can be used in conjunction with a robust, wideband beamforming network to steer a SAR beam over the desired angular sector. FIRST RF also verified high power beamformer performance. Finally, with the support of USAF, FIRST RF was able to complete a site visit for the C-130 for installation review. FIRST RF aggressively developed working hardware during Phase I, and is ready to begin platform integration and installed testing in Phase II. The primary objective of the Phase II SBIR program is to develop a thin (low-profile) wide-band phased array element for use in low-band VHF foliage penetrating radar applications. The Phase II program will expand on the work completed in Phase I in the area of numerical modeling and antenna design. The effort will culminate in the fabrication, test, and delivery of a full scale flight-like antenna array demonstrated on a representative aircraft model.",

It will be an Internet Protocol (IP)-based network, running on top of the multiple data links currently available. The nodes forming the planned DoD Airborne Network Backbone typically contain multiple radios, with data links based on Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) technologies.  The overall objective of the proposed Phase II effort is the development and evaluation of the AIRNet suite of protocols which provide a network layer for multi-radio TDMA systems. AIRNet combines: (1) the use of multiple metrics for characterizing link costs in networks with multiple radios; (2) the use of multi-criteria optimization schemes for addressing Quality-of-Service (QoS) issues in airborne networks; and (3) the use of disruption tolerant schemes to address severe link intermittence. The algorithms will be evaluated using high-fidelity simulations involving general airborne networking scenarios and an airborne network scenario consistent with the Advanced Tactical Data Link (ATDL) program.  AIRNet will be implemented in a network of COTS Personal Data Assistants (PDAs) running O-SITA (Overlay Sync-Less Impromptu Time Access) at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. O-SITA is being developed by Scientific Systems Company and BBN Technologies as part of a contract with AFRL and will be leveraged in this effort.

        "abstract": "We propose a large-format LWIR HgCdTe Focal Plane Array that can perform rudimentary signal pre-processing and increase pixel well dynamic range, thereby elevating seeker abilities to acquire, track, and discriminate enemy targets.  This approach, supported by Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems, is based on a novel differential dual pixel design using pairs of adjacent pixels each connected in an inverted, parallel configuration.  With this invention, referred to by its inventor as an \u201copsistor,\u201d common mode rejection of incident radiation and noise suppression can be performed simultaneously.  Noise mitigation is achieved by the unique ability of this \u201copsistor\u201d structure to code input optical signals with a polarity modulation pattern that permits signals to be recovered after MCT sensor detection with greater than 15dB of signal-to-noise improvement.  This noise mitigation feature can permit the development of a new generation of low-cost, high-performance (large D*) smart IR focal plane arrays well matched to the requirements of THAAD and multiple kill vehicle (MKV) programs. During Phase I, we effectively demonstrated that single \u201copsistor\u201d MWIR and LWIR pixels can successfully recover very weak polarity-coded target signals buried deep in noise.  Similar success is expected in Phase II for the proposed opsistor-technology-based MCT focal plane array.",

Problems are frequently discovered in the hardware/software prototyping or flight test program phases, when they are difficult and expensive to fix and likely to result in significant program perturbations.  Potential safety issues that were not forecast can also be encountered.  Recent studies by both U.S. and NATO organizations have identified structured modeling technologies and processes (including the evolving Model Driven Architecture\u00ae, or MDA\u00ae, process supported by commercial industry) as having a high potential to significantly mitigate the identified problems, if appropriately adapted and incorporated into the platform avionics and weapon integration design approach.  To support such a model-based process, flexible modeling algorithms for weapon control systems and associated weapon employment functionality need to be developed in languages such as the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) and Unified Modeling Language (UML).  The effort proposed here would demonstrate development of modeling algorithms for an example weapon control application in accordance with requirements developed under the Phase I study effort.",

There is a growing concern about system security because many current software systems are neither reliable nor secure. Software should ideally be secure from external agents and conditions accidentally or purposefully degrading system performance. In short the software must be trustworthy. A method is needed for the system administrator to assess the current security level of a system and gain insight into vulnerabilities, so risk can be actively managed rather than incorrectly assumed to be at a constant level. We are pleased to submit this proposal to design, develop, and evaluate a Software Trustworthiness Assessment Tool (STAT). We will focus on techniques for assessing the software trustworthiness of an integrated system during runtime by learning what behavior at a system level is \u201cnormal,\u201d and by extension, trustworthy, and what is unusual and potentially untrustworthy. Current solutions are generally based on the detection and blocking of intrusions, computer viruses, and other malware. STAT instead detects problems that occur as the result of unanticipated interactions between trusted software applications that lead to untrustworthiness in the system as a whole.",

The designed performance of antennas is typically degraded by their installation on the airframe. Also, the presence of many RF systems in a small region creates enormous opportunity for undesired interference via antenna-to-antenna coupling. These conditions present serious challenges for engineers tasked with integrating antennas onto platforms. We propose to develop a tool that implements ray tracing on electrically large, high-fidelity airframe CAD models to predict installed antenna performance: antenna patterns, antenna-to-antenna coupling, spatial field distributions, angle-of-arrival, and other direct or diagnostic metrics. In Phase I, we developed and validated a baseline predictor while researching advanced modeling enhancements. In Phase II, we will engineer this into a robust capability, implement various modeling and ease-of-use enhancements, and couple it to a graphical user interface (GUI) emphasizing 3-D visualization to aid in scenario configuration, multi-system management, and result interpretation. A CAD pre-processor tool will also be developed to assist the user in importing, creating, editing, and repairing platform models.  The tool suite will offer advantages over existing asymptotic solvers through more accurate near field interactions, creeping wave algorithms for realistic geometries, and powerful diagnostic features.",

New, bright scintillators such as cerium doped lanthanum bromide (LaBr-3:Ce) exhibit high energy resolution. The energy resolution of LaBr3:Ce with PMT readout is at present limited by photoelectron statistics. The quantum efficiency of even the best PMTs over the emission spectrum of LaBr3:Ce (340-450 nm region) is quite low (about 30-40%).

The MT-VCAD is a compact hybrid semiconductor chip device that utilizes an integrated MEMS mirror in conjunction with an amplifying semiconductor resonant cavity and a hybrid PIN detector to selectively amplify and detect different wavelengths of light. Unlike APDs, whose gain and noise figure suffer at higher data rates, the MT-VCAD maintains high gain (>100x) at high data rates (10 to 40 Gb/s), thus enabling satellites to communicate over longer distances and at 10\u2019s of gigabits per second. The MT-VCAD is compatible with coherent and direct detection operation. The MT-VCAD receiver inherently accepts and amplifies only a narrow wavelength band (0.1 nm), reflecting other bands, and is able to change this wavelength in microseconds. Therefore the proposed tunable receiver, with a tunable transmitter, can rapidly change wavelength and eliminate any attempts to jam or damage the detectors either by wideband illumination or by narrowband lasers. Wavelength tunability also enables compact wavelength division multiplexed systems.

In addition, high-speed hypertemporal imaging techniques will be able to exploit the operational characteristics of this imaging array because it will not saturate like conventional linear FPAs; in addition, radiation hardened design approaches will be considered in the development of the Phase II imaging device.  A complete demonstration camera system will be developed and demonstrated to MDA at the end of the Phase II effort.",

The development effort to accomplish the subsequent prototype for this enhanced reference monitor was small because the enhancement itself resulted in a relatively tiny formal model and software implementation.   Phase II will extend the Phase I prototype into additional prototypes that embody capable, usable, useful and certifiable Distributed Secure Routers.  By accomplishing an initial consensus of reviewers, Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of a relatively tiny enhancement to the reference monitor concept and separation theorem.  In Phase II we put this system forward as the subject of the fairly heavyweight testing and analysis efforts typically associated with an Evaluated Assurance Level of 6.  We propose to obtain EAL6 assurance artifacts that have been, historically speaking, dearly-bought.  Our approach is reasonable primarily because the Phase I efforts produced a fair amount of evidence demonstrating that the required system implementation is quite small.",

Hidden targets using camouflage, concealment and deception are difficult to detect with standard weapons sensors including basic ladar systems.  A multi-discriminant ladar having polarized, multi-spectral, and multi-pulse features is expected to provide a significant enhancement to the target detection process, but ATR algorithms must be developed to take advantage of these multi-discriminant attributes.  The Phase I effort, which used synthetic ladar images, has demonstrated several promising algorithms based on novel formulations of spectropolarimetric feature vectors used with manifold learning/clustering techniques; however, these algorithms must be refined, extended and verified by application to measured multi-discriminant ladar images, which is the goal of the Phase II program.  The use of multi-discriminant LEAP ATR algorithms tailored to AFRL experimental ladar systems will facilitate the rapid assessment of the compatibility of the ATR algorithms contemporaneously with the laboratory and field tests.",

        "abstract": "As UAV airframes become smaller and yet more functional, a dramatic need arises for versatile wideband antennas that are conformal to the airframe yet are not compromised by the integration methods.  Traditionally, VHF and UHF apertures present the greatest challenge because the wavelengths at these frequencies are on the order of the size of the vehicle itself, if not bigger.  FIRST RF has developed a breakthrough method of transforming the airframe of the vehicle itself into an antenna, namely the wings.  The Phase I program was successful in developing a very novel antenna technology \u2013 the LEADeR antenna - whereby the entire wing serves as part of the antenna.  Because the antenna effective aperture is so much bigger than traditional highly-tuned resonant approaches, the antenna input impedance is much more amenable to broadband matching techniques.  The direct application of this antenna technology includes two specific airborne platforms with a requirement to transmit high power RF signals over a broad frequency range \u2013 VHF through upper UHF.  One vehicle is an airborne decoy, the other is an airborne electronic warfare (EW) system.  Until now, one of the biggest challenges to each system is a high performance, broadband conformal antenna.",

The proposed computational method will use a novel two-level approach that involves a system-level solution with an embedded component-level calculation. The component-specific solution of the conservation equations will use the hybrid approach involving homogenous, separated, and annular two-phase flow regimes. The system-level solution will utilize these component characteristics to predict the system performance in a generalized manner. Component models will be developed for Finned-tube Condensers and Evaporators, Microchannel Heat Sinks, Spray Cooled Devices, Pumps, and Accumulators. An extensive literature search will be undertaken to construct a set of correlations for local characterization of two-phase flows for use in component-level analysis. The model will be validated using data already available in the literature and measurements on practical two-phase systems. Phase I effort has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of developing the two-level computational method and its utility in the design of a practical two-phase pumped-loop system.

Current implementations are limited in their capabilities to produce multiple reflection points due to constraints imposed through the inflexibility of the architecture.

The range profile will be updated pulse-to-pulse to reflect changing sensor position and target aspect. The scalable architecture provides the ability to synthesize complex radar scenes that can be represented with the range resolution and range extent provided by the CTSB implementation.

We developed a novel imaging technique for forward-looking synthetic aperture radar processing of stationary targets that achieves high Doppler resolution and requires little computation, and demonstrated that we could measure scatterer positions in the resulting imagery and then use the positions to classify targets and select aimpoints.  We also developed techniques for readily generating range/Doppler images of moving targets that contain well-focused responses and techniques for making monopulse measurements on these responses despite the presence of interference, and demonstrated that these also enable target classification and aimpoint selection.  The techniques require a coherent wideband monopulse radar and apply for frequencies from Ku-band to W-band.

The major technical challenge of the RJC program is developing low-cost, lightweight valves to withstand the extreme temperature environment of rocket motor exhaust.  Rhenium metal has been successfully demonstrated as a high-temperature, non-eroding metal in solid propellant combustion gas.  However, the use of monolithic rhenium components is limited due to cost and weight restrictions.  Rhenium substitutes, such as silica-phenolic, carbide ceramics and coated carbon composites, have been designed, but are limited due to unacceptable erosion at elevated temperatures (e.g. 2600\u00b0K).  The employment of functional rhenium coated graphite instead of expensive, free-standing, components is an innovative way to reduce up to 84% of the weight and cost, while keeping the proven performance of rhenium.  An innovative deposition technique, known as EL-Form, was optimized in a Phase I investigation to manufacture RJC components for hot impact testing.

The Phase II work described here focuses on using data from an existing Ladar sensor to explore how high-dimensional spatial, spectral and polarimetric data can be used to detect and classify hidden targets.  The general approach will be to apply specific dimensionality reduction techniques to experimental data to map the data into a lower dimension feature space.  A point-surface invariant metric technique will be used to compare the identified features to a set of target CAD models.  The statistical properties of the resulting classification will be examined in terms of detectability, separability, and robustness to noise.  The following dimensionality reduction techniques will be explored: Diffusion Mapping and ISOMAP.",

        "abstract": "A research program is proposed on the integration of signal processing and electromagnetic modeling, to address the problem of performing ATR with targets possessing a high degree of variability. Sparseness is employed from two perspectives. First, in the signal processing component, sparse classifiers are developed, based on principled Bayesian techniques, which infer the scattering physics most relevant for ATR applications. This relevant scattering phenomenology is linked to the physical components of the target, to focus computational resources. By defining the sparse set of key scattering features, one implicitly infers which relatively small set of observables are most robust to target variability, while also providing discriminative power. The second area in which sparseness is employed is within the computational electromagnetic model. Compressive sensing employs the fact that the angle-frequency dependent scattered fields are typically sparsely rendered in an orthonormal basis (wavelets or DCT), and based upon this one need only perform a relatively small number of computations, from which the remaining computations may be inferred. By exploiting the joint information across multiple similar but distinct targets in a database, the number of compressive computations may be further reduced. The proposed research seeks to optimally integrate these processing and computational tools.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this proposal is to build a diagnostic Micro Power Radar (MPR) to track projectiles and detect voids during hard target penetration. Current smart fuzes use algorithms based on accelerometers output. This is problematic due to the mechanical noise introduced by impact, and the uncertain behavior demonstrated by penetrators under nearly identical test impacts. The addition of non-inertial sensors to the warhead could ameliorate the problems faced by current fuzes.  Tracking projectiles through sand utilizing microwave radar primarily depends on two factors, the radar cross section of the projectile and the loss through sand. In Phase I measurements were taken of two projectiles, a one-inch diameter and a half-inch diameter. Nose-on cross sections were too small to anticipate tracking head-on. RCS was measured 1 cm2 for the small target and the large target is approximately 5 cm2 RCS. From the side, both targets had reasonable cross sections and a tracking diagnostic instrument should not be restricted by the RCS of the targets.  Based on emitting and detecting very low amplitude and short voltage impulses, MPR has a sensitive window for accurately detecting reflections from boundaries between different materials. This should prove useful in detecting voids in targets.",

        "abstract": "Rhenium has been successfully demonstrated in tactical solid rocket motor applications because of its high melting point and strength at elevated temperatures. However, rhenium comes with a significant weight and cost penalty when used in monolithic form. Low-cost refractory ceramics such as hafnium carbide (HfC) have increased temperature capability, lower density, and are more chemically inert, but in unreinforced monolithic form they are susceptible to catastrophic thermal shock owing to poor toughness. In previous work, Ultramet developed and demonstrated a rapid, low-cost melt infiltration process for fabrication of net-shape, fiber-reinforced, high temperature ceramic matrix composites for liquid propellant combustion chambers operating at 4200\u00b0F. Melt infiltrated carbon fiber-reinforced zirconium carbide components have been tested to 5200\u00b0F by the Air Force with no erosion. In Phase I, Ultramet has successfully developed rapid melt infiltration processing of carbon fiber-reinforced hafnium carbide matrix (C/HfC) composites up to 2 inches thick. The processing is virtually independent of part size and shape, making it applicable for net-shape fabrication of pintles and throats for a broad variety of solid rocket motors. Although hafnium carbide has well-established thermochemical survivability in motors operating with reduced smoke propellants, this project is the first to demonstrate processing for a fiber-reinforced HfC composite. Alliant Techsystems (ATK) has expressed great interest in this technology for high-thrust reaction jet control valves in air-to-air missile attitude control systems and will team with Ultramet in Phase II for material and structure optimization and two series of hot-fire testing in a TC-1 type motor.",

For example, these modeling techniques can be applied to tactical missiles, especially in providing more realistic target signatures for early warning receiver design.  In addition, the application of these techniques to missiles flying at angle of attack provide a realistic 3-D scenario upon which to evaluate the newly developed tools and overall concept.\"",

This approach improves overall system effectiveness by increasing the ability to resolve high speed closely spaced objects, track maneuvering objects (boosting missiles and maneuvering/unstable reentry vehicles), and identify and destroy lethal objects within dense target clusters containing decoys and debris.  Intelligent Systems Research designed, developed and tested a prototype proof-of-concept system.

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses the application of new acoustic processing technologies to automatically identify and eliminate non-language speech sounds as a pre-processing stage to improve audio processing. Non-language speech sounds (coughing, breathing, \u2018ah,\u2019 \u2018uhmm\u2019) make up a large part of natural human language use, but contemporary speech recognition data preparation relies on hand-labeling of non-language speech sounds. The proposed work will extend, improve, and refine the capabilities of a computational model of auditory cortical processing based on multiscale spectro-temporal modulation features to the automated detection of non-language speech sounds. Advanced Acoustic Concepts and the University of Maryland have extensive experience applying the computational model to a variety of speech processing problems. Phase I results indicate that cortical processing algorithms are highly capable of identifying non-language speech sounds. Recognition algorithms will be trained and tested to distinguish non-language speech sounds collectively and individually, to classify them by individual type, and to determine accurate segmentation of the sound stream. Speech enhancement algorithms based on the same cortical processing model will be designed or adapted and applied to improve the identification of non-language speech sounds under noisy conditions. The feasibility of performing identification, classification, and segmentation in near real time will be demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "The United States Military has an urgent need to develop affordable phased array antennas supporting SATCOM on the move (OTM) capabilities. Currently-available SATCOM terminals rely on gimbaled dish antennas integrated with broadband feed structures. Although dish antenna technology is well suited for some commercial and military applications, the parabolic dish is not an optimal antenna solution for military SATCOM terminals. A phased array antenna is the only solution which will provide the data rates and beam agility required for OTM SATCOM terminals. However, in order to field an affordable phased array antenna, certain obstacles must be overcome in both the design and manufacture of the antenna and associated electronics (Tx/Rx modules, phase shifters, etc).  The proposed FIRST RF approach represents a dramatic departure from the conventional phased array architecture, and reduces cost and complexity and improves reliability. FIRST RF took a particularly aggressive approach during Phase I and built and tested passive arrays at Ku and Ka bands in order to validate the basic antenna architecture and construction process.  The objective of this SBIR Phase II effort is to build a fully active Ku-Band phased array to demonstrate the advantages and affordability of the new phased array architecture.",

At the lower level, the focus is on network/system security analysis, and the unique graphical models we develop are called attack graphs. Our proposed attack graph model is scalable, practical, powerful in analysis, and can efficiently provide situational awareness, prediction into the future, and optimized action planning. At the higher level, the graphical models capture the inherent dependency relationships of applications on networks/systems, and of missions on applications. By separating the modeling process and introducing the interfaces for integration, our proposed approach enables independent graphical model development at different levels and at the same time ensures interoperability. In Phase II, we will develop these technologies rigorously, which will provide powerful capabilities spanning from situational awareness and what-if analysis to damage assessment and action planning, in both top-down and bottom-up fashion. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that supports dynamic security analysis and integrates different levels of graphical models for coherent enterprise-wide network attack damage assessment. The developed models will be implemented into an automated software tool to aid the administrators in normal and attack situations.",

Furthermore, NanoSonic would apply its inkjet patterning process and proprietary dielectric materials for the efficient production of these radiating elements, frequency selective surfaces and dielectric substrates in a highly integrated multilayer structure. The full integration with a protective radome and an ultrahydrophobic coating for rapid water-shedding would produce a highly reliable antenna structure resistant to delamination and other failures, thus ensuring the highest capabilities once deployed.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II proposal describes a latching anti-tamper (AT) stress sensor (LATSS) for volumetric protection of military systems.  LATSS devices are intended to passively detect and remember if a change in some mechanical aspect of the shield enclosing a protected volume has occurred and provide a signal that can be queried to report the change.  They are based on spin dependent tunnel (SDT) junctions utilizing magnetostrictive ferromagnetic electrodes.  Magnetostrictive SDT junctions provide a unique combination of capabilities for an AT sensor.  The hysteretic magnetic behavior of the SDT electrodes provides the capability to record a change in stress without applied power.  The magnetoresistance of the SDT junctions permits electrical readout of the orientation of the magnetization of the ferromagnetic sensor electrodes, which is set by magnetostrictive coupling to the substrate strain. SDT devices can be fabricated using standard back end of line semiconductor processes, potentially making LATSS a low cost volumetric AT solution.  Because of their small size, several LATSS devices could be combined on the same substrate to produce a cryptokey memory, providing a new class of passive tamper-responsive cryptokey memory.  Additionally, SDT materials are intrinsically radiation hard, permitting development of radiation hard LATSS devices.",

The SOC technology should be small and have a low cost impact on the overall Zinc-Air battery.  Power consumption for the SOC technology should be minimal over the life of the Zinc-Air battery. In Phase I, a general SOC architecture and its deployment to characterize Zinc-Air battery SOC with respect to discharge rate and environmental factors was developed.  The major components of the architecture were (1) Coulomb counter, (2) microcontroller with RAM/ROM, (3) sensors to detect (one or more) of environmental factors, (4) analog preprocessing module and (5) a LED fuel gauge to visually indicate of SOC.  The following key factors were determined to influence the accuracy of a SOC system for Zinc-Air when not taken into account: (1) temperature and humidity; and (2) O2 exposure times, shelf life and storage time.  A Fuzzy Neural Network (FNN) enabled SOC algorithm was developed based on existing Zinc-Air constant discharge current performance data augmented by additional test data. The feasibility for developing and deploying a SOC indicator system for Zinc-Air batteries has been established. The primary goal of the proposed Phase II program is to develop and integrate prototype SOC indication technology for BA-8180/U (3rd generation) Zinc-Air batteries that accurately accounts for environmental and storage factors.  This includes the development and conducting of a test plan that will train the SOC indicator and evaluate its accuracy with BA-8180/U & BA-8140/U (4th generation) Zinc-Air batteries at various states of charge and under various environmental and storage conditions.  Finalize the selection of appropriate sensors (w.r.t. cost, size, power consumption), build and demonstrate one lot of prototype devices suitable for advanced laboratory and supervised field-testing.

The feasibility of the radar system was demonstrated through benchtop testing as well as with a compressor test rig that was designed, built, and commissioned by MSI during the Phase I project.

In addition to the focus on security, there will be many enhancements added to the Phase I prototype, including: a. Providing an emergency capability that will disseminate information to all devices regardless of the user preference b. A subscription capability so that the user can subscribe to data that is related to certain topics c. Allow the prototype to handle more service providers, devices and data types d. Allow the prototype to send and receive messages from a secure mobile device, such as: 1. the Sectera Edge Secure Mobile Environment \u2013 Portable Electronic Device (SME-PED) being developed by General Dynamics 2. the Guardian SME-PED being developed by L3-Communications 3. STU-III Cell Phones  e. Research conversion and compression algorithms to analyze whether they will add any benefit to the system The result will be a system that can provide the right information to the right people at the right time efficiently, automatically and reliably regardless of their location or equipment.",

Advanced image processing techniques will discriminate targets of interest from naturally occurring objects and events, with fewer than three false alarms per day for sensors operating in support of an individual CBP station. AUGS will employ SPEC s advanced, miniature LADAR technology in a tripwire sensor (with a range of 1 kilometer in adverse weather conditions) and an imaging camera, and will include adaptable, networked communications, anti-tamper mechanisms, and environmentally-appropriate camouflage. The AUGS system will be supported by small, unattended RF communications relay units, a handheld emplacement support device and a laptop-compatible, GUI-based software application for warning and report.

        "abstract": "To better quantify the benefits from the advanced microlens technology developed in the Phase I we plan to have microlenses installed in three astronomical telescopes. In Phase II we are planning to complete the fabrication of the remaining 4 microlenses  needed for Gemini telescope and ,also fabricate microlenses for SOR telescopes in New Mexico (NGAS)and Hawaii. This will provide a direct evaluation of advanced gray-scale technology from the end users point of view. Data will be collected from these telescopes to quantitify the performance improvements achieved. Our Plan also includes further development of gray-scale mask technology toward making smoother microlenses with better knife edge performance in Hartmann sensors. This will mean further development of phase-shift mask technology. We also plan on tackling the problem of larger format microlens arrays such as needed by (Thirty Meter Telescope) TMT.   BENEFIT:  The first commercial goal is to become the supplier of diffraction-limited anamorphic microlens arrays for Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensors in advance astronomical telescopes requiring multiple off axis artificial guide stars. The inclusion of such micro-lenses would allow Hubble like performance from grown based telescopes. The same technology that can produce these high quality anamorphic micro-lens arrays will have wide spread application to all micro-lens products. Current US market for micro-lens arrays is in excess of $30,000,000 dollars and supports several micro-lens and mask manufactures. The success of this SBIR would introduce a new more capable technology into the market place. This SBIR would advance the quality and sophistication of micro-optics manufacturing in the USA.\"",

This SBIR addresses the Navy\u2019s need for Next Generation Aircraft Wire Insulation.  Advancing current technology using next generation insulation will lead to reduced maintenance, fewer hazards and an increased overall life of aircraft wiring. In Phase I, Tiburon Associates, Inc. and team member University of Dayton Research Institute, investigated approaches to improve the chemical and hydrolytic stabilities of polyimide polymers.  Based on mechanical, chemical and electrical property and degradation testing, two polymer candidates, that met or exceeded Navy requirements, were selected for optimization.   Phase II will involve candidate optimization, additional testing after optimization, and on-wire sample testing.  Validations of on-wire insulation formulations will allow Tiburon to down select to one, optimal formulation.  The team\u2019s experience in aircraft wiring systems, expertise in synthesizing new polymer materials, and experience in transitioning technologies present aerospace communities with the opportunity to obtain durable, reliable, and environmentally compliant wiring insulation.

However, Petri Nets, as originally formulated, did not include the concept of time. Since, several extensions of Petri Net methodology have developed to address timing, though none meets all of the requirements for describing complex military and commercial architectures. The proposed investigation will identify a comprehensive methodology for describing timing and provide a strategy for implementing it in an executable architecture tool. Architectures that integrate communications and operations are difficult to describe and execute because these components evolve on significantly different time scales; therefore, a mixed-time resolution strategy is required.  Many systems and operations cannot be described well by the current generation of tools.  This effort proposes a new integrated software toolset:  Modeling and Simulation Studio will have the capability of integrating discrete event simulation, continuous event simulations and hybrid simulations of executable architecture in one Petri Net tool.",

These passive devices also had limited power output in the pulses due to mode competition above threshold and non-linear gain effects. With the introduction of the quantum dot gain media to semiconductor lasers, the ability to tailor the active region to the passively mode-locked laser cavity and thereby produce a low threshold, low noise condition, has led to superior performance and to a re-evaluation of the monolithic passively mode-locked semiconductor laser as an ultrashort pulse optical source.  The challenges, however, for quantum dot mode-locked lasers are to identify fundamental limitations to the pulse width such as non-linear gain and dispersion and to make the operation more robust.  In this Phase II SBIR, we will optimize key device parameters for more stable operation, higher power and wider operating range.

Currently, batteries limit the range and mission time of MAVs since the batteries contain a finite supply of energy. The proposed research is unique in that it considers the use of multiple EH sources along with both batteries and supercapacitors to store energy. Supercapacitors represent a highly reversible storage mechanism and can be used for energy buffering, primary storage for low-power subsystems, and parallel operation with batteries to reduce peak current demands on batteries. The proposed power supply functions are isolated from other vehicle subsystems by the use of a separate energy-efficient supervisory power control system so that the duty cycles of other subsystems can be optimized based on mission needs and availability of energy. Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is accomplished by efficient computational techniques and innovative hardware so that maximum efficiency is obtained from the EH sources. The supervisory control system also directs EH sources to either recharging functions or to direct application of power to other subsystems.

ISI proposes to build this software on its patented technology platform which provides the advantages of easy extensibility for additional data sources and applications, continuous upgrade while the system is live, software modification without core engine rebuild, and a modular design approach which makes simultaneous modification of domain logic and user interface possible. In Phase II, ISI will proceed through a software development cycle and deliver a usable prototype.",

A drastically simpler paradigm must emerge that uses elemental (COTS-like) thermal control modules that can be rapidly and reliably linked to enable a wide range of missions irrespective of the satellite and the orbital environment.  TA&T in collaboration with ATK Space and B&K Engineering propose a thermal control architecture consistent with the principles of responsive space. The proposed architecture is called the Satellite Modular And Reconfigurable Thermal System (SMARTS).  The Phase II project will continue and finallize the SMARTS architectural trade studies and perform detailed thermal modeling of a representative ORS spacecraft using SMARTS.  The analytical results will guide the design of a sub-scale test bed consisting of multiple panels and a radiator.

Inexpensive high performance Al/Gr composites have been developed with a quasi-isotropic thermal conductivity (TC) of 600 to 750 W/mK and corresponding thermal expansion (CTE) of 7 to 3 ppm/K.  CTE matching base plates for advanced multi-channel phased array radar systems enable hard (solder) bonded GaN packages for maximum thermal efficiency.  Either liquid cooled or forced air convection cooled base plate can be used for a multi channel array with high thermal dissipation requirements.  FEA thermal modeling will be used to design of the ~8 by 12\u201d baseplate.  The goal is a two to three-fold increase in power density in wide bandgap semiconductors and to manufacture radar arrays with greater than 100 channels on a single ~page sized baseplate.   In a parallel project, baseplates Al/Gr or Cu/Gr composites mounted with high performance single use devices will be cooled by liquid to vapor phase change material at the core of the baseplate.  This combined with direct die attach enabled by CTE matching results in high performance systems for limited duration missions.

Not only do cyber networks protect critical and sensitive information, they also enable vital functions both in the U.S. and abroad, in the military as well as in the commercial realm and are therefore a valuable target for international and domestic adversaries. Systems administrators and analysts are faced with a near-impossible task of defending its cyber assets and the processes that depend on them.  Given the difficulty of fully protecting large-scale networks through standard hardening techniques, network administrators require advanced security methods to support the detection and analysis of intrusions on their networks. To meet this need, 21st Century Technologies (21CT) proposes IMPACT, a solution providing immediate attack prediction capabilities and impact assessment that scales to infrastructures the size of the U.S. Military\u2019s systems. IMPACT will give analysts the capability required to define critical targets, enemy attack strategies, and given the current state of attack, the measure of detriment to Air Force missions. The proposed solution will specifically answer whether the attack or an attempt to disarm the attacker will affect the ability to hit targets or compromising soldier\u2019s lives.

        "abstract": "In this SBIR, Diversified Technologies, Inc. (DTI) proposes to design and demonstrate scalable solid state switches to meet the Navy\u2019s requirements for electromagnetic launchers that convert electrical energy into kinetic energy. One approximate requirement for kinetic ordinance is to accelerate a two kilogram projectile over a distance of 1 meter to 2 kilometers per second. In one launcher approach, the acceleration requires precisely timed high power pulses of energy  applied to each of the launcher\u2019s electromagnetic coils.  This massive amount of switched power requires peak currents nearly an order of magnitude higher than presently available from high speed, solid-state switch modules. The primary challenge in this effort is adapting DTl's technology in high voltage switching to the very high peak current required by the launcher. This SBlR proposal will focus on developing flexible power converters capable of accommodating a range of launcher designs, therefore demonstrating that this challenge can be met. In Phase II, DTI will utilize these switches to build a power converter suitable for demonstrating the full magnetic launcher concept.",

The work will build on Space Computer Corporation\u2019s existing HSI-CD system by making novel improvements to key processing elements: (1) precision registration, (2) adaptive spectral prediction and normalization, and (3) target signature matching and detection filtering. The registration effort will improve multi-look image alignment in complex backgrounds using precise geo-projection with fine-scale terrain elevation data combined with illumination insensitive scene-based registration refinement. Physically motivated spectral normalization procedures that enable pixel-level comparisons between different HSI passes over an area will be developed to augment or replace currently-used empirical transformations, providing more effective compensation of localized image variations introduced by the environment rather than by material changes. Similar methods will be used to obtain precise matching of material signatures to in-scene spectra, enabling the use of highly selective nonlinear spectral filters for discrimination of specific changes. The program aims to show significant improvements in change target sensitivity and false alarm rejection and to position HSI-CD technology for transition to one or more Air Force sensor programs.",

Therefore, the performance of speech processing applications (speech recognition and speaker identification applications, for example) depends on pre-processing to find the regions in the recording where speech is present.  Although current methods have had success isolating human speech from interfering background noise, these methods have not addressed non-language speech sounds (NLSS), i.e., sighs, coughing, and backchannel sounds (\u201cun-huh\u201d, \u201chmm\u201d, etc.). 21st Century Technologies (21CT) proposes Adjustable Adaptive Language speech Filter (AALF) as a robust NLSS filtering system that combines a signal processing feature extraction component, an adaptive machine learning mechanism that provides robustness to various input conditions, and a post-processing component that includes a user-specified detection threshold to tune AALF\u2019s performance for specific speech processing applications that follow.  AALF will improve the generation of actionable intelligence by decreasing the cost of creating speech training databases and improving the performance of speech processing applications.",

For proper hydration, the ideal drinking water temperature is below 71\u00b0F; however, in extreme temperatures, water that is sufficiently below body temperature is useful for hydration. It is also recommended that smaller amounts of water be consumed at frequent intervals rather than drinking occasional large volumes. To meet these requirements, a compact personnel hydration system cooler (CPHSC) that can be easily integrated into a Marine hydration pack is needed. Through its Phase I SBIR study, Technology Applications, Inc., has demonstrated the feasibility of a unique CPHSC that is compact, lightweight, quiet, produces no thermal signature, and requires no ground support equipment other than a small rechargeable battery. This cooling system is based upon evaporative cooling, which uses the large latent heat energy of water. Two concepts under development are a continuous-flow system, where water is cooled as it is consumed, and a batch cooling system, where a small quantity of water is cooled prior to drinking. Development of these systems will result in a CPHSC that supplies cool drinking water in sufficient quantity for optimum Marine hydration.",

In this SBIR program, CFDRC proposes to develop a novel fuel injection concept that injects a small percentage (~10%) of the fuel directly into the flameholder wake to control the wake fuel-air ratio.  Using a combined numerical/experimental approach in Phase I, the feasibility of the wake injection concept was demonstrated on a benchscale 0.75\u201d flameholder.  In Phase II, the wake fuel concept will be adapted to a more realistic 1.5\u201d flameholder that employs a closed V-gutter arrangement.  This flameholder will include two fuel circuits (main and wake) and flameholder cooling air discharging into the wake.  Three rounds of design, fabrication, and testing will be conducted; the first round focusing on the basic features of the design, the second round on design optimization, and the third round on testing a near engine-quality design.  At the end of Phase II, the concept will be at TRL 4 and ready for sector testing at GE in Phase III/CPP, followed by potential full engine testing.",

These new life rafts will be fabricated using Triton\u2019s novel fabric, developed during the Phase I that is made by applying a nanoparticle filled coating onto a base nylon fabric. The nanoparticle filled coating will provide improved gas barrier (for extended use times), abrasion and temperature resistance (improved durability) at thinner coating thicknesses (lighter weight). The base nylon fabric will provide the necessary strength to the structure. During the Phase I Triton successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the approach and fabricated coated fabrics based on its proposed concept that showed significant improvements over current fabrics but at reduced weight. In the Phase II we will optimize and scale up the fabric development and fabricate a prototype life raft to demonstrate the benefits. Triton has gained the interest of a large commercial life raft manufacture which should enable quick transition of the technology to commercial application.",

It has become increasingly clear that strategy, operational plans, and implementing procedures must occur in the context of these local cultural constraints in order to be effective. The U.S. Army is exploring simulation-based training tools for training the skills needed for success in culturally situated and sensitive missions. The modeling and simulation of culturally believable agents for such applications is a difficult and expensive proposition. Consequently, we propose to develop and evaluate Culturally Aware Agents for Training Environments (CAATE), a modeling and simulation tool for affordably creating software agents that embody local culture and belief sets to drive realistic, situationally relevant and culturally believable behaviors during simulated training missions. By focusing on the social and cultural elements that most affect mission success, we believe we can ensure problem tractability and solution feasibility. CAATE embodies sound didactic principles, uses social network models for modeling the social and cultural situation, and supports the development of human behavior models that display appropriate cultural behaviors.",

Our Phase I efforts present a basic version of an integrated architecture for network service. In Phase II, we will further refine the architecture by including new service elements, aiming to develop a complete solution for network services in ANs. The network services we will address include address configuration, name resolution, time synchronization, security services, and policy services. Although not all the network services are described in detail, the proposed integrated architecture is believed to be capable of accommodating other services. The significant advantages of the proposed approach can be summarized as follows: 1) it is impervious to network dynamics; 2) it can operate autonomously without connectivity to ground nodes; 3) the distributed hierarchical network service structure improves scalability, reliability and robustness; and 4) as we implement different services in a common basis, server election, service advertisement/discovery, and service architecture maintenance are performed by the common distributed clustering process, which in turn renders efficiency. To our best knowledge, our work represents the first complete solution that provides robust, scalable, auto-configurable and efficient network service support for ANs.",

Cooperative decision making and problem solving is hard for people who have different languages, priorities, and incentives, and is even more difficult with the participation of non-human agents with inscrutable behaviors to people. A fundamental challenge is in developing artificial agents that collaborate in a natural way with humans in order to utilize individual expertise to benefit the whole. Our innovation is a shared intelligence framework, a constrained, but still widely-applicable, role of human agent collaboration (HAC), for managing human-agent teams and ultimately facilitating both human-agent cooperative tasks and human-to-human activity coordination. Our approach addresses the overall problem of cooperative intelligent behavior by splitting it into two sections, where collaborative decision-making falls on the shoulders of human experts who work together (possibly through agent intermediaries), but where the generation and flexible adaptation of the expert team is conducted through HAC.",

The miniature high power density Meyer Nutating Disk Engine designed during the Phase I effort is a dual disk engine designed to produce a maximum output of 6-7 Hp at 4,000 rpm.  The compact size, inherent to the nutating design, packages this engine within a 4\u201d diameter and 7.5\u201d overall length, weighing 8.2 pounds, with a Power to Weight Ratio (BHp/lb) of .82. Heavy fueled operation allows this engine to operate efficiently at reduced rpm and light loads extending mission length for loitering conditions. Engine operation is permissible at elevations up to 15,000 feet at reduced output levels. Initial development work has been completed on the Meyer Nutating Disk Engine concept, including a 150 target horsepower proof-of-principal engine, with a second generation prototype underway.

A number of supercomputing, workstation, and embedded computing hardware platforms have emerged recently to supply FPGA computing power for these applications. Unfortunately, developing for these platforms is currently a long, difficult and error-prone process. While a number of commercial software tools are emerging to facilitate programming beyond VHDL, the high-level application mapping problem to heterogeneous complexes of general purpose processors and FPGAs is still a complex manual programming task. In this  Phase II SBIR project, we will modify the R-Stream\u00c2\u00ae high-level compiler to automatically map programs expressed in C to such heterogeneous complexes. This technology will be applicable to a range of system targets including supercomputers, workstations, and high performance embedded computing systems.

Electronics subsystems are critical components of modern weapons systems and are extensively employed throughout the DoD.  It is therefore critical to protect these technologies and avoid their exploitation in such a way that may reduce a weapon system\u2019s effectiveness. In this Phase II SBIR program, Infoscitex Corporation (IST) proposes the continued development of an anti-tamper (AT) solution that promises to bridge capability gaps indicative of existing AT solutions.  The light-curable anti-tamper coating (LCATC) demonstrated in Phase I will be refined to ensure protection against a range of reverse engineering techniques.  An application process scalable to meet foreseeable demands from the DoD will be developed.  The Phase II program will culminate with a round of reverse engineering challenges, which will demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of IST\u2019s LCATC.",

The challenge addressed in this SBIR project is how to exploit fully the unique capabilities of heterogeneous teams composed of a mixture of Robots, Agents or Persons (RAPs); that is, how to improve the safety, efficiency, reliability and cost of achieving mission goals while maintaining dynamic adaptation to the unique limitations and contingencies of a real-world operating environment.  Our response to this challenge is to create a new infrastructure that will facilitate cooperative and collaborative performance of human and robots as equal team partners through the application of advances in goal-oriented, multiagent planning and coordination technology.  At the heart of our approach is the USC TEAMCORE Group\u2019s Machinetta, a state-of-the-art robot proxy framework with adjustable autonomy (Schurr et al 2005). Machinetta facilitates robot-human role allocation decisions and collaborative sharing of team tasks in the non-deterministic and unpredictable military environment through the use of a domain-independent teamwork model that supports flexible teamwork.",

        "abstract": "Miller Fasteners made from 2-D laminates represent the state of the art in joining CMC panels to metal frames.  Despite its success, the extant Miller fastener design is limited by its construction from a laminate of 2-D fabric.  The resultant fastener part has poor interlaminar shear strength, and its manufacture and application entails high machining costs and high material scrap rates.  3TEX, in collaboration with COI Ceramics, will design, model, and demonstrate CMC Miller Fasteners based on 3-D braided fiber architectures.  This improved fastener addresses each of the concerns with the existing design.  The intertwined 3-D braided fiber architecture has no layers, thus no fracture-prone interlaminar regions. This will lead directly to higher out-of-plane stiffness and strength, and increased fracture toughness.  The braided preforms are near net shape and would reduce costs through less machining and material waste.  In Phase I, C/SiC 3-D braided Miller Fasteners demonstrated feasibility.  For Phase II, SiC fiber 3-D braided preforms with integral head shaping will be manufactured, infiltrated with SiC matrix and tested.  This effort will advance their Technology Readiness Level  to 6 and perform subcomponent testing in a relevant environment.",

Combustion Science & Engineering, Inc. proposes to develop a robust reduced kinetic modeling strategy for aviation fuels that can be coupled with unsteady flow models such as LES to simulate static stability limits in augmentors.  In this approach, the fuel molecule  will be represented by a global reactions step, while a detailed reaction sub-set will be used for CH2O/H2/O2 scheme for accurate predictions of non-equilibrium phenomena such as ignition and extinction.  Various turbulence/mixing models will be evaluated and optimum set of models will be chosen to couple with reduced kinetic model for CFDC simulation to predict flame propagation and static stability limits (i.e., ignition and extinction) under augmentor operating conditions.  Measurements of important fundamental kinetic parameters in vitiated conditions will be made to validate the reaction schemes.",

This capability is envisioned as an executive agent, that would ultimately become a critical component of SBT/SBE systems. The automated scenario/script builder is envisioned as a graphical, standards-compliant software application that employs non-proprietary implementation with open interfaces for ease of integration and with facilities for workflow monitoring during simulated execution. In Phase I, we developed a prototype of this system to provide convincing technical evidence of graphical workflow design and execution. Phase II will produce a working prototype of the scenario/script building framework, a test and integration plan, and initial estimates of operation and maintenance.

Fortunately, enough progress has been made in many areas to enable realistically envisioning robots with a significant level of autonomy working cooperatively with humans in heterogeneous teams to perform highly-constrained tactical maneuvers (e.g., clearing a room). Phase II of FIGHT-R research and development is focused on 5 principal objectives to achieve this goal: add mechanisms to handle inter-role conflict, increase resilience when team member \"sick\", do empirical testing of new/old roles in simulation, and on robots, and demonstrate flexibility of approach both in adding tactical maneuvers and in reusing on various robots.

While LSP is a mature and reliable manufacturing process, slight anomalies during the process or variations in material ductility can cause small subsurface cracks to form in the resultant LSP processed material. Most existing NDE techniques are not sensitive enough to detect these cracks. The emerging Thermosonic imaging technique has proven to be capable of detecting very small surface and subsurface cracks formed during the LSP process. To validate the test results and enable the instrumental calibration of a thermosonic imaging system for specific components, calibration standards with real cracks must be produced.  In this proposal, Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI) proposes an innovative approach for the development of calibration standards for thermosonic NDE.

However, realizing this potential is currently a time-consuming, manually intensive task requiring days or weeks to produce actionable intelligence. To reduce the analysis time and the analyst workload we propose to develop a family of graphical analysis tools for automated GMTI link discovery. Our approach extracts key track-to-track relationships from MTI (or other INT) data to produce a large directed graph, enabling the application of computationally efficient algorithms which have been developed to perform link analysis on very large graphs. Because our approach transforms the data from tracks to a discrete nodes and links, it simplifies difficult problems of multi-INT correlation and fusion, avoids the need for long track lifetimes, and still retains the information needed for forensic analysis. We also apply recent extensions of scan statistic methods to graphical data to detect interesting relationships from noisy graph data. These methods allow users to incorporate information about data uncertainty and to get back quantitative confidence measures for the discovered linkages, helping users to determine if there is adequate information for making decisions.",

        "abstract": "Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), which uses a gasilier to convert coal to fuel gas, and then uses a combined cycle power block to generate electricity. is one of the most promising technologies for generating electricity from coal in an environmentally sustainable way. IGCC has many advantages over traditional technologies including: higher efficiency, lower pollutant emissions, and a possibility of carbon capture and sequestration. One of the remaining challenges for the IGCC is the need to develop a cleanup technology to remove reduced sulfur and nitrogen compounds from the hot fuel gas at gasification operating temperatures.\n\n\n\nNanoScale Corporation proposed development of nanocrystalline sorbents and catalysts for hot gas cleanup technology to allow for removal of reduced sulfur (H2S and COS) and ammonia pollutants from coal-generated fuel gases at gasification operating temperatures. In Phase I, several sorbents and catalysts were synthesized and evaluated with real fuel gas from the gasifier at Western Research Institute (WRI). These sorbents and catalysts were tailored to selectively react with reduced sulfur and nitrogen compounds present in fuel gas and were found to be immune to other components of the fuel gas. Two materials, a sorbent for removal of reduced sulfur pollutants and a catalyst for ammonia decomposition, were found to be particularly effective approach proposed by NanoScale utilizes manufacturing methods that are easily scalable, cost efficient, and environmentally friendly.\n\n\n\nIn the proposed Phase II project, the most effective Phase I materials will be optimized, and their ideal predominance parameters will also be determined to enable most efficient operation under IGCC fuel gas conditions. The testing will include both laboratory scale experiments, as well as pilot-scale demonstrations with real fuel gas at WRI. The results of the proposed project should clearly demonstrate the advantage of using nanocrystalline materials for hot fuel gas cleanup and the feasibility of the NanoScale approach.\n\n\n\nThe proposed project offers environmental benefits that can revolutionize current control methods by providing sorbent and catalyst materials that are technically superior to existing materials. Possible applications of the proposed technology include IGCC plants and other pollution control systems. Benefits offered by nanocrystalline sorbents, including enhanced chemical kinetics and increased removal capacities, have been demonstrated for many toxic chemicals and pollutants.\n\n\n\nNanoScale is uniquely qualified for the proposed development since it is a leader in the field of reactive nanocrystalline materials.",

        "abstract": "There is growing concern about how to limit the release of mercury into the environment.  One significant source of mercury is found in fluorescent lamps.  Recently, however, compact fluorescent lamps have been heavily promoted in order to conserve electrical energy.  While it is true that switching to energy efficient lighting is one of the easiest ways to save energy, reduce CO2 emissions, and save money in the short-term, fluorescent lighting is not the ideal long-term solution precisely because fluorescent lamps contain toxic mercury vapor.  Solid state lighting (SSL), on the other hand, holds even greater promise.  White LEDs are already more efficient than fluorescent lamps, do not contain heavy metal toxins, and are available with decent color rendering abilities.  What holds SSL back is the high price per lumen ration.  Only if the cost can be reduced with SSL be able to make significant progress in replacing incandescent and fluorescent lighting.  One way to do this is to improve the luminous efficiency of the white LEDs so that more light is emitted at the same price.\n\n\n\nNN-Labs proposes to complete line of transition-metal doped semiconductor nanocrystals (D-dots &trade;) to be used as nanophosphors for white LEDs.  Current white LEDs rely on micron-sized phosphors that suffer up to 50% losses in efficiency due to backscattering of fluorescence.  Nano-sized phosphors, because they are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light, do not scatter light.  By using D-dots &trade; nanophosphors, white LEDs could improve their luminous efficiencies up to 100% compared with bulk phosphors.  Furthermore, D-dots &trade; are more ideally suited for use in LEDs than other kinds of nanophosphors, such as quantum dots, because D-dots &trade; are immune to re-absorption losses that plague intrinsic nanocrystal emitters.\n\n\n\nThis SBIR Phase II project will develop a full spectrum of D-dots &trade; emitters with high photoluminescence quantum yields, optimal absorption profiles, and long photo and thermal stability lifetimes required of high brightness (HB) LED phosphors.  Also, NN-Labs will work together with its industrial collaborator, Dow Corning, to develop manophosphor/encapsulant composites and fully integrate them into HB LED manufacturing processes.\n\n\n\nThe market for HB LEDs was $4.2 billion in 2006 and is expected to grown to $9 billion in 2009.  Estimations show the LED Phosphor market associated with HB white LEDs was $180 million in 2006 and should reach $2.3 billion by 2015.  NN-Labs predicts revenue from sales of D-dots &trade; to reach $383 million by 2015.",

Surprisingly, we have also found great interest in industrial applications for the tine product remaining after screening the G-sand for the granule application. With these recently gained insights Lesktcch Limited is confident that commercial and industrial applications can be found to re-utilize 100%, of the stamp-sand by-product now exposed upon Lake Superior shorelines along the Keweenaw Peninsula in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

The G-sand will be sized and stored to keep the material dry: shingle manufacturer specifications require granules to not exceed 1% moisture so as to assure the asphalt is capable of adhering to the mineral. Industrial sized testing trials will be negotiated with companies such as Johns Manville to process the required amount of G-sand in order 10 accommodate each plants requirement; we foresee test batches of up to 20 tons per plant. The remaining fines material will have a representative portion removed and submitted to scientists at the Institute of Materials Processing (IMP) Michigan Technological University (MTU) for industrial application testing.

        "abstract": "This program exceeded all key milestones. Using cellulose Waste, CMS demonstrated novel ethanol drying membranes via small scale dephlegmation process that yields fuel grade ethanol (FGE) at a lower cost than large switch grass ethanol plants. This success yields positive value for cellulose waste. We achieved targeted EPA goals of developing low cost environmentally friendly systems to enhance recovery of waste streams. In addition to this success we have lined up key partners for both the fabrication of membrane systems as well as field testing in related applications.\n\n\n\nIn Phase I, we fabricated chemically resistant hollow fiber (HF) membrane modules that had desired chemical resistance and transport properties consistent with the goals associated with the final ethanol drying step in small scale manufacturing processes. There was success with flat sheet systems for ethanol-water separation and though HF and flat sheet systems provided excellent performance results, HF is preferred in Phase II. This is because of excellent relationships with commercial partners combined with associated better design and cost features. Using the HF membranes prepared in the earlier tasks, we evaluated these materials specifically under \n\nconditions consistent with small scale ethanol manufacturing sites for both liquid phase and vapor phase separation of water from ethanol. We obtained excellent flux and separation. This included very high water transport rates and very high water-ethanol separations factors. This excellent flux and separation in combination with stability was demonstrated over a wide range of operating conditions.\n\n\n\nLong term testing showed the membranes had excellent stability. This is consistent with parallel result, and also consistent with the chemistry of the CMS materials. Reviewers had concerns related to CMS membrane water/ethanol selectivity but tests in Phase I showed excellent water/ethanol separation which likely related to the unique chemistry of the CMS membranes.\n\n\n\nWe took lab results and put them into the small scale membrane module/dephelmation system published by Leland Vane from the EPA and comparing to published results from the Department of Energy on FGE costs. We demonstrated CMS membrane drying costs were actually less than large scale molecular sieve driers. Most important results showed that waste stream cellulose stream actually had significant positive value ($16-$18/ton).\n\n\n\nPhase II will build and evaluate pilot system. Fortunately we have established a number of key relationships with membrane suppliers, ethanol engineering design firms and the EPA test sites.  This positions CMS well for both Phase II success and subsequent commercialization.",

The KSE upgrading technology does not require extensive supporting services, such as a hydrogen plant. The technology produces \u201cgreen\u201d propane, derived solely from renewable materials that are byproducts of biodiesel manufacture.\n\n\n\nIf biodiesel is produced to meet only 3% of the U.S. diesel fuel demand, over 1.8 billion pounds of glycerol, also known as glycerin, will be coproduced. The current annual worldwide demand for glycerol is only 0.5 billion pounds. As a result, the oversupply of glycerol has already depressed glycerol prices in the U.S. and in Europe. Not only will biodiesel economics thereby be depressed, but also the physical disposition of byproduct glycerol becomes a challenge. Hence, to fully exploit the potential of biodiesel, an effective glycerol upgrading technology is needed, the project of the current proposed research.\n\n\n\nThe program entails the development of new catalyst compositions for the glycerol conversion reactions: laboratory studies demonstrating the performance of the technology, including catalyst activity and selectivity: and economic analyses and life cycle assessments to demonstrate economic performance. Based on Phase I results. technology can be developed which converts glycerol into \"green\" propane at uniquely high yields, producing a high valued biofuels product with a large and dispersed market. The technology is simple, does not require an external source of hydrogen, and is inexpensive to build and operate. Even with Phase I economics, the KSE technology provides propane at manufacturing costs substantially below market clearing prices for propane. When the development program is completed, the Phase II technology can he utilized today, with current prices, to produce \"green\" propane, and will support more rapid exploitation of biodiesel as a component of the national energy balance The Phase I technology is clearly technically feasible and economically viable. It. is anticipated that tile application of the technology will significantly improve the economics of biodiesel production for the dispersed group of biodiesel plants in the US, and provide an economic disposition for the major quantities of byproduct glycerol, thereby facilitating rapid introduction of economic biodiesel manufacturing operations.",

        "abstract": "Although water recycle and reuse is considered good environmental practice, its implementation is highly dependent upon the economics and hence can be challenging to implement. An example is the recovery of low quality heat as water condensate from industrial flue gases. In this case, tremendous quantities of energy and water are lost out the stack in the US today, since no conventional condensing technology is economically viable. In this proposal, we present a unique technology/process, the Transport Membrane Condenser (TMC), to recover water with concomitant energy recovery from these low quality industrial emissions. As a specific example, industrial boilers account for nearly 35% of US industrial energy consumption. It is estimated that about 70 billion gallons of water per year are available in the combustion flue gas generated from these boilers. Our TMC technology can be used to recover the water vapor and energy from this flue gas for boiler feed water makeup. Prior to the Phase I submission, our pilot testing of the proposed TMC demonstrated the technical feasibility for high purity water recovery from the flue gas with concomitant heat recovery. However, its payback period exceeded the targeted one year set by our commercialization partner During Phase I avenues for cost reduction and performance enhancement with the modification of our existing commercial membranes have been identified and evaluated using a bench-top unit simulated the flue gas environment. We were able to achieve a 60% reduction In capital cost of the TMC element via significant enhancement of the membrane efficiency and reduction in the production costs. This reduction was well in excess of the 33 to 50% reduction necessary to deliver a one year capital payback as required by our commercialization partner. In this Phase II proposal, we will develop this modified membrane, verify its functional performance in a finalized module configuration, and conduct membrane manufacturing development while assisting our commercialization partners in preparing the technology/product/system for field demonstration The successful completion of this proposed Phase II project will produce a commercially viable \u201ctrue\u201d green process for water conservation and reuse along with significant energy savings. In addition to the boiler flue, during Phase I, additional water recycle/reuse and energy recovery was identify by our proposed technology for numerous industrial emission streams. Further, this transport membrane condenser can offer a truly \"green\" agricultural greenhouse operation via water recycle. energy storage/reuse, humidity control, and elimination of fungicide use.",

        "abstract": "Because of the large number of objects in a BMD threat cloud, discrimination of an RV from debris and decoys stresses the radar and processor resources available in the BMDS.  During Phase I, MARK Resources developed several relatively simple algorithms for the detection of a physical feature characteristic either of debris or of threat objects, and we demonstrated the feasibility of quickly and efficiently rejecting debris on the basis of its physical rather than statistical characteristics.  Using simulated data, we successfully applied these algorithms over a broad range of conditions, in terms of engagement geometry, debris and threat characteristics and motions, and radar parameters.  The algorithms were designed so that they will be straightforward to automate.  During Phase II, we propose to refine and automate the debris simulation and rejection algorithms developed in Phase I; to demonstrate the fidelity of the debris simulation algorithms and the effectiveness of the debris rejection algorithms through Monte Carlo testing; and to establish the capability of the debris rejection algorithms to work in real time in BMD radar processors.  In order to facilitate transition into the BMDS, we have teamed with Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems\u2019 BMDS Integration Program group.",

During this effort, a Concept of Operations (CONOPS) was developed, decomposed, and translated to functional requirements. From the requirements, enabling capabilities and technologies were identified to meet these challenges.  Critical enabling technologies in collision avoidance and landing zone selection were accomplished under company own funds.  These demonstrations validated the state of current technology and identified implementation risks.  The Phase II approach is to prepare and conduct a demonstration that integrates these enabling technologies on an autonomous VTOL UAV.  The demonstration will follow a scenario calling for the delivery from a battalion aid station of an LSTAT and supplies to a simulated casualty at a set of reported coordinates.  The scenario mission will demonstrate the five following enabling capabilities;   a) Navigate through urban or wooded terrain to combat injury site;   b) Select suitable site for autonomous landing and take-off with minimal human guidance;   c) Safely land and take-off autonomously (with minimal human intervention); d) Communicate with human medic team members; and e) Carry a payload of medical supplies and equipment to include an LSTAT to the site of injury.",

Extending the notion of data models or object models, an ontology can provide rich semantic definition not only to the meta-data but also to the instance data of domain knowledge, making these semantic definitions available in machine readable form. While the value and potential of a well structured ontology is rarely debatable, the promise of ontology is infrequently realized due to the labor extensive process and specialized skill set required to develop an effective ontology. The ability of ontologies to learn, or evolve to changing information structure is critical to maximizing their benefits to solve key knowledge management challenges within a net-centric environment. The Securboration Team has developed an innovative approach to break the main barrier which prevents self-learning of ontologies: the ability to understand the meaning of artifacts and relationships the artifacts have to the domain space. Our approach, called Ontology Generation and Evolution Processor (OGEP), leverages existing lexical to ontological mappings integrated in an innovative approach to semantic-based ontology generation.",

        "abstract": "Future supersonic missiles can be improved through the use of polymer matrix composites (PMCs) for structural airframes.  However the severe aerodynamic heating conditions will expose the structure to short term temperatures and stresses that are beyond those typically seen by these materials.  Nevertheless because the airframes are required to survive these conditions for very short times, it may be possible to employ PMCs as primary structural materials.  Designs using these materials are presently limited by the lack of a consistent database that reflects the property degradation caused by severe short term thermal exposure.  Materials Research & Design, Inc. (MR&D) proposes to continue the Phase I effort to develop a design method and supporting database that will enable the use of PMCs in short term, high temperature applications.  The overall goal of the Phase II program is to demonstrate the use of PMCs as a missile structure that is exposed to extreme, short term thermal loads.  The structure may include the Phase I ra-dome, or the fuselage, fairings, control surfaces, strakes, or fins.  Specific objectives of the Phase II effort are separated into Part A and Part B. The goal of Part A will be to compare a degraded PMC design to a baseline design in terms of weight, cost, and performance to show that the use of PMCs offers real system benefits.  The goal of Part B will be to fabricate a PMC subcomponent suitable for government sponsored testing in a high temperature wind tunnel.  The Phase II program will include tasks that address design and analysis, material fabrication, assessment of high heating rate behavior, creation of a thermostructural database, and manufacture of a representative missile subcomponent.  Another important outcome of the project will be a micromechanical model for use by the Navy and its contractors to design degrading PMCs with other fiber architectures, heating rates, etc.   The program will be performed by a team of MR&D, Raytheon Missile Systems, Physical Sciences, Inc. (PSI), and Southern Research Institute (SoRI).  MR&D will manage the program, develop the material model, design and analyze the missile component, and prepare the reports.  Raytheon will guide the study, provide system information, and fabricate a selected high temperature PMC materials and subcomponents.  PSI will simulate aerodynamic heat loads using the Laser Hardened Materials Evaluation Laboratory (LHMEL) at Wright-Patterson and define effective properties under high heating rates    SoRI will generate the database by characterizing the material under conditions of short term, high temperature thermostructural loads.  The MR&D team is uniquely suited to perform the proposed effort because of previous experience on the SM-3 Gr/BMI nosecone and in-depth knowledge of the thermal degradation of PMCs under severe aerothermal loads.",

The gyrotron uses the smallest cavity, ~2.2 cm long, in the TE021 mode which will permit operation down to 100 kWCW at high efficiency and allow the smallest magnet. The main magnet that produces the 18 kG cavity field is only 15 cm OD by 7 cm long with a 12 mm ID clear bore. This very compact small bore design, to minimize the coil power of the electromagnet, has ample space for coolants. The power required for the main 18 kG magnet is only about 4.6 kW, not including the coil power for the 0.8 kG MIG field or a collector. This compares to about 7 kWCW of rf Ohmic loss in the cavity at 100 kWCW output. The coils are copper foil wound and edge cooled by attached water-cooled copper plates. The 50 kV MIG produces ~10% axial velocity spread at an alpha of 2.0.",

During this USAF SBIR Phase I project TDA employed its new chemistry to formulate an improved liquid shim, the formulation of which was optimized to meet a selected set of properties as specified by USAF and its contractors.   In Phase II TDA will continue to optimize its shim to meet the complete set of requirements.

But these new data flows introduce security risks as sensitive information passes outside of the domain where it was created.  To mitigate this risk, the originators of information must assert control over the dissemination of sensitive information, and the receivers of information must verify that this sensitive information was disseminated by trustworthy and valid sources.  In both cases, detailed and accurate metadata must be provided with the assurance that it cannot be compromised to misrepresent the associated information.

MetaSAFE will provide secure association of information with its metadata, and a secure trail of assertions, signed by trusted sources, verifying the metadata.

SENTINEL checks the electronic power signature that characterizes a volume operating in its environment.  Any volume of or individual analog, digital, or RF elements of any system has a unique power signature on the supply voltage line(s), due to the unique combination of components in the system and their individual activation sequences, which combine to form a signature that is unique to the operating environment in which the element functions.  We exploit this signature in a simple system which detects the signature, compares it with an expected one stored within it at activation, and then responds to a detected tampering situation with a reaction that prevents reverse engineering.  It can be implemented in any volume, at subsystem, board, MCM, module, or chip levels.  Phase II will produce (1) proof-of-concept, tested prototypes, (2) performance and exploitation testing and demonstration results, (3) a comprehensive system design to carry forward into Phase III or transition, and (5) specific commercialization and transition plans.

The system is based on hyperspectral H2O absorption tomography.  Senor light from a rugged, high-power time-division multiplexed (TDM) source is distributed to 18 beams.  The beams are judiciously arranged to obtain high spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio.  The gas properties are reconstructed using a newly developed tomographic reconstruction algorithm.  The high-frame-rate images will capture the dominant spatial and temporal instability modes in the augmentor along with their interaction and spatio-temporal evolution.  The TDM source will repeatedly cycle through 19 different wavelengths, spending 440 ns on each one, to sample many key features in the H2O absorption spectrum.  The proposed solution uses advanced hyperspectral sources (rather than traditional diode lasers) to monitor H2O absorption features, offering higher performance and straightforward inclusion of additional wavelengths needed to detect other important combustion species.  Despite using absorption spectroscopy for determining the temperature and H2O concentration, this technology is fundamentally different from typical diode laser-based absorption sensors and has many advantages, specifically, allowing the acquisition of many spectral features covering a wide spectral range at very high speeds (typically 30 kHz) and thereby providing better temperature accuracy and spatial resolution.",

A user-friendly interface will enable easy set-up of missile defense scenarios, sophisticated visualization options, performance analyses and design studies. Furthermore, the simulation tool will be expandable and compatible with third-party missile modeling tools.",

PRA proposes to further develop the target metrics and processing algorithms that were developed in Phase I by validating the algorithm performance in both a high-fidelity simulation and a data-collection experiment.  These metrics use the spatial and temporal correlation to measure relative state parameters and then bootstrap up to absolute parameters.  The primary advantage to the PRA proposed solution is that it provides MDA with a cost-effective approach to enhance the existing BMD infrastructure.  The PRA solution requires no hardware modifications to current capability but instead will utilize PRA\u2019s algorithms to extend current BMD performance.  In Phase I, PRA developed target metrics and processing algorithms that utilize its unique atmospheric characterization measurement systems.  In Phase II, PRA proposes to validate the radar metrics and processing algorithms using accredited BMD simulations and operational early warning radars and will work with Lockheed Martin in a Phase III effort to implement and test the algorithms into a BMD radar facility.",

Monitoring of ice formation and current methods of subsequent removal also requires a large investment of resources, and has negative environmental effects. The development of novel coatings that minimize ice accretion and removal time from aircraft would greatly benefit both the civilian and military aviation industries. In the Phase 2 research program we propose to systematically evaluate the anti-ice performance of our nanocomposite coatings in a variety of atmospheric conditions that may be encountered in-flight and on the ground. Tests will include static ice adhesion assays and ice accretion studies on aerodynamic shaped substrates using an icing wind tunnel.

The large civilian market for lasers and detectors that operate at the eye-safe 1.55 \u00b5m fiber attenuation minimum ensures a stable and diverse manufacturing base to support NGARS technology, and market-driven improvements of yield, uniformity, cost, and performance. The advanced receiver technology developed by this program can readily be adapted to civilian applications. In Phase I, Voxtel demonstrated a monolithic multi-stage InGaAs APD design with gains exceeding 2000, with greatly reduced multiplication noise, and characteristics compatible with linear-mode SWIR single photon counting.

        "abstract": "Silicon Space Technology (SST) demonstrated during Phase I that astute modifications to a commercial CMOS process can yield significant improvement to Texas Instruments (TI) DSP circuits' radiation hardness.  SST developed a practical approach for Harden By Isolation (HBI) integration into two existing TI DSP IC products (250nm VC33 and 180nm C2812).  The resulting conclusion is that SST's HBI approach can be integrated via relatively minor changes to the circuit layout in combination with SST's process modules.  This proposed program will use this methodology to produce radiation hardened versions of two DSP's--250nm VC33 and 130nm C6727.  It is expected the resultant RH circuits will be hardened to a total ionizing dose level >300 Krad, a dose rate of 7e9 rad(Si)/sec, and be latch-up immune--all without the large cost in area, speed and resources required by incumbent \"Harden By Design\" (HBD) approaches.  If successful, these products will demonstrate that families of TI products can be made available for space and military use through qualification of RH processes rather than individual HBD parts.  A radiation-hardened process capability at Texas Instruments will enable a broad supply of radiation-hardened ASIC's, memories and standard products required for systems being developed for MDA.",

A photodiode is composed of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) being in junction with the semiconductor.  This new concept is based on the effect of reduced electron-phonon coupling in quasi one-dimensional CNTs, which considerably suppress the thermal noise and enables higher detector operational temperatures. Semiconducting CNTs are known to exhibit the inverse proportional dependence of the band gap on the nanotube diameter. Thus, the variation of the CNT diameter allows to control the detector operational range.  Another type of photodetector is based on the bolometric response of suspended CNTs.  This new approach is to gain an advantage over traditionally used II-VI and III-V bulk compounds and related nanostructures for IR detection. Simple and cost effective fabrication (wet processing)  combined with robust and easy to control electro-optical properties allow making CNT-based detectors with reduced noise, smaller in size, with lower power requirements  and at a low fabrication cost.  In Phase I we demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed concept. In Phase II we will fabricate multi-spectral, nanoscale, uncooled IR detectors and demonstrate the performance of this innovative technology at the seekers level through laboratory and field tests.",

        "abstract": "Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) is currently used as a transparent electrically conductive coating on aircraft canopies to provide electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding for electronic components. The problem with ITO is that it is relatively soft and scratches easily, requiring frequent replacement of the windscreen, leading to high maintenance costs and aircraft downtime. In addition, ITO is applied by custom equipment using extremely laborious vapor deposition processes, which are expensive, complicated to operate and tend to produce low yield rates. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of using a specialized process to deposit aluminum zinc oxide (AZO) and indium zinc oxide (IZO) transparent conductive coatings as a replacement to ITO. The advantage of both AZO and IZO is that they have hardnesses that are significantly greater than that of ITO and are thus much more scratch resistant and durable than ITO. The deposition process that will be used is much simpler and more forgiving than vapor deposition, producing higher yield rates and less expensive coatings.",

        "abstract": "Viscosity and low temperature lubricant characteristics determine turbine engine starting capability, and lubricant motion with respect to the contact surfaces at low ambient temperature.  Such low ambient temperatures influence the oil viscosity and also the variation of its curve shape versus the temperature.  According to the aforementioned research method, the requirements for accuracy and reliability increase for predicting the work of contact surfaces (bearings) over a wide range of speeds, temperatures and loads.  The purpose of this proposal consists of a complex study of physical and mechanical processes between the gas turbine engine oil lubricating system (oil pump, oil filter, oil pipe, and engine rotor bearings) and tribological oil parameters.  These parameters include oil viscosity at low ambient temperature [\u201340 0F], shear stress, shear rate, friction coefficient, and oil film thickness.  They will be used to develop a modeling tool and associated methodology to effectively and accurately determine the maximum allowable viscosity for engine oils.  For determining the effectiveness of oil lubricity during the start up period between contact surfaces, and the influence of the low ambient temperature [-40 0F], different gas turbine engine oils will need to be tested under a non-stationary process.  This non-stationary process, in particular, start and stop has significant influence on the reliability and longevity of oil pump, oil filter, and bearings under extremely low temperature conditions. Recording tribology parameters (oil viscosity, shear stress, shear rate, oil film thickness, friction coefficient, and wear) in this non stationary process requires a new approach about the classification of lubricants concerning their starting properties, and their allowable viscosity under low temperature conditions.",

However, with the continual increases in thermal loads due to advancements such as high-powered solid-state electronics within the next generation weapon systems, improvements to the current industry standard are required.  In addition to novel heat exchanger configurations, improvements in the thermal properties of the heat transfer fluid have been proposed using solid-liquid suspensions based upon nanoparticles.  Although a wealth of research data exists for the thermal conductivity improvements with the addition of nanoparticles, experimental demonstration within practical application has been lacking.  To address this shortcoming, Mainstream will rely on its expertise in nanotechnology, heat transfer fluids, and thermal management systems to demonstrate the thermal transport improvement using nanofluids within an aircraft-suitable single-phase heat exchanger.  The Phase II effort expand upon the successful Phase I by optimizing the nanofluid composition, expanding the temperature range of the thermal/physical properties characterization of the nanofluid, and demonstrating the heat transfer coefficient augmentation within suitable aircraft heat exchangers.",

All ground forces being deployed in culturally distinct and sensitive areas need to have at least some basics skills, knowledge, and awareness of cultural norms and prohibitions.

In orbit, most satellites are powered by photovoltaic cells, and these solar cells are protected by a thin sheet of glass that blocks protons, electrons, atomic oxygen, and UV light. Electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection is provided for the cover glass by coating the glass with indium tin oxide (ITO), and light transmission is improved by adding another layer of antireflective (AR) magnesium fluoride (MgF2). These coatings darken significantly under radiation, leading to significant power loss by end of life (EOL).

Unlike conventional self supported polymer capacitor films that have limited polymer chemistries and dielectric thickness, the proposed capacitor system makes use of a family of highly cross linked amorphous polymer dielectrics, that have dielectric constants in the range of ?=2.5-13,  breakdown strength >1000V/?m and are integrated with aluminum electrodes into a capacitor using a non contact process, in an environment free of particulate contaminants.   This results in defect free polymer dielectrics that have low dielectric absorption due to their amorphous character, and breakdown strength higher than any self supported film dielectric due to the combination of the intrinsic polymer properties and their submicron thickness.  In the phase I work the main focus of the effort was to develop a \u201clayer isolation process\u201d in order to elevate the energy density of these polymer multilayer capacitors.  The results show that single layer small area capacitors were produced with energy densities as high as 11.5J/cc, which is typical for submicron thick acrylate polymer dielectrics.   Multilayer capacitors with 1200 capacitor layers that were \u201cpartially processed\u201d for layer isolation, exhibited energy densities as high as 3.4J/cc.  The Phase II work will be designed to complete and optimize the layer isolation process in order to further increase the capacitor energy density.

Intelligent agents are the buyers and sellers in this market, and they represent all the elements of the sensor network, from sensors to sensor platforms to computational resources. These agents interact based on a negotiation mechanism that determines their bidding strategies. This negotiation mechanism and the agents\u2019 bidding strategies are based on game theory, and they are designed so that the aggregate result of the process is a market in competitive equilibrium, which guarantees an optimal allocation of resources throughout the sensor network. We extend market-based optimization using arbitrage look-ahead agents to turn this approach into a non-myopic planning algorithm, which provides computational gains, more efficient allocations of sensor tasks, and risk management framework that hedges against uncertainty.",

        "abstract": "Tactical laser sources delivering high peak power (from multi-MW to TW) in agile optical pulse trains at high pulse repetition frequency (PRF) in the 3.5-4 \u00b5m wavelength region are of interest for several military applications including proactive infrared countermeasures (PIRCM), non-lethal munitions, and remote sensing of battlefield threats.  To meet the needs for future tactical lasers, Aculight proposes to develop, build, and deliver a transportable, highly flexible, fiber-based high-peak-power optical source capable of operating at mid-infrared wavelengths.  The proposed laser technology provides direct access to regimes of operation that are challenging or off limits for traditional pulse solid-state sources intended for military use.  The rugged, fiber-based nature of the laser enables rapid transition to battlefield deployment.",

To minimize the impact of the training intervention evaluations on the 11th RS our Phase II training intervention methodology will use a four-tier spiral approach.   The spiral approach is a method in which we introduce each intervention cumulatively one at a time as they are developed.  A baseline will be established and then the spirals will be introduced.

In the near term, it is apparent that reduced order models are needed in order to assist in the design process by providing engineering estimates of combustion instability.  One key area that requires effort is the area of screech modeling.  A critical aspect of any model that attempts to predict screech is the correct representation of the dynamic heat release rate.  In this Phase I SBIR, Energy Research Consultants and its partner, Georgia Institute of Technology will join together to 1) develop a reduced order heat release model, and 2) conduct experiments in augmentor like conditions to validate the model.  Georgia Tech\u2019s experience with combustion oscillations combined with unique experimental facilities at ERC will provide the right combination of resources to efficiently develop the design tool needed.  Based on success with the Phase I efforts, in Phase II, transverse mode instabilities will be incorporated along with non-homogeneous mixtures (both single and two phase).   These conditions, along with the longitudinal modes already demonstrated in Phase I, will provide a wide range of data against which to validate the modeling approach.",

        "abstract": "DNA aptamers are artificial nucleotide sequences that bind to target molecules with affinity and specificity similar to those of antibodies.  The high specificity, stability and low cost of aptamers make them superior reagents for detection of biodefense toxin and biological threat agents.  Specific DNA aptamers are selected from combinatorial libraries by series of iterative selection/amplification cycles called SELEX (Systemic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment).  Separation of aptamer/target complexes from unbound aptamers is a key step in the enrichment process and a variety of technical approaches have been used.  However, all currently available protocols for selection of aptamers require numerous selection cycles with enzymatic amplification steps that may produce artifacts.  Ultimate improvement of both selection time and selection specificity could be achieved by developing a single step selection protocol.  We propose a novel NON-SELEX-based approach for single step isolation of DNA aptamer.  The proposed Phase II effort will further develop PSI\u2019s methodology for which feasibility was shown during Phase I research.  Further demonstration of the utility of PSI\u2019s novel technology will be performed by selection of aptamers against biodefense-relevant targets specified by the Air Force.

The focus of the Phase II project is to test the efficacy of the system under more stringent environmental conditions, as well as to conduct tests with live BW agents.  The data acquired will support approval of the electrochemical decon system by the EPA as a sporicide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).

As the technology for missile systems is advanced, the next generation of missiles will have added capabilities to deploy countermeasures and masking techniques to foil radar detection. The next generation of radars therefore, must also have added capabilities to counter those advanced threats. One crucial need for the next generation of radar exciters is the technology for frequency agility and waveform modulation. For exciters, Hittite offers a family of products that make up phase-locked frequency synthesizers. They include VCOs and frequency dividers, programmable counters, phase-frequency detectors, loop amplifiers, and completely integrated phase-locked oscillators. Use of such components can greatly reduce size/weight and power consumption. In addition, the use of high-speed digital-to-analog converters (DACs) provides a means to obtain ultra wideband frequency and phase modulation at a high intermediate frequency (IF). The X-band output in our proposed exciter is obtained with a single upconversion as opposed to the more traditional double upconversion method. Thus the use of high-speed DACs reduces the amount of RF circuitry required in the exciter and moves the high-speed processing closer to the antenna as desired.",

However, doing so remains challenging because of the need to integrate multiple considerations that go into deciding whether a given popup is a TST and whether to pursue it. Systems for supporting such mission-critical decision making are crucial in helping to decrease the time for decision making, and to increase the reliability and robustness of the decision making process. For Phase I, we proposed an innovative system called Sentinel for helping support the human decision making process in planning against TSTs. Sentinel combines the technologies of ontologies and rule bases in a novel way to address the problems of representation of decision analysis and automation of decision support. In addition, it supports distributed decision making, provides visibility into the steps of the decision making process and takes into account feedback received from the human decision maker. Careful consideration has been given in Sentinel to issues critical to user adoption, namely its usability and its maintenance over time. During Phase I, we prototyped the critical components of Sentinel and demonstrated its use in helping a user assign assets to pursue a TST, perform distributed decision making and conduct what-if analyses, thereby minimizing the technical risk of our approach. Phase II will significantly improve the decision support capabilities, ease of use and ease of maintenance of Sentinel, resulting in a fully functional prototype suitable for commercialization.",

The approach is to produce a set of test procedures enhancing the processes and alternatives in adequately demonstrating the durability and reliability of military gas turbine engines while minimizing cost and test hours. The design hierarchy for a typical turbine engine may be decomposed into layers for each subsystem, assembly, component and structural element. System level reliability can be predicted, based upon known lower level elements of the design. Phase I showed that it is possible to develop a Weibull-based approach to statistically \u201croll-up\u201d the failure probabilities from components/subsystems to predict overall engine system reliability. Reliability assessment early in development effectively determines whether a design meets predicted life cycle goals. The technology proposed will accelerate the introduction of new designs and materials by many years and greatly decrease development and production costs. The enhancement is accomplished through a unique combination of probabilistic simulations, scaled turbine engine testing and statistical evaluation in defining a test methodology that utilizes the probabilistic approach in providing an accurate, low-cost alternative compared to the reliability assurance methods employed today.",

        "abstract": "Wave Computation Technologies, Inc. (WCT) proposes to develop a new commercial electromagnetic particle-in-cell (EM-PIC) software package based on a 3-D hybrid technique that combines two efficient algorithms, (a) the enlarged cell technique (ECT) and (b) the spectral-element time-domain (SETD) method, as a high-order solver for EM-PIC simulations.  This hybrid technique overcomes the well-known limitation of existing EM-PIC solvers due to their stair-stepping approximation. The proposed hybrid method uses domain decomposition to divide the problem into SETD regions with coarse structures and ECT regions with fine structures. As the SETD method has spectral accuracy and the ECT method has second-order accuracy, the overall convergence of this EM-PIC solver is better than second order.  In Phase I the team has already developed and demonstrated the prototype of this method.  Specifically, we have integrated the ECT with the particle-in-cell calculation, and have achieved the second-order global convergence. The typical computation time for a problem with 5.45 million cells and 1600 time steps is approximately 14 minutes on a desktop computer (Pentium-D 2.8GHz, only 1 CPU is used). This speed is believed to be unprecedented. In Phase II, the proposed 3-D hybrid numerical EM-PIC solver will be integrated into an existing commercial platform to produce a new commercial package, Wavenology PIC. It promises to effectively mitigate spurious effects caused by the stair-stepping approximation in the conventional EM-PIC simulation method. The commercial code will be complete with particle emission and propagation. The algorithm will be scalable, stable and globally at least second order accurate for curved geometries. Issues such as self force, grid heating, non-physical radiation and self heating will be mitigated to globally second-order convergence.",

        "abstract": "Thulium doped fiber laser near 2 micron is of great interest because of the potential possibility of combining high efficiency, high output power, and retina safety together. This proposal is for the development of new Tm-doped glass fiber for efficient high power 2\u0192nmicron fiber laser capable of generating an output power of up to thousands watts. The doping concentration of the proposed glass fiber can be very high, which will result in the so-called cross relaxation energy transfer of thulium, dramatically improving the quantum efficiency. In Phase II, we will design and develop new Tm-doped glasses, measure the spectroscopic properties of thulium ions, characterize the cross relaxation energy transfer, demonstrate quantum efficiency of approximately 200%, and fabricate fiber perform and single mode fibers based upon Phase I results. We will realize efficient near 2 micron laser pumped with multi-mode 800nm laser diodes by optimizing fiber parameters, and demonstrate high power 2 micron fiber lasers. Successful development of such highly efficient high power 2 micron Tm-doped glass fiber laser with output power of kilowatts level would revolutionize the fiber laser development and enable many new applications.",

The second set of behavior signatures will integrate minimally observable Markov Decision Processes into the computational component of the BSP software to enhance the accuracy of the likelihood predictions and refocus the intelligence gathering effort for determining the likelihood of a particular COA.  Similarities between the two sets of behavior signatures may exist, such as the existence of a type of support, e.g., financial funding, thus, increasing the likelihood of a terrorist act being committed, but the level of financial funding may be critical to differentiating between the ability to detonate an explosive device in a market of a local village versus flying a jet liner into the White House in Washington, D.C.",

Offering higher speed and lower power than competing devices, the ADC will advance the state of the art and enable next-generation digital sub-arrays. A combination of innovative design and SiGe BiCMOS technology will be used to realize the ADC. Implemented as a key part of the receiving signal chain, the ADC will reduce RF complexity by moving data conversion inside the antenna element to enable radars with size, weight, power, and cost a fraction that of current phased arrays. Phase I developed a preliminary design and simulations demonstrated its feasibility. During Phase II, initial ADC prototypes (including a companion demux) will be designed, laid out, fabricated, packaged, and tested. The initial design and layout will then be refined in preparation for a second fabrication and test cycle during the Phase II Option. Follow-on programs will integrate the ADC into field systems, adding features and enhancing performance.",

The proposed system combines the airborne collision avoidance sensors and the weather monitoring capabilities. The concept fully supports cooperative target detection by incorporating Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and transponder receivers for severe weathers. It also supports non-cooperative target detection and tracking through pulsed-Doppler radar mode, space-time adaptive processing and communicating with ground-based radar systems; 2. 3D wind-field profiling based on Antenna Interferometer technology. With the capability of digital-beam-forming and antenna scanning, it is possible for the proposed multi-channel system to perform 3D wind profiling, and measure microburst, windshear and turbulence in real-time.  3. Simple and proven hazard detection and classification based on hazard microphysics. Microphysics-based extraction of weather hazard spectrum features greatly simplifies their detection by using a priori knowledge, thus avoiding tremendous \u2018data training\u2019 needed with other algorithms.

The stacks will be operated on reformate gas as fuel and pure oxygen as oxidant.  Several novel cell/stack designs will be investigated in parallel, and promising technologies will be implemented into the final stack design.  The stack will be optimized for compactness and maximum performance as well as other requirements such as fast start-up and ability to thermal cycle.

        "abstract": "The objective of this Phase II project is to design, implement and demonstrate an innovative secure cognitive wireless network via MIMO processing and polyphase carrier interferometry spreading spectrum technology. Specifically, a cooperative spectrum sensing algorithm will provide a virtual RF topology map of a wireless  network in a hostile environment. Next, with the aid of the virtual RF topology, a polyphase carrier interferometry waveform is designed to achieve anti-jamming capability. Furthermore, a jamming avoidance RF watermarking technology is implemented to significantly improve the anti-jamming performance of the wireless network. A smart antenna array is integrated with the RF watermarking technology to provide an oscillating beamforming and offer transmit diversity in addition to frequency diversity, leading to superb performance improvement. Most importantly, multiple smart antenna arrays are combined to create a virtual grid, generating a distributed, prioritized RF watermarking technology. As a direct result of this innovative research and development, the proposed wireless network not only provides high performance and high security against passive eavesdroping, but also eliminates the vulnerability against active jamming from adversaries. In addition to theoretical and numerical analysis, the proposed cognitive wireless network will also be implemented in hardware via DSP/FPGA/SDR boards to demonstrate its superb performance and exceptional security feature.",

In Phase I, POC successfully demonstrated the feasibility of LACR by producing high-quality ITO film with low resistivity and high optical transmittance.  In Phase II POC plans to package the system in a small hand-held repair unit tethered to the laser medium and cooling system through durable optical fibers.  The repair unit applies flexible LaRP in a tape and reel format to continuously provide fresh ITO material to repair damaged surfaces, regardless of their level of curvature.",

Solid rocket boosters have been found to create particularly dense debris environments, but deployment hardware debris is typically also present, both for solid and liquid fuel boosters. Data collected on foreign tests has also indicated significant debris environments. It is important that the effects of debris on BMDS performance be well understood and its detrimental effects mitigated where necessary. The debris RCS modeling technique developed under this SBIR will help ensure that large-scale BMDS simulations accurately reflect realistic debris environments. Also, the prescreening technique makes it possible to quickly assign debris identification probabilities to many of the objects in a missile complex, typically after a few seconds of track, thereby enabling the defense to allocate its resources more effectively. In Phase I TSC demonstrated the feasibility of a debris RCS modeling technique. TSC will refine and fully automate the model in Phase II. The Phase I effort also generated quantitative prescreener performance results for a limited set of deployment and debris environment conditions. A much more expanded set of conditions will be examined during Phase II to mature the algorithm and characterize performance.",

In-process monitoring is desirable when tight thickness tolerances are required, but difficult, because the coating is uncured.  By measuring in-process, the application can be adjusted, and waiting to cure and sanding can be avoided.

The design process is automated by an evolutionary optimization algorithm that employs a finite element analysis program as an objective function evaluation engine.  Finite element modeling in the Phase I effort showed a potential increase of 12.2% in average torque production for the F18E/F generator.

To image with high definition  under overcast starlight level conditions, low dark current, high NIR sensitivity and low read noise are mandatory.

The risk of exposure via inhalation, dermal contact, or ingestion routes will be investigated and toxicity profiles will be assessed for a set of standardized nanomaterials with well defined physical and chemical characteristics.  A Nanomaterial Assessment for Safety and Handling (NASH) database will disseminate the collected information via a publicly accessible web interface.  The NASH database will provide a repository for the nanomaterial characterization data, their exposure risk, and a summary of in-vitro and in-vivo toxicity data for each class of nanomaterial.  The effectiveness of personal protective equipment for providing a barrier to nanomaterial exposure will be evaluated.

        "abstract": "In order to realize the geolocation and attitude determination benefits of formation flying multi-spacecraft clusters or constellations with onboard Acquisition, Tracking and Pointing (ATP) lasercom systems, four key elements must be present: 1. Broadband inter-spacecraft communications to enable the transport of high resolution pointing sensor data around the topology to the computing node(s) and return geolocation and attitude information to the individual nodes. 2. Precision inter-spacecraft timing synchronization to enable accurate time stamping of multi-sensor data samples throughout the formation. 3. Precision inter-spacecraft relative range measured by cooperative time-of-flight (TOF) handshake. 4. Precision pointing sensor data to enable accurate relative pointing angle determination between each craft and its nearest neighbors. An inter-spacecraft laser communications network is the only integrated subsystem that can provide all four of these key elements [26].  The proposed SBIR Phase II effort will leverage several existing SPI programs (Section 4) to extend the models, analyses and designs from the Phase I effort, and produce a fully-functional prototype at a minimum cost.  Space Photonics (SPI) will develop the algorithms, calibration processes, and software/firmware for the inter-spacecraft ranging, timing synchronization, attitude and position determination; and, will demonstrate these functions in our free space optical, lasercom testbed (LaserFire\u00ae testbed).  However, the algorithms, calibration processes, and software/firmware developed for this SBIR Phase II program can be applied to any gimbaled or gimbal-less lasercom crosslink system. These functions can even be applied to RF crosslink systems. But the RF implementation will suffer significant loss of inter-spacecraft position accuracy due to the larger RF beamwidths.",

This includes the \u201cAffordable Moving Surface Target Exploitation\u201d (AMSTE) and NetTrack programs. Although each program approached the tracking and fusion problem from a different aspect and with various technologies, they both gave us insight into the role that human cognition plays with practically any attempt to fuse various data sources to improve tracking capability. On Phase I, we began architecting solutions that could apply to the problems we were familiar with, which included high value target tracking and track based feature usage to perform ambiguity resolution. As the original architecture was developed, it became clear that the problem was too specific and that the solution was not extensible enough to handle many other mission objectives that were of just as much, if not more, importance. The original architecture was strictly a collaborative filter that operated on user actions. The evolution of this architecture led us to a second solution that utilized a multi-layered finite state machine with incorporated collaborative filter. This approach could be applied to more mission objectives, but was still limited in the solution space since finite trees were designed. This meant that only those solutions defined within the system could be used by the operators. This limitation led us to the third and final architecture, a generalized approach with no preconceived architecture. This solution utilizes neural networks, and is the method to be researched, developed, and implemented on Phase II.",

The goal of this project is to develop superior semi-supervised approaches and to integrate them into an IE system.  We will pursue improvement in several areas.  First, we will explore the use of bootstrapping and active learning approaches for event detection.  This includes investigating single-module versions of these approaches as well as pipeline-aware versions when event detection is integrated into the IE pipeline.  Second, we will investigate the use of novel information sources in order to augment semi-supervised learning.

This proposal is for an innovative model-based automated resource management system, that combines threat detection, response algorithms, and operator-assistive visual displays to protect satellites from close-orbiting threats. In Phase 1, the concept of conducting onboard threat detection and evasive maneuver planning was demonstrated. An estimator was developed to perform onboard detection of maneuver pulses of a close-orbiting threats using RADAR or LADAR systems, and fuel-optimal maneuver planning algorithms were developed to evade the detected threat. In Phase 2, these capabilities will be expanded in several areas. Detailed parametric models of space assets and attack satellites will be developed to facilitate in-depth analysis of algorithm performance. Response algorithms to plan evasive maneuvers will be enhanced to account for station-keeping objectives, pursuing attack vehicles, and more accurate models. Fault detection methods such as parity space and detection filters will be evaluated against estimators for performance in maneuver detection. The resulting software frameworks will be integrated to form a simulation testbed for evaluating defensive counterspace scenarios with close-orbiting threats.",

In addition, high-quality silicon coatings may be polished to achieve excellent specularity. In Phase I, Surface Optics Corporation (SOC) demonstrated a low-stress silicon cladding for SiC mirrors using a novel ion-assisted evaporation (IAD) technique.  A cladding with little intrinsic stress is essential to minimize bending that would otherwise distort the figure of lightweight mirrors.  Excessive coating stress may also cause cracking or delamination from the substrate.

One already demonstrated solution, which offers significant weight and cost payoffs, uses advanced fuel-lubricated (fuel-lubed) bearing. The challenge associated with fuel lubrication is that the fuel does not provide nearly as much lubricity to the bearing components as the traditional oil lubrication does. As a result, fuel-lubed hybrid bearings typically use advanced self-lubricating, fuel compatible C-C cages and Si3N4 rolling elements to reduce bearing heat generation and to improve overall bearing performance. To further improve the bearing performance, particularly when the engine bearings are required to operate at extreme conditions of load, speed, and temperature, antiwear additive has to be added to fuel to enhance its tribological properties. In this program, we propose to better understand the fundamental tribological behavior of friction pairs under fuel lubrication, and to develop enhanced concepts addressing performance and reliability issues related to fuel-lubricated bearings for both short and long term applications.",

        "abstract": "To address the Air Force need for a target damage/kill assessment sensor for high-energy laser (HEL) weapon systems, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) is developing a Holographic-Optical-Element-Based Damage Assessment (HOEDA) system. Based on sensor and data fusion of three laser remote-sensing (polarimetry, vibrometry, and spectroscopy) modules, HOEDA is based on optics of a single telescope using innovative holographic optics and physics-based software models (algorithms). The system provides accurate and reliable damage assessment (from predamage to kill) in targets hit by HEL weapon systems. While operating at standoff distances of up to 200 km from military aircraft at altitudes >25,000 feet, the system offers submillisecond response (real time) to provide feedback for lethal/less-lethal operation of both strategic and tactical HEL systems.  In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of the HOEDA system by modeling and simulations and by assembling and laboratory testing a TRL-4 prototype using simulated damaged targets. In Phase II, POC plans to assemble an optimized, fully functional, low power consuming ",

        "abstract": "With the advent of High Powered Microwave (HPW) weapons, it has become necessary to understand the effect of the radiated energy on those persons exposed. Additionally, other systems, such as microwave and troposcatter systems, also pose a danger to humans who are exposed to their radiated energy. The U. S. government, the Air Force and other international organizations have developed standards that specify the safe exposure limits.  When computing Electromagnetic biohazards, it is necessary to properly consider all aspects of the problem. The aspects are the proper definition of the source and its radiation, proper propagation of the energy to the designated location, and proper computation of the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR).  Remcom\u2019s modeling tools Wireless InSite and XFdtd are ideally suited to be used for this application.  In Phase I, RF propagation from a source to a target approximating the surface area projection of a human was modeled and calculations of electric field and power density at the target were performed.  Phase II will expand on that demonstration to develop a fully-functional RF hazard calculation package (RHAZ) that is similar in \u201clook and feel\u201d to the Air Force\u2019s LASER hazard calculator (LHAZ).  The tool will provide multiple user interfaces (depending on the end user) and incorporate various RF propagation models present in Wireless InSite and FDTD calculations and bio-effects calculations via XFdtd.  Also incorporated will be database modules of commonly used emitters as well as cumulative exposure for personnel.   The RHAZ software package has to potential to benefit various government agencies as well as commercial businesses.  Remcom will draw upon its experience and previous successes in bringing SBIR products to commercial development to create a highly useful commercial software package.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This Air Force Phase II SBIR program would apply thin film Metal Rubber\u2122 sensor skin arrays to the quantitative measurement of distributed flow on Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) control surface test articles.  During the Phase I program, NanoSonic designed and synthesized electrically conductive, low areal mass density, and low modulus thin film transducer materials, and demonstrated their use for the calibrated measurement of skin friction through both water flow and wind tunnel tests.  Metal Rubber\u2122 is a self-assembled nanocomposite material containing alternate layers of specialized polymers and functionalized metal nanoclusters.  Phase I research further demonstrated the ability to form two-dimensional sensor skin arrays of such materials, and to acquire, multiplex and store data from the array elements in near real-time.  During the Phase II program, the mechanical and electrical transduction properties of the sensor materials would be optimized, improved data acquisition electronics would be implemented, the transduction response of modified sensor materials would be calibrated, and sensor elements and arrays would be used to analyze MAV components through water and air flow testing in industry, university and government research laboratory facilities.  The Phase II program has the support of a primary manufacturer of advanced unmanned and manned air vehicle platforms.  BENEFIT:  Conformal, low areal mass density, and low modulus Metal Rubber\u2122 skin friction sensors and sensor arrays have applications in the measurement of flow-induced shear stress on advanced wind tunnel models, and in the flight control instrumentation of MAVs and NAVs where weight and frequency response are of critical importance.  Related applications include use as similar air data sensors on larger unmanned and manned aircraft and lighter-than-air vehicles, and on the control surfaces of small hydrocraft.  Metal Rubber\u2122 itself has applications in flexible electronics, as low weight flexible electrical interconnects for deployable RF and PV arrays, as EMI shielding for defense platforms and commercial electronic systems, and as an environmentally-friendly replacement for conventional lead-based eutectic solders.\"",

        "abstract": "High flux flash X-ray systems provide unique methods of imaging ultra-fast events that cannot be captured using normal photographic techniques.  X-ray images can be obtained in 20 to 50 nanoseconds, even through smoke, fire, and metal, and enable precise recording of details of test events under the harshest conditions.  X-ray based techniques thus provide unique means to track hypervelocity projectile parameters.  Unfortunately, current film-based imaging systems require an extensive calibration process, excessive time and space within an experimental chamber, and result in errors in data analysis.  To address these issues we propose to develop a low cost, high precision, large area X-ray imaging system based on a novel scintillator coupled to a high-resolution digital readout.  System components will be low cost, portable, rugged and modular, and except for the passive scintillator, will be located external to the chamber to minimize space requirements. When completed, this system will provide instantaneous high-precision measurements of projectile orientation parameters, in a time-efficient manner.  Our Phase I efforts met with resounding success, demonstrating the feasibility of measuring hypervelocity projectile parameters with the desired precision.  Phase II research will build on this success to develop and deliver a turnkey system for DOD personnel.",

The algorithms do not require long term tracks or even pure tracks.  Flow based conservation of mass utilizes the Navier-Stokes continuity equations and we apply them using cellular automata.  The application of Quadtree decomposition partitions the problem to a size that can be solved efficiently. Their innovations can support direct exploitation that also includes sensor scheduling and tasking, as well as target mobility predictions to aid in tracking.  Another use in tracking is to influence the track state update with the traffic flow models which advances tracking from autonomous filtering to the flow based tracking. An example of their application to the GMTI forensics problem would be forward or backward time propagation through the state-transition matrices given an event location and time.  The product would be an estimate of probable locations of origin or destination that may lead to suspect locations for IED bomb makers, emplacers, or triggermen. Transition opportunities include the integration of exogenous data influences like traffic flow to support improved sensor tasking efficiency, all ground tracker efforts, and can help us integrate terrain, urban considerations, weather and other influences.  Workstations such as DCGS and MTIX would benefit from the enhanced analysis capability derived from the cellular automata estimate in which we can find new lines-of-communications or sources and sinks, and even anticipate new events.",

Contact of these metal or carbon filled coatings with alloy components creates the potential for significant corrosion.  These corrosion problems have been controlled historically with chromate inhibitor containing primers, but as these materials are eliminated, a need exists to control corrosion of both the conductive metal fillers and the aircraft structure in contact with these coating systems.  To address the need for improved protection of aircraft structures coated with conductive coatings, Luna will develop a tailored inhibitor package that mitigates the complex corrosion processes associated with these conductive coatings and aircraft materials. Luna has selected novel nanocomposite compounds and surface treatments as the basic platforms for tailoring inhibitors specifically for this application.  The nanocomposite inhibitors can be intercalated with a range of anodic or cathodic inhibitors, permitting significant design latitude for engineering coatings.  A further advantage is that the inhibitor release is moderated by an ion exchange process.  Finally, since these inhibitors and treatments can be produced with existing processes, using low cost raw materials, they will be competitive to other commercial inhibitors.",

Experiments on laboratory mock-ups replicating typical cooling channel configurations have shown the ability to non-intrusively measure both the temperature of the fluid within the channel and in the region between the channel and the heated surface.  One dimensional analytical models and inversion algorithms to accurately extract heat flux from the ultrasonic data have also been developed and demonstrated.  Initial investigations on C/C composites show that scattering from multiple interfaces and microstructure complicates the analysis.

This is particularly true when the ontology describes a domain where the knowledge is perishable and being refreshed in near real-time, such as in many intelligence applications.   SET has developed a new approach to effectively address the adaptive ontology challenge. During Phase 1, we developed a metamodel framework for ontologies that is domain independent. Through a robust proof-of-concept prototype, the SET team demonstrated its \u201cCollective Learning Environment for Ontologies\u201d (CLEO) architectural concept in Phase 1. SET proposes to extend this architecture and the associated implementation during Phase II to support minimally supervised learning of ontologies. The ultimate goal of this effort is to develop, refine, evolve, and maintain ontologies using a continuous stream of raw data, and to derive new structural and domain-specific information using machine learning algorithms. Together, these two goals will be met by a mixed-initiative, partially supervised learning system that allows the ontology to self-adapt to new information.",

During phase II, we propose to develop cost-effective schlieren-PIV system which can be used to make measurements in large and small scale wind tunnel facilities and also in combustion environments. We will address the challenging issues such as conditions for successful velocity measurements in a 3-D cavity flowfield, sensitivity of the system, alternate light sources, and image processing. The integrated cost-effective system will be delivered to AFRL at the end of the program and significant commercial efforts will be made in order to enhance fluid dynamics research at government, academia, and industrial laboratories.",

This impacts both the handling and the utilization of the materials.  Triton proposes to replace the nickel with another conductive, environmentally resistant coating that does not have the safety and environmental issues of nickel.

This problem is a type of  EMI and the goal of RF system designers and analysts is to achieve EMC where no interference problems exist. We propose to develop a software tool named Electromagnetic Interference Toolkit (EMIT) for predicting interference between radiating and receiving RF systems where the dominant coupling mechanism is antenna-to-antenna. The tool will consist of a GUI and underlying computational engines. The GUI will pass user specified inputs to the computational engine, will provide visualization of data (2-D and 3-D plots, schematics, and mesh of the platform & antennas), and will interface with the full wave solver WIPL-D for the generation of coupling data. During the Phase I effort, we have developed the architecture and implementation plan for the EMIT software, developed proof of concept modules for the computational engines, and validated these modules. The Phase II effort will focus on commercializing the tool. As such, the emphasis will be on developing a GUI, implementing the proof-of-concept codes developed under the Phase I as robust engineering codes, and performing measurement based validations.",

        "abstract": "In both the commercial and military electronics markets, there is a continuing trend to reduce size, weight, and overall equipment costs, while at the same time increasing functionality and improving reliability of the electronic circuitry. Integrated circuit manufacturers have addressed this need by integrating greater functionality directly onto the silicon chips, thus yielding the System-on-Chip approach. This technique, however, only addresses a portion of the problem. While it does provide for a reduction in size and cost while increasing overall functionality, these ICs still need to be packaged into functional end applications. The ICs typically still require a large number of discrete circuitry to support their functionality. The integration of these ICs and required discrete circuitry into a single end application package is the System-in-Package (SiP) approach. Newer packaging techniques, improved material sets, and new methods of passively integrating circuitry are being developed which allow for a further reduction in size and cost in the final package. Omega Wireless Solutions is adept at advanced packaging, passive integration, and electromagnetic simulation, and has the tools and abilities necessary to integrate the U.S. Navy's Quadrature LINC architecture into a small form factor utilizing the latest SiP techniques.",

It remains a difficult task to design a power amplifier that simultaneously provides very wide bandwidth, high gain, high linearity, and high efficiency.

The innovation in HiSAAM technology will enable the system to apply masks of any complexity quickly, accurately, and with high resolution, and can easily be integrated with automated coating applicators to provide masking and coating in one step.  In addition, the novel masking material deposited with this system is easily removed once coatings have been applied, leaving no residue.  In Phase I POC experimentally proved the HiSAAM concept by fabricating a working prototype and demonstrating its performance.  In Phase II POC plans to build two versions of the full-scale masking head, optimize the masking material, and demonstrate system accuracy, resolution, and speed.

Acquisition of PIV and PLIF images at 5 to 10 kHz will be sufficient to capture the interaction of small- and large-scale structures responsible for initiating or sustaining most of the phenomena that affects augmentor stability.  Initial demonstration measurements will be performed in a laboratory turbulent flame where the interaction of vortices (i.e., the instabilities) can be controlled in systematic way for optimizing system performance.  Data from these measurements will be used to demonstrate the ability to track instability modes and their spatio-temporal interaction.  These laboratory experiments will be followed by the installation of the system at WPAFB for performing measurements under various augmentor conditions dictated by AFRL scientists.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project demonstrates a combination of two powerful adaptive digital signal processing technologies that enable broadband, high-power amplification with high linear dynamic range and high output efficiency.  The technologies are the Adaptive Pre-Distortion Linearizer (ALIN), and the Adaptive Branch Matching (ABM) algorithm.  Combined, these two unique technologies will significantly improve the performance of LINC architecture power amplifiers, as well as being directly applicable to a very wide range of other military and commercial RF Power Amplifiers. The Adaptive Pre-Distortion Linearizer (ALIN) uses a real-time digital signal processing technique to reduce harmonic and intermodulation distortion over a wide range of input frequencies, signal types, and amplitudes, and in rapidly changing environments.  Pre-distortion is necessary to enable power amplifiers to perform efficiently and is required in the LINC configuration to meet performance requirements. The technology adaptively tracks nonlinear distortion and cancels the errors The Adaptive Branch Matching (ABM) technology accurately matches the gain and phase of the branches in the ExLINC power amp architecture to insure optimal cancellation of the nonlinear distortion components.  The ability to maintain gain and phase matching between the branches of LINC power amplifiers is critical and has been a limiting factor in previous LINC systems.  This technology overcomes this important limitation which improves stability and performance.  Both the ALIN and ABM technologies are blind adaptive algorithms that automatically track parameters that drift without requiring external calibration signals. During Phase II, the ALIN and ABM algorithms will be implemented and tested in real-time FPGA hardware and applied to a number of different amplifier modules, including a broadband Extended-Range Dual-LINC (ExLINC) prototype amplifier system (to be developed in conjunction with OnQ Technologies, Inc. and Omega Wireless, Inc.) with preliminary target goals of compact size (",

The defense application includes use of SiGe IR Sensors as low cost thermal imagers for various Army and Marine missions and the ability to detect mortar fire and muzzle flash in hostile environment. SiGe based IR Focal Planes offers a low cost alternative for developing near IR sensors that will not require any cooling and can operate in the NIR band. The attractive features of SiGe based IRFPA\u2019s will take advantage of Silicon based technology, that can promise small feature size and compatibility with the Silicon CMOS circuit for signal processing.  As Part of the Phase II Program, Magnolia will work with MIT to design, develop and build high sensitivity infrared sensor based on SiGe material system. We will evaluate various device designs for SiGe detectors to simulate and model the performance for very low dark current and high quantum efficiency and hence higher SiGe sensor performance. We plan to build and characterize SiGe detector arrays for their electrical and optical properties at room temperature. The Phase II effort will be focused on building the 2-D SiGe focal plane arrays with high quantum efficiency and very low leakage current.  Magnolia will also collaborate with Boeing /SAIC for the FCS Program and iRobot for Robotic applications for the FCS and other missions. We will also work with FLIR Systems for their Army and Navy System Applications.",

Phase II will focus on the development of a multi-layered airframe where alternating layers of a high strength ceramics and carbon-carbon composites are used to thermally protect the airframe and to ensure that the nose tip will ablate symmetrically when the airframe is exposed to severe thermal loads.  The design has a high strength ceramic \u201cplug\u201d between the nose tip and the rest of the Maraging steel airframe to reduce heat flow from the nose.  The Maraging Steel will be covered with a ceramic sleeve to reduce the heat flux into the airframe.   The base effort will review and update the airframe requirements, develop a first order model to assess the impact of ablation, generate material properties over the range of expected temperatures and verify or update thermal and strength performance models using simple layered coupon tests.  The first option will focus on the feasibility demonstration of the airframe through testing a prototype in a high temperature oven.  The second option will examine the ablation control ability of the layered nose cone through testing of prototype nose cones in an arc jet facility.",

(SFC), along with our university research partners, proposes to continue development of active anti-tamper (AT) sensors for the purpose of protecting sensitive integrated circuits (ICs) and data from adversaries and reverse engineers.  Several IC AT techniques currently exist, but are inadequate because of high cost, lack of effectiveness, difficulty in use, unreliability, and inability to work together in a single, multi-mode sensor.  SFC has addressed these problems in Phase I by both refining existing techniques and developing new techniques and schemes for putting these into practice.  For example, our previously developed active AT circuit board coatings have been redesigned with IC protection as the goal.  We will rely on our previous AT experience for near-term solutions, while exploring advanced long-term AT techniques using technologies such as MEMS, nanotechnology, and materials that can detect several types of intrusion. SFC has assembled a distinguished team to address this proposal. In conjunction with our university research partner, we are proposing a novel and innovative approach to meeting the demanding requirements listed in the solicitation.

        "abstract": "To reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency, composites are being adhesively bonded into integral structural elements of aircraft at an accelerating rate.  Once a bonded structure is assembled, there is no conventional NDI method available to assure that bond strength is adequate for service.  The presence of weak regions in bonds can lead to disastrous failure of the structure under flight loads.  Laser Bond Inspection (LBI) offers a practical solution to locating weak regions in laminate-adhesive bonds in aircraft structures.  It is a local proof-testing method that applies a well-controlled dynamic stress to the composite structure and senses the failure of weak adhesive bonds in response to the stress.  The controlled stressing of the composite material has no effect on the material or bond if it is not damaged, defective, or substandard.  In order for LBI to be widely applicable, however, advanced technology needs to be developed to inspect thick multilayer composite structures (0.5-1.0 inch thick), bonded structures with non-parallel surfaces (e.g., tapered flange to skin composite), and mixed material joints (e.g., metal-to-composite).  The innovative aspect of the proposed SBIR Phase I program is to perform key experiments to demonstrate new LBI technical approaches to these difficult inspection problems.",

This is achieved with an array of at least 16 sensor elements with different crystallization rates.

Several sensor module considerations will be investigated in detail, including sensitivity of crystallization kinetics to moisture in the environment, module assembly, and the effects of thermal and annealing strains. A prototype sensor capable of withstanding prolonged cycling will be developed and tested in a high temperature furnace, and delivered at the end of the Phase II, together with the sensor readout system, for use in further evaluation and experimental demonstrations.",

        "abstract": "Bonded joints are used extensively for both civilian and military aircraft applications, especially for corrosion damage mitigation via patch bonding. Assessing the quality of these bonds is typically performed using NDE techniques such as bulk wave ultrasonics or thermography. These methods cannot reliably differentiate between a good bond and a so-called \"kissing\" bond. A kissing bond has no mechanical integrity existing between one or both of the substrates that sandwich the adhesive. Shear wave energy concentrated at the substrate-adhesive interfaces will certainly provide the necessary kissing bond detection capability. Bulk wave techniques could be designed to introduce shear waves into a bond structure but they would be impractical and tedious to implement. Guided waves, on the other hand, provide the resource to easily introduce shear waves into the bond interfaces. FBS, Inc. proposes the development of a guided wave technology that will be capable of determining the mechanical integrity and strength of bonded structures to solve the famous \"kissing\" bond problem. The guided wave technique, which has shown promise in previous work, will take advantage of recent advances in guided wave sensor technology and feature based detection algorithms to finally provide a solution to the \"kissing\" bond problem.",

The 100% solids non-chromate primer was based on liquid epoxies and aliphatic amine hardeners.  A solvent-free hyper-dispersant was used to reduce the application viscosity.  Non-chromate corrosion inhibitor packages were employed in the formulas.  These two-component epoxy primer candidates had a maximum of 30\u201d Ford #4 Cup viscosity under the ambient temperature.  These application viscosities are very similar to that of the widely used MIL-PRF-23377J primers.  These new non-chromate primers have quick dry characteristics and a 2h pot life.  The primer films passed a 20% G.E. elongation.  Also, a 100% solids, UV curable, urethane and polyester acrylates, gloss white topcoat was investigated.  To reduce the film shrinkage during UV curing, a dual cure system was chosen.  The current proto-type UV cure, two-component urethane systems are based on reactive diluents, low viscosity polyester acrylates and hydroxy functional urethane acrylates, and isocyanate prepolymers.  Photo-initiators for surface cure and through-cure are incorporated in the formulas.  These systems can be cured by UV radiation followed by ambient temperature cure or the reverse.

        "abstract": "Since the inception of laser peening, improved nondestructive test methods and sensors have been sought to ensure that laser peening produces the desired magnitude and depth profile of residual compressive stress in the part being treated.  There are no reliable nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques generally applicable to any surface enhancement process to monitor residual stress, so it is important to have real-time process controls and monitors in place for these processes.    Laser beam diagnostic sensors are used typically to verify that the correct laser pulse energy, temporal pulse width, and fluence spatial profile are delivered to the part for each laser spot applied.  Test coupons, such as Almen strips, may be processed on a sampling basis, which provide a semi-quantitative measure of the effectiveness of laser peening.  However, these techniques do not provide information measured from physical phenomena directly in the part during laser peening. Incorporating real-time process sensors, which monitor the laser beam interaction or the stress wave generated in the part on a spot-by-spot basis, will greatly reduce the probability of nonconforming process conditions.  The real-time quality control system to be developed in this program will enable immediate corrective actions during processing, when needed.",

        "abstract": "Compact, efficient, and sustainable electric power generators are needed to provide mobile electric power for deployable military bases.  Fuel cells with fuel processors that run on logistic fuels are attractive candidates due to inherent efficiency, practicality, sustainability, and safety.  In these low-power processing devices   (3 kW to 15 kW), fuel atomization and evaporation prove to be limiting factors for heavy liquid fuels such as JP-8.  To replace volatile fuels such as propane or gasoline in these applications, improved atomization and vaporization techniques for heavy fuels are needed.  In this research program we will develop a low-power logistics fuel combustor based on our novel atomization technology.  The combustor will be mated with a steam boiler to deliver steam for a hydrogen reforming process.  Our fuel atomizers can create droplets with 10 \u00b5m mean diameter and can be scaled to deliver fuel, biodiesel, or ethanol.  In the Phase II project, we will optimize the burner and steam boiler demonstrated in Phase I and integrate these components into a turnkey steam generation system.  We will then interface the steam generator with an Air Force hydrogen reformer.",

To address these issues, we propose to extend design, develop, and evaluate a Collaborative Multimodal Environment for Data Integration and Analysis (C-MEDIA). Four core components characterize our human-centered approach. First, we will enable AOC personnel to correlate data by building C-MEDIA on a software framework that can fuse heterogeneous information sources and present these sources through a single multimodal access point. Second, we will support the exploration and exploitation of correlated data sources by providing warfighters with an integrated view of data through advanced, human-centered, multimodal display tools within a fully tailorable environment. Third, we will support collaboration between teams of local and distributed AOC personnel by providing a collaborative work environment that lets teams share and manipulate data sources in real-time, then digitally capture collaborative output. Fourth, we will assess the feasibility of our approach by leveraging existing in-house technology and other systems to develop and then evaluate a full-scale prototype of the C-MEDIA system.",

While candidate long-term systems are likely to include conventional variants of current ballistic missile capabilities, the PGS-CSM concept is expected to create new opportunities for hypersonic vehicle technologies, which would offer greater maneuverability approaching a target than would more simple ballistic missile reentry vehicles. Practical application of hypersonic missiles, however, requires development of structures and insulators capable of operating in the very demanding high temperature chemical, thermal, and mechanical environment. In this Phase II project, Ultramet will expand upon the Phase I success in high temperature structural foam-based insulator and refractory composite structure development to design, fabricate, and test aerostructures for application to the PGS-CSM program. Specifically, Ultramet will team with ATK, which will provide system and individual component requirements, Materials Research & Design, which will perform design and analysis, Ocellus, which will optimize aerogel processing and infiltration of Ultramet structural foam insulators, and Carbon-Carbon Advanced Technologies, which will fabricate C/C components for use in combination with Ultramet\u2019s ultrahigh temperature ceramic matrix composite outer shell.

Development of a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) inverter fed Permanent Magnet (PM) motor for the DD(X) shipboard propulsion illustrates future trends for large 20 MW, 2000 V, PWM Machines of 310 Tons.  Challenges remain with regard to the insulation systems for these large machines. PWM inverters place much greater stress on the insulation system as compared to sinusoidal supplies, due to the high switching frequencies, high voltages and resulting high time rate of change in voltage (dv/dt).   These large machines are often operated at voltages that are beyond the partial discharge and corona inception voltage in order to obtain high power density.  To obtain long life, new insulation systems developed specifically to address PWM inverter demands are needed to obtain 25-year life goal. Destructive life testing is required to qualify these insulation systems.

The tool will perform automatic event detection and causal explanation generation. Speech recognition, text processing, and causal techniques will be used to analyze and generate diagnostic explanation of events.

To resolve this problem, this effort seeks to develop a bi-directional haptic automated communication system (HACS) that is capable of presenting information communicated with hand signals through a tactile vest.  Following an iterative design process, the tactile language and haptic presentation vest will be tested and modified to ensure that the core technology is of highest utility to users.  The technology will then be extended to include a training and evaluation tool to guide users through learning the new communication modality.  Upon validation, the tactile language presentation system will be combined with a gesture recognition and automated status evaluation component developed under an associated effort.  As part of this integration effort, a multimodal commander interface will be developed in order to ensure that the information recorded with the status evaluation component is optimally presented up the chain of command.  After HACS system integration, the system will be rigorously tested in the lab and during field exercises to ensure that is will provide added benefits to warfighters when fielded.",

        "abstract": "Future Air Force hypersonic vehicles will employ complex shapes and fly extended maneuvering trajectories.  Since the flight times may increase by an order of magnitude or more, existing ablative thermal protection systems will not be practical due to their excessive surface recession and high density.  The future Air Force vehicles will employ wave rider shaped carbon-carbon aeroshells over multiple insulating layers to protect the payload.  The present manufacturing method employed for these aeroshells is hand lay-up of two-dimensional fabric in which substructures are tediously formed and debulked to create a carbon/phenolic (C/Ph) precursor aeroshell.  Even with this time-consuming process, the aeroshell often delaminates during carbonization so the part must be scrapped.  This leads to an expensive, trial and error process to develop an acceptable carbon-carbon part. In order for carbon-carbon aeroshells to serve as a practical component for future hypersonic vehicles, it is necessary to develop less expensive fabrication methods, and more reliable, well understood processing techniques.  One attractive fabrication method uses a tape-wrapping technique in which a bias-ply C/Ph tape is wrapped over a mandrel, cured, carbonized, and graphitized to form a carbon-carbon aeroshell.  Tape-wrapping has been recently applied successfully to the development of erosion-resistant carbon-carbon exit cones.  A second attractive fabrication technique is to replace the flat 2D lay-ups with an involute, or rosette construction.  The involute plies spiral from the inner to outer diameter of the carbon-carbon part providing through-thickness reinforcement to reduce the potential for delaminations.  Involute technology was used throughout the 1980s and 1990s to build carbon-carbon exit cones for Air Force missile systems such as the Peacekeeper.   In addition to alternate fiber architectures carbon-carbon processing techniques can also be improved significantly using models that address pore pressures and shrinkage stresses that occur during carbonization.  These processing models have been applied successfully to the recent fabrication of carbon-carbon exit cones.   The goal of the Phase II effort is to develop a material design and processing method that will produce a structurally sound C-C aeroshell for prompt global strike reentry body.  The development effort will address both tape wrapped and involute fabrication methods.  Tape wrapping provides potentially lower processing risk, but also offers lower strengths and stiffness.  Alternatively, involutes offer higher thermostructural properties, but are expected to exhibit higher processing risk.  The proposed Phase II effort will be performed by a team of Materials Research & Design (MR&D), ATK Launch Systems, Southern Research Institute (SoRI), and Mr. H.O. Davis.  MR&D will analyze the operational behavior of the aeroshell, exercise the processing model, design the subcomponents and manage the program.  ATK will fabricate materials and perform carbonization experiments.  SoRI will characterize C/Ph materials for processing properties and carbon-carbon panels for thermostructural properties. Mr. H.O. Davis will guide the process modeling, involute design, and carbon-carbon fabrication.",

The newer Navy vessels under construction, like LCS, or design, like DDG-51, would benefit from the lighter weight and lower fuel costs which would result from an improved lightweight insulation system. Phase II plans include moving forward developing an insulation system using the FireMaster Marine and FireMaster Marine Plus materials from Thermal Ceramics. Once developed, amorphous fiber blanket material by Unifrax Corporation will be investigated as a second fiber material source. In small scale testing, the amorphous fibers manufactured by Thermal Ceramics will be used in conjunction with layers of new materials. For the deck design the weight threshold is less than 1.3 lbs/ft2 with a goal of 1.0 lb/ft2. For the bulkhead design the weight threshold is less than 1 lb/ft2 with a goal of 0.7 lb/ft2. Any applicable guidance drawings will be updated to include the insulation systems developed in Phase II of this SBIR. Using the same process as for steel, an insulation system for N-30 Aluminum bulkhead and deck divisions will be developed. Fire testing will be conducted at both Intertek ETL SEMKO in Elmendorf, Texas and at Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas.

The combination of these two innovative technologies enables the Precision Pulse Positioning Orientation System (3POS) as an effective approach to provide self-determination of the position and orientation of stationary or moving platforms.  In Phase I PRA developed the optimal combination of polarization, phase, and timing measurements required for the 3POS and now proposes to demonstrate the system by developing and testing a prototype in Phase II.  PRA proposes a 3POS architecture with multiple receive antennas (three or four) located on a platform to determine position and orientation in an inertial reference frame that is defined by the transmit antennas.  In addition to being low cost, 3POS will also occupy minimal real estate on a platform and require minimal power to operate.",

Therefore, sophisticated attack tools are able to defeat nearly any software-based protection mechanism. What is needed is a software protection framework that is immune to this inherent weakness.  By using a hypervisor, sensitive data and algorithms are moved outside of the reach of the operating system, and therefore outside the reach of virtually all software-based attack tools.

        "abstract": "Virtual and constructive simulation environments provide powerful practice for warfighters because they offer realistic events to which the warfighters can respond. To use these environments for effective training, they must provide pedagogically sound training experiences which incorporate measures and assessments of trainee performance in relation to training objectives.  Current scenario definition languages have been designed to provide high fidelity detail with respect to physical entities in the simulation environment, the interactions among them, and the scenario events, but they generally fail to define the pedagogical aspects of the scenario.  Lacking the explicit pedagogical scenario goals, training events based on these scenarios can not be optimized to achieve the training objectives.  To meet these challenges, Aptima is developing PRESTO (Pedagogically Relevant Engineering of Scenarios for Training Objectives), which will include support for developing pedagogically sound training scenarios and provide training runtime support for SAF operators to focus on bringing about the experiences the trainee needs to achieve their training objectives.  PRESTO will also develop scenario language components to describe the pedagogical aspects of the scenario for incorporation into other scenario definition languages.  PRESTO will be able to support a variety of simulation environments.",

        "abstract": "In Phase II of this SBIR, Harmonic Devices (HDI) proposes to develop miniaturized MEMS filters at UHF, S-band and Ka-band to address the requirements of NASA's next-generation software defined EVA radio.  The filters are a key enabler for this highly reconfigurable, fault tolerant, cell-phone sized EVA radio.\n\nFor UHF and S-band, HDI will employ its proprietary contour-mode aluminum nitride MEMS piezoelectric resonator technology.  Processed on silicon substrates, the resonators have their natural frequency defined by the lateral, in-plane dimensions of the structure.  This feature enables the definition of different frequencies directly at the CAD layout level.  Thus, the low insertion loss UHF and S-band filters can be monolithically integrated into a single chip.  For the Ka-band, HDI will employ coaxial 3D MEMS interdigital filters that exhibit low insertion and ripple in a miniaturized form factor.  Several US companies have expressed a keen interest in HDI's technology.  \n\nIn Phase I, HDI successfully proved the feasibility of employing the proposed UHF, S-band, and Ka-band filters in NASA's software defined EVA radio through simulation and microfabrication pilot studies.  The filters can be monolithically integrated onto the same silicon substrate, resulting in substantial savings in board space.  The objective of Phase II is to build the filter prototypes and deliver them to NASA for testing.  The results of the Phase I feasibility study convincingly justify Phase II continuation.",

        "abstract": "The Global War on Terrorism is increasing pressure for DOD depots to expedite the return of serviceable weapon systems to the warfighter while maintaining or decreasing maintenance costs. Each military service has responded to this challenge by undertaking enterprise-wide logistics modernization programs.   Efficient data capture and programmatic data input is a primary obstacle in the production deployment of these systems, often delaying critical productivity gains by a factor of years.  Significant progress has been made in areas of financial management and material procurement but no service has effectively addressed depot shop floor automation.   While each service has maintenance execution capabilities on its implementation roadmap, an efficient systematic process of data capture and programmatic data input has not been adequately addressed. This project proposes to develop an effective system of converting current depot shop floor paper-based work instructions into ISA-95 standard-based XML files configured for data loading ISA-95 compliant shop floor automation systems and enabling Integrated Work Control Processes (IWCP)\u2019s.  Anautics will develop the proposed capabilities in partnership and being sponsored through the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC) , Siemens UGS Software , and the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences (NCMS)  .  OC-ALC will provide access to source data and resources to verify and validate processes, Siemens UGS Software will provide Teamcenter requirements management, portfolio management, and maintenance execution software and services; and NCMS will provide access to complimentary research and development programs.  To ensure program success, Anautics will work with NCMS in the OC-ALC Engines shop as a test bed for the IWCP application. This will ensure no production DOD systems or networks are impacted during the test and development effort. Although the IWCP team will be working in an isolated test environment, data validation and process accuracy will be assured through the collaborative participation of OC-ALC equipment specialist, planners, and shop floor supervisors. When completed; the system, captured data and supported processes will be presented to DOD Logistics Program Offices for evaluation and potential incorporation into formal implementation roadmaps.",

Second, in order to take advantage of the explosion of temporal information that we will make available, we will provide temporal reasoning capabilities which will allow event visualization systems to \"make sense\" of complex situations automatically.  Our Phase II work will continue the development of a robust graph-based temporal reasoning component which can track changes in reference time throughout a document, estimate the duration of specific events, identify the likely order of a sequence of events, and compute an exact time-stamp for events which are not associated with overt time or date information.

        "abstract": "As technology trends towards higher system data rates with reduced size and cost, the ability to create high-speed electrical interconnections at low cost is becoming critical. High-speed I/O, integrated along with high I/O parallellicity, is allowing interconnects to achieve over 1Tb/s of total chip-to-chip data rates. These rates are on a rapid upward trend, increasing at a rate of about 20% per year. As this trend continues, chips with many hundreds of parallel 20 Gb/s I/Os will be on the scene within the next few years. In order to compensate for the inadequacies of the interconnect technologies, chip manufacturers are integrating low-jitter clock circuits, adaptive equalization and multilevel signaling into chip I/O. However, the high nonrecurring costs involved in such approaches can only be afforded by the highest volume applications. Using commercial materials and printed circuit manufacturing methods, this proposed program will develop an inexpensive technology for increasing the bandwidth of copper traces on printed circuits. The approach involves using novel networks and repeaters to optimize each data channel at the design stage using conventional design tools. Our techniques will permit creation of copper-clad printed circuits using conventional materials, such as FR4, yet support single channel data rates in excess of 10Gb/s.",

The system combines projection of structured laser light with photography of the illuminated surface.  Photogrammetric techniques are used to obtain the three dimensional shape of the surface.  Whereas most structured light systems employ a repeating pattern of lines, the proposed system uses a robust true 2D pattern that is maximally distinct in any small region. This approach captures all the data necessary to determine the relative 3D positions of separated objects or portions of an object with a single pattern and eliminates the need for alignment of multiple patterns projected in sequence, allowing rapid high resolution profile capture. It also facilitates capture of relative positions of separated objects by avoiding the position ambiguities introduced with repeating patterns. Shapes of rapidly moving or deforming objects are captured in a single laser flash, allowing direct measurement of transient structure strain, vibration, or motion. 3D snapshots of wind tunnel models can be acquired in either single-camera or multi-camera mode, with short exposure times, fast frame rates, and high accuracy.",

Overall transmit or receive patterns are then described as products of two factors: the element pattern and the, so-called, array factor. Practical small array antennas may not conform to the above assumptions, since their elements may be influenced differently by their physical environments. This may cause theoretical patterns to become degraded. In this SBIR effort, TSC proposes to improve the antenna pattern performance of an existing legacy array via corrective phase and/or amplitude controls at its individual elements, through the implementation of a powerful optimization technique whose effectiveness and efficiency has already been demonstrated in other antenna and waveform design applications and whose feasibility has been demonstrated during Phase I of this SBIR topic. During this Phase II TSC proposes to validate this optimization, via modeling and simulation and via actual measurements in a legacy beamformer. TSC also plans to use its optimization to support a three-way tradeoff analysis among radome design, beamformer design, and attendant pattern performance.",

        "abstract": "To support Non Line of Sight (NLOS) lethality for the USMC weapons systems timely, accurate targeting is needed for Ground Based Observers using imagery collected from a Tier II UAS.  In Phase I, an Unmanned Air System (UAS) payload was designed and a systems architecture developed that could support NLOS fires using mensurated imagery generated in real-time using a GPS, IMU, and camera system and provide access to the georectified and georegistered imagery for targeting through a web interface.  Our Phase I analysis showed that this technology would enable a GBO to determine target coordinates at ranges greater than 5 km from a UAS with target location errors of less than 10 meters. In Phase II, NAVSYS will develop a fully functional prototype system and integrate the payload onto a surrogate UAS with a GRIM server that the GBO can access through a WiFi link and laptop.  This system will be used to demonstrate the following capabilities in an operationally relevant environment: \u2022 Georegistration of images to produce mosaiced, overhead map in near-real-time \u2022 Web server to support GBO targeting from imagery through a WiFi interface \u2022 Determination of accurate target coordinates for Call for Fire (< 10 meters TLE)",

Related techniques associated with this method includes the use of severe deformation for material homogenization and refinement, micro/nano composite development, and the use of shape memory effect for reduced and fully reservable/repeatable hysteresis for improved MEMS packaging reliability.

        "abstract": "Certification of systems with Information Assurance requirements is challenging and expensive due to the lack of powerful abstractions that permit separation of concerns.  Current methods consider systems in total at the implementation level and the resulting complexity leads to expensive an inaccurate system characterizations.  A need exists to provide representations of diverse, yet coordinated, behaviors affecting MILS policies and certification as executable models to produce high fidelity, repeatable and readily communicated artifacts. We propose an innovative approach to address these challenges by introducing abstractions based on a hierarchical set of system security properties that describe the system at the infrastructure, architecture and application levels.  The result is a unified model based design and analysis environment that reduces the cost and risk associated with the design/certification of high assurance computing systems. We are able to represent the properties of critical system aspects and provide tailored analysis and visualization capabilities to meet system stakeholder (managers, developers, certifiers) requirements.  Our previous work on model based analysis for system safety and dependability properties provides a solid foundation for our approach, enables the consideration of cross cutting system aspects (security, safety, dependability) and demonstrates the scalability and technical feasibility of our tool implementation strategy.",

The existing tools, processes, and data sources are no longer sufficient to fully communicate and protect the interoperability of our deploying naval forces. Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) are the technical and commercial response to these same issues. They are based around the decomposition of complex web-based applications into web-service components. A primary advantage of an SOA is the natural separation of business logic, data, and user interface. This provides a natural mechanism for third-party interface with business-logic protected data.

Phase I testing produced useful data on model scale autorotating rotors at advance ratios up to 1.7, thereby supporting analysis development and laying the groundwork for further Phase II testing.  Enhanced yawed flow models for comprehensive rotorcraft analyses were also investigated and an enhanced lifting surface blade/wake model was developed and validated for improved modeling in this regime.  Additionally, Phase I studied CFD grid generation and flow analysis methods for improved modeling of reversed and strong spanwise flows.  Phase II will see further high advance ratio rotor tests, up to 2.5, and CFD analysis supporting the development of new validated models suitable for extreme yawed flow.  These new models will be incorporated into CDI's commercial rotorcraft aerodynamics software for immediate use in rotorcraft design and flight simulation codes.

The strength of the approach comes from the fact that (1) the software application is securely tied to the TPM security chip through these snippets, (2) the \"holes\" or \"voids\" that the snippets create in the original binary make it very difficult to reverse engineer the overall application code, (3) the application software can be protected against unauthorized execution, and (4) the TPM snippets provide integrity checking against modifications of the binary.

The Tai-Yang Research Company (TYRC), in an ONR-sponsored Phase I SBIR effort, designed a quick disconnect terminal fitting for a high temperature superconducting cable that provides simultaneous electrical and cryogenic connection in a compact, rugged and simple package. In the proposed Phase II Base project and Options I-IV, TYRC proposes to advance the degaussing cable technology from TRL 3 to TRL 6. The proposed effort includes several prototype connector design/build/test iterations, a factory connector test facility, a full-length HTS degaussing cable assembly, and a facility for testing the cable onboard a ship platform. TYRC will develop a manufacturing plan and supplier relationships in order to successfully transition the program to Phase III.",

        "abstract": "The Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) is an amphibious vehicle designed to operate through harsh conditions and at much higher speeds than its predecessors.  These capabilities and broadly vary operational conditions lead to a complex design and human factors scenario for the forward seating positions that cannot be solved using a passive seat suspension.  Injurious shock loads transmitted to the occupants when traversing over water in high sea states as well as harmful shock and vibration transmitted to the occupants when the vehicle is traveling over land pose a threat to occupant health and significantly limit mission length.  To address this, a retrofit-capable Semi-Active Magnetorheological Vehicle Seat (SAMVS) system was developed in Phase I which adapts to these broadly varying operational conditions as well as occupant weight to provide optimal protection of the occupant during EFV missions.  The key technologies behind the SAMVS system is a retrofit-capable magnetorheological (MR) damper that can be electronically controlled by compact control electronics featuring a control algorithm developed specifically for this application.  With these technologies, the SAMVS system enables a unique single solution for all shock and vibration environments encountered by the EFV.  It has been shown that the SAMVS system can reduce the shock dosages applied to the occupant by 33% in water mode and reduce the vibration transmitted to the occupant by 65% as compared to the current passive suspension system.  Further performance gains are expected in Phase II as a tactical prototype system is fabricated, tested, and refined.",

As demonstrated during Phase I, a statistical description of Environmental Severity Indices (ESIs) derived from climatological data contained in CFDDA databases may be used to construct statistically representative three-dimensional atmospheres, defined by the probability of encounter, Pe. We have shown how these may be used to construct hydrometeor descriptions for system requirements definitions and to provide weather encounter erosion estimates using the Aeroheating and Thermal Analysis Code (ATAC). During Phase II we will refine the CFDDA hydrometeor models, improve the CFDDA database format and provide direct database access for the ATAC model. A graphical user interface will be developed to drive the systems requirements definition and system performance studies.

The sensor nodes alert one another when the tracked objects might enter another sensor's FOV.  Additionally, the sensor nodes pass track information which allows a sensors to identify objects that come within its FOV as the same object that was in another sensor's FOV.

        "abstract": "Orbital pipe welding systems are not true emulation of skilled welders who adjust welding parameters based on observation on the weld pool. This SBIR Phase II project aims at the development of commercial prototype systems which can adaptively adjust welding parameters based on an observation on the weld pool surface like a skilled welder but does not require the torch to be moved smoothly/evenly. One of the major innovations associated with this technology is a so-called \"torch sensor\" which can \u00a1\u00b0observe\u00a1\u00b1 the weld pool surface to measure its depth. In addition, this sensor is adaptive in response to possible fluctuations/variations in welder's operations. Another major innovation is the control strategy used, which reduces the current to a lower level each cycle once the desired weld pool surface depth is achieved rather than trying to maintain the depth at the desired level. Phase II base and option I projects are designed to develop the first commercial prototype for manual welding of pipes by relatively inexperienced welders. If the option II project is awarded, another commercial prototype will be developed to integrate the technology into an orbital system for automated orbital pipe welding. Phase III aims at their adoption to DDX program.",

The replacement device sterilizes using low temperature discharge plasma and requires only several millileters of hydrogen peroxide for each cycle versus approximately five gallons of distilled water with the autoclave.

In addition, reduced weight requirements for the next generation Future Combat System (FCS) dictate a need to mitigate the recoil and manage the total heat load.  In order to design a light weight gun tube which resists excessive wear, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms contributing to thermochemical erosion is necessary.  This new program development will result in a computer code that melds modern computational modeling with all the prior knowledge of thermochemical erosion.

        "abstract": "Conventional approaches to developing Insensitive Munitions (IM) solutions for composite rocket motor cases have involved the development of improved energetic material formulations combined with various techniques to achieve venting of the composite case structure prior to propellant ignition and catastrophic failure of the motor. Such approaches have achieved some degree of success in enhancing IM performance, but typically at the expense of additional weight, more costly manufacturing and/or reduced mechanical strength. In order to meet the challenging IM performance goals for impact, sympathetic detonation, and cook-off response, and to achieve processing characteristics that are compatible with state-of-the-art filament winding procedures, new material formulations are desired for near-term and future missile structure programs. This SBIR program involves the development and characterization of multifunctional, high conductivity polymers and highly aligned prepreg mats reinforced with multiwall nanotubes (MWNTs) to achieve tailored conductivity and inherent IM performance improvements while maintaining favorable processing characteristics. The proposed research consists of a multi-stage, integrated modeling and process development approach to achieve optimal material formulations and a prototype composite case design. This research is expected to result in enabling nanomaterials technologies to meet the Army\u2019s goals for improved composite structures with multifunctional performance characteristics for tactical missile systems.",

This package size is 2 in. X 2.5 in. X 8 in. in dimension, and weighs less than 3 lbs. and has the advantage of being a standard size for Department of Defense expendable items.  For future ASW missions, this greatly improves the detection potential of helicopter-equipped ships, including the Navy\u2019s new Littoral Combat Ship (LCS).  Navmar\u2019s approach further allows for selectable modes of operation, including single high source level impulses, multiple lower level impulses, or precisely timed M of N type impulses.  This serves to provide great flexibility of a single source package, ranging from large area search, to localization, to potentially Doppler content from an impulsive source.  Additionally, the volume reduction of 20:1 over the conventional A-size sonobuoy will greatly improve storage and handling issues aboard ships, with their constrained storage area, and reduce at-sea replenishment requirements.",

In the Phase I program, critical technical issues related to the formulation of numerical solution schemes for these coupled equation sets in terms of numerical algorithms, relative stiffness, disparate time scales and wave speeds, flux construction were resolved and applied to applications of control in conductors and Hartmann channels. In Phase II, the models will be extended to include more complex electromagnetic plasma interactions and verification and validation performed for a range of high speed missile/plume and flow control applications.

For example, an electronic attack mission may require simultaneous operation of communications equipment and a high-powered jamming transmitter.  Or, a UAV may need to transmit telemetry and collect SIGINT simultaneously.

        "abstract": "Many current United States Navy (USN) OPSIT/TACSIT scenarios comprise demanding dynamic environments for airborne sensors.  The ability to task or mode interleave with adaptive scheduling is essential to achieving desired sensor/mission effectiveness.  Both active electronically scanned array (AESA) and conventional mechanically scanned antenna (MSA) airborne multi-mode radar systems will require energy timeline resource management to realize their full performance capabilities.  Furthermore, the programmable nature of many modern AESA based sensor architectures allows real-time modification of antenna pattern and waveform characteristics.  Real-time adaptive optimization of AESA control and scheduling over the implicitly large number of degrees of freedom is computationally impractical without sufficient constraints.  In contrast, non-adaptive legacy resource management approaches rely exclusively on rule-based constrained methodologies that relax computational concerns, but significantly under utilize radar energy timeline resources.  Recent real-time computer systems research in optimum scheduling in complex dynamic environments has produced computationally efficient approximate solutions that are attractive for use with rule-based constraints.  LSI proposes to develop and evaluate hybrid rule-based constrained optimization techniques for real-time adaptive optimization of airborne AESA and MSA control and scheduling.  These techniques will apply to airborne AESA and MSA radar systems of interest to the USN and address both air-to-air and air-to-ground operation.",

This research will produce a computer-controlled physical system capable of delivering motion, vibration and jitter in six degrees of freedom to a payload up to 300 kg.  The payload could be a small spacecraft, or a large or small subassembly or sensor.  A means of physical characterization of vibration disturbance sources will also be developed.  Requirements for simulation will be gathered from the AIRSS program and other sources.  These will drive the design of a hardware and software spacecraft motion and vibration simulator.  The six-axis simulator will use a hexapod geometry with electromagnetic actuation and be both portable and suitable for vacuum operation.  It will be operated from a user interface and will accept and export data to other ground test systems.  The simulator will be delivered to the Air Force and interfaced with new ground test subsystems and payloads.  It will reach full capability with inclusion of software for simulating more general mechanical impedances, for example those resulting from spacecraft solar arrays.  A separate system for six-axis characterization of vibration disturbances including cryocoolers will also be delivered.  BENEFIT:  The motion and vibration simulator will have direct application to the Third Generation Surveillance (TGIRS) system and its Integrated Testbed (ITB).  It will provide greater realism in the mechanical environment during ground testing and allow verification and improvement of wide field of view infrared sensor performance through physical test.  It will reduce risk for space flight components.  The companion vibration characterization system will provide a means of verifying properties of vibration disturbance sources and of comparing signatures of different components including cryocoolers.  This information will be useful in satellite and sensor models.  The simulation capability will be applicable to missile flight motion simulation and generation of synthetic environments for other aerospace and defense systems, including testing and validation of homeland security systems on mobile or harsh environment platforms.\"",

The complexity of space-flight design requires reliable, fault-tolerant equipment capable of providing real-time dose readings during a mission, which is not feasible with the existing thermo-luminescent dosimeter (TLD) technology, especially during extravehicular activities (EVA).  Real-time monitoring is important for low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and interplanetary space flight to alert the crew when Solar Particle Events (SPE) increase the particle flux of the spacecraft environment.  \nThe Phase-II project will design and fabricate a prototype Dosimeter-on-a-Chip (DoseChip) for personal dosimetry comprised of a tissue-equivalent scintillation crystal coupled to a solid-state photomultiplier (SSPM).  The ubiquitous nature of CMOS technology provides a standardized development platform, and the ability to integrate the supporting electronics into a miniature, lightweight design.\nThe DoseChip provides a tissue-equivalent response to the relevant energies and types of radiation for low-Earth orbit and interplanetary space flight to the moon or Mars and will be sensitive to the dose rates and particle fluxes of ambient Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) to the higher rates of major SPE.  The DoseChip will complement the existing Crew Passive Dosimeters by providing real-time dosimetry and as an alarming monitor for SPE.",

Innovative design features beside the control will include the use of different drive motors on separate drive wheels to provide both low and high speeds while saving weight and the use of recent developments in power technology to provide high speeds, weight savings, and long durations of use.

Yet O&S costs are often under estimated, especially early in the development cycle when 80% or more of the total ownership cost is \u201clocked-in\u201d by technology/system design decisions. Developers and planners require an approach to estimate the cost impact of designs quickly and with credibility, enabling life-cycle cost to be used as a key element in technology/system design trades for a \u201cbest-value\u201d system. This includes identification of key O&S cost drivers, uncertainties, sensitivities and the cost-risks associated with technology maturity and system/technology manufacturability. This capability will help to ensure new military technologies and systems are both effective and affordable. This Phase II research will enhance an existing cost methodology and computer toolset. The existing toolset is the basis for affordability tools used within several DoD acquisition and research organizations. The integration of technology maturity and manufacturability considerations into the cost-estimation methodology will provide a capability acknowledged by the Defense Science Board as an important issue in systems acquisition.

        "abstract": "OPTRA proposes the development of a two-color IR source simulator based on fused projected images of two digital micromirror devices (DMDs), one for each spectral band.  The system employs a broadband IR (thermal) source whose energy is spectrally filtered via a dichroic beamsplitter and bandpass filters prior to being imaged onto each DMD.  The \u201con\u201d reflected image from each DMD is then recombined by the dichroic beamsplitter, and the fused beam is expanded by a telescope and transmitted towards the unit under test.  The relative intensities of the two bands are controlled through the duty cycle of \u201con\u201d versus \u201coff\u201d images reflected by each DMD.  Because the IR source temperature is constant, response is considerably faster than resistive based simulators; similarly, thermal management issues are significantly less complex than with resistive arrays whose time constant depends on thermal management.  Simplified thermal management may result in a lower power, more fieldable system.  This approach provides a broadband simulation, unlike laser simulators, resulting in a more representative target with which to challenge an IR tracker.  The overall approach offers the ability to realistically simulate the spectral, spatial, temporal, and radiant intensity properties of a number of targets for IR tracker test applications.",

In Phase I we have demonstrated the approach using simulations and experimental test beds. The successful completion of this phase of the project provided a prototype health monitoring system and established a framework to integrate new algorithms allowing the rapid packaging of advanced health management techniques for validation and verification, flight certification and final system integration and evaluation. In Phase II, we will develop a diagnostics and prognostics toolbox that will allow the transition of advanced techniques for on-line health monitoring of power system components to operational situations.

However, other tests have indicated these coatings are incapable of surviving rough handling, such as the -65&#61616; F drop test, or decontamination after exposure to chemical agents.  Therefore, it is a goal of the proposed work to develop a protective coating for munitions containers having a thermal conductivity no more than 0.1 W/m K, while providing chemical agent resistance and decontaminability. Phase I involved development of selected fire retardants and their incorporation into a water-based resin for spray application to meet the requirements of the coating.  The resins were chosen for their excellent adhesion to metal, resistance to chemical exposure, and low temperature resilience to survive cold-temperature impact. Concept feasibility was demonstrated in cold-temperature impact tests and propane torch exposure tests of prototypes spray applied to zinc-phosphate-coated steel.

Both of these factors cause significant lead-time and cost impacts.

        "abstract": "The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of producing a wearable health monitoring system for the human body that is functional, comfortable, bendable in 3 dimensions, durable, water-proof, washable, and light-weight. This new technology area of wearable health systems, sometimes referred to as smart-clothing, promises to allow for a secondary human nervous system that connects various different electronic devices positioned on or around the human body. As the shrinking in size and weight of electronic circuits has progressed, it is now possible for the modern human astronaut to carry increasing numbers of different electronic devices and sensors such as thermometers, gas monitors, microphones, altimeters, digital processors, digital memory, and push-button controls. These devices allow the astronaut to access data about their current environment and health status, and communicate with other astronauts and/or databases to send and receive information of value. As the variation in the number of devices and sensors that can be deployed increases greatly, a new technology is required to allow the seamless integration of these devices with the human astronaut so that the devices can be electrically powered, operated, re-charged, and communicate with each other over a digital pathway.",

For this data to be\nuseful to humans monitoring these systems and to automated algorithms\ncontrolling these systems it will need to be converted into more\nabstract data.  This abstracted data will reflect the trends and\ncharacteristics of the systems and their environments.  Currently this\ndata abstraction process is manual and ad hoc.  It is manual in the\nsense that either humans do the abstraction in their heads or the data\nabstraction is done by hand-coding computer programs for each data\nitem.  It is ad hoc in the sense that each data abstraction is\ndeveloped on its own with no representation of how it relates to the\ntasks being performed or to other data abstractions.  In this project\nwe propose building a Data Abstraction Architecture (DAA) that allows\nengineers to design software processes that iteratively convert\nspacecraft data into higher and higher levels of abstraction.  The DAA\nalso formalizes the relationships between data and control and the\nrelationships between the data themselves.  The DAA consists of\nrepresentations for data and data abstractions, a data store, a\nabstraction architecture processing engine and a development\nenvironment.  We will evaluate the architecture using three NASA\ndomains: 1) a lunar outpost monitoring and control application; 2) a\nrobotic scientific survey application; and 3) a vehicle procedure\nexecution scenario.",

This is based on direct conversion of the RF waveform to digital format using an ultrafast analog-to-digital conversion (ADC), followed by ultrafast digital processing. The proposed receiver uses both superconductor and semiconductor circuits, both digital and analog, within the same heterogeneous-temperature, hybrid technology (HTHT) system.  The individual components have already been designed and are being demonstrated in other projects.  In the present Phase II project, a complete architectural design will be undertaken, for several Navy shipboard platforms, to deliver maximum performance within real-world constraints.  Issues of receiver performance, cryogenic packaging, power and size, system reliability, and system costs will be addressed.  This will demonstrate the feasibility of such an HTHT digital SATCOM receiver incorporating multiple receive bands.  Progress during this project will direct optimization of system components that are being pursued in parallel with concurrent funding. Design, fabrication, and demonstration of some critical components will be carried out during the Phase II Option.  At the conclusion of the project, a detailed multi-band digital-RF transceiver system design for a chosen Navy SATCOM program will be delivered for implementation in Phase III.",

Identifying the true costs of transitioning technologies from concept to production is complicated by many factors, from the lack of a known cost basis from which to estimate new requirements to difficulties in identifying information that can support improved cost extrapolations.  Based on an ontology-driven approach, the Requirements-Based Cost Modeling System (RBCMS) will be a web-accessible toolset that enables users to evaluate and document cost estimates, particularly in pre-proposal and proposal project stages.   InRAD\u2019s software will merge cost data with technical information to provide a foundation for determining costs for elements in order to (1) provide a basis for the derivation of cost drivers and their impact to total product cost and product requirements and (2) provide a systematic approach for cost managers to access highly targeted data to substantiate costs for which no historical or documented costs are known. The RBCMS will manage cost sessions to provide continual histories of changes and traceability to factors that impacted projections.

        "abstract": "Optimizing the human contribution to joint warfighting, and achieving a revolutionary war-winning capability for future operations requires a paradigm shift from traditional methods of leadership.  For future leaders to be effective their training must adapt to rapidly changing events and they must have the knowledge and skills to lead operations in various battlefield and non-battlefield environments such as peacekeeping, stability, humanitarian operations, and working with international organizations.  In the new paradigm, the enemy sets conditions so U.S. forces must engage at the tactical level, reducing the role of technology in the fight.  This requires leaders who understand how to achieve human dominance over potential adversaries in addition to kinetic dominance.  Working with the United States Military Academy, we identified and defined the dynamic leadership skills required in modern asymmetric warfare.  In examining basic leadership concepts, we found ten specific roles and responsibilities necessary for leaders to operate effectively when engaged in joint, stability, support and security operations within an asymmetrical war environment.  In addition, the authors found that certain meta-leadership knowledge and skills and attributes were expected to enhance leader performance.",

During Phase II, we will also evaluate the interoperability of our framework with 802.21 MIH, and make technical contributions to the standard community.

To meet this challenge, the DECISIVE ANALYTICS Corporation team is pursuing two related objectives.  First, we are developing a framework, based on the Dual Node Network technical architecture that will allow the deployment of an interlaced information fusion and adjudication network to enable effective decentralized, distributed fusion within operational and communication limitations.

        "abstract": "Military personnel are often subjected to significant vertical acceleration while carrying out their duties.  Such acceleration can interfere with the individual\u2019s ability to view platform-fixed displays by inducing spatial disorientation and/or motion sickness.  The resulting decrease in personnel performance arises from head movements and posture-maintaining muscle coordination that are the body\u2019s response to vestibular-ocular reflexes.  Suppression of these reflexes can lead to improved functional performance; repeated exposure to vertical linear motions can desensitize a person from these natural reflexes. The development of a vertical linear accelerator (VLA) system will enable researchers to accurately test for, evaluate, and even provide rehabilitation for the effects of vertical acceleration on the vestibular-ocular reflexes. In the Phase I effort, Dynamic Structures and Materials (DSM) produced a 1/3rd scale VLA prototype using linear motors and air bearing technologies that tracked commanded position within +/-100 microns at speeds up to 7 ft/s.  Operational frequencies of up to 4 Hz were demonstrated.  Velocity tracking was within 0.9% of the commanded velocity. Sound measurements were within ambient noise levels.  DSM proposes this Phase II effort to develop and install a full-scale VLA that will provide an important training and testing tool for both screening and desensitization applications.",

        "abstract": "With the expected extension of duration of the space missions outlined in NASA's Vision of Space Exploration, such as a manned mission to Mars or the establishment of a lunar base, the need to produce potable water from onboard wastewater streams in a closed-loop system becomes critical for life support and health of crew membranes. Reverse osmosis (RO) is a compact process that has proven its ability to remove inorganic and organic contaminants from space mission wastewater. Our Phase I feasibility study indicate that the use of low-energy composite hollow fiber RO membranes developed at Santa Fe Science and Technology resulted in a 65-80% increase in the production of purified water compared to that obtained from the corresponding low-energy RO flat-sheet membrane without sacrificing the water quality of the permeate stream. Therefore, replacing existing spiral wound membrane elements in the RO subsystem with hollow fiber membrane elements will reduce the batch processing time or enable a lower feed pressure to be employed due to the use of higher productivity membrane elements. This will lower the overall power requirement for the RO subsystem. Phase 2 will be based on expanding the size of the membrane element in order to develop several working prototype membrane elements that can eventually be mounted in the RO subsystem of the closed-loop Integrated Water Purification System. Also during Phase 2, we will explore the use of hydrophilic polymeric coatings to determine whether it is possible to minimize the rate of membrane fouling due to the high concentration of organics in the wastewater feed stream.",

This Phase II project is targeted toward extending the durability of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) on hot section turbine components.  TBCs are highly susceptible to degradation by corrosion at elevated temperatures, and degradation from Calcium Magnesium Alumino Silicate (CMAS) is of particular concern to the Navy.  CMAS is a byproduct of decomposed jet fuel and can attack critical components.  The mitigation of CMAS effects by use of thin overlay coatings on TBCs is the primary focus of this SBIR project.  In Phase I, ATFI demonstrated that a low-cost, solution-based inorganic coating was effective in infiltrating the TBC and limiting corrosion by CMAS.  Various TBC architectures were evaluated and, in most cases, positive impact was realized from the presence of the overlay coating.  In Phase II, ATFI will work with engine manufacturers to further develop this concept and test performance under burner rig exposure conditions.  Additionally, prototype parts will be developed and made available for testing by the Navy which will aide in preparation for transition planning and Phase III participation.",

This provides high power density at low cost and a small size and weight.  When used as a driver amplifier in the MPM, the V/W band MMIC provides sufficient power and gain to drive the specially designed V/W-band TWT.  InnoSys uses high voltage integrated circuits to achieve the high voltages needed for the TWT, and solid state vacuum device technology for the design and implementation of the microfabricated TWT power boosters.  The overall gain of the combined MMIC/TWT is high, and that attribute is coupled with a reduction in the size and weight of the power supply.  By combining the precise, lower cost manufacturing advantages of solid state with the high-frequency, high-power performance advantages of vacuum electronics, the result is a device/MPM that will enable V- and W-band electronics opportunities including important SATCOM applications. The V/W-band MPMs, including the integrated power supplies and conditioners, and the TWT power boosters, will be manufactured in-house by InnoSys and made available to the Department of Defense and prime contractors for defense and security applications including communication systems.",

Similar to biometrics taken from humans, digital metrics can be used to create a unique fingerprint of a compute system, or network.  The fingerprint generated can be used to unlock protected data or applications; eliminating the need to store a static key. The protection is keyed to the environment for which it was generated; therefore an attacker must be capable of recreating the environment to defeat the security. By using a dynamically generated key we are much less likely to fall into the break-once-break-often category that has plagued so many modern DRM solutions. Akita eliminates the need for key-files, key-fobs, or dongles that can be stolen and used to execute pirated copies of otherwise protected software.

This method uses a pulsed gas to draw adjacent material into a delivery pipe connected to a receiving container or exit tube for delivery over long distances. This work would continue development on the base technology of the pneumatic approach.  \nWe also propose to adapt the pneumatic system developed for mining to the task of regolith transfer. For example the pneumatic regolith transfer method could be used in place of an auger (which has a tendency to jam) to move the regolith from a hopper to an oxygen extraction plant. \nAs another application of this pneumatic approach, we proposed to use dusty gas (regolith suspended in carrier gas feeding from a hopper to a processing plant) and heat it in a heat exchanger. The convective heat transfer (or even gaseous conduction) in granular material is much more effective than solid-solid conduction especially in vacuum where particle to particle conduction is minimal making a regolith four times better insulator than aerogel.",

At present, this data is transferred over wired connections that a maintenance crew member must set up and operate.  In this context, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) is proposing to develop an advanced, digital video/audio/data Universal Avionics Recorder (UAR) that combines all of the capabilities of the current Airborne Data Recorder (ADR) and Mission Data Loader (MDL) and adds new capabilities not available on the T-45.  The UAR will also bring new functionalities, including wireless download/upload of mission- and MFOQA-related data (fully supporting MFOQA requirements) and also supporting the Terrain Avoidance Warning System (TAWS).  The TAWS represents a continuation effort for Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) protection as mandated in the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS).  In particular, the UAR will combine the functionality of the existing ADR, Advanced Signal Data Computer (ASDC), Signal Data Computer (SDC), Digital Video Recorder (DVR), and MDL into one unit.",

Robotic intelligence is required in at least four areas: two-way communication with humans, safety awareness, self-monitoring, and self-maintenance. Robot teams will need to interact with Astronauts concerning the state of their hardware. They may need to interact with humans in order to insure human safety.  In Phase 1, we developed an initial HSI Framework (HSIF) to structure protocol-driven interactions (conversations) among Astronauts and multiple-component autonomous systems (soft-bot systems (SBS)). In Phase 2, we extend our HSI framework, with new protocol development that will support interactions among {human-robot team}, {SBS\u0096 robot}, {human\u0096 robot} and {SBS- human \u0096 robot team}.

The Phase II PREOD-THz will coherently convert the terahertz field into a visible two-dimensional image for immediate view in milliseconds and with spatial resolution of ~100 pixels per inch.  The system produces ~1.0 mW/cm^2 sensitivity to terahertz waves for 20% visible contrast.  The sensitivity allows the use of a currently available commercial low-power terahertz source, helping achieve sensitive detection with a signal-to-noise ratio of ~1000 to produce a two-dimensional snapshot of a terahertz image instead of point-by-point detection, which greatly alleviates the current problem of long image acquisition time.  The miniaturized low-cost system design is frequency-independent, and has a wide bandwidth.  POC has demonstrated the PREOD principle by simulation and by fabricating a proof-of-concept prototype, demonstrating terahertz sensitivity and real-time detection.  In Phase II POC will optimize the design and component performance, and develop a fully functional engineering prototype meeting Army requirements.  PREOD-THz will represent a new portable terahertz imaging system operating at video frame rates for security applications.",

The ASSIST architecture separates the interface that specifies instruction from the construction of executable instruction, enabling the interface for instruction to be applied to different and emerging standards.

Valuable intelligence information can be extracted from exploitation of these networks, especially via correlating activities across these short-lived networks. Cross network correlation can potentially satisfy existing operational requirements. The RF Network Understanding System (RFNUS) is focused on delivering operational intelligence by applying unique cross network exploitation and correlation techniques. The Phase I activity demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. The Phase II effort will expand the Phase I concept in three major areas.  First, the number and types of networks targeted will be expanded to include exploitation of collection from current collection sensors and associated data sources. Second, the system will take advantage of classified information available from those sensors including expanded external information (including header data, and currently unavailable parameters such as power and geolocation data.  Finally, with the addition of more networks and more data from those networks, the logic contained within the discovery tool will be expanded to fully exploit the wider range of target data.  Ultimately, the Phase II objective is to produce a deployable prototype system for field testing. The prototype will be developed by identifying requirements collaboratively with the customer, and executing a workplan consisting of design, development, and integration and test tasks.",

The Modular Distributed Concentrator (MDC) comprises an array of identical, smaller-sized solar concentrator dishes with a network of power transmission links that route the high quality concentrated energy to a centralized receiver and avoids the challenges of deploying large concentrators with furnace chambers suspended at their focus. The Phase I showed the ability to optimize the concentrator reflector scale to provide low mass, showed that the heat pipe approach had better figures of merit than the optical waveguide approach, and, as a proof-of-concept, used a terrestrial solar concentrator to fire a sodium heat pipe to transmit heat at 1000C. The Phase II effort proposes to establish a system design for a MDC / heat-pipe based carbothermal processing system which requires >1625C process heat.  We develop and demonstrate the components needed to deliver heat at this temperature with high performance, using space quality materials, including concentrator, concentrator receiver, tungsten/lithium heat pipe, and an innovative Heat Pipe Thermal Interface (HPTI) that most effectively transfers the power directly into the regolith. The Phase II includes an end-to-end demonstration of all of the subsystems, collecting and concentrating solar energy, transmitting it at >1625C, through the heat pipe and HPTI into the regolith, and extracting oxygen from regolith simulant in an existing process chamber.",

The Phase I project used an ASC camera at the JPL mars yard to gather test data. Hazard Identification, and Entry Decent and Landing applications were investigated. These data sets were taken and delivered to JPL.  The analysis demonstrates that a Flash LADAR system can resolve landing hazards and is suitable as an EDL sensor.  This data, together with inputs from JPL scientists, was used to develop a brassboard camera concept for NASA applications. The optimized camera will be fabricated and delivered in Phase II.

The key innovation is the use of dual-element periodically poled waveguides embedded in a nonlinear optical substrate.  This innovation results in a vast improvement in the measurement capabilities of lidar systems by enabling the use of a single stabilized laser to both operate a high power transmitter and generate low power frequency tripled light for synchronous calibration and frequency locking of the Fabry Perot filter on the lidar receiver.  To be used in a space-based system, the UV module must be rugged and must perform optimally in a radiation environment over the mission lifetime.  To achieve this goal, the proposed dual-element structure will be packaged in a compact, robust fiber-pigtailed package which will readily lend itself to future space qualification for mechanical stability of the package and radiation damage resistance of the non-linear optical material.",

Semimetallic HgTe has already proven itself as an excellent soft x-ray absorber material due to its low heat capacity.

Hence Hg0.834Cd0.166Te-based microcalorimeter arrays are expected to have an energy resolution superior to that of HgTe-based ones. We propose the growth of single crystal Hg0.834Cd0.166Te layers by molecular beam epitaxy on Si substrates. Mercury vacancies will be filled after growth to reduce the possibility of them acting as acceptors and introducing a significant electronic heat capacity. The samples will be characterized by x-ray diffraction to assess their structural quality and crystallinity, FTIR mapping to confirm the uniformity of their energy gaps and alloy compositions, Hall measurements to assess their electrical transport properties, etch pit density counts to determine dislocation densities, transmission electron microscopy to determine microscopic structural information, and heat capacity and thermalization efficiency measurements at mK temperatures. These assessments will further test their promise as high energy resolution quantum calorimeters and will help optimize material and processing parameters. The thermal property measurements will be performed on samples specially processed to remove some or all of the Si substrates and CdTe buffer layers. Finally, the development of a broadband infrared/mm wave reflective coating will be undertaken.

Called the Spatial Frequency Remapper, SFR, it trades the large field of view of a Fizeau design for simultaneous observations at multiple wavelengths.  Since SI does not require a large field, SFR, is a clearly better design.  It can produce better images and allows tight control requirements to be relaxed.  The SFR is also the heart of a full-aperture interferometric imaging system that will dramatically improve the performance of AO equipped telescopes.\n\nThe Phase I study was remarkably successful.  The SFR design was rejected during the Vision Study because of its perceived optical complexity.  That concern was retired; the design is robust, even with many apertures.  It needs only three optical surfaces, down from the five-surface design of the Vision Study.  Tolerances are not tight.  The inputs can be divided between combiners, further simplifying the optics and data flow with negligible effect on mission performance.\n\nThe search for better sparse-aperture configurations worked.  The search was sped up 1000 fold, enabling the discovery of the 30-aperture configurations needed for SI.\n\nThe main commercial application, improving images from AO equipped telescopes, requires a seemingly impossible to build optical fiber interface.  We found an alternative assembly procedure that is standing up well to detailed study.  A data reduction technique was developed that should improve sensitivity by a factor of 1000, increasing the range of possible applications.  The configuration search found ways to divide a full-aperture into the multiple configurations, tying off another loose thread in the design.\n\nFinally, a testbed and prototyping plan was developed since in our view the success of the Phase I study clearly supports continuing the development of this technology.",

The interface of the structure/control surface dynamic vibration modes with flows will be modeled using particle-based material point method (MPM) in an integrated dynamic fluid-structure interaction environment. The MPM is essentially a particle-based method which avoids dealing with the time-varying mesh distortions and boundary variations due to structure/control surface deformations and/or motions (i.e. wing flutters, FCS/structural mode interaction, PSD turbulence response), thus being significantly more robust and computationally efficient than the traditional finite element methods that must utilize moving-boundary and mesh-regeneration.

In the JTRS environment, the possibility exists for a single terminal to be connected to multiple networks at any given time with simultaneous data transmissions occurring through the individual channels in a single terminal. A test capability needs to be developed to verify JTRS functionality, particularly, the correct performance of IP-networking waveforms. This will require a full suite of test tools, from a host simulator that generates and sends data messages, to data analysis tools such as the AADT to verify the data sent was the data actually received, to network visualization tools to verify network connectivity between nodes, to data logging and troubleshooting tools to help in isolating and diagnosing problems in the test environment.",

Transpiration-cooling technology has long been considered a candidate for long-life thrust chambers but has never been deployed on a domestic rocket engine. In this program WASK Engineering, Inc. proposes to design, fabricate and hot-fire test a 100 lbf reaction control engine (RCEs) with transpiration-cooled thrust chambers and novel injector design. This effort will build on the technology demonstrations achieved on our Phase I program. These new transpiration-cooled O2/CH4 RCEs will be tested in existing atmospheric (non-vacuum) test facilities on an existing and operational test stand. Test results will be used to anchor and refine existing transpiration cooling thermal/performance analysis models. Ultimately, results of this Phase II program will lead to a durable, low cost, non-toxic RCE technology capable of using in situ propellant combinations, particularly oxygen/methane that will have higher performance than current toxic, expensive, storable hypergolic RCE designs using rhenium-based thrust chamber technology.",

The NIRPCS will have near zero read noise and dark rates below the read noise to support photon counting for frame capture times as high as 10 seconds.  Up to 10/5 frames can be sequentially captured and digitally averaged.  Important NASA applications for the NIRPCS include spectral measurements on extra-solar planets in search of water and bio-markers and measuring the dynamics of galaxies at high redshift to better understand the formation process.  The technical objectives of Phase II are centered on more focused study on the behavior of the TE photocathode at the very low cooling temperatures anticipated for the ultimate implementation of this sensor technology by NASA for the astronomy application. The modeling results of the Phase I effort showed that reduction of the electric field in the InP, due to applied cathode bias, reduced the bias dependant hole avalanche and absorber generation contributions to the cathode dark current. Factors of 3.8x and 48.2x reduction in dark current resulted for two redesigned cathodes at an operational temperature of 200K and +2V cathode bias. This occurred by redesign of the epitaxial structure in which the p-doped cap layer was eliminated. However, too much reduction of the electric field in the InP may also reduce the escape probability of hot electrons in the InP to vacuum thereby reducing quantum efficiency. Therefore a technical Phase II objective is to execute a design of experiment (D.O.E) to determine the best epitxial design for maximum quantum efficiency and reduced dark current.",

        "abstract": "Reaction wheel mechanical noise is one of the largest sources of disturbance forcing on space-based observatories. Such noise arises from mass imbalance, bearing imperfections, and other sources. It takes the form of a number of discrete harmonics of the wheel speed, often also with a broadband noise component. Jitter problems can arise when harmonics sweep across observatory modes, and can be exacerbated by gyroscopically coupled spin-rate-dependent wheel structural modes that dynamically amplify the tonal and broadband disturbances. For a well-balanced wheel, higher harmonic forces can be on the same order as the fundamental, therefore when there is a jitter problem it can occur at very low wheel speed. These higher harmonics are generally less well-characterized than the fundamental.\n\nThe proposed Reaction Wheel Disturbance Model Extraction Software (RWDMES) is a tool for fitting a hybrid physical/empirical model to wheel induced-vibration data. The physical model captures the wheel structure including gyroscopic effects, while the empirical model captures the harmonic forcing and broadband noise. The Phase I effort demonstrated the ability to fit a highly accurate harmonic/broadband/structural model, including 43 harmonics up to 14.63 times the fundamental, to measured wheel disturbance data in a point-and-click environment in about 2 hours. The benefits of the technology include reduced program effort to produce wheel disturbance models, leading to more accurate jitter prediction earlier in a mission. This in turn allows jitter problems to be mitigated at the design stage when changes are relatively inexpensive.",

This effort will conclusively demonstrate the ability of two-stage Hall thrusters using highly-efficient helicon ionization sources to outperform today\u2019s state-of-the-art in spacecraft propulsion.",

Due to the large amounts of waste heat generated by these systems, a key consideration is the development of lightweight, highly efficient heat rejection systems (HRS) that can operate at elevated temperatures (~550 K).  Our innovation is the integration of an ultra-light radiator panel with a lightweight titanium heat pipe.  Our approach will reduce the total mass by 32% compared to our baseline design.  In addition, our innovation will greatly surpass the performance of carbon-composite systems under consideration and represents a lower risk approach to achieve a practical HRS.

        "abstract": "In this Phase II effort Toyon will increase the state-of-the-art for video/image systems.  This will include digital image compression algorithms as well as system level integration, encompassing the image sensor all the way to compressed imagery data transport.  To accomplish these goals Toyon will design a complete FPGA-based video compression system. The novel aspect of this design lies in the dynamically reconfigurable hardware IP cores that will interface to an embedded processor. Similar to a software defined radio (SDR) system where separate RF waveforms are loaded at runtime, Toyon aims to reload separate image compression encoders.  This enables the use of several different image/video compression standards, all on the same hardware platform.  The dynamically reconfiguring architecture of this system enables a single image sensor and hardware platform to handle the two most common space video camera applications, while still maintaining low power consumption in a highly integrated package.  First, H.264 for high framerate, real-time video for situational awareness and surveillance.  Second, lossless JPEG200 encoding for scientific and research post-processing.  However, due to limited funds for this Phase II design, we will most likely work with a purchased H.264 IP core along with a standard JPEG compression core, which Toyon developed on the Phase I of this program.  Providing the capability to reconfigure for both motion video and still image compression will provide near-term utility and demonstrate feasibility for Phase III development.  Toyon will target the solution to a custom fully radiation hardened hardware platform.  Potential radiation hardened components include a Xilinx FPGA, Xilinx PROM, Atmel SRAM memory, Aeroflex voltage regulators, and a Cypress CMOS image sensor paired with space-ready optics.",

Programs such as the GRC Space Transceiver Radio System (STRS) seek to abstract the radio waveform from the hardware platform itself; this is meant to improve flexibility and promote component and subsystem reuse. In this Phase II effort Toyon proposes to perform work that will advance the state of the art in reconfigurable wireless transceivers in order to help realize the vision of STRS. Specifically, we propose to develop a modular, but highly integrated, digital and analog signal processing platform along with a standards-compliant waveform. The space-ready reconfigurable radio will serve a range of NASA missions and can be easily modified or enhanced for future needs. The RF front-end will be direct conversion with high integration of the frequency translation subsystems. For digital processing, we will pursue a system-on-a-chip (SoC) design with both reconfigurable logic and a soft-core processor implemented in a radiation-hardened Xilinx FPGA and PROM. The entire system architecture will leverage an EXP board-to-board connector design developed in Phase I. This system concept was validated in Phase I through Toyon's demonstration of a fully-functional packet-based 500 kbps waveform. In Phase II Toyon will pursue development of a waveform that is standards-based in order to further promote reuse and interoperability.

Less capable and expensive collection system technologies are generally based on stagnation of high velocity ambient airflow on a collecting surface. The momentum of particles and heavy molecules precludes their following gas streamlines during this stagnation. Instead, they concentrate and are trapped on the detector's surface if the surface is \"sticky,\" or concentrated in the surface boundary layer, which can be separated from the mainstream flow and collected. Typically, current separation methodology collects about 50 percent of the particles between 1.0 and 10 microns in diameter from a flow of 500 L/min with a power consumption of up to 500 watts; i.e., about 1 watt of power is required for a small fan to compress 1 liter of air per minute to produce the high velocity airflow necessary for effective trapping of small bio-particles and heavy molecules. However, our electrospray technology consumes negligible power and achieves virtually 100 percent particle collection. In fact, we have demonstrated that the power efficiency of electrospray gettering for a single electrospray emitter to collect 100 percent of the particles, often without a fan, at 10,000 times greater than the power efficiency of state of the art systems.",

All hardware will be demonstrated in simulated Venus surface conditions.  During Phase I, a first-generation prototype BLDC motor and resolver were designed, built and tested in Venus-like conditions (460oC temperature, mostly CO2 gas environment).  The Phase I tests demonstrated the feasibility of the design through verification that the motor and the resolver can operate at 460oC for an extended period of time.  A further developed and optimized version of this motor and resolver could be used to actuate sample acquisition systems, robotic arms, and other devices outside of an environment-controlled landed platform on the surface of Venus. The motor and resolver's capability to survive for hours (and potentially longer) in that environment is a major benefit to future Venus science missions since it would allow time for communication ground loops to optimize sample target selection and allow for multiple samples to be acquired from the surface.  The extreme temperature motor and resolver would therefore revolutionize the exploration of Venus.  In Phase II, an extreme temperature resolver and a suite of different size of extreme environment brushless motor will be developed to TRL 6.

The performance of these thrust chambers is limited by the operating temperature and thermal-chemical response of the available materials.  The Phase I efforts focused on performing design and analysis services to address multiple areas related to the development of lightweight high temperature non-eroding materials for liquid propulsion combustion chambers.  We showed through theoretical thermal-structural calculations that monolithic HfO2 and ZrO2 are the best performing ceramic thermal barriers for Ir/Re combustion chambers within liquid engines.  In the Phase II effort, MR&D proposes to use the lessons learned from the Phase I studies to evaluate material options, optimize the design, demonstrate scale up to and fabrication of a full scale combustion chamber for the NASA 3000-5000 lb LOX/CH4 engine, and ultimately hot-fire the chamber at NASA.  This will be in direct support of NASA MSFC Lunar Lander Ascent Stage engine.  The Phase II tasks include: 1) Detailed thermal-structural design and analyses; 2) Addressing fabrication stresses/strains; 3) Addressing vibration stresses/strains; 4) Performing material characterization; 5) Performing any design revisions based on the material property characterization as it becomes available; 6) Fabrication of a full scale combustion chamber that reflects the best performing materials and geometry resulting from the thermal-structural design studies; 7) Performing pretest predictions and assisting with instrumentation for the hot-fire test; and 8) Performing posttest data correlation and suggesting design improvements.",

Typical software development practices are not acceptable in systems where failure leads to loss of life or other high costs.  \n\nSoftware best practices for high confidence systems are often codified as coding rules. Adhering to these practices can increase software readability and predictability, thereby enhancing quality. However, adherence is limited by the lack of high-quality tools to measure adherence automatically. Checking rule conformance requires a diverse set of software analysis technologies, ranging from syntactic analysis to sophisticated inference of runtime behavior.\n\nBy combining lightweight verification techniques with other scalable analysis techniques that target syntactic and other static properties, we will create a tool that flags violations for almost all the rules typically applied to high-assurance code. \n\nOur Phase I work demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In Phase I, we developed a tool for checking compliance with rules developed for JPL flight software. The tool leveraged GrammaTech's existing technology for static analysis, including facilities for analyzing a program's abstract syntax tree, control-flow graph, and inferred runtime behavior.

The initial application is intended for 2.5 m diameter PMMA Fresnel lenses which NASA anaticipates as part of the EUSO mission cosmic ray telescope.  The new thin film technology combines MIT advances in nano-structured, self-assembled, low index multilayer structures with Agiltron's recently developed mist deposition process, a method for applying large area thin films at low temperature with precise layer thickness control. The proposed UV AR coatings consist of inter-connected oxide nanoparticles in the form of a 3D nanoporous network able to produce stable films with refractive indices as low as 1.1 and high transparency in the visible - UV. In Phase I of this program we successfully demonstrated AR coatings on PMMA substrates with UV reflectance less than 1% at 300-400 nm (compared to 5% for bare PMMA substrates). In Phase II, Agiltron intends to further develop the coatings to a higher technical readiness level (TRL) by improving the robustness and abrasion resistance of the films and engineering the deposition techniques to enable multilayer coatings of tuned refractive index (graded index) for broader band AR performance. By the end of Phase II, nanoporous films deposited by the mist process will possess high transparency, good environmental stability, and excellent abrasion resistance and mechanical integrity. The material can be applied conformally on large area glass and plastic substrates (polycarbonate, PMMA) using low annealing temperatures. Mist deposition is fundamentally inexpensive and may have commercial applications to the plastic optics industry for eyeglasses or cellphone camera lenses.",

        "abstract": "The overall objective of this research program is to improve the affordability, survivability, and service life of next generation aircraft through the use of ADAPT --- an integrated adaptive diagnostic and prognostic toolbox. The specific focus of the research effort is adaptive diagnostic and prognostic algorithms for systems with slowly-varying dynamics.  Model-based machinery diagnostic and prognostic techniques depend upon high-quality mathematical models of the plant.  Modeling uncertainties and errors decrease system sensitivity to faults and decrease the accuracy of failure prognoses.  However, the behavior of many physical systems changes slowly over time as the system ages.  These changes may be perfectly normal and not indicative of impending failures; however, if a static model is used, modeling errors may increase over time, which can adversely affect health monitoring system performance.  Clearly, one method to address this problem is to employ a model that adapts to system changes over time.  The risk in using data-driven models that learn online to support model-based diagnostics is that the models may \"adapt\" to a system failure, thus rendering it undetectable by the diagnostic algorithms.  An inherent trade-off exists between accurately tracking normal variations in system dynamics and potentially obscuring slow-onset failures by adapting to failure precursors that would be evident using static models.   The proposed ADAPT will feature an innovative new parameter estimation algorithm and new adaptive observer / Kalman filter techniques designed specifically for health monitoring.  The research team of Barron Associates, Inc., the University of Virginia, and Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company will demonstrate ADAPT using a high-fidelity electro-hydrostatic actuator simulation.",

Complex aircraft configurations may be easily analyzed with the practically automated surface intersection and Cartesian mesh generation of the Euler solver. The proposed design-oriented approach to transition prediction will permit rapid assessment of aircraft that exploit natural laminar flow to reduce drag. To facilitate design and numerical optimization using the new aerodynamic analysis, a parameterized geometry engine that can quickly model complex aircraft configurations will be interfaced with the Euler/IBL solver. Desktop Aeronautics will also develop a set of optimization tools well-suited to use with the geometry engine and aerodynamic analysis. This set of tools will permit aerodynamic shape optimization and multidisciplinary design at earlier stages in the vehicle development process.",

In dry-sliding experiments, the friction of the diamond-coated composites against lunar dust simulant was low and the wear was so small that it could not be detected. In contrast, all other tested materials experienced rapid abrasive wear. These tests demonstrate that diamond-coated composites are ideal materials for non-lubricated bearings, designed to operate in a lunar dust environment. The primary thrust of Phase II will be a fabrication of sliding, journal and ball bearings and testing them in low temperature vacuum chamber that corresponds to the parameters of the Moon's surface. To implement technology transfer, DMI will partner with established bearing companies. Hence, NASA will have qualified suppliers of different types of precision diamond-coated composite bearings.",

These efforts have resulted in successfully flight qualifying three TMC components, including a piston rod used in the divergent exhaust nozzle actuator for the Pratt & Whitney F119 engine (F-22), and two exhaust nozzle actuator links for the GE F110 engine (F-16). TMC weight savings over the monolithic titanium and steel components being replaced typically varies from 35 to 45% depending upon the application load requirements. The relatively low density of TMC (10% lower than Titanium) combined with its excellent mechanical behavior, results in significantly higher specific static properties than conventional material systems. Additionally, creep resistance of TMC is dramatically enhanced over monolithic titanium due to the presence of the SiC fibers, which do not exhibit discernible creep at the temperature regime of interest. Currently, FMW is working with closely with the aerospace industry to develop TMC structural components for both Military and Commercial airframe applications. FMW proposes to use this same technology to work with the Jet Propulsion Lab to develop a TMC pressure vessel for the Venus Lander mission.",

These digitizers must also interface to typical digital signal processing logic using e.g. LVDS I/O. To meet these needs, Hittite proposes an innovative digitizer combining a high-speed (10 Gs/s), wideband (10 GHz), moderate-resolution (6 bit) ADC with a companion digital demux to reduce the data rate and present LVDS-compatible outputs to e.g. Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGAs.

During Phase II, the ADC and demux chips will be designed, laid out, and fabricated. Prototype digitizer modules will be assembled into a small module, tested, and delivered during a Phase III effort. The initial two-chip digitzer reduces development risk.

Zero or low cryogenic propellant boiloff is required during extended missions and lengthy on-orbit times. Multilayer insulation (MLI) is currently the insulation of choice for cryotank insulation. MLI's high vacuum performance exceeds alternative insulations by a factor of ten.  However, heat flow through MLI is usually the largest heat leak in cryogenic systems, so improvements in thermal performance are desirable. Integrated Multi-Layer Insulation (IMLI) is an innovative new technology using a micro-molded polymer substructure integrated with radiation barriers to provide an ultra-high performance thermal insulation system. \n\nIMLI was proven a viable concept in Phase I work, reaching TRL4 with component validation in the laboratory. Prototypes were built and tested, demonstrating equal to lower thermal conductivity than MLI, and layers attached to each other in a snap-together assembly with controlled layer spacing. The Phase I IMLI prototype had a thermal conductivity of 1.8 W/m2, with the Celcon polymer used for these prototypes still outgassing. The IMLI thermal conductivity was calculated to be 63% that of MLI, which would provide improved long term cryogenic propellant storage. \n\nThis improved insulation can provide lower thermal conductivity, vacuum compatibility, layers inherently attached to each other that support themselves, and efficient assembly. IMLI may also provide inherent structural benefits, including improved strength and integrity over current MLI.\n\nThis proposal is to further develop IMLI toward commercialization.

This long-wavelength region of the EUV includes the important solar emission lines O V near l=63.0 nm and Mg X near l=61.0 nm, formed at intermediate temperatures in the solar atmosphere.   While narrow-band EUV multilayer coatings are by now widely used in NASA missions for high-resolution solar imaging at wavelengths shorter than 35 nm, the observations made at those wavelengths probe coronal and transition region lines formed at either low (e.g., He II at l=30.4 nm) or high (e.g., numerous Fe lines) temperatures.  In contrast, the 60\u009665 nm wavelength region provides a unique spectral window in which to observe intermediate-temperature solar emission lines.  However, efficient narrow-band multilayer coatings operating in this range have been unavailable until now.  The successful development of efficient, stable Gd-based multilayers as we propose, based on preliminary experimental results, especially those obtained during our Phase I effort, will therefore enable the construction of new high-resolution solar telescopes tuned to O V or Mg X that will complement existing multilayer telescopes tuned to shorter EUV wavelengths, thereby providing more complete temperature coverage, and leading to better understanding of the solar atmosphere, its variability, and its crucial role in driving space weather.

        "abstract": "We have investigated the feasibility of employing a hazard detection and mitigation system based upon a polarization discriminating range-gated Lidar system.  This dual use system will be capable of both imaging targets in low visibility scenarios, such as smoke, fog, haze, light rain, and low light levels, and providing an early warning of in-flight hazards, primarily icing conditions in clouds.  The polarization discriminating optical system and accompanying image processing software are capable of differentiating highly depolarizing surfaces from those that contribute little to depolarization.  Examples of this type of differentiation include water and ice phases in clouds and hard-target surfaces surrounded by an aerosol particulate media.  The NIR Lidar system is designed to operate around 1.5 \uf06dm for maximum eye-safety, even when used from the ground.  Major components of the Lidar unit include a laser transmitter, a fast gated detector, and polarization switching components.  The performance of this type of system has been demonstrated in the Phase I project in laboratory experiments using custom built rain and fog generating chambers.  Both image enhancement of a hard target and detection differing depolarization ratios were demonstrated.  Backscattered noise from obscurants is greatly reduced by the fast-gated camera system, and a narrowband optical filter provides additional noise rejection.  The NIR Lidar system can be easily integrated with a database of common object types for identification of hard targets, such as obstacles on a runway.  Illuminated NIR imagery is ideal for providing images of hard targets, as object detail is very near that seen with a visible camera, unlike FLIR (forward-looking infrared) imagery, and the performance is equivalent in day or night conditions.",

These antennas must meet the specific performance requirements for lunar/planetary surface network and the demanding transport and operational space environments. In Phase-1 research, WEO established specific RF performance and physical/environmental requirements for the antenna, and designed, fabricated, and tested a breadboard smart antenna model to see whether it is feasible to meet these requirements. The Phase-1 results demonstrated the feasibility of this technical approach, thus justify Phase-2 research. WEO now proposes a two-year Phase-2 program to develop a brassboard \"Smart Multifunction Antenna for Lunar/Planetary Surface Network.\" In the proposed Phase-2 research, the deliverables include an optimized brassboard model of a smart multifunction antenna. The parts and materials used in the hardware, the fabrication process, as well as other issues regarding this brassboard model will be compatible with and scalable to those of the final deliverable antennas for Phase-3 and deployable models, which must meet NASA's stringent transport and operational requirements, constraints of space mission environment, and the limited weight and size for mounting on astronauts and robots, fixed nodes, and other platforms.",

To date, few measurements have been made of the characteristics of freestream turbulence in transonic wind tunnels, and details of the amplitude and spectra of freestream velocity and pressure fluctuations is lacking.  Consequently, there is an urgent need for in-situ measurements to determine flow quality and the performance of turbulence and noise suppression devices. This information is required if we are to accurately assess and characterize ground test facility performance. To meet these challenges, a unique research program is proposed to clarify and alleviate the aerodynamic problems associated with adverse wind tunnel flow quality.  It combines innovative advances in data base assessment and management, and new approaches to turbulence instrumentation and analysis.  Standardized turbulence measurement techniques and data analysis procedures will be established and used to document the flow quality in our major test facilities.",

Current state-of-art technologies can not provide all features of high energy and efficiency, compactness, narrow linewidth, super frequency and power stability, low noise, and high extinction ratio at the same time. PolarOnyx proposes, for the first time, a high energy (1 mJ) single frequency (< 1 KHz) fiber laser transmitter to meet with the requirement of solicitation. It is a specialty fiber based MOPA operating at 1550 nm. PolarOnyx proposes a revolutionary approach to fundamentally resolve the issues of nonlinear effects by employing our patent pending proprietary technologies in fiber lasers. Our unique spectral shaping techniques enable us to reduce the SBS and ASE noise significantly in the amplifier for commercially available EYDFs and to reuse the residual pump to further increase the efficiency. These will make the fiber laser transmitter system superior in terms of wall plug efficiency (over 30%), energy(1 mJ), noise, size, and cost. In Phase I, we have demonstrated all major functions of the proposed idea and shown a practical energy scaling capability in proof of the concept.

The brown out condition occurs when a helicopter attempts to land in a sandy environment and the downwash from the rotor kicks up the sand, engulfing the aircraft in a cloud of dust. The pilot can not see the ground nor can he maneuver the aircraft for a safe landing. An onboard radar altimeter indicates the aircraft height above the ground. However, a real problem contributing to accidents and aircraft strikes is the uncommanded and unsensed drift of the helicopter either in a front to back or side to side motion. There are no sensors currently onboard to detect this motion. This slow motion can not be detected by the pilot and can result in a collision with an object or depression on the ground This proposal addresses this situation and puts forth a new concept for a small radar system. The proposed system will provide a display sufficient for the pilot to determine and correct for the drift of the platform and will allow for safe landings.",

        "abstract": "All NASA exploration systems operate in the extreme environments of space and require reliable electronics capable of handling a wide temperature range (-180\u00baC to +130\u00baC) and high radiation levels. To design low-temperature radiation-hardened (rad-hard) electronics and predict circuit and system characteristics, such as error rates, modeling tools are required at multiple levels. To determine the electrical responses of transistors and circuits to radiation events, physics-based Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) and mixed-level tools are required. This project will provide models and tools that will improve capabilities for prediction of technology-dependent responses to radiation in wide temperature range, which will lead to better design of rad-hard electronics, better anticipation of design margins, and reduction of testing cost and time. Future NASA missions will use nanometer-scale electronic technologies which call for a shift in how radiation effects in such devices and circuits are viewed. Nano-scale electronic device responses are strongly related to the microstructure of the radiation event. This requires a more detailed physics-based modeling approach, which will provide information for higher-level engineering models used in integrated circuit (IC) and system design. Hence, the proposed innovation: detailed high-energy-physics-based simulations of radiation events (using MRED/Geant4 software from Vanderbilt University) efficiently integrated with advanced device/circuit response computations by CFDRC NanoTCAD three-dimensional (3D) mixed-level simulator. This will also enable a large number of statistically meaningful runs on a massively parallel supercomputing cluster. The extreme low temperature physics models combined with radiation effects will be validated with the help of consultant, Dr. John Cressler (Georgia Tech), in collaboration with the NASA Extreme Environment Electronics program, and serving the NASA RHESE Program (led by NASA-MSFC).",

Solders have found that abraded and scratched surfaces significantly degrade optical clarity and the usefulness of the transparent armors. To repair the damaged armors, a convenient, low cost, simple to use repair system is desired. To address these needs, EIC Laboratories proposes to develop a field curable repair coating containing optically transparent nanoparticle fillers. Research results have predicted and experimentally confirmed that nanoparticles can be functionalized such that when incorporated into a compatible polymeric coating, they will selectively migrate into cracks. Based on these research results, EIC Laboratories has designed an easy to apply coating that will selectively migrate to cracks, adhere to the surface, and restore optical transparency without distortion. A coating formulation composition, which is fundamentally highly economical, was demonstrated Phase I which provides 90-100% recovery of optical clarity in sand-damage hardcoated polycarbonate substrates used in most military goggles. Phase II will entail further optimization of the coating composition and cure properties, scale-up of the synthesis, development of a field-worthy coating application kit, and extensive testing with standard issue goggle lenses.

This creates an opportunity to explore new ways to employ EA assets not only singly but also as networks of weapons. It is more cost effective to analyze and optimize airborne electronic attack methods in simulations than in combat. By marrying a dynamic mission planning and execution tool (i.e., OPUS) with EA models and resource optimization schemes, we will create an EA Planning Tool that can also demonstrate a variety of concepts and assess the effectiveness of different potential EA assets. OR Concepts Applied (ORCA) has put together a team of experts to build tools for modeling and managing EA effects. Not only will tools be available in a stand alone PC-based simulation environment, we will also integrate the technology into the Air Force Research Laboratory\u2019s Virtual Combat Laboratory\u2019s software environment.",

This triazole is very adaptable to a wide range of functionalization to produce plasticizer, oxidizer and binder chemistries with desirable energetic properties.  During the Phase II effort, PSI will implement its strategy for the synthesis of four plasticizers, two oxidizers, and two polymeric binders, all based upon the low cost 1,2,3-triazole chemistry developed on the Phase I effort.  Depending upon the outcome of the synthetic effort, the IM and energetic properties of the materials successfully produced, and their projected cost; select triazole materials will be scaled up for formulation and motor testing.

Benefits of using MCAS over hinged surfaces include, low- weight, volume, and cost, and faster response rate of the control system, which translate into improved range, accuracy, and lethality of the munitions. Continuous in-flight adjustments will help reduce dispersion (thus, friendly force casualties) while significantly increasing endgame maneuverability and lethality.

        "abstract": "During Phase I CFDRC defined the performance and a roadmap for reduced operational costs of existing and new launch platforms using a Bi-propellant Air-Turbo-Rocket (BATR) as first stage propulsion.  Specific applications include the Orbital Sciences Pegasus launch vehicle and an innovative Nano Satellite Launch Platform (NSLP).  Phase I concluded that the BATR\u2019s specific thrust (200 lbf-s/lbm) and specific impulse (700-900 seconds) from sea level, M= 0.5 through 120K, M=4.5 make it an enabling technology as the first stage booster for a NSLP.  This level of specific thrust and Isp minimizes propellant consumption during critical vehicle high drag and gravity well trajectory regimes associated with an NSLP trajectory.  As a result NSLP GLOW is reduced to the level that the identical carry vehicle system launch and recovery infrastructure under consideration for mobile ballistic missile target launch missions can be utilized for low cost NSLP launch operations.  Furthermore, the BATR\u2019s unique flexibility regarding multiple bi-propellant combinations allows this air-breathing 1st stage engine to match up with any possible 2nd stage liquid rocket engine.   During Phase II the first ever static firing demonstration of a high performance BATR engine will be conducted.  By scaling an existing 6-inch solid propellant ATR, a candidate for multiple tactical missile applications, this demonstration is achievable within the funding level of a single Phase II SBIR activity.  The Phase II demonstration will verify BATR performance levels throughout all first stage boost and powered fly-back operations defined during Phase I system study.  CFDRC will coordinate this demonstration activity with ongoing concept studies at Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital Sciences, Teledyne Solutions and others to enable a new small launch vehicle using the first stage ATR propulsion during Phase III.",

At present, these capacitors represent a significant contribution to size and weight on mobile platforms, limiting their deploy-ability and strategic responsiveness.

Significant savings could be achieved with capacitors engineered to carry structural loads so that vehicle structural components could be replaced with load-bearing, capacitive elements.   TPL proposes the Phase II development of a structural, high energy density capacitor for electromagnetic weapons systems by applying a novel composite dielectric technology to an innovative capacitor design.  The successful Phase I effort established the necessary groundwork for the proposed program. Materials and processes were identified and performance validated relative to the Army\u2019s expectations for a structural capacitor. The objective of the Phase II program will be a full-scale demonstration of the structural capacitor technology for EM power applications.

Fine shrinkage cracks do not pose a structural problem in the static sense, their presence can promote deterioration processes that over time can lead to failure.  They allow water to penetrate, which can lead to ASR and DEF, the corrosion of steel reinforcements and fatigue cracks.

Under a Phase I SBIR, we developed and field demonstrated a prototype instrument for micro-crack detection in concrete.

        "abstract": "Propellant aging in solid rocket motors can result in various defects such as micro-cracks, fissuring, and abnormal density variations. These defects can lead to abnormal burn rates and unsafe operations of the motor. Nondestructive inspection of solid rocket motors is critical in monitoring solid rocket motors integrity. High energy gamma-ray CT is a nondestructive inspection method to evaluate structural integrity of a rocket motor. Various artifacts in the reconstructed image due to high-Z beam hardening and scattering can hinder the detection of defects and subtle changes over time due to aging. In Phase I high fidelity Monte Carlo simulation of gamma-ray interaction and transport through solid rocket motors was proposed to characterize such artifacts. New high-Z beam hardening and scatter mitigation algorithms based on the simulation were formulated and applied to projected CT data. In Phase II, this research will be extended to realistic imaging instrumentation and rocket motor models. Required calibration measurements will be performed to specify Monte Carlo inputs. Model-independent and dependent beam hardening and scattering corrections will be derived and verified with real data reconstructions. The fidelity of high resolution artifact corrected image reconstruction will be verified with full Monte Carlo simulation.",

        "abstract": "While the traditional approach to collecting video data for stereoscopic display is to use two cameras, it suffers from several drawbacks including excess cost and size, added complexity, and the necessity of careful calibration.  Within Phase I, we investigated techniques for collecting stereoscopic data from a single camera, which eliminated the problems associated with the dual-camera configuration. In the Phase I effort, we used Equinox's ARC device to perform this real-time stereoscopic display task while at the same time doing so within a small, low-power, low-cost device.  While in Phase I, the device was limited to very simple rectification algorithms to correct for camera rotations, we did investigate more advanced rectification algorithms within a software system running on a PC workstation. In Phase II, we propose to modify the existing ARC device to produce a custom architecture for stereoscopic display and image correction.  By leveraging our in house technology, we can do so rapidly and at low cost.  The custom architecture will allow more advanced rectification algorithms to be deployed, while at the same time keeping the physical and power footprint limited to something not significantly more than a thicker iPod.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  A non-mechanical technique for steering the field of view of lidar sensors is being proposed.   This coarse steering technique allows the field of view of active sensors to be moved in precise discrete steps.  The ability to scan over \u00b120\u00b0 in one dimension has been demonstrated.  For Phase II, this capability will be extended to two dimensions and implemented as a compact package.  The compact, two-dimensional beamsteerer will be integrated with a fine angle steering module that uses two 1x12,288 element optical phased arrays.  Using this approach, the modular steering assemblies can be implemented separately or in combination to provide the coverage and accuracy needed for different applications.  For example, step and stare imaging lidars would perhaps use only the coarse steering module and satellite laser communications would require both coarse and fine capabilities.   The technique proposed for the coarse steering module has the ability to scale to large apertures, handle high energy beams and provide fast response without complicating the system design.  The modular beamsteering architecture makes use of liquid crystal assemblies, which are economical to produce.  BENEFIT:  The ability to non-mechanically point an optical system is important in a variety of applications including free space optical communications, remote sensing and weapon guidance.  Non-mechanical systems have the potential to be more accurate, smaller, lighter and less expensive than systems that use gimbals to position the beam.  Future deployment of optical systems in small airborne or space-based platforms will eventually require these attributes. \"",

In order to realize this goal we have deeply analyzed those big RWDs and found that there are 7 serious problems must be overcome: (1) the measurement assumptions and calculating equations are questionable, (2) it is impossible to measure the deflection at the same point in the two-step and two-point procedure, (3) the two-step procedure will get large error from the truck vibration and pavement unevenness, (4) the two-point measurement cannot get the deflection basin, (5) the error from support beam bending should be simply removed, (6) the error from different sensor heights should be eliminated, (7) the effects of the dust, dirt and moisture to the sensor window should be prevented. The key of our new design to solve these problems is to put a sensor between the front tire and rear tire without deflection and put 3 sensors behind the rear tire with deflection and sample their data simultaneously then make average and subtraction to get the relative deflection basin and eliminate the errors from pavement unevenness, truck vibration, test not at exact point, and so on. In Phase-II, we will build and deliver 3 prototypes: (1) use high accuracy laser rangefinders with inclinometer, speed/distance encoder, GPS and ground marker to get the deflection profile, (2) add the thermal scanner and ground penetration radar to the above for layer analysis, (3) add a portable falling weight deflectometer to the system (1) for test verification at discrete points. Since there is no software can be adopted from existing RWD, two new software packages will be developed: (1) automatic high speed sensor operation and data collection software and ASIC, (2) backcalculation and runway load bearing capacity estimation equations and data analysis software to get a 3-D runway deflection and defects profile with ground marks as a function of space and time.  In addition to the airport application, the portable ADRWD will be used for highways, gas stations and many other places; the technology related with laser rangefinder, IR, Radar, etc. will be used for railway defects inspection and missile defense and their prototypes will be built up in Phase-II as a part of commercial applications.",

During phase I, Makai has developed an analytical model to technically balance and financially evaluate a large-scale OTEC-driven hydrogen (or alternate fuel) plant and industry. This computer tool technically links and balances system components while providing resulting total costs. The model has been used as a means of comparison between the OTEC-hydrogen path and competitive hydrogen paths such as coal, natural gas, and nuclear. It was concluded in phase I that OTEC is both a technically and economically feasible hydrogen production pathway, it has the potential to be cost competitive with other renewable technologies and should be considered a legitimate player in a future hydrogen economy. The principle efforts in phase II will be to expand on the OTEC-hydrogen model developed in Phase I, develop a conceptual design of a large at-sea plant to supply hydrogen (or alternate fuels) for the US Navy or civilian users, and provide strong technical and economic evaluation and justification (if merited) for this energy source in the near future.",

If the brake force is too low, safety is at risk.  If the brake shoe is replaced before the end of it's lifetime to ensure safety, maintenance and thus operating costs are increased.  Currently there is no system in place to monitor brake shoe force during train operation.  Mide has constructed a feasible self-powering brake shoe force measurement system design based on Phase I trade studies, prototypes and testing.  The system includes a piezo electric energy harvester that powers a system consisting of a low power strain measurement  device as well as data storage wireless transmitting capability.  Strain is measured via high temperature strain gage capable of operating in presence of extreme thermal loads.  This system will wake up during a brake event, record data until the brake force has subsided and wirelessly transmit the data to a central location for reduction and analysis.

As part of the process, we will conduct additional vehicle dynamics analysis to ensure that the truck performs well under a wide range of scenarios including worn conditions.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) has been identified by the World Health Organization as a serious global health problem affecting 740 million people in 130 countries. Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of preventable brain damage, with nearly 50 million people suffering some degree of IDD-related brain damage. IDD is preventable and treatable by iodization of table salt. Identification of individuals suffering from IDD and populations at risk requires the development of an instrument capable of measuring iodide in urine and both iodide and iodate in table salt. We propose to develop a small, lightweight, inexpensive instrument, the Rapid Iodine Analyzer (RIA), that will allow measurements of iodine present as either iodide or iodate. The instrument will be based on a novel and proprietary detection method successfully demonstrated in our Phase I grant. It will be highly automated and will require very little sample preparation. The portable instrument is expected to have a limit of detection of lt 1 ppb and to be free of interferences. Thus, the sensitivity will be adequate to diagnose patients as having moderate (20-49 ppb) or severe iodine deficiency (lt 20 ppb), as well as those having normal (100- 199 ppb) or excess iodine (gt300 ppb) in their urine. Because of its low cost (lt 2,000 retail), portability (lt 5 lb), and low power requirements (lt 6 watts), the RIA will be highly useful for assessing iodine deficiency in populations in remote locations around the globe and for testing for the presence of iodine additives in salts dispensed in those regions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A highly sensitive (lt 1 ppb), portable instrument will be developed for the measurement of iodide and iodate in urine and table salt. The Rapid Iodine Analyzer will be an important new tool for use in addressing the problem of iodine deficiency disorders currently affecting 740 million people in 130 countries.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultimate objective of this proposed program is the commercialization of a universal transcutaneous energy transfer (TET) system with a high performance implantable battery. This integrated power system will be adapt\nable to a host of next generation fully implantable mechanical circulatory support (MCS) systems. To date, fully implantable systems (i.e. the combination of an implantable electric MCS system and a TET system allowing electrical power transfer across the \nintact skin) appear to be the most promising approach to eliminating the risk of exit site infection altogether. Most MCS systems in clinical use today require either cannulae (if the blood pump is extracorporeal) or drivelines (if the blood pump is intrac\norporeal) to cross the patient's skin. With such percutaneous designs, infection at the exit site is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality during long term management of patients. Under Phase I of the program, the feasibility of the digital, fault-tol\nerant TET system was demonstrated. Abiomed's analog TET system for the FDA-approved AbioCor Implantable Replacement Heart was redesigned using digital circuits, enhanced for fault-tolerance, and reconfigured for improved spatial coupling. Digital versions \nof both the implanted TET (iTET) and external TET (eTET) electronics were prototyped and tested. A preferred TET configuration was then selected as the basis for the Phase II program. Under the proposed Phase II program, Abiomed's key innovation will be a \nuniversal TET system, integrated with an implantable battery pack having very high capacity (60 Wh) and cycle life (gt1,000 charge/discharge cycles). A digital, fault-tolerant TET architecture and novel solid state lithium battery chemistry will be employe\nd. Sold as an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) product, this flexible power system will bring the survival and quality of life benefits of fully implantable technology to an increased number of patients through a host of MCS systems. Under the continu\ned program, the design and feasibility testing of the universal TET system will be completed. Based on the success of our Phase II program, private funding would enable further development and design qualification activities in anticipation of commercial l\naunch of the universal TET product. Abiomed would partner with at least one other company to integrate the universal TET system into the partner's MCS system; transfer the universal TET system to manufacturing and produce clinical units for the partner; an\nd provide technical support while the partner completes system-level safety and compliance testing, conducts clinical trials, and seeks regulatory approval for its MCS system. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE: Existing schemes for powering implantable mechanical ci\nrculatory support (MCS) systems pose the risk of infection at cable exit sites, particularly during long term use. Transcutaneous energy transmission (TET) systems reduce this risk by delivering electrical power across the intact skin, but this technology \nhas not yet come into widespread use. The universal TET system and high performance implantable battery proposed in this research would offer a general purpose, highly reliable means of powering a host of next generation MCSSs. This original equipment manu\nfacturer (OEM) product would therefore both improve patient quality-of-life and enhance commercialization of MCS technology for long term applications.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): WAYFINDER: A Cognitive Aid for Independent Transportation ABSTRACT Transportation and mobility have long been areas of great dependency for individuals with intellectual disabilities, such as mental retardation. Few individuals with intellectual disabilities obtain drivers licenses. Other typical modes of transit, such as taxi service, are prohibitive due to cost issues. The dominant modes of transportation for this population continue to be 1) specialized transportation services provided by schools or service agencies, and 2) public transit (i.e., bus) systems. Specialized services are usually segregated and often pose restrictions on destinations and require advanced reservations. Public transit systems present an opportunity for more independent and integrated transportation. However, there are many inherent barriers to using transit systems for people with intellectual disabilities. The proposed project is to develop and evaluate WayFinder, a portable system that integrates Palmtop computers, global positioning systems, and instant messaging technology in a simplified multimedia application to provide intelligent audio and visual cues to facilitate independent navigation of public transit systems by individuals with intellectual disabilities. This goal of the proposed Phase I/Phase II project is to develop an independently usable system to enhance access to community based health related resources for individuals with intellectual disabilities. Specific aims in Phase I are to develop requirements for the system, design and build a software prototype, and conduct a pilot study using a complete between- subjects repeated measures design to evaluate the utility of the system for improving independence and self-direction in public transit navigation. In Phase II, the prototype system will be developed into a fully functional software/hardware system that will be used in a field study to determine the impact of longer term use of the WAYFINDER system on transportation supports needs and self-determination. The field study will employ a randomized, placebo control group design. The hypothesis is that the system will significantly increase independence in navigating public transit systems and therefore decrease dependency on family, staff and other caregivers. Implications include increased opportunities for self-direction and independent mobility, improved access to health related services including medical, therapeutic, wellness, recreation, nutrition, work opportunities and other resources for individuals with intellectual disabilities. WayFinder has commercial potential for schools, service agencies and individuals with intellectual disabilities and their families. Enabling individuals to independently use public transit will increase work opportunities and decrease costs associated with transportation assistance. This project will result in WayFinder, a low-cost, powerful system that will enable individuals with cognitive disabilties to be able to use public transit systems in an independent manner. This is relevant to the public health by enabling greater access to medical, therapeutic, wellness, recreation and other community based health interventions for a segment of the American population that is currently dependent upon others to meet these transportation needs.",

It is generally agreed that ablation therapy has be\nen unsuccessful because it is not capable of treating the large, deep arrhythmogenic foci that cause ischemic VT. We have developed a method capable of doing so using saline-enhanced radiofrequency (SERF) ablation. We treat VT by injecting warm saline into\n the tissue simultaneous with RF ablation. The infused saline flows through the extracellular space convecting energy. This increases the effective thermal conductivity of the tissue by a factor of more than 20. We have used our steerable SERF ablation cat\nheter with a retractable electrode to demonstrate in a canine infarct model that SERF ablation creates thermal lesions large enough to treat VT the lesions are reliably transmural, even in the presence of infarct scars, and multiple lesions can be placed t\no provide a line of block. We have also shown that the therapy is safe, that the catheter meets safety and reliability requirements, and that it is biocompatible. We propose to complete the development of our saline-enhanced radiofrequency (SERF) ablation \nsystem for treating ischemic VT. We will complete the design of our system and catheter and validate that they comply with medical safety standards (EN60601-1), biocompatibility (ISO-10993), and validate the sterilization to a sterility assurance level (SA\nL) of 10-6. We will carry out extensive preclinical survival testing in large-animal infarct models at the Mayo Clinic, Loyola University, The University of Pennsylvania, and the Brigham and Women's Hospital. We will then apply for and obtain an Investigat\nional Device Exemption (IDE) to carry out a multi-center clinical trial. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Our development of SERF ablation to treat ventricular tachycardia (VT) is relevant to public health in that we are addressing a growing and expensive problem t\nhe implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) that patients receive to treat these potentially fatal arrhythmias are neither curative nor reliable. The United States spends over  2B annually placing ICDs, and half of the patients develop additional VTs\n that are unresponsive to their ICD. At minimum the shocks these patients receive severely reduce their quality of life. At worst the patient remains susceptible to sudden cardiac death. An effective and inexpensive method of treating these patients VTs is\n urgently needed.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our current capacity to generate chemical and structural biological data far exceeds our capability to meaningfully assimilate it. The data describes molecules and biological macromolecules and associated properties. A \nprinciple common to the structure of all chemical and biological macromolecular entities is the composition of objects related by energetic interaction. A natural representation of all such entities is a graph composed of nodes related by edges. We have de\nveloped powerful, scalable techniques that operate on graph databases for efficient similarity searching (Closure-tree), identification of statistically significant subgraphs (GraphRank), and query specification (GraphQL). These techniques are naturally ap\nplied to chemical and structural biological data, which are naturally represented as graphs. We have demonstrated the validity of the approach in prior work, and the feasibility in our phase 1 research. The overall goal of this project is to deliver powerf\nul innovative problem solving tools to medicinal chemists, structural biologists, and drug discovery researchers synthesizing ever increasing amounts of chemical, biochemical, structural biological, cell biological, and clinical data. Phase 1 of this proje\nct is ongoing and highly successful. We have successfully demonstrated that the Closure- tree and GraphRank algorithms are effective on chemical compound databases of realistic, industrial size. We have developed methods to exploit our knowledge of the nat\nure of chemical databases. Using these methods we have improved similarity query performance time by over an order of magnitude. We have identified several specific aims to purse in Phase 2 of our research. We have rapidly established a professional softwa\nre development and research infrastructure and developed the tools necessary to support progress toward the goal of solving important problems hindering medicinal chemists and structural biologists conducting modern drug discovery research for the developm\nent of new therapeutics. We will pursue four specific aims in our Phase 2 research. (1) We will develop specific additional functionality for Closure-tree and GraphRank, and integrate GraphQL into our chemical and structural bioinformatics tool set. The re\nsults of this aim will be used to (2) develop methods and functionality to represent chemical, structural biology, systems biology, and glycobiology data as graphs. Building on these results, we will (3) apply our tool set to specific relevant research pro\nblems such as HIV-1 Protease inhibition, Avian Flu neuraminidase inhibition, and p53-protein interactions. Finally, we will (4) assemble a state-of-the-art chemical and structural biological informatics tool set with detailed documentation and relevant cas\ne studies. The outcome of this research will be powerful, innovative new tools in the hands of medicinal chemists, structural biologists, and modern drug discovery researchers in academia and the pharmaceutical industry. The tools address significant obsta\ncles in the drug development process and will enable new discoveries and greatly advance the practice of cheminformatic and structural biological data analysis. Through a carefully developed market analysis described in our commercialization plan, we show \na growing market for our tools and competitive advantages. Application of our techniques will have significant impact on the interpretation of structural biological data, on pharmaceutical research and modern drug discovery chemistry, and on human health c\nare through the design of new drugs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Graph-based representation of chemical compounds results in a more accurate realization of the chemical space. The use of recent techniques in graph querying and mining will enable data analysis\n that can scale to millions of compounds.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  New upper-extremity assistive appliances coming into the orthotics and prosthetics (OandP) market are increasingly technologically sophisticated and expensive, which has given rise to a growing population of amputees w\nho cannot obtain them or make use of them for various reasons and thereby enjoy no benefit. Current estimates put the number of upper-extremity amputees worldwide at nearly 25,000,000 persons, with approximately 80% of these living in rural areas and survi\nving through agriculture and animal husbandry. It is advantageous to help these amputees because experience has shown that with functional restoration comes renewed self-sufficiency and independence, and a majority of amputees fit with functional prosthese\ns resume productive occupations, benefiting themselves, their families, and society at large. For this reason, some humanitarian agencies focus on providing assistive appliances, and while lower-extremity prosthetic options exist, they have been hampered i\nn their efforts to assist upper-extremity amputees owing to a lack of affordable hardware. The Fundamental Objective of this three-phase SBIR program is to create a complete upper-extremity prosthesis that can be manufactured and distributed on a large sca\nle to enable and delight disadvantaged amputees for whom few or no other viable rehabilitative options exist. In Phase I of this SBIR project, ADA successfully demonstrated the technical and economic feasibility of a new low-cost upper- extremity prosthesi\ns intentionally designed for distribution in the United States and abroad to overcome treatment disparities affecting under-served populations. As recommended by expert prosthetists active in humanitarian relief efforts, ADA's prosthetic system conveys spe\ncific benefits to amputees: 1) it is comfortable and restores useful grasping function; 2) it alleviates emotional and psychological shock caused by amputation and fosters a positive self-image; and 3) it restores a more normal appearance that bolsters soc\nial acceptance, particularly in cultures having strong stigmas against disfigurement and disability. Phase II incorporates two stages of field validations involving human subjects. These evaluations will be IRB- approved and will enable ADA's well-qualifie\nd research team to fully validate the system's performance, amputees' functional proficiency using it, and its acceptability in a cultural context. A kit comprising the prosthesis and additional materials will be developed to facilitate global distribution\n while helping amputees become proficient and able to use the systems to maximum advantage in their lives. Finally, manufacturing infrastructure will be set up to supply Phase III market demand; distribution channels already exist and have expressed their \neagerness to begin supplying ADA's system to their clients.",

        "abstract": "A pulsed neutron generator is proposed for the detection of special nuclear material. A recently developed microwave-excited plasma neutron generator will be pulsed to produce the activating neutrons whose pulse lengths vary from 100 microseconds to 2 ms with a fall time of less than 1 microseconds. We demonstrated that we can increase the peak yield as a function of either RF or microwave power, and thus maintain a high average yield. We modified two existing Adelphi generators to demonstrate pulse widths from 50 microseconds to 2 ms with repetition rates of 250 Hz to 5 KHz. We observed pulsed operation by observing the plasma photon yield and the fast\nand thermal neutron yields. We found that the generator could maintain its plasma at low pressures even though it was being pulsed. We computer simulated the use of a gate electrode to both truncate the pulse fall time and determine neutron pulse structure. We fabricated this gate electrode and its accompanied electronics and installed them in an Adelphi generator. The electrode was shown to operate with the design voltages. The proposed Phase II generator is designed to be low cost, and mechanically and electronically robust, to ensure its wide distribution and use at ports throughout the world. The proposed\ndevice is expected to be much lighter than the existing Adelphi generators and require less power. It is a high average yield generator that meets with SNM-detection-system integrators' requirements. The project has a high probability of success based on the Phase I research successes and recent development by Adelphi and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.",

The utility of prisms for neutron detection has long been established, but a single neutron prism has never been able to provide sufficient deflection for practical applications.  This project will design and produce compound refractive prisms that more effectively deflect and spatially separate neutrons according to their wavelength.  Unlike a single prism, a compound prism is a row of N prisms that combine to produce an N-fold increase in the refraction of neutrons.  Phase I involved the design and construction of material and magnetic compound prisms, and demonstrated that they can be an optimum tool for neutron detection.  Further, the magnetic prisms tested in Phase I polarized the neutron beams, thus creating an additional tool for analysis.  Phase II will include the construction of material compound prisms from more complex yet higher performance materials such as MgF2 and Teflon.  A number of systems will be designed and constructed based upon the prism technology; these systems include monochromators, spectrometers and stress analysis tools.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The prism-based tools should have application to materials research and development as well as to nondestructive testing.  Specific applications include the measurement of magnetic films for information storage, crystallography and proteomics, stress analysis for metallurgy, and kinematic studies of boundary layers in materials.",

The overall goal of this proposal is to identify and perform in vivo testing of new inhibitors of E\nTX using a novel approach for the inactivation of pore-forming toxins developed at Innovative Biologics, Inc. It is based on the blocking of the target pore with molecules having the same symmetry as the pore itself. Results from our SBIR Phase I project d\nemonstrated that beta-cyclodextrin derivatives designed to block the transmembrane channel formed by epsilon-toxin can inhibit its cytotoxicity at low micromolar concentrations. Based on the successful completion of this feasibility study, we propose to de\nsign, synthesize and screen a library of beta-cyclodextrin derivatives for inhibitors of epsilon-toxin's activity and test selected lead compounds in mice.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The detection and enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) has the potential to become a very powerful tool in cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, current technologies for CTC detection are not yet established\n in routine clinical practice. One reason is that CTCs are present in blood at an extremely low concentration of one in 10 million white blood cells. Existing technologies lack the sensitivity and/or specificity required for reliable detection of these rar\ne CTCs. Another reason is that current technology does not offer information about the molecular status of CTCs. The overall goal of this project is to develop an assay technology named QMAGEX for Quantitative Multiplex Analysis of Gene Expression in Singl\ne Cells and to utilize the technology for sensitive detection, accurate enumeration, and functional analysis of CTCs in body fluids. The long-term goal of this effort is to leverage this assay technology to develop a suite of high value cancer diagnostic p\nroducts. These products would satisfy many significant unmet needs in cancer diagnostics, especially in the area of early detection, therapy guidance and recurrence monitoring. In Phase I, we have developed a prototype QMAGEX assay, demonstrated its capabi\nlity for detecting RNA transcripts in situ in individual cells with single copy sensitivity, and proven its feasibility for cancer cell detection in blood. In Phase II, we aim to move QMAGEX from the current proof-of-concept stage to a robust and high info\nrmation content assay. The specific aims in Phase II include: 1) Develop essential components for high information content 4-plex QMAGEX assay; 2) Develop and validate a flow cytometric 4-plex QMAGEX assay for rare cell detection in blood; and 3) Evaluate \nthe clinical utility of the high information content 4-plex QMAGEX assay for detection of CTCs in metastatic breast cancer patients. Commercial diagnostic products focusing on specific cancers and specific diagnostic applications will be developed in Phase\n III. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It has been known that circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can provide an early indication of tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, detection and molecular analysis of CTC using the QMAGEX assay system will be valuable in early detec\ntion of cancer, in identifying cancer patients for targeted therapies and determining response to treatment, in monitoring cancer progression and recurrence.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Despite the widespread practice of basic and advanced life support, over 1000 patients die each day in the United States from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Even though they receive standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation (sCPR) the average national survival to hospital discharge for these patients is less than 5%. The applicants have developed the inspiratory impedance threshold device (ITD) to increase negative intrathoracic pressure during the decompression phase of sCPR, thereby doubling forward blood flow. The Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrated that intensive care unit admission rate (primary study endpoint) in patients with an initial heart rhythm of pulseless electrical activity increased from 19% to 52% (p=0.02). During Phase 2 investigators also discovered a fundamental new principle of blood flow during CPR: an inverse relationship between intrathoracic pressure and coronary perfusion pressure as well as cerebral perfusion pressure and survival rates. With increased intrathoracic pressure, coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures, as well as survival rates, decreased. The Phase 2 research further lead to the discovery that during sCPR ventilation rates and duration are often excessive and that the chest is often not allowed to fully recoil after each compression.  Each of these common clinical errors was electronically recorded for the first time and then shown to be detrimental, if not deadly, in animal models of cardiac arrest. Based upon these Phase II results the applicants have improved the ITD by adding a ventilation timing light to guide proper ventilation and developed a new and improved hand position for sCPR to help promote full chest wall recoil. Another way to assure that the critically important full chest recoil occurs after each chest compression is by using active compression decompression (ACD) CPR, a technique also developed by the applicants that utilizes a hand held device. Based upon these Phase 2 results, the Phase 2 continuation research will be conducted to obtain sufficient clinical data for regulatory clearance for the ITD as a technology intended to improve 24-hour survival rates after cardiac arrest. A pivotal clinical trial is proposed in the form of a prospective, randomized, two-site clinical trial to: 1) determine the 24-hour survival rate when using the ITD with improved sCPR, and 2) to determine the 24-hour survival rate when using the ITD and assuring full chest wall recoil with ACD CPR. With 400,000 out-of-hospital deaths from cardiac arrest in the United States alone,  widespread application of this technology could result in 50,000 additional survivors per year.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The great need for more efficient and effective oncologic drug development has driven the discovery and integration of biomarkers into all phases of clinical research. Further still, biomarkers are entering the clinical\n arena as early means of determining which patients are likely benefiting from a particular drug. One field of targeted therapy that has relied on biomarkers for many years is cancer immunotherapy which seeks to use  vaccines  molecules to activate and dir\nect immune cells, and their secreted cytokines and antibodies, against tumors. Several cytokines have been found to be informative in understanding the type of immune response (e.g., Th1 or Th2). Molecular analyses have suggested that a combination of thes\ne immune markers could predict which patients will have clinical benefit.         Equipment currently used for measuring a panel of cytokines is: 1) very expensive 2) highly labor-intensive and 3) limited in sensitivity. There is a need for a technology th\nat completely automates the measurement of user-configured panels of cytokines at increased sensitivity and more importantly that an individual investigator can afford. Such technology will accelerate the discovery process in oncological research initially\n and enable other areas of research as well.         In phase I, we have successfully demonstrated a rapid and parallel immunoassay lab-on-a-chip based on manipulation of discrete sub-microliter droplets. Heterogeneous  sandwich  assays were performed on I\nL-6 within 10 minutes, which includes completely automated washing steps on a programmable chip. During phase I, we resolved a number of research issues to demonstrate the feasibility of performing immunoassays on a digital microfluidic chip while in Phase\n II we will build on those results to: scale up the number of user-configured immunoassays performed on a chip to 384 by developing a chip that can perform 48 simultaneous cytokine immunoassays on each of 8 PBMC samples stimulated by 8 peptides; demonstrat\ne reproducibility, linearity, range, LOD, recovery, inter/intra-assay variability on a statistically significant number of samples, perform method comparison, and develop cell handling capability on-chip for fully integrated operations.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is challenging for visually-impaired people to find their way in unfamiliar, complex indoor spaces such as schools or office buildings. GPS technology has already been exploited for speech-based navigation for visual\nly-impaired wayfinding in outdoor environments, but there is no equivalent technology for indoor wayfinding. Sighted pedestrians may sometimes find indoor wayfinding challenging, but they can usually find their way with the help of signage. The inability t\no easily access signage continues to be a major impediment to indoor wayfinding for people with visual disabilities. A team at the University of Minnesota Laboratory for Low-Vision Research, first demonstrated the feasibility of a  Digital Sign System  (DS\nS) to support indoor navigation for visually impaired people. In Phase I, this team worked in partnership with AME Corp. to develop evaluation prototype of the DSS system, and demonstrated its use for non-visual indoor navigation with human performance tes\nts. The DSS system consists of a hand-held device that emits an infrared beam. The user pans the beam until a reflection from a retroreflective bar-coded sign is returned. Computer software  reads  the sign's image and feeds its identification code to a bu\nilding database. Information, including the content of the sign and its position, is then retrieved from the database and provided to the user via synthetic speech. Feasibility prototypes of all system components have been developed and validated. The goal\n of this phase II project is to develop a production prototype for human testing. The engineering work will include designing an improved optical assembly and developing digital tag localization software that runs on a digital signal process in real time i\nn the prototype. This production prototype will be used to evaluate the efficacy of indoor wayfinding by visually impaired pedestrians via DSS and a spatial database with speech-based user interface called the Building Navigator. These production prototype\ns will be commercially viable. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Independent mobility is an important prerequisite for full participation in modern society. Reduced mobility and associated social isolation are among the most debilitating consequences of vision loss\n.

If consi\ndered as a separate condition outside of CVD, stroke is the 3rd leading cause of death behind heart disease and cancer. Total Homocysteine (tHCY) is a confirmed independent risk factor for CVD. Additionally, it is a sensitive marker for folate and colalami\nn (vitamin B12) deficiency, with implications to birth defects, pregnancy complications, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive impairment in the elderly. Several million tHCY tests are performed annually in the U.S. related to these conditions. tHCY has gar\nnered significant attention as a modifiable risk factor for CVD because levels can be reduced simply through dietary supplementation of Folic Acid and Vitamin B12. While tHCY's value in this manner still remains unconfirmed, strong evidence is mounting in \nits association specifically with stroke. At the same time, tHCY is finding a growing market as a vitamin deficiency monitoring tool for patients taking drugs known to degrade folate metabolism. An additional marker, Reduced Homocysteine (reHCY), has also \nbeen proposed as an alternative to tHCY. Currently, tHCY and reHCY analysis requires expensive instrumentation, time consuming procedures, and can only be performed in a clinical laboratory. Advanced Microlabs, LLC is developing microfluidic technology for\n rapid detection of disease biomarkers that will be inexpensive ( 500 instrument,  3/assay), require very small samples (i.e., finger prick instead of a blood draw), provide results within minutes, and require no sample pretreatment such as centrifugation \nas is now currently the case. In the current project, we will build on our successful Phase I results and create a versatile point-of-care device for the detection of tHCY and reHCY. Additionally because our device is a multi-analyte platform, other releva\nnt markers could be added to our menu in Phase III.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The U.S. POC market became a  10 billion industry in 2005 and is currently growing at a faster rate than central laboratory testing. This is because devices like ours offer\n cheaper testing, closer to the patient, reduction in healthcare costs, and enhancements the physician-patient dialog and thus improving care.",

Importantly, the system is open-ended to the addition of new prognostic markers and drug targets into the assay panel. There are several anticip\nated advantages of the layered membrane platform over current histopathology tools such as immunohistochemistry (IHC).

Human acceptance of autonomy hinges on trusting system-level behavior. The goal is to develop technology to verify system properties for high-level autonomous control of complex systems operating in rich and unpredictable environments. The System-Level Autonomy Trust Enabler (SLATE) applies constraint-based models and reasoning to support incremental modifications necessary for system-level V&V of fixed and reconfigurable systems, given component-level guarantees. The significance of this innovation is to enable trusted high-level autonomous control systems across a wide range of critical applications, including manned and unmanned spacecraft, rovers, and habitats. If successful, this will simplify the process of control system design, maintenance, and reconfiguration in response to changes in the environment, the system being controlled, or the mission profile.  Phase I addressed SLATE feasibility for requirements representation and reasoning.  A TRL-4 proof-of-concept prototype on a multi-level robotic control system, implementing a surface robotics exploration mission, demonstrated that SLATE is feasible in practice.

        "abstract": "Methane (CH4) is the second most important atmospheric greenhouse gas after CO2, yet its global sources and sinks are still inadequately characterized.   Monitoring the isotopic composition of atmospheric methane is one of the most promising approaches to closing the methane budget.  Recent claims that plants may account for a substantial fraction of atmospheric methane have lead to an increased emphasis on studies of ecosystem CH4 fluxes, with particular interest in using isotopic composition to identify specific production pathways.  Currently, field deployable instruments for direct measurements of methane isotopes having sufficient precision do not exist. Recent advances in quantum cascade laser technology have made available continuous wave operation near room temperature without cryogenic cooling.  With such devices, it is now feasible to develop a compact portable instrument with sufficient sensitivity for direct measurements.  The Phase I project modified an existing optical system and demonstrated the ability to directly detect the ratio of methane isotopes with a precision of 0.2 parts per thousand (0.2 \u00bf) in an averaging time of 100 seconds in ambient air without pre-concentration, exceeding the Phase I goals.  Extended measurements of the isotopic ratio of ambient methane outside the research facility and measurements of the isotopic content of human breath and natural gas were performed.  Preliminary designs for the aircraft-borne instrument were developed, and measurement opportunities for Phase II instrument deployment were identified. The Phase II project will complete the design and construction of a prototype instrument, which will be compact, rugged and field-deployable.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This instrument will provide scientifically meaningful isotopic ratio measurements in real time, without pre-concentration and without cryogenic cooling of either laser or detector.

Bone grafting is routinely necessary prior to the placement of Dental implants due to bone loss caused by periodontitis. Autograft bone is considered the gold standard because of its osteogenic cells, osteoinductive factor\ns, and osteoconductive properties. Nevertheless, because of procurement morbidity and constraints on the quantity of autograft, surgeons also use allografts, xenografts, and synthetic materials. Many synthetic alternatives have been developed, but they are\n generally not as effective as natural materials due to the absence of osteoinductive and osteogenic properties. If synthetics were made more osteoinductive, they could provide an unlimited source of graft material that would eliminate many of the drawback\ns of autograft, allograft, and xenograft. The goal of our Phase I application was to develop bi-functional peptide coatings that promote the attachment and retention of osteogenic growth factors and cells to tricalcium phosphate bone grafts. First, we iden\ntified tricalcium phosphate (TCP)-binding peptides using phage display techniques. Next, we synthesized combinations of the Affinergy novel Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2 (BMP-2), Platelet Derived Growth Factor-BB (PDGF-BB) and cell-binding sequences coupled\n to the newly identified TCP-binding peptides. These candidate bifunctional linker peptides were tested for their ability to bind BMP-2, PDGF-BB, and osteoblasts on TCP matrix, while retaining BMP-2 and PDGF-BB bioactivity and the osteoblastic phenotype. H\nere, we propose the extension of these studies by first optimizing our linker peptide sequences to generate the highest possible affinity binding peptides for TCP, BMP, PDGF and osteoblasts. We will also examine the commercializability of the peptide coati\nng through an exhaustive battery of biocompatibility, sterilization and storage tests. A rabbit ulnar defect model will then be conducted to optimize dosage conditions and test the efficacy of new peptides. These data will provide key evidence for the in v\nivo efficacy and general commercializability of this bone graft coating system. Additional Phase III studies funded by Affinergy and/or new potential partnerships would likely involve a large animal model, and/or the identification and optimization of new \npeptide sequences in preparation for IDE submission. Public Health Significance: Bone grafting is routinely necessary prior to the placement of Dental implants. Natural materials like autograft (bone harvested from the patient) and allograft (cadaveric bon\ne) have traditionally been used in these grafting procedures. Each strategy has unique limitations including complications associated with autograft harvest; and with allograft concerns regarding immunogenicity, risk of disease transmission, limited availa\nbility, and high procurement costs. Many synthetic alternatives have been developed, but they are generally not as effective as the natural materials. In this project, we are attempting to improve synthetic bone substitutes with the Affinergy linker peptid\nes. We expect that peptide coatings will improve the ability of synthetic materials to stimulate bone healing by encouraging the attachment of bone promoting growth factors and cells on the surface of these synthetic alternatives.",

Once biofilm is established on a medical implant, it is essentially impossible to era\ndicate by any means except explantation. New technologies that decrease microbial colonization and infection rates associated with metal implants would clearly improve care and reduce medical costs. In Phase I we proposed the development of a generalizable\n peptide coating, allowing a clinician to load an antibiotic onto an implant at point of care. Using phage display technology, Affinergy has identified a series of peptides that bind with high affinity to metals, including titanium and stainless steel, as \nwell as peptides which bind the antibiotic vancomycin with high affinity. These peptides were synthesized as a single bifunctional peptide to serve as an  interfacial biomaterial  or IFBM designed to attach a coating of vancomycin on the surface of metal i\nmplants. The IFBM developed in Phase I retains the high affinity of its component peptides for metals and vancomycin, delivering an effective antimicrobial dosage to metal surfaces. We also demonstrated that this peptide coating for metal surfaces is stabl\ne in biological fluids, resists biomechanical and shear stress and does not alter cellular behavior on metal implants. With the successful completion of our Phase I aims, we are now eager to further optimize our vancomycin-binding sequences, as well as tes\nt new vancomycin:metal bifunctional peptides assembled using different ligation chemistries, peptide orientations and asymmetric ratios of peptide components.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growth factors are potent signaling molecules, initiating essential cellular programs for differentiation, proliferation and survival. Only recently have large molecules like growth factors, been employed to enhance the\n efficacy and specificity of medical implant therapies. In particular, procedures that require native tissues to interact with an implanted material stand to benefit from inclusion of growth factors. A successful merger at the interface between technology \nand biology is generally predictive of subsequent therapeutic outcome. Affinergy Inc., has developed bifunctional peptide linkers, called interfacial biomaterials (IFBMs) that help promote biology at the critical interface between a synthetic and a biologi\nc. Attaching one peptide designed to bind a growth factor, to another peptide designed to bind a medical device, offers a simple and target-specific therapeutic strategy. In addition, our modular approach allows interchangeability of peptide  halves , to p\nroduce a combinatorial array of potential bifunctional IFBMs. Currently we chemically synthesize our peptides as one continuous sequence. This approach presents significant challenges, as coupling efficiency of solid-phase peptide synthesis decreases drama\ntically as chain length approaches 30 residues. We proposed a Phase I study, exploring the use of [3 + 2] cycloaddition or  click chemistry  to prepare IFBMs. This method takes advantage of our modular approach and allows for higher total yields through th\ne coupling of shorter peptides (lt25 mers). Additionally, selective coupling in the presence of unprotected amino acid side chains enables high-throughput screening capabilities of completed IFBM libraries. We have generated two IFBMs which bind a resorbab\nle collagen sponge and a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP); one using click chemistry and one using traditional solid-phase synthesis. In our Phase I studies, we found nearly identical biostability and in vitro activity of IFBMs made with both synthesis tec\nhniques. Successful completion of these aims has encouraged us to expand our IFBM technology to other growth factors and bone graft materials. Our goal in Phase II is to optimize click chemistry for IFBM manufacturing, examine the biocompatibility, storage\n, and sterilization of prototype IFBMs, and test their efficacy in vivo. Affinergy's IFBM technology is designed to improve growth factor therapy in three potential ways: 1) promoting the sustained release of BMP from existing carriers; 2) reducing the sup\nraphysiological amounts of recombinant growth factor required to provide the desired therapeutic effect and 2) capturing and concentrating endogenous molecules from the extracellular milieu, potential decreasing or eliminating the requirement for recombina\nnt protein.Project Narrative         Bone grafts currently take one of three forms, which include autograft (typically harvested from the patient's iliac crest) allograft (cadaveric bone) and synthetics (helistat sponge, hydroxyapatite or tricalcium phosph\nate). Autografts harbor all the endogenous biological capacity for bone regeneration, but represent a painful additional surgical step. Allograft and synthetics require no such secondary procedure, but have limited or no osteoinductive capabilities. Our go\nal is to therefore merge the benefits of both grafts, by adding a growth factor binding peptide coating to collagen-based bone grafts. We envision this technology as a means of reducing the dosage of expensive growth factors, while removing the pain and po\ntential complications associated with bone harvesting. This technology is likely most applicable to intervertebral and posterior lateral spinal fusion, procedures growing in frequency and known to benefit from osteoinductive growth factors. With over 45,00\n0 spinal fusion surgeries performed each year, the demand for improved technique, care and cost is unlikely to be soon assuaged.",

This research program concerns a photochemical system designed to destroy highly toxic compounds called dioxin-furans, which are unintended byproducts of some industrial processes. During an extended test program at an industrial facility, the researchers will evaluate: (1) long-term ultraviolet lamp energy efficiency in hot, dust-laden gas streams, (2) dioxin-furan destruction efficiencies during routine variations in source conditions, (3) reaction product characteristics, and (4) reductions in pollutants in addition to the targeted dioxin-furans.  The broader impacts of this research will include an improved understanding of the chemical reactions of dioxin-furan compounds at the gas temperatures and pollutant concentrations typical of industrial gas streams. The results will help assess the applicability of photochemical systems to provide high efficiency air pollution control while reducing emissions of greenhouse gases produced by existing control techniques. Photochemical systems that destroy toxic air pollutants\nwill provide an attractive alternative to systems that retain the toxic compounds on adsorbents disposed in landfills. The development of ultraviolet light technology will result in reduced air emissions of persistent toxic pollutants that bio-accumulates in the food chain and cause adverse human health effects.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aktiv-Dry LLC, in collaboration with Nabi Biopharmaceuticals, proposes to develop and evaluate in animal models the needle-free respiratory delivery of fine dry powder nicotine vaccine. While syringe and needle have bee\nn a common vaccine administration mechanism, international authorities recognize a growing requirement for alternative formulations and delivery systems, especially because of inadvertent disease from needle contamination, accidental needle-sticks, thermal\n instability of current formulations, and compliance with vaccination regimens. Nicotine is primarily responsible for the psychoactive and addictive effects of smoking. Immunotherapy has already been shown to be useful in prevention and/or treatment of add\niction to nicotine and other drugs of abuse. Nicotine-specific antibodies can bind and sequester nicotine in the serum, thus preventing nicotine from reaching the brain as antibodies are too large to cross the blood-brain barrier. A number of studies have \nshown that, in animals, NicVAX(tm), a nicotine-carrier protein conjugate vaccine, reduces the distribution of nicotine to the brain, attenuates the locomotor and stimulus properties of nicotine and prevents nicotine from relieving nicotine abstinence syndr\nome. In humans, such a vaccine may be an effective aid in smoking cessation and reduce the rate/extend the time to relapse. Nabi has already demonstrated the safety and immunogenicity of NicVAX(tm) in humans and established its potential as a useful therap\neutic and preventative agent to assist in smoking cessation/abstinence and prophylaxis. Aktiv-Dry has developed a technology to manufacture pharmaceutically active microparticles suitable in size and stability for delivery by inhalation. Delivery of NicVAX\n(tm) by a needle-free approach to the respiratory tract using the Aktiv-Dry technology may facilitate patient compliance, address potential issues with distribution and use on a world-wide basis, and possibly enhance the efficacy of a nicotine vaccine.",

Alderon Biosciences, Inc. proposes to fill this need by developing an open biosensor \nplatform technology for quantitative studies of cancer gene expression, with the goal of replacing slower and more costly methods. The working hypothesis of this SBIR proposal on  Innovative Tools for the Molecular Diagnosis of Cancer'' is that the disposa\nble sensor arrays and electrochemical readers of Alderon's innovative enzyme-enhanced electrochemical system (eSystem) for cancer gene expression analysis will greatly facilitate studies of cancer biomarkers. Feasibility of using Alderon's biosensor platfo\nrm technology for quantitative cancer gene expression analysis has been demonstrated in Phase I work and differential gene expression was quantified in induced and non-induced cancer cells. The major milestone achieved in Phase I work was demonstration of \ntarget detection sensitivity sufficient for enzyme-enhanced probe-based detection of even rarely expressed messages in small tissue samples without need for target amplification (quantification of mRNA targets down to 1-3 copies per cell in samples as smal\nl as 104 cells). In Phase II, new eSystem readers and ePlates with small sensor-area electrodes that require very small volumes of samples and reagents will be further developed and validated. Phase II Project Aims are: 1) make and test new eSystem compone\nnts (improved assays, small-sensor ePlates and ePlate readers) for simultaneous quantification of levels of expression of multiple cancer gene targets without use of target amplification steps; 2) produce manufacturing prototypes of new eSystem readers and\n 96-sensor microplates; and 3) refine performance until equivalent or better (speed, sample size, cost, reliability) assays of gene expression are obtained with the eSystem compared to quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays. Highly sensitive gene expression \nmeasurements without the complexity or cost of existing methods have been proven possible with new small sensor-area microplates that require very small volumes of samples and reagents. This advanced electrochemical technology will be further developed for\n cancer research and diagnostics, and then extended to other human health products. When disease-related gene expression products reach clinical use in an estimated 5-7 years, markets will likely grow to exceed a billion dollars/yr for each major disease. \nWe intend to reach a strategic share of the market in research and testing with the aid of proven technology and strategic partnerships.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation Monitoring Devices ( RMD') is developing a digital radiographic imaging technology that is based upon a semiconductor x-ray receptor. The more specific, targeted application is mammographic imaging (including \nbreast tomosynthesis) for which the benefits of this technology will later be described. At the core of this research, RMD is developing the process for creating  direct imaging' x-ray detectors fabricated from polycrystalline layers of the semiconductor m\nercuric iodide (HgI2). A significant part of this work will involve tailoring the electrical, chemical and physical properties of these layers for the intended purpose. To utilize HgI2 as an x-ray receptor, it must be coupled with an amorphous silicon (a-S\ni) thin film transistor (TFT) array. The TFT array provides pixelation, charge storage and frame readout necessary to form a complete imager. In order to enable digital mammography to achieve its full potential and thereby, have a major clinical impact, x-\nray detection technology needs to be advanced. RMD is investigating a  direct' detection method using mercuric iodide (HgI2) as the x-ray detector. The HgI2 film acts as the sensor, detecting the incoming x-rays with high quantum efficiency due to its high\n x-ray stopping power. The detected x-ray image is converted directly into an electronic charge image due to the formation of electron-hole pairs in HgI2. Due to efficient collection of these charges with minimal lateral spreading, this approach does not s\nuffer from the light spreading effects observed in phosphors and thereby, provides high detection efficiency as well as high spatial resolution. HgI2 has nearly ideal characteristics for mammography such as high stopping efficiency, large gain, good charge\n transport, and good stability. Finally, the method by which RMD is proposing to deposit the HgI2 films is highly cost effective and can be used to readily cover large areas, making it very complimentary to the large sized a-Si:H TFT arrays that are increa\nsingly becoming available. RMD plans to deposit and test the key HgI2 layers on two types of substrates: 1) simple conductive plates for testing electrical bulk properties, and 2) a range of a-Si TFT arrays that will provide the key imaging data. RMD will \nperform all the fabrication tasks associated with the layers and conduct most evaluations on the simpler devices. To aid with the a-Si TFT tasks, RMD has joined with two collaborators   Varian Medical Systems and the University of Michigan to provide mater\nials and expertise with testing. Dr. Mitchell Goodsitt of the University of Michigan has joined our team to provide guidance on the specific imaging requirements for high resolution mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). Dr. Daniel Kopans and \nRichard Moore of MGH have also joined our team as clinical consultants. Dr. Kopans and Richard Moore are specialists in mammography and DBT and will provide guidance and input on clinical goals and evaluate our imagers under conditions applicable to digita\nl mammography and DBT. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RMD is proposing to develop a new type of mammography x-ray detector that holds the promise of very high spatial resolution and superior images at low exposure levels. The proposed fabrication technique is bo\nth cost effective and readily scaleable, both helping to remove manufacturing barriers that can impede adoption of technology.",

The barriers to using existing modalities in studies of laboratory animals have traditionally been poor spatial resolu\u00adtion, low sensitivity, and high cost.  Although detector technologies have improved significantly in recent years, the current state-of-the-art scintillator technology remains the primary performance-limiting factor. To address these issues, this project will design and develop a novel scintillator coupled to a very high spatial resolution photodetector.  Phase I research demonstrated the feasibility of developing a novel scintillator array capable of providing parallax-free, high resolution imaging of high-energy radioisotopes. The Phase II research is a logical extension of the Phase I work, with the focus on improving the throughput of the materials processing technique, fabricating a larger-area focused scintillator array, fabricating a prototype detector, and thoroughly evaluating these devices at our collaborators\u00bf facilities. Substantial efforts toward commercialization of this technology will also be made.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Molecular imaging techniques are well suited for imaging radiolabeled antibodies and other sub\u00adstances used to localize and characterize tumors in small animals, and for developing new radiolabeled agents for diagnosing and treating diseases in humans.  This detector will significantly improve the resolution and sensitivity with which measurements can be made, allowing the development of superior drugs and technologies to diagnose and stage certain cancers, diseases of the heart and disorders of the circulatory system, and treatments to curtail the progression and even to cure these conditions.

Illicit nuclear materials represent a threat for the safety of the American citizens and the detection and interdiction of a nuclear weapon is a national problem that has not been yet solved.

Using neutron signatures represents a promising solution, however, such a detection technique requires capabilities of detecting neutrons, both thermal and energetic neutrons, while rejecting effectively background gamma rays.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Among the various functional imaging techniques, SPECT maintains an important role in the study of disease models in small animals as well as in patient care. Many SPECT-labeled imaging probes that have highly specific\n distributions with very little background are being used to measure a wide range of biological parameters of importance in small animals including substrate metabolism, blood flow, hypoxia, protein synthesis and receptor characteristics. The utility of th\nis important modality has been significantly enhanced in recent years by the development of methods to image transgene expression in vivo. Furthermore, SPECT is capable of dual-isotope imaging for correlating two biological processes with a single imaging \nstudy. Recent demand for small animal SPECT has also been driven by the pharmaceutical industry where in vivo quantification of biological processes to measure an agent's mechanism of action and its concentration at the site of action is necessary. Each of\n these applications requires excellent spatial resolution, not only because of the small scale of the details to be imaged but also for the demanding detection and estimation tasks. Unfortunately, existing SPECT instrumentation does not provide the require\nd performance, so the development of a high-resolution detector is essential for the improvement of future SPECT systems. To address these issues, we propose to develop a novel detector based on a unique design of a scintillator coupled to a very high spat\nial resolution readout. Specifically, the scintillator design and fabrication will minimize the loss of resolution arising from parallax errors due to depth-of-interaction effects within the scintillator, while maintaining very high efficiency for the dete\nction of incident radiation. This combination of scintillator and readout, when coupled to a custom designed collimator, will form a SPECT detector module that can achieve extremely fine spatial resolution and high sensitivity in a cost-effective manner. T\nhe effort subsequent to the successful development of the detector module will focus on the development of a complete small-animal SPECT system as a prototype product.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of the proposal is in the area of breast cancer imaging and tumor characterization using oxygen sensitive phosphorescent labels and hybrid imaging modality. We propose to use simultaneous diffuse optical tomog\nraphy (DOT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to obtain high spatial-resolution and quantitative functional images of breast tumors. Imaging in pre-clinical models with injected contrast agents and imaging the oxygen concentration within tissue are impo\nrtant for a number of clinical and scientific reasons. Low oxygen content in tumors is a marker of radiation-resistant tumor regions, and is also correlated with a poor treatment outcome. For basic research applications, it is also very important to unders\ntand how hypoxia develops in tumors and how it is correlated with exogenous and endogenous markers of low oxygen. During Phase I, in conjunction with standard diffuse optical tomography (DOT), we obtained high contrast images of hypoxic regions in breast t\nissue simulating phantoms using long-lived oxygen sensitive contrast agents and a simple lifetime imaging system with cooled avalanche photodiodes. In Phase II, a prototype of the CW and time domain lifetime imaging module will be developed which will have\n parallel acquisition across a cooled 16-element avalanche photodiode (APD) array for high resolution and high throughput imaging. The low-cost, compact lifetime imager module will be designed to be compatible with high magnetic and RF fields associated wi\nth MR units in hybrid imaging systems. Using this APD module in a dual-modality imaging setup at our collaborator's facility at Dartmouth College, NH (Prof. Brian Pogue, Thayer School of Engineering), phantom and animal model imaging will be performed to o\nbtain functional optical images with high resolution and high contrast. The optical image reconstruction will be aided by the spatial and anatomical information obtained from simultaneously obtained high-resolution MR images in order to improve the accurac\ny of these images. The compact APD based detector prototype will have a small footprint and will be mounted inside the magnet of the MRI unit, dramatically decreasing the complexity of the current PMT based detection systems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hybri\nd imaging with simultaneous diffuse luminescence imaging and magnetic resonance imaging can be used to obtain high resolution functional maps of tumors based on their oxygen concentration. Hypoxic breast cancer detection is the primary target application, \nwith the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment prognosis using exogenous contrast agents. Other applications could include brain imaging to monitor cerebral function or cerebral hemorrhage, and monitoring tissue and muscle oxygenation, histot\noxicity, etc.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Venous catheters play critical roles in the administration of chemotherapy, antibiotics, blood, blood products and total parenteral nutrition essential for the successful treatment of many chronic afflictions. Recent ad\nvances in catheter technology have enabled the explosive growth in oncology (vascular access ports), nephrology (hemodialysis catheters) and inpatient interventions (peripherally inserted catheters). Unfortunately, the catheter surface interaction with the\n blood stream has a very high potential of initiating surface thrombi that lead to serious and often life-threatening complications. To counter this risk, patients are given systemic anticoagulation drugs, which, while reducing the probability of surface c\nlotting, introduce a second set of serious medical complications that significantly increase patient morbidity and mortality. Current treatments to prevent catheter-related thrombosis rely primarily on IV/oral anticoagulation. However, the tradeoff between\n long-term IV/oral anticoagulation and internal bleeding severely limits the performance of these powerful devices. Many approaches have been studied to reduce the formation of surface clots associated with the use of venous catheters, but none have met wi\nth more than minimal success. However, we have recently discovered an approach to modifying one of the most commonly used catheter biomaterials in such a manner as to drastically reduce the formation of surface clots during the long periods that such cathe\nters must remain within the body. This modification appears to have not only the potential to be medically effective, but also to allow the fabrication of improved venous catheters with minimal or no increase in cost. In Phase I of this project, we shall c\nompound the new plastic and conduct in-vitro tests to demonstrate that the compound (a) can be readily made, (b) that its mechanical properties are similar to those biomaterials now most commonly used for making catheters, and (c) that it has dramatically \nreduced tendencies to instigate the formation of surface clots in appropriate baths of platelet rich media. In Phase II, the formulation of the optimal composition of the biomaterial will be completed and actual venous catheters will be made and used for e\nxtensive in-vitro tests as well as for testing in animals. By the completion of the project, the groundwork should have been set for final engineering and rapid commercialization of anti-thrombotic venous catheters which should lead directly to substantial\nly improved patient outcome.",

This project will design, build, and implement a high performance, position sensitive detector that can be integrated with microfluidic chips for detection and imaging of charged particles, emitted by the radiolabeled probes present in the fluids circulating in these chips. High sensitivity detection of these charged particles is desired with high spatial resolution, along with low minimum detectable activity. The Phase I project designed and built novel position sensitive detectors for charged particle imaging that can function under conditions appropriate for in-vitro studies.  The detectors were integrated with prototype microfluidic chips and their performance was evaluated. The Phase II project will optimize the proposed technology and implement it for studying biological processes at the molecular and cellular levels. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Over and above the use in nuclear medicine, the proposed detection technology will be useful in nuclear and particle physics, space research, homeland security, environmental monitoring and synchrotron studies.",

According to the American Cancer Society approximat\nely 60,000 people in the US will be diagnosed with melanoma this year, and 8,000 will die from this disease. For Pb-212 melanoma therapy to proceed to clinical trials, it requires an imaging surrogate for treatment planning and disease staging. The Federal\n Food and Drug Administration recommended Pb-203 be developed as the imaging companion, the subject of this application. To prepare for clinical trials, animal studies will demonstrate that Pb-203 imaging isotope is a viable substitute for the therapeutic \nPb-212 label. Animal studies will be performed to determine the agent's affinity for tumor cells, biodistribution will be assessed. Additionally to satisfy FDA requirements for clinical trials and approved drug product, a Pb-203 production method will be d\neveloped so that the isotope can be produced to support Pb-212 based therapies. After successful completion of this Phase II SBIR, AlphaMed will have completed the preclinical animal work needed to support an IND application for using Pb-203 labeled [DOTA]\n-ReCCMSH as the imaging partner for its Pb-212 based melanoma therapy. To support other Pb-212 based therapies, AlphaMed will have its Pb-203 production method listed as a Drug Master File, available to be referenced in IND applications. Targeted radiother\napy has shown to be very effective in preclinical tests in treating metastatic melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer that takes 8,000 lives a year in the US. To proceed to clinical trials, an imaging isotope of the same element as the therapeutic will be \nused for treatment planning. Successful completion of this grant application will demonstrate the proposed imaging isotope is suitable and an acceptable isotope production process is established.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant advances have been made toward the development of a new generation of molecularly targeted cancer drugs, many of which are only now emerging from the pipeline. This project aims to develop a new, highly sens\nitive technology for detecting drug-resistance mutations in proteins which preexist prior to treatment or are acquired due to the selective pressure exerted by treatment with molecularly targeted anti-cancer drugs (ACD). This problem is exemplified by drug\n resistance developed in patients treated for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with the small molecule drug Imatinib (Gleevec/Glivec/STI571). It is well documented that this resistance arises from mutations in BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, the target for Imatinib\n. Drug resistance also occurs in both Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) acute lymphatic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) patients who are treated with Imatinib. Several problems must be overcome in order to effectively det\nect and characterize drug resistance mutations against anti-cancer drugs: i) The spectrum of mutations can be very diverse, occurring outside the drug binding pocket. In the case of the BCR-ABL kinase, mutations appear throughout the kinase domain, such as\n the P-loop (ATP binding) and A-loop (regulatory region). This can necessitate DNA sequencing of the entire gene or specific portions in order to detect the occurrence of both known and uncharacterized mutations. However, DNA sequencing is expensive when i\nncorporated into a commercial assay and has limited sensitivity (gt20%). ii) It is possible to isolate the drug target proteins or fragments to perform functional and/or structural analysis. However, such analyses are hindered by difficulties in assaying t\nargets in crude biological mixtures and in isolating target proteins in a pure form. In this project these limitations are overcome by using novel technology developed by AmberGen for isolating highly purified cell-free expressed polypeptide fragments of t\nhe drug-targeted protein(s), and detecting characteristic drug resistance mutations using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) scanning technique. The new approach, termed drug resistance assay for mutations against \nanti-cancer drugs (DRAMA-ACD) has the advantage that it allows low-cost scanning for mutations (even those previously undiscovered) with high sensitivity and high throughput. Achievement of key milestones during Phase I included: i) the demonstration that \nDRAMA-ACD could detect mutant BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase at a sensitivity of at least 5%; ii) the successful demonstration of PC-SNAG, a method of capturing and photoreleasing cell-free expressed fragments of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase with significantly red\nuced levels of non-specific contamination; iii) the demonstration that all steps in DRAMA-ACD can be multiplexed using bead-sorted libraries of in vitro expressed proteins (BS-LIVE-PRO); iv) Development of a process known as PC-PRINT which enables beads co\nntaining the target peptides to be transferred directly to a MALDI-MS target for direct analysis. During Phase II, we will continue to focus on the development and application of DRAMA-ACD to detect mutations in the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. An important mi\nlestone will be a demonstration of the ability to detect these mutations in CML patients with a sensitivity of 1%. The research will be carried out in collaboration with Dr. Adam Lerner, Associate Professor of Medicine and Pathology, a leading expert in th\ne area of hematologic malignancies, who will provide us with samples for analysis from CML and Ph+ ALL patients undergoing Imatinib treatment. All results will be statistically analyzed in collaboration with Prof. Jos e Dupuis, Associate Professor of Biost\natistics, and Boston University School of Public Health.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a commercial grade optical probe and system for FDA clinical trials and subsequent commercialization of a population-wide colon cancer screening test. An interdisciplinary research team of engineers, biologists, and clinicians has developed low-coherence enhanced backscattering (LEBS), an optical technique which enables sensing tissue microarchitectural correlates of the genetic/epigenetic changes in otherwise histopathologically normal mucosa. The preliminary animal and human studies demonstrated the potential of LEBS to detect subtle alterations in histologically normal-appearing tissue that occur with the presence of precancer in a different part of an organ, a consequence of the well-established concept of field carcinogenesis. This opens a possibility to detect colonic adenomas by means of LEBS analysis of rectal tissue, which is readily accessible using a rectal probe and without the need for colonoscopy or bowel preparation. Indeed, ex vivo human studies and a small-scale trial of the in vivo LEBS probe from Phase I research demonstrate that rectal LEBS is remarkably accurate for predicting neoplasia anywhere in the colon. In continued close collaboration with the research team, American BioOptics endeavors in Phase II to refine the prototype LEBS probe into a medical-grade probe for use in a patient without bowel preparation and to develop a low-cost LEBS optical system for multi-center FDA trials and\nsubsequent commercialization.  LEBS has the potential to become the first truly population-wide test for colon cancer screening performed during an annual exam by a primary care physician, without colonoscopy or bowel preparation to determine the need for colonoscopy. The proposed test would be simple, inexpensive, minimally intrusive and highly accurate without the need for bowel cleansing. Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. largely because of especially poor screening participation relative to other major cancers. Only a small fraction of eligible population (90 million Americans over age 50) undergoes screening colonoscopy due to a variety of reasons including expense, patient reluctance, complications, and insufficient number of endoscopists. Development of a minimally invasive test to identify patients who do and do not harbor colonic adenomas is of crucial importance to enable, for the first time, population-wide screening for this disease. Currently, no such initial screening test is available. Based on the results of the LEBS test, the physician could recommend either no colonoscopy (the majority of cases) or need for colonoscopy (which the patient will be more compliant with). Thus, with a readily available LEBS screening test developed in Phase II and subsequent FDA approval, more patients with colonic neoplasia will undergo colonoscopy. The LEBS test would not only prevent many more colon cancer deaths by screening a larger part of the population, but it would also reduce costs/complications of screening in the majority of the population who are not destined to develop neoplasia.",

Most importantly, sphingosine\n 1-phosphate produced by sphingosine kinase (SK) mediates the effects of tumor necrosis factor-1 and interleukin-12, pro-inflammatory cytokines that are central to pathologic processes in these diseases. Because of this pivotal role of SK in regulating inf\nlammation, we are developing SK inhibitors to be used as drugs to treat arthritis. In Phase I of this project, we demonstrated that our proprietary SK inhibitors block signaling pathways induced by inflammatory cytokines in cell culture. Importantly, we fu\nrther demonstrated that oral administration of the SK inhibitors attenuates the development of collagen-induced arthritis in mice and adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats. These therapeutic effects of the SK inhibitors are manifested without toxicity to the \nanimals. These studies provide the first proof-of-principle demonstration that SK inhibitors are likely to be effective in the treatment of arthritis. In Phase II of this project, we will more thoroughly evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of an optimized fo\nrmulation of the leading SK inhibitor in multiple models of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Additionally, we will determine the optimal schedule for treatment of the animals, and examine the therapeutic effects of combining the SK inhibitor with e\nstablished anti-arthritis drugs. Both of these activities will be important for subsequent translation to clinical trials. The following Specific Aims will be addressed: 1. To confirm the therapeutic activity of ABC294640 in three experimental models of rh\neumatoid arthritis. 2. To determine the therapeutic activity of ABC294640 in two experimental models of osteoarthritis. 3. To determine the therapeutic activity of ABC294640 in combination with established anti- arthritis drugs. 4. To determine the pharmac\nokinetics and the optimal treatment schedule for ABC294640. Upon completion of these experiments, we will be ready to begin clinical testing of a new chemical entity directed toward a new molecular target critical for progression of arthritis. Therefore, t\nhese studies provide a focused approach for moving a novel inhibitor of SK into clinical trials for the treatment of these debilitating diseases.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women and is a worldwide health problem. Unlike most cancers, cervical cancer is caused by a virus - the human papillomavirus (HPV). Two preventative vaccines\n against HPV were recently licensed in the United States. Merck and Co. developed a vaccine called Gardasil(tm) and GlaxoSmithKline has developed the vaccine Cervarix(tm). Although both appear to be effective at preventing HPV infection in women, neither v\naccine protects women already infected with HPV from developing cancer or afflicted with the disease. An estimated 20 million people are infected with HPV and worldwide, cervical cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death affecting an estimated 500,\n000 women each year. Consequently, a therapeutic approach is still necessary to combat already existing HPV infection and cervical cancer.    Regardless of significant advances in vaccinology, the therapeutic potential of cancer vaccines remains to be real\nized, partly due to an array of evasive and immunosuppressive mechanisms employed by progressing tumors4. Therefore, the success of therapeutic vaccines is not only contingent upon their ability to generate new immune responses and/or boost the existing on\nes, but also to overcome immune evasion mechanisms. Therapeutic vaccines based on well-defined universal tumor associated antigens (TAAs) represent an attractive approach because of their practicality as well as targeting broad range of cancer types. Howev\ner, the weak antigenic nature of TAAs combined with possible immune tolerance and evasion mechanisms in cancer patients present major hurdles that require potent adjuvants to achieve therapeutic efficacy.    To overcome these obstacles, ApoImmune has devel\noped a proprietary novel HPV vaccine, ApoVax104-HPV, that constitutes i) a chimeric molecule containing the extracellular domain of costimulatory 4-1BBL fused C-terminus to core streptavidin (ApoVax104), and ii) biotinylated HPV 16 E7 oncoprotein as a TAA \nconjugated to the chimeric protein via biotin/streptavidin interaction. In the Phase I SBIR application, we demonstrated that ApoVax104 component of the vaccine i) targets conjugated antigens into dendritic cells (DCs) constitutively expressing the 4-1BB r\neceptor and activates DCs for antigen uptake and presentation, leading to initiation of adaptive immunity, ii) directly works on CD4+ and CD8+ T effector (Teff) cells further augmenting adaptive immunity, and most importantly iiii) overcomes the suppressiv\ne function of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells. Therefore, the pleiotropic effects of 4-1BBL on innate, adaptive, and regulatory immunity provides a unique advantage over other vaccine approaches under development or in clinical settings. This not\nion is supported by our strong data obtained during Phase I SBIR studies demonstrating that vaccination with ApoVax104 with a synthetic peptide representing the dominant CD8+ T cell epitope for HPV E7 oncogene (E749-57) was more effective than 3 benchmark \nadjuvants (lipopolysaccharide, (LPS), Monophosphoryl Lipid A (MPL), and CpG oligonucleotide (CpG), in the generation of primary and long- term T cell memory as well as in the eradication of established E7-expressing TC-1 tumors. In addition, vaccination wi\nth ApoVax104 resulted in better efficacy and undetectable toxicity as compared an agonistic Ab against 4-1BB receptor, currently being pursued for cancer clinical trials. Building on these strong preclinical studies obtained from Phase I, the goal of this \nPhase II SBIR application is to develop a humanized ApoVax104-HPV vaccine containing full length HPV16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins to conform to the requirements of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Phase I clinical trials.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: \n Unlike most cancers, cervical cancer is caused by a virus - the human papillomavirus (HPV). Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women",

        "abstract": "As a nation, we are faced with multiple challenges from global climate warming, rapid depletion of fossil oil, a strong desire to become independent from foreign oils, and a moral obligation to preserve our environment for future generations. In response to these challenges, many consumers have changed their purchasing behavior, preferring bio-based products over fossil-based products with a willingness to pay a premium. This green socioeconomic movement is now prevalent in many commercial markets. Many companies which manufacture and market finished consumer products are actively seeking new bio-based raw materials to develop their green products for this growing segment of consumers. As a result, the market opportunity for bio-based raw materials is growing very rapidly. Our patent-pending vegetable oil gel technology is geared towards taking advantage of this growing market opportunity. This technology blends an advanced polymer into liquid vegetable oil, forming a microscopic three-dimensional network of polymer springs within the oil matrix, conceptually similar to the spring structure of a mattress except at a nano-molecular level. Depending on the density and strength of these oil matrix embedded molecular polymer springs, the resulting gelled material can exhibit a wide range of unique properties, from a strong and tough material, to a jell-O like soft gel, to a pudding-like soft solid, and to even a thickened but flowable liquid. Additionally, this gelled material can be produced with a clear or opaque color. The versatility of this material allows us to consider many different applications in a wide variety of industries. As a result of our work in the Phase I project, we have already developed two commercial prototypes as value-added ingredients for the Cosmetic and Toiletry Industry (CTI) and candle industry, and have verified some of their unique benefits when incorporated in the end formulations of CTI products. The brand names we've chosen for these two commercial prototypes are NatureVgelTM Soya - 100 and NatureVgelTM Soya Butter-100. The unique benefits we have verified for the CTI include: a) imparting a very silky and cushiony skin sensory in the finished cosmetic and skin care products; b) increasing product stability; c) controlled delivery of essential oils and fragrance, and d) longer wear. In addition to the Cosmetic and Toiletry market and candle market, there are many more potential commercial markets such as toy market, shoe and back pack cushion, burn beds, etc.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the research is to develop and fabricate an instrument that can facilitate the discovery of new drugs via high throughput screening (HTS). ECIS (electric cell-substrate impedance sensing) is a\n technology developed by Applied BioPhysics to study the behavior of cultured cells in real time. Instruments manufactured by the company currently find use in over 150 laboratories world wide to measure such fundamental cell properties as permeability of \ncell monolayers, cell migration and cell-extra cellular matrix interactions. The ECIS instrumentation had been limited to low throughput research endeavors where a maximum of 16 individual cell cultures could be monitored. Phase I research culminated in th\ne development and fabrication of the first 96 well version of ECIS. This instrument is limited to measurements of simple impedance and has a throughput restricted to a single 96 well plate. In spite of these limitations, the ECIS 9600 instrument is now bei\nng successfully marketed primarily to academic laboratories. The objective of the Phase II research is to build upon the success of Phase I and create a truly high throughput ECIS system. The new instrument will be capable of monitoring the complex impedan\nce of ECIS culture wells over a broad spectrum of AC frequencies. Custom electronics will accommodate rapid data acquisition of large numbers of 96 well plates permitting thousands of individual wells to be screened. The instrument will capitalize upon the\n power of monitoring complex impedance and will be tailored for two important cell-based assays. One of these assays will involve measurement of cell migration based on an automated ECIS-based wound-healing assay. The other will monitor changes in barrier \nfunction of cell layers. None of these important measurements can presently be accomplished in a high throughput assay. The achievement of these goals will involve several steps:  development and testing the necessary electronics,  design and testing of af\nfordable consumable arrays specifically tailored for each assay,  production of custom software to run assays and manage the large resulting data files,  interfacing the ECIS instrumentation with standard robotic plate handlers. Once a complete prototype i\nnstrument has been fabricated, we will establish two beta test sites where the instrumentation and its software will be thoroughly evaluated and changes implemented to yield the final production unit. In Phase III, the instrument will be used in HTS assays\n in the pharmaceutical industry, where literally tens of thousands of test compounds will be evaluated in the search for modern therapeutic drugs.",

        "abstract": "Red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus, is one of the most economically important fish species in the Gulf of Mexico. While there are numerous species of snapper marketed worldwide, in the United States L. campechanus is known as the true red snapper and the only species that can legally be labeled simply \"Red Snapper\". Another snapper species, Lutjanus purpureus, which is harvested in the South Atlantic and Caribbean Sea, can be labeled red snapper but requires the port of landing in the label such as Caribbean red snapper to indicate that it is not L. campechanus. Due to the significant price difference between L. campechanus and all other snapper species, it is common practice for distributors and retailers to simply label the product \"Red Snapper\" regardless of the species or country of origin label. In addition, the continued demand for red snapper has contributed to flagrant over fishing of the species. Misidentification of snapper at harvest, results in misrepresentation of a given snapper species population and negates species management efforts. We are proposing the development of an efficient, commercially available, PCR-based diagnostic that will utilize specifically developed DNA markers and provide the level of reproducible discrimination needed to generate a useful snapper species identification method. The development of our assay will provide the industry as well as federal, state, and private labs with a valuable tool for validating the authenticity of red snapper and for managing conservation efforts.",

Often, these demands can be in direct conflict, e.g., very large droplets reduce drift but may run off the target or may be ineffective against pests on leaf undersides. Depending on the immediate weather conditions, the proximity to sensitive crops or areas, the pesticides being applied and the target pests, the applicator may desire to \"fine tune\" the application parameters such as nozzles, use of adjuvant, rate of active ingredients and method of application. Along these lines, applicators need additional methods and equipment to balance or optimize spray tank adjuvant performance and economics to achieve drift mitigation goals for a given application. A particular problem develops when a mix of chemicals is applied simultaneously. In these cases, a \"tank mix\" of many chemicals and adjuvants is prepared and sprayed.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to build and test a 20 L capacity Remediator for medical wastes. Infectious Medical Wastes (IMW), mainly from hospitals, represents a major component of hazardous wastes generated in the U.S.. In f\nact, more than 4.5 million tons are generated per year. Hospital waste remediation was a  1.5 billion industry in 2003. Incineration remains the predominant disposal method, with continued problems of environmental pollution, severe local opposition, trans\nportation, high costs and the threat of recent (1997) laws shutting down incinerators. This firm recently demonstrated a novel technique for remediation of IMW that involves submersing the IMW in proprietary liquids that are specifically activated by micro\nwaves to generate antimicrobial and antiviral activity in a manner as or more effective than an autoclave. This technique uses unique, microwave-active liquids, proprietary microwave enhancers and simple, ambient-pressure techniques. It yields an extremely\n inexpensive, rapid, environmentally benign, local, point-of-service methodology for remediation of IMW, usable much as a local-area photocopier or shredder. The Phase 1 work further developed this, demonstrating application to a wide variety of mixed IMW,\n including metallic parts, bandages, gloves, cotton, etc. and actual hospital wastes. Typically, 400 g of wastes in 650 mL of microwave liquid could be remediated in 7 minutes using a 1.1 KW oven, with final weight/-volume reductions to lt 15% of original.\n Detailed analyses of thermal degradation products of the microwave liquid and wastes showed none. A mechanical prototype of a Remediator was built and a fully-microwave-functional prototype was designed and evaluated. AOAC Sporicidal Tests and microwave-v\ns.-heat-only tests were also done in the prior work. In the proposed Phase 2 work, a fully functional Remediator will be built, tested and refined, to arrive at a design suitable for handing over to a large contract manufacturer. AOAC Sporicidal and quanti\ntative tests and tests with actual hospital wastes will be used to verify performance, along with comparisons with extant benchmark methods. The work is a collaborative effort with a highly specialized microwave design company, one of the world's premier u\nniversity microwave chemistry groups, the Regional Bio-Defense Lab, and a large hospital. Estimated remediation costs are  900/ton for this firm's technology, vs.  2900/ton for incineration, and more for microwave-steam methods. This firm's technology's es\ntimated capital cost is less than  8 K for a 30 kg/hr throughput, as compared to  18 K for on-site autoclaving and  80 K for microwave-steam. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The technology could, potentially, entirely replace incineration of medical wastes (alrea\ndy beset with public health problems) as well as expensive methods such as in-situ autoclaving and microwave-steaming, yielding an inexpensive, environmentally benign, and local, point-of-service method for medical waste remediation, to great public benefi\nt [1-26]. Independent studies [2-4] show it could initially (within 5 years) capture about 10% to 30% of the more than  2 billion (in 2008) medical waste remediation market, possibly more subsequently. This firm's technology's estimated running costs are 1\n/3 to 1/6 that of other methods, its capital costs are 1/3 to 1/10 of other methods, and, in contrast to other methods which (with the exception of incineration) leave a large amount of residual waste, it leaves less than 15% of the original volume of wast\ne.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a SBIR Phase II application for developing microfluidic microchips containing 30k protein kinase (PK) substrate peptides for proteomic PK profiling of cell lysates. In recent years there has been a dramatic expa\nnsion in our understanding of PK (kinome) biology.1-7 In addition to the fundamental role of PKs in protein post-translational modification and cell signal transduction, PK enzymes have been associated with various forms of human cell growth malfunctioning\n and more recently with hematopoietic stem cell diseases.8-10 In fact, more than 200 PKs have been linked to human disease loci4, making PKs an important group of potential therapeutic targets. The success of the kinase-targeting therapeutic strategies has\n stimulated intensive efforts in new target identification and drug discoveries.11-14 A great need in these studies is to be able to effectively monitor the changes in PK levels under different cellular conditions. To realize the full potential of these st\nudies, it will be vital for assays to have the capability of simultaneously monitoring the presence and quantitative levels of multiple PKs, not just a single kinase assayed per reaction. Such quantitative measures will allow for more accurate and reliable\n profiling of PKs on a proteome- scale. However, presently only limited choices for PK assays are available and these are mostly low throughput or only for qualitative assessments; the technologies for massively parallel PK profiling are still in their ear\nly stages, as there are major challenges and barriers to overcome. This proposed project seeks to build on the success of the Phase I project to develop a robust, quantitative, comprehensive, flexible, high throughput, cost effective and scalable PK profil\ning peptide chip platform. This will be a significant step towards addressing the rising needs of life science research and applications in the functional kinome fields.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Currently more than 200 protein kinases (PKs) have bee\nn associated with human disease, and the tremendous success of kinase-targeting therapeutic strategies has stimulated tremendous efforts toward identifying new kinase targets and potential drug discoveries. Unfortunately these efforts have been hampered by\n a lack of sensitive, quantitative assays for monitoring levels of multiple PKs simultaneously. The proposed 30k substrate peptide array aims to address this need, and allow highly accurate and reliable profiles of cellular kinase activity under different \nconditions, and has significant potential as a future diagnostic and/or drug screening platform.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further develop HunchLab -- software tools that leverage spatial statistics to enable police personnel to test their theories of criminality against data collected in the day-to-day activities of policing. The preceding Phase I project proved the feasibility of developing HunchLab as a set of innovative software tools that scour the historic data of a police department, search for geographic aberrations expected by the theories or 'hunches' put forth by crime analysts, and apply spatial statistics to confirm or deny the supposition. Preventing crime is a more sophisticated task than simply mapping incidents or arrests and deploying resources accordingly. The ability to detect and analyze changes in the geographic patterns of crime and disorder is an innovation in policing which holds the potential to enhance the organizational capacity of police departments across the country. This Phase II project will refine the application and build additional functionality, including alternate workflows for different user types, expanding the alert infrastructure, and building text mining capabilities.  The obvious sector that this product will impact is law enforcement at all levels of government. Additionally the successful outcome will impact federal law enforcement agencies and regional crime analysis consortia. There are roughly 250 municipalities with over 100,000 people in them, and these each have police\ndepartments that would find this system of use. The tools will be helping thousands of police officers do their jobs better every day. This efficiency will result in better policing, meaning that criminals will be caught more effectively. Criminals cause damage far in excess of the property and medical costs directly attributable to their activity. Perhaps more importantly, the research will form the basis for other products that operate in realms other than law enforcement. The algorithms and technologies developed in the Phase I prototype are transferable to other datasets that demonstrate similar point pattern processes - events with explicit spatial and temporal attributes. Our Phase I process demonstrated a substantial utility in domains other than law enforcement including fraud detection, real estate, sales and public health. The Phase II work plan includes testing with other data sets to refine that software should address these other markets.",

We named the project FLAMES (FLAsh Monitor Evaluation Studies) Development and testing proceeded in phases. The Phase I prototype monitor was a unit the size of a deck of cards, worn on a belt and was connected\n to the electrodes by 70 cm long wires. Subsequently, the circuitry was miniaturized and we developed a small, nondisposable, coated circuit board that snaps onto the electrodes and operates up to a month on a small battery. The monitor is 7 cm long W 2 cm\n wide W 6 mm thick and weighs less than 15 g. This version of the monitor was used for the remaining phases of clinical testing. Data regarding the frequency, timing, and amplitude of hot flashes are downloaded directly from the monitor to data acquisition\n software. Researchers at the UCSF Women's Health Clinical Research Center collaborated with the biomedical engineers at Bahr Management, Inc. to develop and test the monitor in women with hot flashes. We now aim to produce a version of the monitor that is\n adequate for commercialization. We will improve the monitor by making the battery rechargeable, increasing water-resistance, providing real-time display in the laboratory, recording for one month, and increasing speed of software download and display. We \nwill test reproducibility and accuracy in 50 peri- or postmenopausal women with hot flashes and subsequently in a multi-center intervention trial in women with hot flashes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hot flashes are common in peri- and postmenopausal women a\nnd negatively impact quality of life. The frequency and severity of hot flashes are generally measured by self-report, which may not be complete, especially during sleep. We designed and tested the accuracy of a miniature hot flash monitor that measures ch\nanges in skin conductance to automatically detect hot flash frequency in ambulatory women over a 7-day period.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Liver damage and failure due to various forms of hepatic injury is a significant source of overall morbidity and mortality in the US and worldwide. Persistent hepatic injury occurs during viral hepatitis, fatty liver di\nsease (steatohepatitis), drug or alcohol and autoimmune induced hepatitis. Clinical conditions are numerous where hepatic injury is a vital component of multi-organ failure caused by complex trauma including blast injury, septic shock, and graft failure af\nter liver transplantation often leading to death of the patient. Enzymatic assays of serum ALT and AST, widely used as part of a  hepatic function' panel, are neither sensitive nor particularity specific to the liver and do not assess the magnitude of live\nr injury or predict outcome. If liver damage is imminent, tissue biopsies are routinely used for diagnosis. This indicates an explicit clinical need for non-invasive biomarkers for early detection of liver injury with enhanced diagnostic information. We pr\nopose here the continuation of the development of novel liver specific biomarkers which are easily detected in serum and can be used for early diagnosis of patients with liver injury and aid in monitoring of potential liver toxicity in patients during drug\n treatment. Our biomarkers can also be used in preclinical studies of hepatotoxicity. We identified several novel liver-specific biomarkers in rat models of hepatic injury with the argininosuccinate synthase (ASS) and hepatic estrogen sulfotransferases (ES\nT-1) being the most sensitive markers which rapidly accumulated in blood and correlated with the severity of damage. In Phase I, a prototype SW ELISA for quantifying ASS in serum was developed, and sufficient data were obtained demonstrating the greater bi\nomarker sensitivity and specificity in experimental models of liver injury compared to ALT/AST. Also, we provided the proof-of-concept data indicating the diagnostic and prognostic value of serum ASS in human patients with several types of liver diseases a\nnd hepatic injury. In Phase II, a ready-to-use ELISAs Kits for ASS and EST-1 will be developed and validated in preclinical studies in rat models of liver injury and hepatotoxicity. Sufficient supplies of the assay components (e.g. antibodies and antigens)\n will be produced under quality assured conditions. We will characterize the diagnostic potential of ASS and EST-1 assays in human patients with various types of liver diseases and hepatic injury. The biomarker levels will be that will be correlated with c\nlinical data including liver biopsy, serological and laboratory data with an emphasis on hepatic injury severity, disease progression and outcome. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic/prognostic values of ASS/EST-1 will be assessed and com\npared with ALT/AST. These analyses will be used to support a pre-IDE application to the FDA for validation of these assays as diagnostic tools and further commercialization. The deliverables of this Phase II project will be quality assured ELISA assays for\n two liver injury biomarkers, and clinical data supporting the use of the biomarkers as tools for aid in the diagnosis of liver injury and monitor the magnitude of liver toxicity far beyond information obtained from ALT/AST measurements.         PUBLIC HEA\nLTH RELEVANCE: Liver health is a major component of human wellbeing. Many environmental chemicals, pathogens, drugs or excessive alcohol can harm the liver and affect its function. An estimated 5.5 million Americans have chronic liver diseases, including v\niral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease or hepatic cancer, which frequently lead to liver failure and requires liver transplantation. Moreover, increasing numbers of prescription drugs such as cholesterol-lowering drugs and over-the-counter medications, in\ncluding acetaminophen, can potentially cause liver toxicity and, thereby, require medical liver function checks.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): BCR Diagnostics, Inc. (BCR) has recently developed and patented a technology platform for engineering fluorogenic functionality into living Bacillus spores. Fluorogenic spores (F-spores) produced at BCR appear to be phy\nsiologically identical to normal spores except for performing as self reporters of initial germination events. Considering the unique features of the F- spores in context with existing needs for rapid and reliable biological indicators (BIs) for sterility \ntesting, BCR proposes a Phase II validation study of a rapid biological indicator (rBI) for steam sterilization. The study's overall objective is to assemble a database for submitting a premarket 510(k) notification to the Food and Drug Administration.    \n Critical to the application is that sterilization processes are essential to the healthcare industry and are required to monitor the effectiveness of equipment and procedures used. Currently, biological indicators of living microbial spores are the most a\nccurate and reliable systems for sterility but the major disadvantage with these indicators is that seemingly sterilized articles must be stored for prolonged times to ensure sterility.     The proposed biological indicator should perform as the convention\nal indicators because both depend on vital functions as parameters of cell death. However, BCR's indicator is different because it measures early germination events while conventional indicators measure spore outgrowth into a bacterial culture.     The pro\nposed study consists of three major assignments: Task 1. To design and construct a prototype of a 2-dimensional lateral flow system to measure fluorogenic activity of the rBI after exposure to a sterilization cycle. For Task 1, BCR will collaborate with Ne\nw Horizons Diagnostics Corp. (Columbia, MD). Task 2. To standardize and test the rBI for stability and reproducibility. Task 3. To conduct a :double blind: study during which the performance (efficacy) of the rBI will be evaluated by comparing it to a conv\nentional BI using spore outgrowth as parameter. For Task 3, BCR will collaborate with Raven Biological Laboratories (Omaha, NE).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sterilization is critical in a number of industries, from healthcare and pharmaceuticals to fe\nrmentation and food service. Conventional techniques to test the effectiveness of sterilization processes, however, involve culture based monitoring that can take up to seven days to complete. To provide more rapid sterility assurance, BCR Diagnostics has \nengineered unique living microorganisms that promptly (less than 30 min) send fluorescent light signals when the sterilization process is inadequate.",

Although Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) is efficacious for persons with SPMI, it is less clear the extent to which this approach adequately meets the needs of substance dependent BPD clients. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is an effic\nacious psychosocial treatment for individuals with BPD and co-occurring SUDs. Over the past decade, this combined approach of DBT within ACT has been identified as a promising direction for clinical practice, and more ACT teams are using DBT to work with t\nheir most difficult-to-treat clients (including those with BPD and SUDs). Dissemination of evidence-based practices remains a high priority at NIDA. A number of barriers limit accessibility to these effective practices in community-based mental health and \nsubstance abuse treatment settings. In line with NIDA's priority to disseminate evidence-based practices, this Phase II grant proposes to substantially expand development of an innovative computer-based training (CBT) program aimed at teaching ACT provider\ns effective DBT strategies to reduce in-session dysfunctional behaviors among their BPD and BPD-SUD clients. Specifically, we propose to expand the content to include more DBT dialectical and stylistic strategies, and will add a variety of case-based scena\nrios to further facilitate interest and to ensure direct applicability to clinical practice. We will also expand interactive exercises to include extensive performance-based learning opportunities that immerse the learner within the treatment context. We w\nill use an iterative process of development in building all new content, ensuring usability and satisfaction by conducting extensive online reviews and individual interviews with DBT experts, ACT experts, and the target audience (i.e., ACT providers), as w\nell as through  live  usability tests with ACT providers. We will then move to a test of the program's efficacy and effectiveness using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the CBT to an enhanced CBT condition that includes expert consultation and\n an online discussion board. In this RCT, we will evaluate gains in knowledge and recall, as well as self-efficacy among ACT providers in treating their clients with BPD and BPD-SUD. Additionally, we will expand the outcome assessment to include a performa\nnce-based role-play between each ACT provider and a mock ACT client. Participants will be assessed pre- and post-training, and at 4- and 12-week post-training follow-up. Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) is an effective service delivery approach for pers\nons with severe and persistent mental illness; however, it is unclear as to whether it is effective for individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder or Substance Use Disorders, a high proportion of who are served by ACT. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (D\nBT), an effective treatment for individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder and Substance Use Disorders, is often sought after by ACT providers to more effectively respond to the needs of their clients. The intent of this project is to develop and eva\nluate an innovative computer-based training program that will teach ACT providers various DBT strategies that will ultimately improve clinical outcomes among their clients with these complex needs.",

The current application represents a cooperative partnership between the PI's small business concern, Behavioral Tech Research, Inc., a company with an impressive history of developing innovative training programs for psychosocial treatmen\nts, and the Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders at Boston University, where PCT-A was developed and evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). PCT-A is a cognitive-behavioral, evidence-based treatment for panic disorder in adolescence and a dev\nelopmental modification of the  gold standard  treatment for panic disorder in adulthood (Panic Control Treatment; PCT). The proposed online training program will substantially aid in the vital training of community mental health clinicians and other commu\nnity practitioners in the utilization of this evidence-based treatment with adolescents. Specifically, the aims of this Phase II proposal are to: 1) Build on the successful development of the initial PCT-A online training prototype by creating a version th\nat encompasses all relevant PCT-A content and materials; 2) In creating the PCT-A online training in its entirety, we will add additional case-based scenarios and expand interactivities to further facilitate interest and to ensure generalization to clinica\nl practice; 3) We will continue to attend to usability and satisfaction variables by conducting extensive individual interviews with end-users during an iterative development process, and; 4) We will conduct a randomized control trial (N=120), comparing th\ne completed online training to the two most common forms of training in new treatment modalities   instructor-led and text-based training formats.

Panic Control Treatment for Adolescents (PCT-A) is one efficacious approach for the treatment of p\nanic in adolescents. The lack of effective treatment availability is compounded by inherent difficulties in providing clinicians with training in treatments like PCT-A, beyond written text manuals or infrequent workshops.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Methylation is a ubiquitous and reversible covalent modification used to control the function of diverse biomolecules including their activity, stability and localization. Like phosphorylation, methylation is used to mo\ndulate protein function, but in addition many small molecules are regulated by methylation including hormones, neurotransmitters, xenobiotics, and lipids. More than 50 distinct methyltransferase (MT's) enzymes are present in humans, and not surprisingly th\ney are emerging as therapeutic targets for a broad range of diseases. Their involvement in neurodegenerative disease pathways is of special relevance because of the central role that methylation plays in regulating neurotransmitter function. The developmen\nt of highly selective MT modulators is clearly a compelling medical priority. However, efforts to achieve this are being hampered by a lack of robust, flexible enzyme assay methods adaptable to high throughput screening (HTS). To address this need, in Phas\ne I BellBrook Labs developed a novel fluorescence polarization immunoassay for S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), the invariant product of all MT reactions. This required development of a highly selective antibody that is able to differentiate between SAH and t\nhe substrate S-adenosylmethionine on the basis of a single methyl group. The Transcreener MT assay enables detection of any MT with any acceptor substrate in a homogenous format - and without the use of coupling enzymes - thus it eliminates all of the shor\ntcomings associated with alternative methods. In Phase II we propose to 1) rapidly commercialize a first generation, fluorescence polarization-based Transcreener MT assay based of the polyclonal antibodies developed in Phase I, 2) increase flexibility and \nease-of-use for the MT assay by using targeted mutagenesis of recombinant IgG clones to increase antibody selectivity for SAH, 3) increase HTS market penetration by formatting the assay for a second commonly used fluorescent detection mode, TR-FRET, and 4)\n use the novel MT assay combined with in silico screening to develop isoform selective inhibitors for five small molecule methyltransferases. The availability of robust, generic fluorescent HTS assay methods and selective chemical probes for MT's should gr\neatly accelerate their validation as drug targets and movement into the pharma drug discovery pipeline.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): BioHelix is the exclusive licensee for a novel, primase-based Whole Genome Amplification (pWGA) technology invented by Drs. Stanley Tabor and Charles Richardson at Harvard Medical School. This pWGA system utilizes multi\nple replication proteins including a primase/helicase, a DNA polymerase, a single-stranded DNA binding protein, and several other accessory proteins to achieve rapid and sensitive whole genome amplification. As such, bringing this novel technology from the\n university laboratory to the market place is a challenging task. During Phase I, we evaluated the performance of this technology and successfully purified all necessary proteins in large production scale. We successfully launched the first generation Rapi\nsome  pWGA kit, which is, to our knowledge, the first commercially available DNA amplification system reconstructed from a cellular replisome. We have also discovered additional advantageous features of the pWGA platform. First, we have shown that the pWGA\n platform can perform real-time detection of trace amounts of DNA (100 fg). In addition, we have demonstrated that in comparison with another commercially available WGA product (GenomiPhi from GE Healthcare) the pWGA platform is particularly efficient in a\nmplifying (by 108 fold) circular DNA from low copy numbers (100 copies) of input. The overall goal of the Phase II research will be: 1) To continue to improve the performance of the pWGA system by optimizing the key components and fine-tuning each componen\nt (if successful, a second-generation pWGA kit with lower amplification bias and higher fidelity will be launched); 2) To explore new applications for pWGA in biomedical research and clinical diagnostics based on the aforementioned studies in Phase I. Base\nd on the phase I data, the applications of pWGA may be expanded into two new areas. One is as a universal DNA detection system, which will be developed for the detection of trace amounts of DNA contamination in biological samples or pharmaceutical products\n. The second new application is related to circular DNA amplification, based upon the phase I observation that pWGA can amplify circular DNA with extremely high efficiency (from 100 copies to over 1010). We propose to develop pWGA as a tool for clinical re\nsearch and diagnostic applications targeting circular DNA viruses such as human Papillomavirus (HPV). We will use pWGA to amplify samples containing HPV and subsequently determine the HPV genotype using the Luminex system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Whole Ge\nnome Amplification (WGA) technologies are useful tools for cancer and genetic research. Amplifying the entire genome enables researchers to perform more tests on a given sample than would otherwise be possible. Two other types of WGA have been commercializ\ned for research applications: 1) methods derived from the polymerase chain reaction and 2) multiple displacement amplification (MDA). Rubicon Genomics has developed a PCR-based WGA platform GenomePlex  Kits for Research Use, available through Sigma-Aldrich\n. GE Healthcare markets the MDA technology under the name GenomiPhi  while Qiagen sells MDA kits under the name REPLI-g(R). Both of these technologies have some limitations. The GenomePlex  system generates short PCR amplicons, which limits its use in down\nstream applications such as RELP, DNA sequencing, and cloning. In addition, it requires a multiple-step reaction setup. MDA also often requires a heat-denaturation step before isothermal DNA amplification to facilitate primer annealing, which increases the\n complexity of the reaction setup and may introduce mutations into the template. In addition, the use of random primers in MDA makes it prone to non-specific DNA amplification even in the absence of an input template. The primase-base Whole Genome Amplific\nation (pWGA) platform is an in vitro reconstruction of a cellular replisome. It performs a simple, one-step isothermal whole genome amplification without ad",

HDA chemistry now allows for the speci\nfic amplification of both ribonucleic acids (RNA), and deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA). Moreover, we have optimized our primer design process to facilitate assay development. We also collaborated with the Keck Graduate Institute (KGI) to develop a small, port\nable nucleic acid analysis device (a.k.a. Rabbit). Finally, we have developed a number of DNA probe based assays for biodefense targets; e.g. Bacillus anthracis and Ebola virus. In this Phase II, we propose to put into place a functioning QMS at BioHelix, \nmanufacture cGMP reagents and devices that perform the our assays, and to validate our assay system for typing HSV-1 and HSV-2 with a large number (~1,000) clinical samples. The data generated from this clinical study will be used to apply for regulatory c\nlearance from FDA for the sale of this diagnostic system. We have selected HSV as a target for this first clinical assay because this virus is the lead cause of sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the United States. In addition, molecular testing for HSV\n DNA has greater sensitivity than the traditional viral culture (sensitivity of more than 95 percent, compared with 75 percent for culture). Despite this fact, molecular tests are not as widely used as culture for the diagnosis of genital herpes because of\n the higher cost of molecular tests. Moreover, molecular testing is viewed as a complex process requiring the isolation of DNA from clinical samples. Finally, as there are no FDA cleared commercial molecular assays for HSV, implementing such tests in clini\ncal laboratories is burdensome. We believe we can offer a solution to this problem. Genital and oral swab specimens collected in Cellmatics Transport Kit buffer (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) can be diluted 1/2000 for direct analysis by the IsoAmp HSV assa\ny. This dilution based sample processing will greatly reduce the degree of complexity of our assay system. In addition, we have begun to collaborate with GE Healthcare to develop a Ready-To-Go(tm) IsoAmp formulation for our assays that will eliminate the n\need for multiple, precise volumetric measurements. BioHelix and GE Healthcare plan to develop a formulation under design control in order to manufacture it under cGMP. The instrument developed by KGI will also be transferred to a cGMP manufacturer (Source \nScientific), such that by mid-2009 we expect to have a cGMP assay system ready for clinical validation studies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop a new, meta-analytic approach for evaluating cancer clusters of flexible shape called Cluster Morphology Analysis (CMA). To date, two of the major deficiencies of geographic studies of cancer a\nre that they often assume clusters have a specific shape (e.g. circle or ellipse) and do not evaluate statistical power using the geography, at-risk population, demographics, covariates and numbers of observed cases of the cancer under investigation. These\n limitations are overcome by this project. Power analyses will be conducted for 11 clustering techniques using a suite of plausible clusters of different sizes, relative risks and shapes. The results are then ranked by statistical power and by the proporti\non of false positives, under the rationale that the objective of cluster-based cancer surveillance should be to (1) find true clusters while (2) avoiding false clusters. CMA then synthesizes the results of those clustering methods found to have the best st\natistical performance. This approach is applied to pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality in Michigan, focusing on three counties that comprise a significant cluster that persists and grows from 1950 to the present day. CMA is a significant advance over\n clustering approaches that assume just one shape and rely on only one clustering method. The major innovation is the creation of methods and software for analyzing cancer incidence and mortality data to accurately identify flexibly shaped clusters defined\n by geographic sub-population of excess cancer risk.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The techniques and software from this project will provide a more concise and accurate description of cancer clusters via (1) the accurate detection of clusters founded on fle\nxible shapes, rather than on arbitrary shape  templates  such as circles and ellipses; (2) the automated evaluation of the statistical power of clustering techniques for the specific geography, cancer and sub-population being scrutinized by the software us\ner; and (3) Cluster Morphology Analysis that synthesizes results across clustering approaches to more accurately identify true clusters. To our knowledge the techniques and software from this project will be the first to address all of these factors within\n a single, comprehensive framework.",

        "abstract": "The Medium Density Fiberboard or MDF industry in North America is facing many challenges, largely as a result of the weak housing market. Residential construction is 20 percent below 2006 levels and it is not likely that an improvement will happen before mid 2008. Rising imports of secondary wood products from China and other low costs countries also have a detrimental impact on the North American production of furniture, mouldings, and other secondary wood products. In an environment of fierce international competition, Canadian and other foreign mills exporting to the USA are usually absorbing the exchange losses themselves, rather than losing the sale to a competitor. In addition, the MDF industry has to grapple with expensive and ever stiffer environmental regulations. We expect upward pressure on prices during the next five years, particularly from 2008 onwards, as environmental standards increase the cost of resins and demand escalates. The companies specializing in higher value added products are doing better. Therefore, the North American MDF industry is progressing by way of shifting its production towards higher value-added products. We have developed an innovative process of treating wood chips with a dilute solution of oxalic acid, patent pending, for the production of MDF, which compared to the control is more resistant to water infiltration in 24 hour swelling and water adsorption tests. The process not only produces value added MDF with increased strength, reduced moisture content, reduced energy consumption, etc. with reduced manufacturing cost but also further increases the profitability of this industry by producing a stream of carbohydrate resource that can be converted into cellulosic ethanol and other value added chemicals. The proposed research fits both USDAs crosscutting priorities, Agriculturally related manufacturing technology and alternative and renewable energy. Making ethanol from cellulose dramatically expands the types and amount of available material for ethanol production and would not compete with food supplies. Presently ethanol is made where grain is available. An ethanol manufacturing facility could be co located with a MDF plant. Additional societal impact will be gained if material from overcrowded forests is proven suitable for the process. The rural economic development will be an advantage, but if material thinned from our forests can be used then the health of the forests and help in prevention of forest fires will also be increased. This will enhance our resource base by providing new carbohydrate for fermentation and health of the environment by improving our standing forests. Each new identified source of carbohydrate that can be converted into fuels and chemicals will help to increase our energy independence. Cellulose ethanol production will also provide additional greenhouse gas emissions reductions.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II research project develops a new rapid, nonmolecular method for quickly testing the drug susceptibility of Mycobacteria tuberculosis, the bacterium causing the epidemic disease tuberculosis (TB). Currently, all measurements for determining drug susceptibility - essential for prescribing effective treatment - rely exclusively on detecting changes in the slow growing bacterial population after exposure to drugs known to kill the bacterium. Phase I demonstrated this technology's approach to drug susceptibility testing provides commensurate information without time consuming measurements of growth. Susceptibility results were obtained in only a few hours compared to currently used methods requiring several weeks to obtain the same information. In addition, resistant strains were easily distinguished from sensitive strains inferring the ability to identify drug resistant TB infections in only a few hours time. With this information in hand quickly, physicians will be able to prescribe antimicrobial therapies with confidence because the treatments will be targeted and not empirical.  The broader impacts of this research are the reduced spread of drug-resistant infections, increasing of the effective lifespan of drugs now known to cure disease, and lower healthcare costs associated with more successful patient outcomes. Rapid testing will enable better control over the spread of tuberculosis and the management of effective domestic and global policies. This will leave the United States and all other countries better prepared\nto mount an adequate defense in the event of an epidemic or intentional widespread exposure.",

Currently, all methods for determining\n antibiotic susceptibility rely exclusively on detecting changes in the bacterial population caused by cell division after exposure to an antimicrobial compound. In our Phase I effort we demonstrated a novel phenotypic approach to antibiotic susceptibility\n testing that provides commensurate information without measurements of growth. Technical feasibility of this method was demonstrated by measuring the antibiotic susceptibility of both sensitive and resistant strains of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aer\nuginosa treated with antibiotics having different mechanisms of action. Susceptibility results were obtained within one hour time. In addition, resistant strains were easily distinguished from sensitive strains. Because grown cultures are no longer needed \nto obtain results, susceptibility results can be obtained directly from urinary specimens at the point of collection within 90 minutes total reducing the time from sample collection to availability by days enabling targeted therapy, improved patient outcom\nes, and the reduced spread and generation of resistant organisms. The method can be realized with a disposable device that is simple, cost effective, and ideal for mass production. The proposed Phase II effort focuses on extending our investigation to incl\nude all first and second line antibiotics used to treat uropathogens and developing a prototype test instrument.         Project Narrative         Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common of all bacterial infections, occurring primarily in\n women, and accounting for as many as 8 million outpatient visits to doctors annually. Furthermore, UTIs have become the leading healthcare-associated infection among adults and children in the United States. However, the management of UTIs has become more\n complicated over the last decade due to increasing antimicrobial resistance to first-line antibiotics. Already, authorities advise the use of significantly more expensive fluoroquinolones as a first line treatment for uncomplicated UTIs when the prevailin\ng rate of antibiotic resistance in the area rises to greater than 20 percent. The same type of resistance of E. coli in other countries has reached a shocking 70 to 100 percent. Antibiotic resistance represents a problem of increasing societal importance b\nrought about by the overuse or inappropriate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The proposed rapid test is an essential tool for the responsible and prudent use of prescribed antibiotics to prevent the spread of resistant bacterial strains.",

        "abstract": "The primary focus of this project is to develop new high valued health related agricultural products through the application of biotechnological research approaches. Domestic and wild fowl, as the disease reservoir for avian influenza virus, play a central role in the re-emergence of this potentially pandemic disease pathogen. The increasing threat of pandemic flu in domestic fowl and human populations has activated governments, agricultural, and medical health agencies in the US and globally to initiate multifaceted research and development efforts aimed at mitigating this threat. New technologies for producing inexpensive high-quality agricultural vaccines to control avian flu at its source will be critical to successful intervention in the disease cycle supporting the threat of pandemic flu in both domestic poultry and humans. This project focuses on the bioproduction of avian interleukin-12 (IL-12) to address both of these needs. IL-12 is a potent adjuvant and key modulator of cell-mediated immunity and greatly enhances the efficacy of influenza vaccines in animal studies. There are currently no sources for IL-12 from any avian species. Phase I of this SBIR project successfully met its objectives in demonstrating the feasibility of plant-based production of bioactive chicken IL-12. We isolated and tested multiple ChIL-12 gene constructs and demonstrated effective expression in plants. We selected a His-tagged native ChIL-12 construct that provides product yields sufficient to support scaled up production for Phase II research and commercialization for the research reagent market. Most importantly, Phase I demonstrated that plant synthesized ChIL-12 shows excellent immune stimulating bioactivity in signature in vitro bioassays using chicken splenocytes. Phase II will focus on advancing ChIL-12 and related products (antibodies, ELISA) to the research reagent market and establishing large-scale production strategies in a transgenic seed-based plant system. Based on our successful Phase I, Phase II will also focus on production scale-up, demonstration of efficacy in avian vaccine trials, and assessment of ChIL-12 activity across avian species. Co-formulation of this strong immuno-adjuvant with avian flu vaccines will be tested to demonstrate whether these poultry vaccines elicit heightened immunity necessary for preventing cross species avian flu transmission. Plant-based bio-production may provide the cost and scale advantages to enable these benefits to be widely integrated into avian influenza vaccine strategies for both domestic and wild bird populations. Success of this Phase II SBIR in demonstrating significant \"dose sparing\" activity by ChIL-12 in avian flu vaccines will provide the basis for a strong Phase III commercialization program and a significant contribution to US and global efforts to mitigate the danger to humans and animals of pandemic influenza. An effective IL-12 adjuvant may also have broader applications as a \"universal\" adjuvant for other diseases and vaccines.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a novel Quality-by-Design (QbD) software platform directed at the needs of FDA's QbD initiative, a framework for innovative pharmaceutical development, manufacturing and quality assurance. QbD is implemented at four levels: process understanding; quality by design; monitor, predict and control; and continuous improvement. QbD implementation is hampered by the lack of a reusable and extensible QbD Software Platform for assembling QbD tools that execute, document and integrate QbD workflow. In the Phase I program, we successfully demonstrated 'proof-ofconcept' for the QbD Software Platform for application to the first QbD level workflow. This project will extend research to the other levels and enhance the QbD Software Platform in three principal ways: 1) increase capabilities for managing QbD data-set objects; 2) enlarge the pool of QbD workflow objects; and 3) add collaboration capability in conjunction with a centralized repository. We will test, evaluate and validate the QbD Software Platform through use scenarios developed in conjunction with pharmaceutical-company research collaborators. The ultimate goal of the program is to develop a commercial QbD software toolkit that enables scientists and engineers to implement QbD for increased manufacturing efficiency with regulatory flexibility.  The health of our nation's citizens depends on the availability of safe, effective and affordable medicines. Pharmaceutical companies need to\nemploy innovation, cutting-edge scientific and engineering knowledge, and the best principles of quality management to respond to the challenges of new discoveries (e.g., complex drug delivery systems and nanotechnology) and individualized therapies or genetically tailored treatments. The FDA and global pharmaceutical community are laying the foundation for a regulatory policy revolution, Quality-by-Design (QbD), that provides a framework for allowing regulatory processes to more readily-adopt state-of-the-art technological advances in drug development, production and quality assurance. QbD shifts focus from 'quality by testing' to 'quality by design', i.e. build quality into the process rather than rely on resource-intensive quality control systems to prevent defective products from leaving the factory. The Quality-by-Design (QbD) Software Platform of the present proposal enables scientists and engineers to implement state-of-the-art multi-variate analysis and machine learning to manufacturing quality. Additionally, given that manufacturing represents 25% of drug cost, equipment utilization is below 40%, and batch quality failures range from 5 to 15%, the effective implementation of QbD will enable improved efficiency providing lower drug costs and increased competitiveness for the US pharmaceutical industry.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-associated adipose redistribution syndrome (HARS), a form of lipodystrophy, is a common problem in HIV patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy and occurs as a side-effect of their anti-viral drug therapies.\n HARS is characterized by an increase in visceral adipose tissue, dyslipidemia, and insulin insensitivity, all of which are believed to increase the patient's risk for developing cardiovascular disease. Recombinant GH is effective at treating HARS, as meas\nured by reductions in visceral adipose tissue and improvement in lipid profiles. Recombinant GH products had worldwide sales of  2.4 billion in 2006, primarily from sales of the drug to treat GH deficiency in children and adults. GH has a short circulating\n half-life and must be administered to patients by daily injection. We created a highly potent, long-acting GH analog, BBT-031 that has a significantly increased circulating half-life and superior efficacy in animal models of growth hormone deficiency comp\nared to GH. Based upon animal studies we anticipate that our long- acting GH analog will be effective when administered once per week or less frequently in humans. The improved in vivo characteristics of this novel GH analog will reduce the need for freque\nnt injections, improve patient quality of life and potentially lead to a more effective therapy for the treatment of HARS. Our long-acting GH analog has the potential to significantly reduce healthcare costs by reducing the amount of drug required by patie\nnts, by reducing costs associated with patient visits to treatment centers and by reducing healthcare worker time associated with providing treatments. The overall goal of this SBIR proposal is to develop this long-acting GH analog for the treatment of HAR\nS and other metabolic complications of HIV and HIV therapies such as wasting (cachexia). During Phase I of the SBIR grant, we developed a GLP (Good Laboratory Practices) manufacturing process and supporting assay methods to produce material for GLP pharmac\nology and toxicology studies. We performed single injection and repeat injection GLP toxicology studies in rats and a GLP pharmacokinetic study in rats. No toxicities were noted at doses up to 30 times the expected dose to be used in humans, and the pharma\ncokinetic profile of the protein suggested it will be effective as a once weekly therapy in humans. We also showed that the protein was more potent than GH at stimulating weight gain and bone growth in growth hormone deficient rats, particularly when using\n a less frequent dosing regimen. During Phase I we also designed clinical protocols for Phase 1 safety and Phase 2 dose ranging efficacy studies in humans. The main goal of the Phase II SBIR proposal is to complete animal toxicology and pharmacology studie\ns in a second species, which is required by the FDA prior to testing this product in humans. We also will continue to optimize the manufacturing process and analytical assays for the protein and perform experiments to identify a stable liquid formulation f\nor the protein for use in humans. Successful development of our long-acting GH analog will provide HARS patients with a more convenient and potentially more effective treatment for their disease. This product also has potential for treating HIV-associated \nwasting (cachexia), for which GH has received approval by the FDA. Although not as significant a problem in U.S. due to wider use of more effective antiviral therapies, HIV-associated wasting still is a major problem in undeveloped countries where patients\n do not have as good access to HIV medications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE HIV-associated adipose redistribution syndrome (HARS) occurs as a side-effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and is believed to afflict approximately 80,000 HIV patien\nts in the U.S. HARS is characterized by an accumulation of visceral adipose tissue and alterations in lipid profiles.

Despite their relevance to human disease and interest by pharma as targets for therapeutic development, this diverse cla\nss of enzymes is understudied and detailed biochemical data is lacking. Highly purified DUB enzymes and appropriate substrates for sensitive and homogeneous assays are not currently commercially available. In Phase I we made new ubiquitin (Ub) proteins and\n poly-ubiquitin chains which are successful DUB substrates. This project was successful and generated a comprehensive tool set with wide-ranging that facilitated the identification and characterization of new DUBs and other UPP components. In this proposal\n we build on that progress and focus on two major topics: new deubiquitinating enzymes and novel ubiquitin chain substrates. Our specific aims are to: i) develop new DUBs to expand our current range of commercially available enzymes; ii) test the complete \nset of DUBs against the Ub substrates and chains made in Phase I; and iii) use new modification on Ub chains to develop a continuous flour-based assay system for DUB proteolysis. We will generate the most comprehensive panel of such proteins that are comme\nrcially available.

        "abstract": "RF sources are required for powering accelerators operating at approximately 350 MHz and for pro\u00adviding 200 kW CW for each accelerator cavity.  This project will develop a fundamental-mode, multiple-beam Inductive Output Tube (IOT) for potential accelerator applications.  The advantage of multiple beams is the reduction in operating voltage required to propagate several beams down individual beam tunnels.  In turn, the lower beam volt\u00adage allows significant reduction in the power supply requirements and decreases the likelihood for electrical breakdown and x-ray generation.  Combined with the IOT\u00bfs inherent high efficiency, the multiple-beam IOT would be an extremely cost effective RF source for accelerator applications.  Phase I developed preliminary designs for all major components and demonstrated feasibility.  An analysis determined power supply, drive, mechanical, and performance spec\u00adifications.  Phase II will finalize the design, then fabricate and test a prototype multiple beam IOT at full power.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The multiple-beam IOT would operate at much higher effi\u00adciency and be considerably less expensive than the klystrons that are now used for numerous accelerator applications.  The sig\u00adnificantly lower operating voltage also would result in dramatic savings for the power supplies and ancillary equipment and facilities.",

Current information technologies for the visually impaired are slow and difficult to operate while holding a white cane or guide dog. Visually impaired people will benefit greatly from a hands-free/eyes-free information system that is much faster to operate and easier to access. The project will develop a voice-operated personal digital assistant (PDA), called Vivian, which performs 10 times faster than Braille PDAs. The outcome of the Phase I study demonstrated the feasibility of real-time speech processing algorithms on integrated microcontrollers without hardware floating-point arithmetic. The outcome of this Phase II project is anticipated to result in a wearable device similar to a state of the art media player with 10X faster processing and 10X smaller in size.  With more than 160 million visually impaired people worldwide, 10 million in the US alone, the proposed research is a critical step towards a device that will address their mobile information management needs significantly better than current alternatives. Moreover, this device should impact mobile information management for sighted people. The results of usability trials with sighted users speaking multiple languages conducted during the Phase I project, indicate that the outcomes of a powerful and fast alternative\nhuman computer interface to graphical user interfaces for sighted and visually impaired users.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A coupling mechanism with the strength to fix a forcefully contracting muscle to a totally inert prosthesis, or to bone, would meet a serious and common need in clinical orthopaedics.  We have explored a new approach t\no such a coupling. The hypothesis was that a coupling prosthesis with a low-mass, high-surface configuration designed to transfer force by shear would transfer greater loads, without pressure-damage to tissue, than can be transferred by the interlocking me\nchanism of sutures or staples. The resulting device is the OrthoCouplerTM. The Phase I feasibility study results exceeded expectations. This was a 60 day assessment reattaching 8 goat semitendinosus (hamstring) muscles; 7 completed all testing - 6 with pai\nred experimental/control data, one with experimental alone. Each proposed Aim was met:--devices were built, validated for cyclic fatigue life, implanted, and succeeded clinically. Excised specimens were 2.5 times the strength of an expertly applied state-o\nf-the art-control (Krackow stitches under close direction of a senior orthopaedic oncologic surgeon). The proposed work applies the OrthoCoupler in goats to the most demanding setting imaginable - restablishing the knee extensor mechanism after complete ex\ncision of quadriceps tendon, patella, and patellar tendon, securing the cut quadriceps muscle stump to a tibial bone plate. This succeeded in four pilot animals - (servohydraulic testing to over 1000 N with femur fracturing without pullout). Specific Aim (\n1) assesses in a random block study the efficacy of two plausible improvements, each intended to facilitate ease of operative use compatible with minimally invasive placement, (2) standardizes design and fabrication with a contracted 'GMP' manufacturer and\n (3) rigorously reprises preclinical testing in a 'GLP' facility. Achieving these three specific aims would place the device at a decisive competitive advantage relative to any present alternative, and ensure our overriding long-term objective - commercial\nization of OrthoCoupler in a range of specific configurations for a market of over 20,000 muscle-to-prosthetic applications annually, including, but by no means limited to, orthopaedic oncology, revision arthroplasty, expanded tendon transfer and sports-in\njury reconstruction.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We have developed and patented a new technology for durable strong connections with tissue not having sufficient strength for conventional sutures or staples. A dominant need for this is in several orthopaedi\nc dilemmas - sports injury reconstruction, orthopaedic oncology, revision joint replacement and tendon transfers. Pilot studies have succeeded in the most demanding application possible, reattachment of the body's most powerful muscle, the quadriceps femor\nis and the proposal will expand that work in an extended term goat model.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cell Preservation Services, Inc. (CPSI) is a biotechnology company dedicated to the development of novel technologies in the area of low temperature biology and medicine. CPSI's core molecular strategy is focused on und\nerstanding and manipulating the cell survival and cell death pathways that appear to be cell-specific and are activated as a consequence of low temperature exposure. This paradigm shift has led to improved processes for the hypothermic storage and cryopres\nervation of a variety of human cells and tissues. Recently, through preliminary studies, we have determined that it is not adequate to merely address stress response issues during preservation through solution design, as has been the focus in the past, but\n in fact a more comprehensive and integrated strategy involving pre- and post-preservation cell conditioning strategies is necessary. CPSI applied this novel strategic approach and has identified promising new methodologies that appear to improve corneal c\nell and tissue quality beyond that of typical protocols which rely only on the use of preservation media, such as Optisol-GS, to maintain tissue integrity and function. Feasibility data gathered on human corneal endothelial cells (HCEC), bovine corneal end\nothelial cells (BCEC) and other relevant human cell strains suggest that the development of improved cornea processing and preservation protocols is highly feasible and successful development of an integrated process should not only increase the quality an\nd utility of corneal tissue, but increase the donor pool as well. Investigations conducted under this research project will utilize cDNA microarrays, proteomic profiling, and viability and functional analysis to define the stress response pathways activate\nd in HCEC following low temperature exposure common to pre-transplant processing. It is the intent of these studies to provide a better understanding of the unique responses of HCEC and whole cornea to low temperature exposure and utilize these data to dev\nelop new procedures for corneal tissue processing. We have established collaborations and subcontracts with researchers from several organizations including Harvard Medical School, the Schepens Eye Research Institute, the Moran Eye Center and NDRI to facil\nitate access to various outside resources (including expertise, cell culture systems, IP, etc.) to evaluate new processes/protocols that are developed under this research project as well as to help ensure the success of this research program. It is our bel\nief that the proposed investigations will lead to new methodologies for the processing of corneal tissue. These developments should have an impact not only on the quality and availability of harvested corneas, but also enable expanded utilization of cornea\nl-derived cells in areas such as in vitro toxicological testing and HCEC transplant. Corneal opacities are leading causes of blindness. One method to resolve this impediment to clear vision is to transplant donor corneas to the patient. To do so typically \nmeans that donor corneas must be preserved in a state of suspended animation in the cold prior to transplant. The methodologies developed in the past using Optisol- GS are dated and not based on modern, molecular medicine. CPSI proposes to use a molecular \nstrategy to develop improved protocols for the long term storage of human corneas - a set of integrated processes that will both increase the available cornea donor pool as well as the quality of the tissue for the cornea transplant market.",

This will be validated and applied to the research underway at our collaborating institute for the purpose of profiling the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway in a panel\n of ~60 breast cancer cell lines for improved prediction of therapeutic response.         The microfluidic platform will provide key advantages over the current cell based screening technology (96-well plate based), including: 1) improved handling of small\n cell samples (micoliters per array), 2) the ability to design more relevant microenvironments for phenotype analysis, 3) enabling multiplexed continuous flow experimentation, and 4) 10X-100X reduction of time and cost for cell culture automation. In addit\nion, the platform is designed such that application specific microfluidic arrays can be utilized with a single system, increasing the flexibility and impact of the technology.         The first major aim of this project will be to engineer an automated mic\nrofluidic screening platform. The main tasks are to optimize the design of the Phase I prototype, scale-up to a 384 well format, and refine the control system for high throughput operation. Three key innovations developed in our previous work will be furth\ner expanded to complete this aim: 1) the design of microfluidic networks and perfusion barriers to better approximate in vivo culture conditions, 2) the use of a pneumatic pressure driven manifold for multiplexed, non-wetted pumping of nanoliter volumes, a\nnd 3) the fabrication process that enables formatting the microfluidic arrays to SBS standards, making it compatible with current 96 and 384 well robotic screening instrumentation.         The second major aim will be to apply this system to the cancer cel\nl screening program at our collaborating institute. This will address areas where microfluidic technology can offer enabling benefits not possible with existing tools.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II research project will demonstrate a working ?alpha? prototype of a MEMS-based approach to security for RFID and other electronic security applications. MEMS resonators have very narrow bandwidths and high frequencies which vary from resonator to resonator. This natural frequency variation can be used to uniquely identify a resonator, and makes cloning a specific signal extremely difficult ? in essence creating a ?voiceprint?. This approach to RFID security overcomes the drawbacks of encryption which include more complex and expensive tags and the need to manage encryption keys. MEMS resonators for RFID tags are unique, secure, cost effective, CMOS compatible, and fast to read, with low power requirements and low overhead. This research project will demonstrate in a real environment with material temperature swings, working vacuum encapsulated MEMS chips with attached antennas, a low-cost prototype reader with maximum 10cm read range, and reader and system software to extract MEMS response signals to compare with stored signals for chip identification.  This project will have broad impact on the security of identification of both people and goods. For example, the RFID tags used in the implementation of US passports were recently cloned which calls into question the security of those documents. Since MEMS resonators cannot be cloned, they can provide significant security assurance to economically validate a given passport. MEMS resonators can also be used to economically authenticate pharmaceuticals\nsince counterfeit drugs are increasingly prevalent (the World Health Organization projects a $75 billion counterfeit market in 2010) and have caused deaths.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Linomide is a known anti-inflammatory drug. Recently we have synthesized a new analog of Linomide, linomide-5. The objective of this proposal is to develop linomide-5 as a therapeutic for treating diabetic retinopathy (\nDR) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Together, these diseases constitute the major causes of blindness worldwide. In both cases, retinal inflammation is a causative factor for the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier, which leads to leakage of\n plasma and fluid into the retina, causing macular edema which is a leading cause of vision loss in diabetic patients and in patients with AMD. There is a dire need to develop effective therapies to treat both the inflammatory and retinal vascular leakage \nof the diseases. In Phase I studies, we have shown that linomide-5 is nearly ~70 fold more potent than Linomide in its anti-inflammatory activity. Further, we have demonstrated that this compound is effective in reducing vascular leakage and inflammation i\nn multiple in vivo and in vitro models. Towards the development of a commercially viable therapeutic with sustained release, we have packaged linomide-5 into nanoparticles (L5-NPs). The goal of this proposal is to evaluate the efficacy of L5-NPs in prevent\ning inflammation, vascular leakage, and loss of vision in animal models of DR and AMD. Furthermore, we will perform rigorous toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies in both rabbits and pigs to assess the safety of using L5-NPs in future human clinical trials.\n The completion of these studies will provide sufficient data that will enable us to file an investigative new drug application with the food and drug administration. We anticipate that L5-NPs will be useful in treating both DR and AMD, and could prove use\nful as a combinatorial therapy with other currently approved anti-angiogenic pharmaceuticals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Retinal inflammation and vascular leakage or breakdown of the blood-retina barrier are early features of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and ag\ne-related macular degeneration (AMD) that leads to macular edema and causes a subsequent loss of vision. Currently, there are no effective drug treatments that address both vascular leakage and inflammation in these diseases. In this Phase II project, we w\nill further investigate linomide-5, a new anti-inflammatory drug candidate, as a treatment for these diseases and determine its long- term efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics to obtain essential data for future human clinical trials.",

Physical limits are driving chipmakers to produce chips containing multiple processor cores, but existing methods for programming multicore chips are error-prone and difficult to use. The potential outcomes of this research project will enable C++ programmers to easily parallelize applications to run on multicore processors without restructuring their legacy applications. Cilk++ is a simple set of language extensions to C++, which, together with a powerful runtime platform, allows multicore processors to be programmed easily. Market research shows that global variables pose a major barrier to parallelizing legacy code. This research project seeks to understand the linguistics, implementation, and applicability of hypervariables, a new construct designed to solve data-race problems created by parallel accesses to global variables. The results of the project include software implementations of hyper-variables in the context of Cilk++, including modifications to the Cilk++ language, compiler, tools and runtime platform. Additionally, the project will produce engineering design documents, user documentation, and training and educational materials, and will evaluate this technology in customer applications.  In 2008, the leading processor manufacturers will ship over 100 million processors, with forecasts for over 75 percent of such processors be\nmulticore. On the software side, the C++ programming language has become the standard langauge for developing applications that run on uniprocessor-based platforms. Although C++ programmers number well over 3 million, most lack the specialized training to use create correct, high-performing parallel programs. This research project will allow ordinary developers to multicore-enable legacy code and bring new multicore applications to market, thereby fulfilling the potential of multicore technology to help users of computers and personal appliances be more productive and to take advantage of the increased performance of computers in as diverse areas as health care, shopping, scientific advancement,  entertainment, financial planning, and more. This research will advance the understanding of how multicore computers can be programmed effectively. The lessons of Cilk++, and the innovation of hypervariables in particular, will generalize to other programming languages, such as Java, C#, and Fortran. The educational and training materials will educate software engineers in parallel programming and expose them generally to the subtle issues of concurrency.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II proposal aims to commercialize a new mesoporous silicate nanoparticles for the reinforcement of thermoplastic polymers used in the manufacture of U.S. cars and light trucks. Whereas nanoparticles, in general, provide some polymer reinforcement benefits, they typically lack the ability to provide strength as well as stiffness. Also, they normally require extensive organic surface modification for dispersion in the polymer matrix. Organic modifiers limit nanoparticles thermal stability and compromise their suitability for nanocomposite manufacturing through cost-effective melt processing methods. The purely inorganic mesoporous silicates this project plans, circumvent all of the limitations caused by organic modifies by providing a unique combination of surface polarity, mesopore size, surface area, and pore volume which optimizes interfacial interactions between the particles and the polymer matrix for effective dispersion and reinforcement. In addition to providing stiffness at particle loadings, the mesoporous silicates provide strength, which allows the amount of polymer needed to produce an automotive part to be reduced in proportion to the added strength. The polymer savings alone allow users of the technology to reduce the weight of the vehicle, achieve stiffness, and improve fuel economy at no added cost.  The broader impact/commercial potential of automotive nanocomposites can directly impact the US energy economy, as well as environmental quality. The combination of\nreduced vehicle weight and increased fuel economy translates into a reduction in petroleum consumption and green house gas emissions. The process for producing mesoporous silicate nanoparticles is neither energy-intensive nor environmentally harmful. Based on aqueous sol-gel chemistry, this project's nanoparticles are manufactured in yields at a temperature of with no harmful waste released to the environment.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project proposes a new approach to the problem of creating and editing premium quality computer-generated character animation that will dramatically reduce the heavy labor penalty associated with animation techniques and software tools currently available. The specific technical innovation consists of a generic animation framework that produces high-quality motion through a reduced set of input parameters (compared to keyframe techniques) while providing a high degree of directability for the user. Additionally the proposed innovation affords the ability to capture, store and reproduce stylistic motions with a high level of fidelity and repeatability. Style is encoded in both physically- and behaviorally-based time-variable parameters supporting smooth transitions between styles.  The theoretical foundation is similar to spacetime approaches yet has major differences that improve usability, flexibility, and productivity. Successful completion of this project will lead to a product that increases the productivity of experienced animators by simplifying the animation process, and enables novice or non-animators to quickly and easily create animated content.  The successful completion of this Small Business Innovative Research phase II project, in conjunction with an appropriately developed user interface, will positively impact the global content creation industry by increasing the ease-of-use for creation of animation compared to the\ndifficult and labor intensive animation processes currently employed. Successful commercialization will expose a much broader consumer market to the art of computer animation. The broader exposure of the solution will allow un-trained and underrepresented groups the ability to express themselves through the art of 3D computer generated character animation that is currently the realm of highly skilled users only. In addition, the increased ease of creating compelling animations will afford the dissemination of animation based information over a broader audience. Finally, the solution will allow animation to be used for applications where it was not previously feasible due to ease-of-use and budgetary constraints opening up new commercial opportunities.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive revision application in response to NOT-OD-09-058  NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications . Medical schools provide little background and training to prepare future physicians to deal with alcohol misuse, abuse and dependence seen in the population. To address this need we are current completing 1R44AA016724-01A1: Medical Student Education on Alcohol Abuse and Dependence, an SBIR Fast-Track (Phase I/II) project to create an online curriculum to educate medical students on the background, proper assessment, and treatment options for patients with alcohol misuse and use disorders. The product combines case studies and interactive learning to teach screening and assessment for alcohol misuse and proper treatment decision making to help patients who misuse alcohol. Phase I of this SBIR project: 1) developed a curriculum plan to cost-effectively prepare physicians-in-training with the knowledge and skills to effectively screen, assess, and intervene, 2) developed one module,  Alcohol Use, Misuse, and Patient Care  and 3) demonstrated (n=32) a significant increase in knowledge pre/post test, (plt0.001), and statistically significant increase in attitudes, self-efficacy, and intended behavior (plt0.05). Phase II is completing our computer-based training curriculum and already planned to utilize a remote Internet-chat based live Standardized Patient (SP) component to assess clinical skills related to alcohol use assessment. Our implementation mirrors the use of SPs in the Step 2 (CS) US Medical Licensure Exam (USMLE). The supplement requests funding to expand the Phase II project by creating and incorporating an additional educational component based around a novel, remote live Standardized Patient for training purposes. The SP experience will be the equivalent of an additional module for the curriculum, yielding a total of 8 modules. In the new module students will have the opportunity to rehearse the clinical skills presented in the other modules by using Internet chat with a remote live SP actor. Feedback regarding the student's performance will be provided using standardized measures based on typical OSCE exam checklists and Likert scales. Because the supplement enhances skills training, it significantly enhances the potential to deliver a cost-effective training experience to students throughout years 1 to 4 of any medical school. It also provides a stable and state of the art framework upon which course directors and clerkship directors can further build and refine patient assessment and care skills. The study, use of human subjects, and planned assessments remain unchanged in the original application. In keeping with ARRA, funds will be used to hire additional staff and pay consultants to add the module.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alcohol use, and especially abuse, continues to be a widespread public and social health problem. Approximately 6% of Americans suffer from alcohol abuse or dependence, while many more are at-risk for these disorders (SAMHSA 2005). However, addiction as a disease is not well understood since not all of us are equally liable to suffer from the diseases of addiction. Nonetheless the destructiveness of addiction is apparent to all. Misuse of alcohol is often overlooked by physicians, many of whom are not well prepared to adequately deal with patients who abuse alcohol. We chose to focus our educational materials on alcohol abuse and dependence because of the tremendous education potential of this topic. The topic can not only effect knowledge, attitude, confidence and understanding of addiction, but can also break stereotypes and teach a full range of doctoring from compassion to strict rule-following. There is much that a student can learn from this topic and apply to better the health of their patients.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Traumatic brain injury (TBI), principally as a result of impaction on the intact closed skull, occurs in vehicular incidents, falls, acts of violence, and sports accidents. TBI is the leading cause of death and disability in the United States, with an annual incidence rate of 1.5 million. Of these, 50,000 die acutely, over 230,000 are hospitalized, and 80,000 experience long term disability. TBI affects people of all ages with most survivors suffering chronic, life-long disabilities with varying degrees of dependence. Currently, there are no therapies to treat TBI that have been demonstrated to improve functional outcomes like memory performance, which if the patient survives, is the most important clinical characteristic of a successful therapy. The lack of therapeutic intervention for a public health issue of this magnitude constitutes a healthcare crisis. We have recently demonstrated that the addition of exogenous apolipoprotein-E, or peptides derived from apoE's receptor binding domain, can significantly reduce inflammatory responses in the brain and in the periphery. Mice given TBI and then treated with COG133 at 30 minutes following head injury exhibited faster recovery times and their performance on behavioral tests recovered to pre-injury levels, whereas the behavior of head-injured saline treated mice never returned to preinjury levels of performance. In Phase 1 we systematically modified the apoE 130-150 peptide compound and successfully defined the minimal and essential residues that retain binding and anti-inflammatory activities. These data support a model where COG 133 assumes the structure of an amphipathic alpha helix that appears to be required for anti-inflammatory activity. Going beyond Phase 1, we have created COG 1410, a significantly modified and improved compound as disclosed herein. In Phase 2, we propose to test the hypothesis that the 3- dimensional structure and resistance to specific proteolytic degradation will further enhance activity in TBI, blood brain barrier penetration and therapeutic window of selected derivatives of COG1410. These studies are necessary to acquire the pre-clinical pharmacology needed to declare a clinical lead for Phase 2B studies of pre-clinical toxicology to support an IND application and Phase 3 human clinical trial studies to support an NDA application with the FDA.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to create a sprayable surgical adhesive which would satisfy the surgical need for a strong, easy-to-use adhesive to adhere planar flaps of tissue. This novel adhesive will reduce fl\nuid accumulation after surgery by eliminating dead space in the wound and maintaining tissues in position for natural healing to occur. Seroma formation is among the most common post-surgical complications, occurring in up to 50% of certain surgical proced\nures. Traditional wound closure approaches such as sutures provide point-to-point fixation, which is inadequate to fully adhere planar surfaces. Surgeons need sprayable glue that can fully adhere planar flaps of tissue without requiring direct contact with\n the tissue. During the Company's Phase I SBIR project, Cohera successfully demonstrated the feasibility of developing a resorbable, sprayable adhesive, TissuGlu , as well as a functional prototype of the spray delivery device. Cohera proposes to test the \nhypothesis that its novel product will meet the FDA requirements for safety and efficacy, by demonstrating that it is biocompatible and effective at reducing fluid accumulation after surgery in both animal models and human clinical trials. During the propo\nsed Phase II SBIR project, we will achieve the following Specific Aims: 1) Finalize delivery device development. Primary goals include a) preparing custom molding designs for device components, b) establishing filling procedures for adhesive and mobilizing\n agent, c) manufacturing and assembling an initial run of 100 prototype devices, and d) initiating shelf life and stability testing of product in delivery device. 2) Complete pre-clinical testing for Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) submission to the\n FDA. Primary goals include a) completing specific physical and chemical characterization studies on adhesive product, b) completing biocompatibility and genotoxicity testing on adhesive product, and c) completing efficacy studies in an acceptable animal m\nodel. 3) Establish GMP manufacturing, packaging, and sterilization of adhesive. Primary goals include a) generating manufacturing protocols and batch release criteria, b) establishing sterilization protocols and packaging and labeling requirements, and c) \ncompleting pilot scale production batch for first human clinical trials. 4) Perform initial clinical study (feasibility phase) in human patients to support Pre-market Approval (PMA) submission.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II project will complete development of the SMART (Self-Monitoring and Review Tool) Log program for symptom management and health promotion in fibromyalgia (FM), and evaluate its efficacy in a large web-based\n trial that will closely emulate its planned application in Phase III. The SMART Log program is an interactive web-based self-monitoring and feedback intervention that employs proprietary statistical analysis procedures to give the individual user personal\nly optimized guidance on behavioral, lifestyle and coping strategies that yield effective symptom reduction. The program incorporates longitudinal collection and analysis of the individual's self-monitoring data followed by delivery of personalized feedbac\nk derived from those same personal data. The program helps FM sufferers discover and monitor linkages between specific personal health-related behaviors and management strategies and their symptom levels over time. Feasibility of this intervention was demo\nnstrated in Phase I by very high retention rates, ratings of satisfaction and perceived relevance, evidence of impact of utilization on improved well-being over the use period, and qualitative data indicating strong interest in continuation with the progra\nm. Specific aims for Phase II are as follows: Aim 1. Refine and optimize the SMARTLog program instruments based on the findings of Phase I. Aim 2. Develop a fully automated web site for administering the SMARTLog program. Aim 3. Conduct alpha testing of th\ne revised and automated program. Aim 4. Conduct a large trial (beta test) lasting nine months with a sample of at least 2000 FM subjects. Aim 5. Determine usability and satisfaction with the SMARTLog program. Aim 6. Determine the relationship between frequ\nency of utilization of the SMARTLog program and change over the utilization period in FM symptoms, functional quality of life, health self-efficacy, health locus of control, and health service utilization. Aim 7. Evaluate usage patterns to identify predict\nors and mediators of usage. The sample of subjects who participate in the study will be dichotomized into two comparison groups based on their frequency of utilization of the SMART Log program over the study period:  high utilizers  and  low utilizers.  Hy\npothesis: High utilizers will show significantly greater improvements over the use period in FM symptoms, functional quality of life, health self-efficacy and health locus of control than low utilizers. Plan for Phase III. Commercialization will employ a t\nhree-pronged revenue model. (1) Institutional sales will consist of licensed use as a disease management program by health advocacy web sites, health insurance companies, and large employers. (2) Subscription sales will be via individual patient subscripti\non for access over a public portal delivering the SMART Log program. (3) Advertising sales will support the public portal that delivers the program to subscribers. Our target population is the entire population of internet-using FM sufferers regardless of \ngeographic boundaries or limitations on personal mobility. The program will be initially made available in English, and other languages may be added later in Phase III. Innovation. This will be the first automated, web-based program to integrate longitudin\nal data collection about behavior, self-management strategies and symptom levels in FM with personal data-based feedback to guide symptom management and health promotion. The product will be potentially expandable for application with other health conditio\nns as well in Phase III. Fibromyalgia is a complex chronic illness affecting 6-12 million Americans. Self-management strategies play a key role in reducing symptoms and maintaining functioning. Public Health Relevance: The proposed project offers a web-bas\ned self- management tool that enables FM sufferers to identify significant linkages between their personal symptom levels and their personal self-management",

        "abstract": "This program exceeded all key milestones. Using cellulose Waste, CMS demonstrated novel ethanol drying membranes via small scale dephlegmation process that yields fuel grade ethanol (FGE) at a lower cost than large switch grass ethanol plants. This success yields positive value for cellulose waste. We achieved targeted EPA goals of developing low cost environmentally friendly systems to enhance recovery of waste streams. In addition to this success we have lined up key partners for both the fabrication of membrane systems as well as field testing in related applications.\n\nIn Phase I, we fabricated chemically resistant hollow fiber (HF) membrane modules that had desired chemical resistance and transport properties consistent with the goals associated with the final ethanol drying step in small scale manufacturing processes. There was success with flat sheet systems for ethanol-water separation and though HF and flat sheet systems provided excellent performance results, HF is preferred in Phase II. This is because of excellent relationships with commercial partners combined with associated better design and cost features. Using the HF membranes prepared in the earlier tasks, we evaluated these materials specifically under conditions consistent with small scale ethanol manufacturing sites for both liquid phase and vapor phase separation of water from ethanol. We obtained excellent flux and separation. This included very high water transport rates and very high water-ethanol separations factors. This excellent flux and separation in combination with stability was demonstrated over a wide range of operating conditions.\n\nLong term testing showed the membranes had excellent stability. This is consistent with parallel result, and also consistent with the chemistry of the CMS materials. Reviewers had concerns related to CMS membrane water/ethanol selectivity but tests in Phase I showed excellent water/ethanol separation which likely related to the unique chemistry of the CMS membranes.\n\nWe took lab results and put them into the small scale membrane module/dephelmation system published by Leland Vane from the EPA and comparing to published results from the Department of Energy on FGE costs. We demonstrated CMS membrane drying costs were actually less than large scale molecular sieve driers. Most important results showed that waste stream cellulose stream actually had significant positive value ($16-$18/ton).\n\nPhase II will build and evaluate pilot system. Fortunately we have established a number of key relationships with membrane suppliers, ethanol engineering design firms and the EPA test sites. This positions CMS well for both Phase II success and subsequent commercialization.",

        "abstract": "Many refinery product streams, particularly those from Ultra Low Hydrodesulfurisation units, are prone to haze due to water emulsions.  Haze is also problematic for biodiesel production, as hazy fuel cannot be used until the haze settles or is removed, which creates costly scheduling and shipping delays.  This project will develop a novel membrane process for the removal of dissolved and dispersed water from fuels in real time.  In Phase I, the membrane was developed and feasibility was demonstrated on multiple fuels.  An economic evaluation showed that the cost of dewatering with the membranes would be very attractive.  Phase II will involve the fabrication of both a small scale (e.g., 1-5 ft2) laboratory prototype and a large commercial size unit (e.g., 50 ft2).  Based on the Phase I study, the long term performance of the membrane modules (both the laboratory and field unit) will be enhanced, and performance over a four-year lifetime will be demonstrated.  Dewatering tests will be conducted both at the laboratory and in conjunction with industry partners at an existing field site.  With the data collected, detailed engineering and economic evaluations will be conducted, and a comparison will be made with alternative non-membrane dehydrating processes.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The membrane technology should have a large impact on a number of areas of interest to the Department of Energy.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this Compact Membrane Systems (CMS) program is to develop a new platform technology for fire suppression and fire prevention systems around membrane supplied nitrogen enriched air (NEA). The limitation \nthat the atmospheres used in the fire suppression be breathable to occupants in the proximity of a fire is easily accomplished by CMS technology. A breathable atmosphere, between 10% and 16% oxygen, is maintained so occupants can safely remove themselves o\nr be rescued; even while starving the fire of oxygen, breathable levels are maintained. CMS proposes the combination with another safe, effective, environmentally friendly means of fire suppression in the form of water mist. The synergistic combination of \nthese fire suppression technologies can address virtually all the shortcomings of current fire suppression technologies. CMS membranes are uniquely suited to production of breathable atmospheres, and have 10 to 100 times greater flux than the membranes emp\nloyed in creating oxygen deficient atmospheres typically employed in inerting, leading to proportionally smaller, more compact and even portable devices. They can be operated at lower pressures than required to optimize the performance of the membranes. CM\nS membranes have only modest selectivity for oxygen over nitrogen permeation in comparison to nitrogen generating membranes. This prevents the membrane from producing atmospheres containing less than 10% oxygen where deleterious physiological effects are e\nxpected. An inherent safe auto-regulation feature for the CMS system is not dependent upon the need for complex, reliable analytical and control schemes. The CMS approach seeks environmentally friendly systems. Water sprinkler and deluge systems are the mo\nst widely used fire suppression systems, but their use can incur irreparable damage or substantial repair expenses associated with flooding and water damage. Halon systems used to protect electrical equipment, aircraft, ships, and restaurants are being rep\nlaced due to their adverse environmental impact. Nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and inert gases are effective in controlling flammable mixtures and in suppressing fires but their asphyxiant nature limits use to uninhabited areas. CMS proposes a breathable NEA a\ntmosphere having a composition within the Unimpaired Physiological Performance Zone employed for fire suppression with minimal concerns for occupant asphyxiation. Phase I met all key objectives including: 1) production of target NEA levels, 2) demonstrated\n CMS membrane operation well in excess of water mist nozzle operating pressure requirements, 3) easy integration and demonstration of the NEA/water mist system, and 4) demonstrated fire extinction while operating in breathable environment. The Phase II pro\ngram will: 1) quantify the effectiveness of the NEA+mist combination, 2) optimize system, 3) design and construct a mockup of a fire suppressant delivery system, 4) demonstrate the apparatus under certification protocols suited to the target niche, and 5) \nposition the technology and equipment for commercialization. Additional resources that are available now which were not available earlier include a) commercialization in parallel markets which will sell minimums of 2000-5000 systems in 2008/2009 further en\nhancing our market ability in 2010 and beyond, and b) strong targeted interest by a large market oriented membrane company. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE A breathable NEA atmosphere having a composition within the Unimpaired Physiological Performance Zone can be\n employed for fire suppression with no or minimal concerns for occupant asphyxiation. This fire suppression technique can be readily employed in hospital and nursing home rooms. As the technology is developed, it could be used to virtually replace any wate\nr deluge system or Halon system.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  DNA microarray studies, largely sponsored by the NIH and other granting agencies, have generated a wealth of data uncovering the complex gene expression patterns of cancer. Currently however, there is no unifying organizational or bioinformatics resource to integrate the myriad independent observations into a single, global, computable environment. Such a resource would not only provide wide access to data from individual studies, but would also provide an opportunity to apply advanced analysis techniques to the aggregated data. In the absence of such a resource, the majority of cancer molecular profiling data remains severely under-utilized by both the academic cancer research community, and by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who could utilize this data to aid in their efforts to develop new biomarkers and therapies. We propose to develop a commercial-scale solution for cancer molecular profiling research to address this problem. The solution builds upon the prototype of Oncomine developed at the University of Michigan, which utilizes a data pipeline, a data warehouse, an analysis engine, and a web interface to deliver human cancer genomic data in an intuitive platform to scientists and clinicians. The specific aims in Phase I of this proposal are to: 1. Modify the Academic Data Pipeline to Support Commercial Operations. 2. Re-host and re-structure the Oncomine Database. 3. Develop a commercial technical operating model for the Oncomine Web Application. In Phase II of this proposal we will: 1. Develop a controlled cancer genomics data pipeline to support the rapid and proactive collection, standardization and analysis of heterogeneous cancer genomics data from repositories, academic laboratories and pharmaceutical companies. 2. Develop a scalable and secure cancer genomics data warehouse to support the storage and retrieval of public and proprietary data. 3. Develop an optimized user interface to support cancer drug discovery and development. The result of this work will be a fully integrated, end-to-end platform for providing publicly funded research results to the commercial sector, with a goal of utilizing that data to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for treating cancer. The Oncomine prototype is already broadly accepted in academia, and has been verified as a research tool with high utility by over 10,000+ non-profit users. Since 2006 Compendia has worked to establish the commercial merit of Oncomine; as a result, tens of thousands of valuable high-throughput experiments are now being utilized by several of the world's top pharmaceutical companies. However, additional funding is required to transition Oncomine from an academic tool to a commercial platform, and to realize the full commercial potential of this approach to advance research and save lives.Cancer is a leading cause of mortality, and is responsible for one in every four deaths in the United States. In recent years global gene expression technologies have generated important new information about the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer by revealing specific aberrations in genes, proteins, and signaling pathways. This proposal seeks funding to provide a platform for aggregating, analyzing, and presenting this genomic data to drug development companies, with a goal of optimizing the clinical usefulness of cancer genomic data for drug discovery and development.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A 1999 National Health and Social Life Survey published in the Journal of the American Medical Association indicated that 43% of American women experience problems with reproductive reactivity in the course of their liv\nes. Despite the fact that significantly more women than men are afflicted with such disorders, there are comparatively few diagnostic and treatment options for women. A reason for this discrepancy is the difficulty of defining and measuring female disorder\ns. Similar to erectile dysfunction, these disorders can exist as an isolated physical impairment or as a co-morbidity of diabetes, heart disease, or hypertension. In addition, they can occur as a normal part of menopause and post-partum, or arise as a cons\nequence of abuse, as a symptom of depression or anxiety, or as a side effect from the various medications treating these conditions. There is an unmet need in research, pharmaceutical trials, and clinical practice for instruments to measure physiological e\nvents associated with reproductive reactivity. This is a fundamental shortcoming since reproductive reactivity is characterized by a complex interplay of physiological processes. Different disorders can be expressed as anomalies that occur in one physiolog\nical indicator but not another, or in several indicators that overlap in time. Current methods remain heavily dependent on patient self-assessment and reporting, and the private nature of these disorders further hinders the collection of reliable and repea\ntable data. The few options for collecting physiological response are (1) of limited functionality, (2) not usable during many types of regular functioning, and (3) must be used in a clinical setting. Because of these limitations, there is a lack of good n\normative data. Corpora Systems aims to develop and test a product that will begin to address these three deficits and become a standard tool for research and pharmaceutical trials, with the potential for use in diagnosis and charting of treatment progress.\n Clinical trials of the prototype developed in Phase I successfully demonstrated its fundamental efficacy. In Phase II, the instrument will be developed further to prepare for commercial production. Clinical trials will be performed to validate the measure\nd factors.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE     Approximately 50 million women in America are afflicted with sexual problems at some point in their lives, and these conditions are still poorly understood. The proposed instrument will significantly advance r\nesearch and potential treatments for Female Sexual Disorders (FSD) by greatly improving measurement of physiological responses associated with sexual function. The instrument will thus have significant impact on the quality of life of millions of women by \nproviding the foundation for improved diagnostic and treatment methods.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This Phase II SBIR project proposes to develop an electrical stimulation augmented exercise device for individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI).  The device will provide a closed-chain, load bearing lower \nextremity exercise that has the potential to condition muscles and reverse or slow the rate of loss of bone mineral density.  Users will be encouraged to voluntarily perform the exercise.  Client volitional efforts will be augmented by electrical stimulati\non and a servomotor drive such that the prescribed exercise range of motion is fulfilled with each movement cycle.  The adaptive stimulation controller will continuously adjust the stimulation profile based on movement errors and servomotor activity to pro\nvide only the stimulation that is necessary to complete the exercise while encouraging clients to contribute their best volitional effort on each exercise cycle.  A visual feedback infrastructure will be developed that encourages client participation, emph\nasizes clinically relevant therapeutic exercise goals, and rewards client achievements.  The visual environment will require clients to generate a series of appropriately timed and executed volitional trigger events (ranging from 'trace levels of applied f\norce' to 'unassisted movements') which will be rewarded with a full range of motion movement cycle and success in a game.  We hypothesize that long-term use of the device in a comprehensive motor rehabilitation program may lead to functional improvements i\nn addition to the localized and systemic benefits of exercise.  Phase I feasibility milestones were achieved, including demonstration that: 1) client volitional effort could be synchronized with the stimulation controller; 2) functional stimulation levels \ncould be well tolerated in this population where cutaneous sensation is in-tact (potentially hypersensitive); and 3) the stimulation controller could accommodate client volitional effort and generate only the stimulation that was needed to elicit the desir\ned exercise movement.  We propose to build upon Phase I results through the following Phase II aims: 1) develop a servomotor drive that will improve exercise quality, provide a wider range and better control of bodyweight loading, allow use by individuals \nwith advanced osteoporosis who are most in need of the exercise, and accomplish the goal of coordinating volitional and stimulation-augmented efforts via haptic feedback rather than a real-time visual display; 2) develop intellectually engaging visual disp\nlay environments that encourage and reward clinically relevant client volitional efforts; and 3) improve reliability and manufacturability.  We will demonstrate efficacy via a two-site clinical trial in which twenty (20) individuals with chronic incomplete\n spinal cord injury participate in a 12-week exercise paradigm using the device. Outcome measures will include assessment of functional improvements (i.e., FIM, gait analysis) and a dynamometer test to assess improvements in volitional control independent \nof exercise-related improvements in torque generating capability. The target market for the device is clinics who serve individuals with neuromotor disabilities such as incomplete SCI, traumatic brain injury, or stroke.  The device will be competitively pr\niced within the electrical stimulation-based exercise equipment market.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVENCE: The proposed work may benefit public health through development of a clinically viable, electrical stimulation based therapeutic exercise device for use in mo\ntor rehabilitation following spinal cord injury or stroke. Compared to existing devices and techniques, the adaptively controlled electrical stimulation, servomotor assist, and video game components and tight integration of instrumentation, control, stimul\nation, visualization, and reporting features may improve efficacy and availability of the therapeutic intervention for many affected individuals.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recovery of quadriceps muscle force following post-surgical knee immobilization is a significant therapeutic aim which is associated with quality of gait and the ability to perform activities of daily living. Several studies from various research groups have shown that neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), used in conjunction with a comprehensive post-surgical rehabilitation program, is a safe and highly effective method for achieving quadriceps strengthening. The most profound results have been demonstrated with use of high intensity NMES technique in which a few very strong isometric contractions of the quadriceps muscle were performed several times per week during a physical therapy session in which the patient was seated on a biomechanical dynamometer. Efficacy of this technique has been demonstrated for individuals undergoing rehabilitation following surgical reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACLR); however, widespread clinical acceptance of the technique has been limited. We assert that this high intensity electrical stimulation technique would be more widely practiced: 1) if a low cost, practical, cohesive system were available to replace costly and loosely connected research-based apparatus, and 2) if the system involved an NMES unit that controlled stimulation automatically using an outcome-based paradigm that did not require incessant involvement of the therapist. We propose a novel rehabilitation system indicated for quadriceps strengthening during post-surgical knee immobilization in which the knee joint will be stabilized using an instrumented post-surgical knee brace and stimulation is delivered by a high output, portable NMES unit with autonomous, adaptive stimulation control capabilities. The target markets for this device would be clinics who serve patients undergoing rehabilitation following ACLR or total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The target price for the system will be $4000. The goals of this FastTrack SBIR project are therefore to demonstrate feasibility of the adaptive stimulation control approach in Phase I using laboratory-based apparatus. We will interface our adaptive stimulator to the KinCom dynamometer and show that the stimulator can elicit a contraction of sufficient strength that function outcomes could be expected, and demonstrate that the adaptive controller can develop appropriate stimulation patterns for use in this low-cycle count application. The Phase II goals will be: 1) to develop an instrumented knee brace capable of stabilizing the knee during near maximal isometric contractions and obtaining measurements of the resulting torque; 2) to implement a rapid training version of our adaptive stimulation controller that is suited for use in this low cycle count application; 3) to implement an alternate fundamental stimulation waveform that may be more comfortable to some users; and 4) to demonstrate efficacy of the proposed system for quadriceps strengthening following ACLR or TKA. / Relevance The proposed work may benefit public health through development of an electrical stimulation exercise device indicated for quadriceps strengthening during post-surgical immobilization following surgical repair of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACLR) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Quadriceps strengthening has been shown to improve gait and improve performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). There are approximately 100,000 ACLR and 400,000 TKA surgeries per year in the United States.",

Standardized skills and criteria by which counselors are measured for credentialing now exist. However, the technique\ns and training methods used to increase the counselors' skills, knowledge, and attitudes have been inconsistent. This is apparent throughout all levels of professional development, especially in preparing counselors to become clinical supervisors. For this\n Phase II application, Danya will outline plans to develop the Clinical Supervision Training Program (CSTP) to address the need for more consistent techniques and training methods for clinical supervisors. Danya hopes that this program will meet that need \nand become the national standard for clinical supervision training in addiction treatment counseling. Other objectives of the program are to increase clinical supervision skills and knowledge among senior clinical addiction treatment staff; provide a mecha\nnism for participants to qualify for Certified Clinical Supervisor (CCS) credentialing established by the International Certification and Reciprocity Consortium (ICRC) and obtain addiction counselor continuing education units; increase learning, skills acq\nuisition, and adoption of new knowledge regarding clinical supervision using the three primary learning styles (visual, auditory, and kinesthetic); and increase opportunities for professional mentorship, clinical competency, and professional growth. In Pha\nse I of this project, Danya developed, produced, and evaluated a 20-module clinical supervision training curriculum. A Trainer's Guide, Participant's Guide, and PowerPoint slide presentation was created for 19 of 20 modules. The 20th module was programmed \nto be completed independently by course participants in an online format. A course Web site and participant discussion forum were developed to support the online module. For Phase II, Danya proposes to accomplish the following tasks: (1) transform all cont\nent into professionally developed commercial products; (2) program the remainder of online training modules; (3) further develop the Web site with the discussion forum; (4) develop a Web-based, computer-simulated interactive training tool; (5) develop a tr\nain-the-trainer curriculum; (6) convene an Expert Advisory Panel review of products; and (7) conduct evaluations of the train-the-trainer event, interactive training tool, and the 5-day training curriculum.

(DRW) aims to market a high-performance duplex rapid test (DRW HIV-Ab/HBsAg Duplex Rapid Test), called DRW HIV-HBV Duplex, wh\nich can simultaneously detect antibodies to HIV (HIV-Ab) for diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) for diagnosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The test will be useful as a diagnostic test \nin the United States and Europe, and as a pre- and post-donation screening test in blood banks in developing countries especially those that process less than 10,000 donations per year and are located in regions of high prevalence for HBV and/or HIV. This \nsimple and inexpensive but highly sensitive duplex rapid test was developed by DRW with funding from the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The project is a competing renewal application that propo\nses to conduct pre-clinical and clinical studies on the DRW HIV-HBV Duplex with the ultimate aim of meeting the requirements for pre- market approval (PMA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Pre-clinical studies to evaluate test performance for HBs\nAg detection will be based on FDA's 1)  Review criteria for assessment of HBeAg and antibody to HBeAg in vitro diagnostic devices  (FDA 1991) for the performance evaluation on HBsAg detection; and 2)  Guidance for Industry-Adequate and Appropriate Donor Sc\nreening Tests for Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) Assays Used to Test Donors of Whole Blood and Blood Components, Including Source Plasma and Source Leukocytes  (FDA 2007). For evaluating the test performance on HIV-Ab detection, we will f\nollow FDA's draft guidance of  Points to Consider in the Manufacture and Clinical Evaluation of In Vitro Tests to Detect Antibodies  (FDA 1989). Results of the pre-clinical studies will be presented to the FDA for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) \napplication that, when approved, will allow the development of DRW HIV-HBV Duplex to proceed to clinical studies. The clinical studies aimed at a PMA submission to the FDA will be carried out at four sites in the U.S. and one site in Italy. Because of the \nusefulness of the DRW HIV-HBV Duplex for pre- and post-donation screening in resource-limited settings, additional evaluations will be conducted in China and Guinea. FDA approval of the DRW HIV-HBV Duplex will allow the use of a new and useful diagnostic t\nest in the U.S., but will also demonstrate the principle that tests used in developing countries should be of the same high quality as those used in developed countries. Confidential information: patent application in process Principal Investigator: Lee, H\nelen H Confidential information: patent application in process PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinical studies of the DRW HIV-HBV Duplex Rapid Test will make FDA approval possible, and hence availability of the test to the US market, where it will be useful in s\nettings where a rapid and immediate test result is needed, such as emergency rooms, in the battlefield, or for healthcare workers immediately after needle stick injury. The test will also be useful in developing countries where ensuring the safety of the b\nlood supply requires the availability of cheap, effective assays that do not rely on sophisticated equipment.

The majority of foot ulcers in diabetic patients are the result of loss of protective sensation (LOPS) secondary to neuropathy that permits unperceived injury. Since neuropathy cannot presently be reversed, protecting\n the foot with LOPS from injury is the next best strategy, and footwear has long been considered to be the most important approach to primary and secondary foot ulcer prevention. Not surprisingly most neuropathic ulcers are plantar, occurring at points of \nhigh plantar loading, so that insoles that redistribute load and therefore reduce pressure should reduce plantar ulcer rates and therefore amputation risk. However, a problem in this field had been that clear algorithms to reliably and reproducibly design \nand manufacture insoles that off-load highly loaded sites on the plantar surface had not been developed and validated. Under the Phase I and II SBIR funding (R44 DK59074) DIApedia LLC has now completed the development of the TrueContour  insole that accomp\nlishes this goal and, for the first time, incorporates both the shape of the foot as well as the walking plantar pressure pattern into the design rules. In a recent clinical trial, TrueContour  insoles have been shown to predictably reduce plantar pressure\n at forefoot sites by 21- 36% and force-time integral by 40% and 34% (both P lt 0.0001) compared to prior industry standard insoles based on shape only. TrueContour  insoles are also often better than iteratively produced highly customized insoles produced\n by expert clinicians. In this proposed randomized controlled blinded clinical trial we will now test the clinical efficacy of TrueContour  insoles in preventing foot ulcer recurrence in patients with previous and now healed plantar neuropathic foot ulcers\n. This will be a three-year multi-center trial with rolling enrolment and 15 months of follow up for each patient. Recurrence rates of 10-60% within the first year have been reported in the literature for patients with a prior plantar ulcer. 286 patients w\nith LOPS and a plantar ulcer healed within the last three months will be randomized to receive TrueContour  insoles or current standard of care insoles. In-shoe plantar pressure will be measured after a two-week  break in' to document the enhanced off-load\ning efficacy of the TrueContour  insoles. Shoe use during the 15 month period will be monitored by a novel shoe-mounted step sensor. Patients will be blinded to condition   all insoles will be supplied from central fabrication facilities without identifica\ntion. End-points will be assessed from photographs by an Ulcer Adjudication Panel blinded to the treatment assignment. This study will clarify whether or not footwear that reliably reduces plantar pressure at sites of prior ulceration also reduces the risk\n for ulcer recurrence. In addition, a positive result will further our effort to bring this product to a wider market. It will also provide the information needed to petition CMS for new codes for this new generation of quantitatively designed therapeutic \ninsoles. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE.  Diabetes is responsible for most of the amputations in the US that are not caused by accidents. Most such amputations start with a foot ulcer that the person cannot feel, because of nerve damage that can develop due to di\nabetes in some people. Well fitting shoes with insoles that cushion the bottom of feet should protect diabetic patients with nerve damage, and prevent ulcers and amputations. While many shoes and insoles are sold for this purpose, there have not until now \nbeen precise rules for how such insoles should be made. DIApedia LLC has for the first time developed such rules, based on the patient's foot shape and for the",

        "abstract": "Volatile natural gas prices are negatively impacting the U.S. industrial sector, which consumes approximately 6.6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas annually.  Over the last 24 months, natural gas prices have fluctuated between $5 and $12 per MMBtu, resulting in high and unpredictable fuel costs for the industrial sector.  With abundant coal resources, an opportunity exists for the U.S. industrial sector to transition from high-cost natural gas to coal gasification as a source of fuel for process heating applications.  However, practical issues such as scalability, economics, feedstock flexibility, and syngas quality must be addressed in order to make this transition feasible.  This project will demonstrate the commercial viability of HydroMax technology, a breakthrough, high-temperature, feedstock-flexible, molten-metal gasification approach.  In Phase I, two 6.125\u00bf internal-diameter HydroMax test reactors were designed, built, and successfully operated using Illinois #6 and Powder River Basin coal types to demonstrate feedstock flexibility.  A detailed economic analysis conducted during Phase I revealed that HydroMax can produce syngas economically at a price of $6.65 per MMBtu, much less than the current natural gas price of ~$9 per MMBtu.  Phase II will focus on the design, construction, operation, and test of a 0.5 meter, self-heated, HydroMax system that will gasify coal and coal/biomass blends.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  An estimated 12,000 industrial operations in the U.S. could benefit from the HydroMax technology; including wallboard/glass manufacturers, pulp and paper mills, and other industrial companies that require process heat.  As a result of reducing fuel gas costs, U.S. industry would become more competitive in the global marketplace, jobs would be created, and the American public would benefit from lower product prices.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II research develops methods to improve the manufacture of recombinant protein products produced in foreign hosts.  Cost-effective production of proteins generally utilizes organisms that are well-suited for protein engineering and large-scale production.  Establishing a suitable production system for a protein is often a time-consuming, trial-and-error-based process and can be a significant barrier for the commercialization of a protein.  In cases where production systems are found, they are often far from optimized due to the time and cost required as well as our current limited understanding of the critical parameters. In Phase I several gene design variables were assessed for their importance to protein expression in the bacterium Escherichia coli, a commonly used production organism.  Data suggested novel means for gene optimization that were unexpected from conventional wisdom.  In Phase II relevant gene design variables suggested by Phase I will be explored toward development of a refined model of the relationship of gene design to protein expression in E. coli as well as in other useful production organisms.  The broader impacts of this research are improved manufacturing techniques for recombinant protein based products.  Protein products constitute a currently >$40 billion and rapidly growing world-wide market including industrial enzymes, diagnostic enzymes and protein pharmaceuticals. The tools developed from this project will drastically improve the speed, reduce the cost, and remove the uncertainties\nof modern protein manufacturing, which significantly limit this market.  Improved production will also accelerate the study of proteins with therapeutic or otherwise marketable potential, expanding the field of candidate proteins for commercialization.",

However, THz science and technology have been underdeveloped because of the unavailability of effective and affordable THz sources.  The few THz facilities currently available are based on free electron lasers (FELs), which are too bulky, expensive, and inefficient to serve as commercial sources.  This project will design, build, and test a compact, pulsed THz source \u00bf a Cherenkov radiator comprising a capillary dielectric tube driven by an over-focused electron beam from a low-energy laser-driven photoinjector \u00bf that can deliver at least 100 kW peak power.  The photoelectrons are produced from a metal cathode illuminated with a sub-picosecond laser.  In Phase I, feasibility was demonstrated for the transport of an over-focused, low-loss, electron beam of 0.15 MA/cm2 of peak current density and a few MeV of energy.  Microjoule levels of radiated THz energy were produced using a pulsed DC or RF gun and a capillary tube.  In Phase II, the development of the THz source will be completed.

Until now all commercial mammography systems have utilized integrating film or detectors. By combining a high-sensitivity detector material, mercuric iodide, with newly available CMOS technology\n photon-counting readouts, we expect to be able to achieve a significant breakthrough in x-ray detector performance. With the new technology we can realize improvement in the signal to noise ratio by essentially removing the dark current and readout circui\ntry noise from the signal. These factors are the specific limiting factors that determine the sensitivity of integrating mode detectors. Photon counting will reduce the dose delivered and improve the system throughput without compromising image quality. Th\nis is important in digital mammography screening due to the large number of healthy patients who are examined. We have reduced the technological risk of the Phase II work by our accomplishments during the Phase I work: We fabricated large area (10 cm x 10 \ncm) imaging charge-integrating CMOS readout chips which are chemically compatible with mercuric iodide, adapted our mercuric iodide film growth process for use with these chips, and created and tested HgI2/CMOS x-ray imagers. We also designed and manufactu\nred specialized photon-counting ASICs for x-ray imaging applications. During Phase II we will adapt the ASIC design and implement it in the mercuric-iodide-compatible CMOS chips to produce a high-sensitivity photon-counting x-ray imager. We will take advan\ntage of our design experience and newly-developed CMOS readout technology, allowing us to place a charge-sensitive preamplifier, shaping amplifier, dual discriminators, and digital event counter for each pixel in the array, all within each pixel's geometri\nc area. Performance testing of detector panel prototypes will be performed at both DxRay and the University of California, Davis, Medical Center.

The construction of this system will create a new molecular imaging tool for researchers performing stem cell and cancer research. Stem cell research holds great promise for the development of cellular therapies for the treatment of disease and the development of cell tracking methods is therefore extremely significant. Several important scientific and technological innovations developed by our team of investigators at DxRay Inc. (Northridge, CA) and the University of California Irvine (UCI) allow the creation of a novel combined XCT and FT system. This project produces a unique dual-modality imaging methodology that combines functional and anatomical information and provides a new approach to molecular imaging. At the completion of the proposed project the combined XCT and FT system will add unique imaging capabilities to the animal imaging facilities at UCI. Furthermore, the innovative XCT technology developed by DxRay and the novel FT technology developed by UCI will be commercialized with support from Gamma Medica Ideas (Northridge, CA) who are very interested in this development and are providing a gantry for the combined system. Cellular therapeutics show great promise for the treatment of many diseases, but unfortunately few non-invasive techniques exist for tracking the cells after administration. The ability to non-invasively monitor cell trafficking in-vivo longitudinally is a pressing need for emerging cellular therapeutic strategies since this could be used to assess response. In-vivo tracking of cells has a broad range of potential applications in various diseases covering the fields of neurology, oncology, and cardiology. Therefore, to address the need for new multi-modality molecular imaging technologies, that are capable of the non-invasive in-vivo longitudinal imaging of mice for cell tracking, we propose to build the first of its kind combined XCT and FT system. The development of this very promising new technology, the first to combine FT with anatomical information from XCT in a relatively inexpensive and easy to use system, will create a powerful new tool for stem cell research and targeted drug delivery studies. We are developing novel in-vivo combined x-ray computed tomography (XCT) and fluorescence tomography (FT) system. This new technology will create a new type of dual-modality molecular imaging.

This new technology will deliver significant improvements in diagnostic capabilities compared with the technology currently used by all major CT manufacturers. The currently commercially-available CT systems ty\npically use a detector having silicon (p-n junction) photodiodes that are optically coupled to a scintillator which is operated in a current-integrating mode where the signals generated from the x-rays are integrated in each pixel over a time before the in\ntegrated charge is read out. The use of these current-mode detectors results in generally poorer image quality than could be achieved by using the technology proposed in the product presented here. Instead of integrating the x-ray current over an exposure \ntime, high-throughput photon counting is used to measure and count each x-ray individually over a similar period. High throughput is necessary as a very large x-ray flux is utilized in many CT applications. For example, CT scanners can produce ~100 Mphoton\ns/mm2/s in the unattenuated beam. The large flux is required to collect sufficient photon statistics in the measurement of the transmitted flux (the attenuated beam) during the very short time frame of a CT scan. This high count rate combined with a need f\nor high detection efficiency required the development in the Phase I of detector structures that provide a response signal much faster than the transit time of carriers over the whole detector thickness. We will continue the development of detector modules\n with the necessary capabilities to replace existing CT detector technology and provide new features: counting (and analysis) of each individual x-ray, binning events according to x-ray energies, and spectroscopic x-ray imaging capabilities. These new feat\nures lead to: significantly reduced x-ray dose to the patient, compositional analysis of tissue through spectroscopic x-ray imaging, and potentially significant improvement in overall image quality.

Based on preliminary numerical and experimental work at various laboratories, it has been proposed that strategies such as inserting a cloud of small gas bubbles or a gas layer in the mercury target could absorb and deflect the shock waves and protect the walls from cavitation erosion.  Another strategy involves the reduction of cavitation through new designs that take advantage of wall shaping and deformation, and energy absorption.  In order to aid the design of such cavitation-mitigation schemes, this project will develop an advanced numerical software package, which couples multiscale, multiphase compressible fluid solvers with structure dynamics solvers.  This code will be capable of simulating the relevant features of the flow, namely shock wave propagation through bubbly media, large liquid/gas interface deformations, shock wave induced cavitation, and deformation of structures due to shock wave and cavitation/structure interactions.  In Phase I, multiphase codes adapted to study this problem were able to capture high pressure wave propagation in bubbly media, along with the interaction of the wave with the bubbles, free surface, and the wall structures.  The potential success of different cavitation mitigation measures (including wall shape design, insertion of an air layer, and the generation of a bubbly medium) was demonstrated.  Phase II will involve further improvements to the software package, including a generalization of interface capturing schemes for broader multiphase/material flows, a multiscale cavitation model for bubbly media, and a structure code for simulation of full fluid/structure interaction.  The software package will then be validated by using existing and conducting benchmark experiments in SNS mercury test loops.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In addition to the SNS application, the software package should have application to multiple fields:  (1) naval applications, where the mitigation of shock wave impact is of keen interest to vessel protection and to propeller blade design; (2) chemical processes, to improve performance of bubble column reactors and multiphase slurries; and (3) minimally invasive medical procedures that use acoustic cavitation-based treatments such as shock wave lithotripsy.",

Based on preliminary numerical and experimental work at various laboratories, it has been proposed that a cloud of small gas bubbles in the mercury target could absorb and deflect the shock waves and protect the walls from cavitation erosion.  In order to maximize effectiveness, a bubble generator would have to produce a relatively large quantity (order of 1% void fraction) of micron sized bubbles.  A method for generating a large quantity of tiny bubbles is to combine a classical bubble generation scheme, based on gas injection from nozzles, with a technique for screening unwanted large-size bubbles with a fine mesh.  The liquid entrained by the gas injection contributes to a two-phase mixture impacting on the mesh.  This two-phase bubble generator could be made more efficient by adding side liquid jets to apply a localized shearing force at the gas nozzle.  In this project, this two-phase flow bubble generator will be further developed, adapted to large flow rate, characterized for the SNS mercury application, and scaled up for application in the SNS target.  Phase I examined the physics of operation of simple, small-scale, two-phase-flow bubble generators.  Techniques to test and analyze bubbles in mercury were developed, and the bubble generator was adapted to mercury applications and characterized.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this proposed research is to develop a simple, inexpensive point-of-care device that will perform absolute and percent CD4+ T cell counts from whole blood. This will be accomplished by adaptin\ng and testing a novel  hybrid  approach to microfluidic sample preparation and analysis. One-time use thin-film laminated microfluidic cassettes will collect, count, and store the blood sample while the required cocktail reagents will be stored and injecte\nd into the cassettes from a bench-top unit. The integrated system will perform a total white blood cell count, absolute CD4+ T cell count, and percent CD4 count using a new volumetric combination electric impedance/fluorescence sensor contained on a dispos\nable microfluidic cassette. Toward this objective, Phase II will expand on our Phase I effort and focus on system optimization and validation. Aim one will optimize the microfluidic cassette design and CD4 blood labeling protocol for automated, on-card CD4\n+ T cell counting. Aim two will focus on fabrication and testing of the integrated bench-top system. Aim three will test and validate the completed CD4 enumeration system, using both modified commercially available normal human whole blood and clinical sam\nples from HIV+ patients, and begin the bench-top studies required to obtain FDA clearance for a Class II medical device. The resulting device, when fully validated and evaluated in the proposed scenarios of use, will be simple, robust, and unique in that i\nt provides a fully quantitative CD4+ T cell analysis with an instrument costing less than  1000. This is many times below the cost of established flow cytometry devices. Reagent and disposable costs will also be lower than that of any currently available d\nevice with per-test total costs of less than  1.50. The tool will find immediate application in all levels of the public health care system, particularly in resource-poor areas and developing countries, for monitoring persons with human immunodeficiency vi\nrus (HIV), formulating differential diagnoses, and making therapeutic decisions regarding anti-retroviral drug treatment regimes, including the highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) approach. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The successful completion of an \ninexpensive, portable CD4 counter would constitute a significant breakthrough in HIV monitoring and treatment by offering healthcare providers a less expensive, mobile platform to conduct the most common CD4 diagnostic test currently performed in the world\n. Such a breakthrough will dramatically improve testing efficiencies with its single-use, disposable test cartridges and will make it possible to rapidly test patients at bedside, in remote locations, or in areas with limited healthcare resources. Finally,\n this new point-of-care system could significantly reduce current CD4 equipment and per-test costs, thereby resulting in millions of dollars saved in the US healthcare and insurance industries, with even greater worldwide healthcare impacts in developing c\nountries.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to design and build a new hearing aid system, which mitigates the most common complaints that hearing aid users have. The most frequently cited complaints include difficulty understanding speech in multi-tal\nker situations, poor sound quality, dislike of the sound of their amplified voice, and unwanted whistling sounds caused by acoustic feedback. Current efforts, with limited success, use signal processing methods rather than restoring more closely the normal\n auditory function. There are three key features needed to make this hearing aid a reality that differentiate it from conventional hearing aids. The first is to replace the current acoustic transducer with a non-acoustic mechanical output transducer that d\nirectly actuates the tympanic membrane. This transducer, called the EarLens, floats on the tympanic membrane in a manner similar to the way a contract lens floats on the eye. The second is to increase the output bandwidth of the hearing aid. The third is t\no place a wide-bandwidth microphone in the ear canal to capture the pinna diffraction cues, in a similar manner to the functioning of a normal ear. Our central hypothesis is that a hearing aid that delivers amplified wide-bandwidth sound and directionally \ndependent pinna cues with a microphone in an open canal configuration will perform better than conventional hearing aids, especially with the presence of competing talkers. In this phase II SBIR application four specific aims are proposed. All hearing aids\n require a  frequency-gain  prescription. However, current prescription methods are limited to frequencies below 6 kHz and the criteria for fitting have been limited to providing audibility and comfort with no considerations being made to preserve sound lo\ncalization cues. To address these issues, a new high- frequency fitting prescription will be developed using a loudness model and tested on hearing-impaired subjects. In Specific Aim # 2, an initial EarLens system prototype will be bilaterally fit on heari\nng-impaired subjects. Proposed measurements include: (1) functional gain at audiometric frequencies between 0.125 to 10 kHz; (2)  spatial release from masking  or the ability to discern a target speech in the presence of symmetrically separated multi-talke\nr maskers; (3) the  better ear advantage  in which the target and masker are arranged asymmetrically such that the target lies closer to one ear than the other. The latter two experiments are conducted with EarLens configured to only amplify sounds over sp\necific bandwidths, which will range from 4 to 10 kHz. For Specific Aim # 3, we seek to build a behind-the-ear (BTE) prototype suitable for an external clinical trial - the  alpha prototype . A number of design changes including industrial design, mechanica\nl design, user interface, and cable design are proposed. And in Specific Aim #4, a clinical trial of the EarLens hearing system will be conducted at four clinical sites located around the country. The objective of the clinical trial is to obtain sufficient\n data for a 510(k) submission to the FDA upon completion of the work proposed in this application. Most of the six million hearing aid owners in the US report various amplification problems. Our goal is to design a high fidelity open canal hearing aid that\n more closely relates to normal auditory function thereby providing the brain with critical cues so that it is able to segregate sounds originating from different directions and thus allow the listener to hear selectively and be able to understand desired \nspeech from interfering speech. As an outcome of this approach, it is expected that there will be greater satisfaction with usage of the proposed hearing aid than those currently on the market.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infection is a major problem for the 5 to 6 million Americans with chronic wounds because it interferes with the normal healing process and increases the risk of serious complications that often necessitate limb amputat\nion or result in death. A significant obstacle to the successful treatment of chronic wounds is the inability to correctly diagnose infection. Most clinicians still rely on visual signs and symptoms that are indicative of infection in acute or surgical wou\nnds but have been proven to be inaccurate for diagnosis of infection in chronic wounds. The primary objective of this proposal is to optimize and validate a novel diagnostic test that will better enable physicians or nurses to detect chronic wound infectio\nn at the point-of- care. Our overall objective is produce a simple, single-use diagnostic device for hospitals, wound care clinics, outpatient centers, and long-term care facilities. The device will give a visible, yes-or-no result within 15 minutes when t\nhe bacterial concentration within the wound exceeds a level demonstrated to be indicative of infection. This would benefit public health by assisting individuals with chronic wounds to receive the appropriate treatment sooner, which will accelerate the hea\nling process, relieve their suffering and discomfort, and lower the risk of infectious complications. Our Phase I objectives focused on the development of a functional diagnostic assay that was demonstrated to detect bacteria in chronic wounds with excelle\nnt diagnostic sensitivity and specificity relative to standard microbiological techniques. Our Phase II specific aims are focused on improvement and validation of the diagnostic test. The first aim is to evaluate a more accurate and reliable method of coll\necting tissue fluid from chronic wounds. This will help to reduce variability in the sample volume collected, which will improve diagnostic accuracy of the test. Our second objective is to change the assay readout from a quantitative ELISA format into a bi\nnary lateral flow-based test. An important step in this process is setting the appropriate threshold for the lateral flow line development using validated standards. Lastly, we plan to evaluate the diagnostic performance of test with samples from patients \nwithin the three major chronic wounds types: diabetic, pressure, and venous ulcers. Results of the diagnostic test will be compared to a reference standard for diagnosis of chronic wound infection to calculate the sensitivity and specificity. The data from\n this clinical study will evaluate the ability of the diagnostic test to detect chronic wound infection and will demonstrate clinical utility of the device. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project goal is to develop a simple, inexpensive point-of-care diagnos\ntic test to help clinicians rapidly determine if a chronic wound is infected. Earlier and more accurate infection diagnosis will allow patients to receive the appropriate treatment sooner, resulting in less pain and suffering and a lower risk of serious in\nfection-related complications.",

        "abstract": "The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 provides a federal mandate to increase the domestic supply of clean, renewable energy sources. The EIS Act amends the 2005 Renewable Fuels Standard by increasing the goal for renewable fuels use to 9 billion gallons in 2008, 15.2 billion gallons in 2012, and culminating in 36 billion gallons by 2022. Achieving these ambitious goals will be difficult. In the next few years U.S. ethanol production, currently at about 6 billion gallons annually, will be limited by the supply of low-cost corn grain. Producing cellulosic ethanol from \"cellulosic\" biomass such as corn stover and other biomass crops such as switchgrass can substantially increase ethanol production capacity, but with costs above $2.50 per gallon existing cellulosic technologies are too expensive. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for new approaches to lower the cost of cellulosic ethanol. In this USDA SBIR Phase II project, Edenspace is continuing to bioengineer a promising biofuel crop, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), to reduce costs of cellulosic ethanol production by more than 70%. Switchgrass is an attractive biofuel crop because it is native to the Great Plains of the U.S. and has wide adaptability to marginal soils and vigorous growth (optimum annual biomass yields of 10-20 tons/hectare). Importantly, the enhanced switchgrass itself will produce enzymes such as cellulases, helping to reduce the capital costs and operating costs of manufacturing these enzymes in microbial bioreactors, and reducing the costs of acid and heat now used to pretreat the biomass.",

        "abstract": "As grain ethanol production capacity becomes constrained by the available supply of corn grain, production of ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass is widely seen as necessary to meet the surging demand for fuel ethanol.  However, the high cost of biomass pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis make cellulosic ethanol too expensive.  This project will develop technology to improve the quality of ensiled biomass, thus reducing both downstream pretreatment and hydrolysis costs.  The approach builds on past research in which ensiled biomass was inoculated with cellulases and other enzymes to increase saccharification (sugar content) and digestibility, thereby improving feed quality for livestock.  Analogously, energy crops will be engineered to express such enzymes in plant tissues, with the enzymes activated during ensilement.  In Phase I, two crops, switchgrass and corn stover, were bioengineered to produce a cellulase in their leaves and stems.  Ensilement increased the level of fermentable sugars in each crop relative to unensiled control crops.  In Phase II, three crops \u00bf corn, switchgrass, and sorghum \u00bf will be bioengineered to produce cellulases in leaves and stems, then grown, harvested, and ensiled.  The ensiled crops then will be tested for saccharification levels, improvements in ethanol yield, and reductions in processing cost relative to the control crops.  Following Phase II, the technology will be applied to a DOE-supported, pilot-scale cellulosic-ethanol biorefinery in St. Joseph, MO.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits by the awardee: By ensiling crops that produce enzymes, the downstream processing costs of cellulosic ethanol can be reduced.  Pricing models have indicated that even slight increases in the levels of fermentable sugars can substantially reduce overall production costs.  The new technology will create value-added revenue opportunities for agricultural producers and ethanol cooperatives, and reduce fuel costs for consumers.",

Measurement of learning assessments will be based on collaborations with two academic faculty to remove possible bias in these studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alcohol use by youth is an importa\nnt health focus for our Nation and alcohol misuse among adolescents is on the increase. Excessive drinking is associated with psychological, social and physical harm to the individual, family and society. School age students nationwide report episodes of h\nazardous drinking of five or more drinks on at least one occasion. Adolescent drinking also leads to poor school performance, criminal involvement and social maladjustments. Equally alarming is evidence that suggests a high correlation between the early-on\nset of alcohol consumption and the development of alcoholism in adults.

        "abstract": "At the present time there is no system to monitor the progress of medical shipments to and within the combat theater other than those pallets that are tagged with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags in compliance with the current DoD mandate for tagging pallets and cases. Full implementation of the DoD mandate to tag all pallets and cases of Class VIII (Medical) materiel is not expected to occur before the end of 2008. The DoD mandate not withstanding, most Class VIII shipments are of less than pallet or case quantity and therefore are not subject to this requirement. Many of these medical shipments are time sensitive and are often subject to damage from rough handling and/or environmental exposure. Very often the timely delivery of these items, in good condition, is necessary to save human life or limb or to alleviate human suffering. Thus, an RFID system with the ability to monitor the condition of the medical shipments in transit is of vital importance. In the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Contract W81XWH-08-C-0014, Eigent conducted a technology feasibility study and considered alternative strategies for an AIT enabled system to provide tracking/in-transit visibility (ITV) of less than pallet/case quantity medical shipments from the point of origin, or from an intermediate shipping point such as a military medical depot, to the point of use.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Electroencephalography (EEG) is a powerful, inexpensive, and underutilized neurodiagnostic tool. Recent technical advances have led to dense-array EEG, with 256-channel sensor nets that can be applied comfortably in 5\n minutes, inexpensive, high-performance amplification and digitization systems, methods for exact sensor registration with MR images, and flexible pattern recognition and visualization software. If it were possible to accurately localize the neural sources\n of EEG activity to specific cortical networks, dense-array EEG could provide new insights in both clinical and research applications. These applications range from localizing seizure onset in neurosurgical planning for epilepsy to identifying the neural f\noundations of language comprehension in infancy. In Phase I, we showed it is feasible to use 5A impressed currents to measure the conductivity of head tissues, using a  bounded  electrical impedance tomography (bEIT) method in which the geometry of head ti\nssues is specified with segmented MR images. Because the same EEG spectral range and electrodes are used for bEIT that measure the EEG, the bEIT procedure provides an efficient, low-cost specification of the electrical volume conduction through head tissue\ns. This may lead to a major advance in EEG source localization. As evidence of this advance, the Phase I results showed that, in each of the human subjects examined with bEIT, the skull was five times more conductive than was assumed in classical source lo\ncalization models. If confirmed in the Phase II studies, these results would provide a definitive resolution of the controversy over human skull conductivity in the current literature. The Phase II commercialization would lead to a fast, accurate, and inex\npensive bEIT method integrated with each dense-array EEG recording, providing robust and reliable EEG source localization for infants, children, and adults. With dense-array bEIT measured as routinely as testing scalp electrode impedance, we can realize th\ne promise of recent biophysical simulations suggesting that, with accurate correction for head-tissue conductivity, EEG provides spatial resolution of brain activity that is equal to or better than magnetoencephalography (MEG). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The\n conductivity scanning system created by this research project would provide accurate estimates of the conductivity of human head tissues that aids in the analysis of the brain's electrical activity with the electroencephalogram (EEG). Because data acquisi\ntion is fast, safe, and taken from the same scalp sensors that are used for the EEG, conductivity scanning would result in greatly improved information about the brain for both research and medical applications.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II SBIR program aims to develop and demonstrate an innovative AC measurement system for measuring ionic current in biological and artificial nanoscale channels. Nanopores and nanochannels represent a key emer\nging component of nanotechnology, as well as a continuing focus of much biophysical and pharmacological research. AC measurement enables new time and amplitude degrees of freedom, such as measurement of the unbiased (zero DC) properties of analyte binding \ninteractions, and new opportunities to study fundamental phenomena. A particular benefit of AC probing is that it permits a significant improvement in measurement sensitivity. In Phase II, our goal is to demonstrate the full capability of the AC method thr\nough construction of an optimized sensing platform. Many aspects of this platform will be taken from an ongoing DARPA funded effort to develop protein pore measurement technology for use outside the laboratory, and this Phase II effort will make a number o\nf significant practical advances available to the research community. Specific Phase II objectives are to build a prototype AC system that provides a net increase in measurement signal-to-noise ratio of 10 over present commercial technology, and to demonst\nrate its capability in an area of active research. The Phase II system will be offered to the research community as an integrated standalone system for basic measurements under the product name: Individual Molecule Analysis Platform (IMAP). A particular ap\nplication of the AC method is that it potentially offers a means to sequence DNA at a cost much lower than any method that relies on chemical reagents. The potential performance was studied in Phase I with excellent results, and we will continue this effor\nt in Phase II. Indeed, preliminary calculations that were updated based on the Phase I results show that it is just possible that the Phase II system will be able to differentiate the bases of DNA in a true sequencing modality. However, even if that tremen\ndous result is not achieved, the Phase II prototype will provide the next generation in nanopore ionic current measurement capability.

        "abstract": "Technology is needed to remove impurities, especially sulfur, from the hydrogen produced from coal-derived synthesis gas.  Although oxides of zinc now remove sulfur from industrial gas streams to the part-per-million level in the presence of steam, much greater removal effectiveness will be required for the hydrogen product.  In fact, concentrations of sulfur in the part per billion level are required to prevent poisoning of fuel-cell catalysts, membranes, and catalysts used to produce synthetic fuels. Thermodynamic analysis indicates that sorbents incorporating cerium and lanthanum will reduce sulfur from the part-per-million to below the part-per-billion level, even in the presence of steam.  In Phase I, measurements of the performance of sorbents incorporating both cerium and lanthanum showed excellent bulk uptake of sulfur, as predicted.  In Phase II, the sorbents will be optimized for maximum sulfur uptake, for regeneration, and for attrition resistance.  A techno-economic analysis will determine a cost-effective route for scale-up and integration with zinc-based sorbents and hydrogen purification membranes. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Removing sulfur and other impurities from coal-derived hydrogen should speed the commercialization of pollution-free coal-fired power plants.  The technology also should benefit sequestration of carbon dioxide, operation of fuel cells, production of synthetic fuels, and long-term operation of hydrogen-powered turbines.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project aims to continue the development of novel endografts for percutaneous treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) using unique and proprietary shape memory polymer (SMP) technology. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are both common and lethal in the older population, affecting between 7 and 13 % of older persons (> 60 years), accounting for between 13,000 and 18,000 deaths per year in the US alone, and increasing in diagnostic prevalence as both diagnostic techniques improve and the population ages. Endovascular treatment using covered stainless steel or Nitinol stent-grafts is now the preferred option for AAA treatment. However, current devices are far from perfect, and complications from endovascular repair such as endoleaks, continued growth of the aneurysm, device migration, arterial dissections, and other problems persist at very high (> 25-35%) rates. Most if not all these problems can be traced to the inherent limitations of the materials used in current devices. We propose to continue the highly promising Phase I work with particular focus on four areas: finalize polymer formulation; develop methods to manufacture patient-specific endograft designs; finalize biocompatibility evaluation; and evaluate endografts in acute and chronic animal studies. Anticipated deliverables at the end of the Phase II project are a finalized polymer formulation particularly suitable for endografts, complete ISO 109993 biocompatibility evaluation, methods to manufacture patient-specific endografts, and comprehensive\ndata on the acute and chronic vascular response of the shape memory polymer endografts.  The broader impacts of this work lie in the development of the next generation of medical devices using advanced materials with characteristics that can be customized to the patient. The successful development of useful devices from such technologies should pave the way for a plethora of commercial opportunities including tissue-engineering applications whereby the seeds' of new tissues or organs can be incorporated into shape memory polymer devices and delivered using minimally invasive methods into the target site to eventually grow healthy tissue. The ability to fuse shape memory polymer technology with advanced three-dimensional imaging and automated manufacturing methods, such as rapid prototyping and stereo-lithography, promises to open up the exciting prospect of creating patient-specific devices within the operating suite; devices that once manufactured can be compacted in situ into a catheter and delivered immediately into the patient. Lastly, successful completion of the overall project should have immediate impact on a disease that is the 13th leading cause of death in the US, and consequently on human health.",

        "abstract": "The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop mini-channel membrane reformers to produce pure hydrogen from gaseous and liquid fuels.  Fuel reforming of hydrocarbon fuels to yield high purity hydrogen is, at present, the only means for overcoming the lack of an established infrastructure for hydrogen. Fuel processors must be able to start up quickly, follow demand rapidly, be tolerant to sulfur, and operate efficiently over a wide range of conversion rates. The use of mini-channel reformers, with selective membrane removal of hydrogen at the site of production within the individual reformer stages, will lead to improved efficiency, thermodynamics and kinetics of reforming reactions.  If successful, the proposed membrane reformer system will decrease system complexity, reduce costs, and allow ease of control, monitoring and transient response. The proposed technology has significant business opportunities in the business sector for high-purity merchant hydrogen, and in the civilian and military sectors for hydrogen fuel cells, used in portable power and distributed generation.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Compact Soft X-Ray Microbeam Facility for Small Laboratories: Radiation due natural and manmade sources is ubiquitous; research into its effects -- both harmful and beneficial -- is a major component of the mission of the NIH and related health agencies. Radiobiological microbeams are facilities able to deliver precise radiation insults to individual cells (or parts of them) and to assess their biological response; developments and discoveries based on this technique (see Bibliography for extensive references) have led to significant advances in our understanding of the detailed mechanisms of radiation damage and cellular response to such damage. Currently, microbeam facilities require large particle accelerators or synchrotron sources, placing them out of reach of smaller laboratories. The microbeam facility to be developed and commercialized within this Fast-Track program combines a compact soft X-ray source with a modern and flexible endstation. Energetiq Technology, Inc. has developed a novel light source technology -- an electrodeless z-pinch xenon plasma source, originally for use in the semiconductor fabrication industry at 13.5nm wavelength (92 eV), that could provide a source of soft x-rays to enable a lab-scale microbeam research facility. The cost and size of the facility would be comparable to an electron microscope. To develop the microbeam source, the photon energy will be raised to the 1 KeV to 3 KeV range by exploiting optical transitions in helium-like systems such as neon 8+ and argon 16+. Options for X-ray optics such as focusing capillaries and grazing incidence collectors will be assessed as alternatives to expensive and fragile zone plates. The project involves a major collaboration with the Columbia University Radiological Research Accelerator Facility (RARAF). They will develop the endstation, including optical microscopy, micro-positioning hardware, dose metrology, controls and the user interface. The integrated product will be installed at RARAF in the last phase of the program. Understanding the effects of ionizing radiation at all size scales and a variety of dose rates has for decades been a major area of medical and biological research. Precisely focused radiation -- microbeams -- directed at individual cells, and advances in imaging technology such as the ability to study individual damaged DNA strands, combine to provide a uniquely powerful (but typically large and expensive) research tool. Our goal is to develop and market A Compact Soft X-Ray Microbeam Facility for Small Laboratories.",

However, the production, purification, and compression of hydrogen represent key technical challenges to the implementation of a hydrogen economy, especially in the transportation sector where on-board storage of pure hydrogen may require compression at pressures up to 12,000 psi.  Existing compressors are inefficient and have many moving parts, resulting in significant component wear and, therefore, excessive maintenance.  This project will develop an efficient, low-cost, solid-state electrochemical hydrogen compressor (EHC) based on advanced Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) technology.  Phase I demonstrated a baseline, low cost, solid-state hydrogen compressor cell capable of compressing hydrogen from 50 psi to 2,000 psi, a 40-to-1 compression ratio.  Phase II will involve a scale-up of the advanced cell architecture to 6,000 psi capability, development and demonstration of critical sealing technology, and the evaluation of candidate membranes that show low power consumption while minimizing parasitic gas crossover.  Ultimately, the 6,000 psi design will be used to develop electrochemical cell architectures capable of compressing hydrogen up to 12,000 psiCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee; The EHC should find use in the conversion of low-pressure hydrogen derived from on-site sources to high purity, high-pressure hydrogen for vehicular refueling.  In addition, this technology should be scalable, leading to compressors that can move large volumes of hydrogen through pipelines to meet infrastructure demands.  In this manner, bulk hydrogen can be effectively delivered to the point-of-use.  The technology also should find use in industrial applications, such as in refineries and ammonia plants.",

Composting is an established process for converting animal manure into other value-added products such as soil amendment and animal bedding material. However, current agricultural composting practices do not generally address increasingly stringent air emissions, are subject to significant seasonal variations, and generally require an undesirably long retention time. USDA/SBIR Phase II research by Engineered Compost Systems (ECS) will build on the positive outcome of our Phase I research, in which innovative compost pile cover and aeration floor technologies were applied to dairy manure solids composting on a pilot scale. The Phase I results demonstrated an ability to quickly compost material while capturing and controlling the majority (>95%) of air emissions produced. The Phase II research will begin with refining the pilot scale process while building a large prototype system to be operated at a large commercial dairy with typical industry practices. Research and development goals at the large dairy will focus on proving air emission performance, reliably producing bedding from dewatered solids, maintaining herd health, and providing an effective nutrient management tool.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many oxygenators clinically available for pediatric (and adult) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) utilize heparin coatings such as Carmeda BioActive Surface on device surfaces, including the microporous hollow \nfibers, to improve biocompatibility. Despite application of these coatings, significant inflammatory and coagulation-related complications, as well as plasma leakage, remain associated with extended ECMO support. Furthermore, application of current heparin\n coatings reduces permeance of the underlying hollow fiber membranes affecting their capacity to transfer oxygen and carbon dioxide. Reductions in gas exchange efficiency caused by these coatings result in greater total biomaterial surface area requirement\ns (a larger microporous hollow fiber surface area oxygenator) thus exacerbating the inflammatory response problem the coating is intended to mitigate, as well as leading to increased priming volumes. During Phase I of this work five ionized plasma (IP) dep\nosited coatings designed to overcome these limitations and to provide enhanced bioactivity and stability were prototyped and evaluated. Two Phase I coatings exceeded the criteria outlined in our Phase I proposal to adjudicate feasibility. Each demonstrated\n sufficient levels of active heparin and plasma resistance to mitigate complications associated with long-term use of membrane oxygenation, without unduly decreasing the gas permeance of the fibers. This demonstration of feasibility warrants a formal Phase\n II research and development effort with the overall objective of advancing the coating technology from proof-of-concept to a level where coating composition and deposition processes are robust and sufficiently consistent to pursue commercialization of one\n or both coatings. The proposed development program will address: 1) optimization of coating composition, 2) optimization of coating processes, 3) comprehensive in vitro performance assessments, 4) in vitro biocompatibility evaluations in human blood, and \n5) prolonged in vivo testing in animals. Upon completion of this Phase II project we will have produced and validated a heparin-based, biocompatible coating that is gas permeable, highly bioactive, maintains its bioactivity after being sterilized and store\nd prior to use, and prevents or delays plasma leakage. Such a coating has significant potential to reduce inflammatory response and subsequent morbidity associated with existing blood oxygenators and other blood-contacting medical devices. Ension has targe\nted pediatric blood oxygenators as the first market segment to be addressed with this improved biocompatible coating, even though it represents only a small portion of the overall market for this product, because it will permit rapid development and serve \nas a stepping stone for access to other applications in other market segments. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is associated with serious complications and potentially poor outcomes in pediatric patients due to changes to the blood resulting fro\nm blood- biomaterial interaction. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This Phase II project represents the main research and development effort for realization of a heparin-based biocompatible coating that is highly bioactive, cost- effective, and maintains its bioac\ntivity after being sterilized and stored prior to use.

A de-facto standard in accelerator control is the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS), which has been applied successfully to many physics projects. EPICS is a channel-based system that requires that each channel of each device be configured and controlled. In Phase I, the feasibility of a device oriented extension to the distributed channel database was demonstrated by prototyping a device aware version of an EPICS input/output (I/O) controller that functions with the current version of the channel access communication protocol. Extensions have been made to the grammar to define the database. Only a multi-stage position controller with limit switches was developed in the demonstration, but the grammar should support a full range of functional record types. In phase II, a full set of record types will be developed to support all existing record types, a set of process control functions for closed loop control, and support for experimental beam line control. A tool to configure these records will be developed. A communication protocol will be developed or extensions will be made to Channel Access to support introspection of components of a device.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single most common cause of death in the United States. Although the study of the CVD has greatly benefited from the use of gene-targeted transgenic mouse models, these small rodents \ndo not accurately reflect human cardiovascular physiology. The Rabbit would be an excellent animal model for CVD research, considering its many similarities to humans in cardiovascular anatomy, physiology, and lipid metabolism.         The long term goal o\nf Evergen is to establish a facility that provides researchers in the biomedical and pharmaceutical community with gene targeted transgenic rabbits. In this project, Evergen Biotechnologies, Inc. proposes to use an approach by combining the proprietary som\natic cell nuclear transfer and the gene-targeting technologies to produce the first gene-targeted transgenic rabbits as CVD and other human disease models for the study of the disease mechanisms and development of therapies.         In this project, we pro\npose to produce Cholesterol Ester Transfer Protein (CETP) knockout rabbits. So far, several companies including Pfizer, Merck, Roche, and Japan Tobacco have developed drugs targeting on human CETP. The recent unfavorable clinical trials of Pfizer's CETP in\nhibitor, Torcetrapib urged researchers in this field to provide a better animal model system to understand the CETP functions and effects of drugs targeting on CETP.         In Phase I, we propose to target CETP gene in rabbit fibroblast cells and produce \nCETP knockout cells (CETP). We will then use these cells for nuclear transfer to produce CETP KO (CETP) embryos.         In Phase II, we will first focus on the production of CETP knockout (CETP) rabbits. We will breed CETP KO rabbits with Hepatic Lipase t\nransgenic rabbits to generate humanized CETP KO rabbits. Hepatic Lipase activity is much lower in normal rabbits than in human. Finally we will perform the pathology evaluation of the humanized CETP KO rabbits. We are confident that through the proposed pr\noject, a feasible method to produce gene targeted transgenic rabbits will be developed and we will for the first time provide a knockout rabbit model to the researchers worldwide.",

        "abstract": "Compared with conventional processes used to produce many oxygenated chemicals, processes based on the selective catalytic oxidation of alkanes to produce oxygenates could yield enormous economic, energy, and environmental benefits.  However, commercial development of such processes has been hindered, in part, because the excessive heat released by alkane oxidation causes over-oxidation (burning) of a significant amount of the oxide catalysts.  These catalysts have inherently small surface areas and poor thermal conductivity, and are not able to dissipate the heat.  In order to reduce regional over-heating and enhance selectivity to the oxygenate products, this project will design and develop a high-surface-area thermally-conductive material for use as a support for metal oxide catalysts.  In Phase I, a nano-scale, high-surface-area, thermally stable and conductive material was designed, prepared, and characterized.  This material was used as a support for a model metal oxide catalyst and tested in a model alkane oxidation.  Significant enhancement in oxygenate selectivity was observed, as compared with conventional support materials or unsupported catalyst.  Phase II will optimize the preparation of the novel support material and demonstrate its application in the selective oxidation of several alkanes.  Catalytic testing will be conducted to measure the enhancement in oxygenate selectivity as compared with conventional support materials and the unsupported metal oxide catalysts. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The novel material should find application as a new product for catalyst support.  Its application to various metal oxide catalysts in many alkane oxidations should help speed the commercialization of these alkane oxidation processes, thereby realizing the enormous economic, energy, and environmental benefits of these processes.",

        "abstract": "The production of biodiesel around the world is increasing at an astonishing pace.  In the U.S., total annual production capacity is expected to be almost 2 billion gallons by the end of 2008.  At this production rate, over 660,000 metric tons of glycerol will be produced as a by-product each year \u00bf over 2.5 times the current U.S. glycerol production capacity \u00bf creating a glycerol glut with few outlets.  This project aims to develop technology for converting the excess glycerol byproduct from biodiesel production into glycerol tert-butyl ethers, an oxygenated additive for diesel fuel.  Phase I demonstrated that this reaction can be conducted in a fixed-bed reactor using a highly active and selective heterogeneous catalyst.  The catalyst was proven stable for 50 hours of continuous operation.  Limitations on the reaction rate were identified, and methods to overcome these limitations were demonstrated.  Phase II seeks to develop reactor configurations and process designs that can be integrated seamlessly into existing yet idle units for the production of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), taking full advantage of the similarity between glycerol etherification and MTBE process chemistry.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This technology eliminates the primary waste stream from the production of biodiesel and converts it into a valuable commodity, an additive for diesel fuel.  It simultaneously improves the economics and profitability of conventional biodiesel by adding value to a waste stream, allows refiners to meet renewable fuel standards in diesel, and offers MTBE producers the opportunity to utilize existing plants with low capital investments.",

A Phase I animal model showed that the EN-TACT(tm) Patient Monitor is substantially more sensitive than diagnosis by clinical signs (73% vs. 13-19%) with comparable specifi\ncity (93% vs. 97%), as reported by Ulmer (2002). The objective of this Phase II SBIR is to improve the diagnostic accuracy in human subject tests. To achieve this objective, three specific aims for the Phase II research are: (1) Reduce subject-to-subject v\nariability in tissue displacement signal by eliminating operator dependant variations in probe placement and interpretation of which ultrasonic echo corresponds to which anatomical feature. (2) Establish diagnostic utility in human subjects using model com\npartment syndromes of the lower leg and abdomen. (3) Verify diagnostic utility in clinical tests at the UCSD School of Medicine, Eastern Virginia Medical School, the University of New Mexico School of Medicine and the College of William and Mary Sports Med\nicine Department.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of the plague, has been weaponized as an agent of biowarfare. The deliberate release of weaponized Y. pestis would likely occur via aerosol dissemination resulting in an outbreak of \nthe highly lethal and contagious pneumonic plague. Therefore there is a critical need for new agents to combat infection by the antibiotic-resistant, weaponized bacteria. Y. pestis, like all intracellular pathogens, subverts signaling events within the hos\nt cell in order to establish and maintain infection. Because the host cell's signaling events are as essential to establishing and maintaining infection as is the pathogen's own signaling machinery, they present attractive targets for anti-infective agents\n. We demonstrate that targeting the host cell is effective at 1) reducing the viability of the internalized pathogen and 2) protecting the host cell from pathogen-induced cytoskeletal remodeling. Luna Innovations Incorporated, Dr. James B. Bliska (SUNY Sto\nny Brook), Dr. Sidney M. Hecht (University of Virginia), Dr. Louis E. Holland, III (Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute), Dr. Deborah A. Lannigan (University of Virginia) and Dr. George A. O'Doherty (West Virginia University) are extending \nthese exciting findings to develop an anti-Yersinia pestis therapeutic for clinical application. The program will focus on optimization of our drug to improve its therapeutic activity as an anti-Y. pestis agent; synthesizing sufficient quantities of the op\ntimized analogs for efficacy studies in in vivo models of infection; and performing genetic toxicological analysis as well as pharmacokinetic studies to establish the drug metabolism and duration of action profiles. The intention of these studies is to per\nform essential benchmarks with our novel biodefense agent in preparation for submission of an investigational new drug (IND) application with the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many bacteria subvert the host cell's signaling machinery in order to establish \nand maintain infection. Using a drug that we discovered and characterized, we have demonstrated that modulating the host cell's machinery essential to the bacteria is an effective way of interfering with the ability of bacteria to survive inside the host c\nell. The proposed research is designed to develop our novel anti-infective agent toward clinical application as an anti-Yersinia pestis agent.",

        "abstract": "In planned Gen-IV nuclear reactor designs, accurate temperature measurements are needed to identify hot spots (especially in the fuel cladding), control thermal cycles, and perform temperature compensation of other sensors.  At temperatures beyond 1000\u00b0C, temperature spikes may occur, which could lead to premature failure of the reactor pressure vessel, fuel meltdown, containment breach, and possible fission product release.  Although these measurements are critical to the safe operation of these reactors, no drift-free measurement of temperature exists for monitoring in-core reactor temperatures.  This project will develop low-drift, ultra-high-temperature fiber-optic temperature sensors that are hardened for radiation environments, specifically for Gen-IV reactors.  The proposed sensors will be designed for reliable, sustained operation at temperatures up to 1100 \u00b0C and for survival at temperatures up to 1400\u00b0C for short periods of time.  The sensors will be constructed from specially selected materials to be chemically resistant, oxidation resistant, and diffusion resistant.  In Phase I, feasibility was demonstrated by testing six different materials and seven kinds of optical fibers in a radiation environment.  With respect to radiation drift, the optical sensor exhibited a variation of only 0.05\u00b0C over a total fluence of 4.7x1017 cm-2.  A specially-designed optical fiber, which is more radiation hard than conventional \u00bfrad hard\u00bf pure silicon core fiber, was identified.  Phase II will focus on a high-temperature, high-fluence endurance test of the temperature sensors at an advanced test reactor.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The low-drift temperature measurement would be an enabling technology for the commercialization of Gen-IV reactors.  Since the sensors will be radiation tolerant and high-temperature capable, they also should find application in space probes, rocket engine monitoring, rocket engine development, and gas turbine health monitoring.  By reducing the use of fossil fuels for power generation, Gen-IV nuclear reactors will reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and U.S. dependency on foreign oil.",

        "abstract": "Photovoltaics, the direct conversion of sunlight into electric energy, is a promising clean-tech approach to energy production.  Organic solar cells show particular promise because they have the potential for light-weight flexible devices with low material and production costs.  Yet, despite significant improvements over the last couple of years, the maximum power conversion efficiency of organic photovoltaic devices is still about 5%, largely due to the low charge-carrier mobility in the organic materials.  Low mobility increases resistance in the film, thereby reducing the photocurrent and the efficiency of the devices. This project aims to develop high efficiency, low-cost organic solar cells using novel nanostructured carbon electrodes consisting of free-standing carbon nanosheets.  The volume between the sheets will be filled with photoactive material, thereby reducing the distance that charges have to travel to the collecting electrode.  In Phase I, growth conditions for the carbon nanosheets were optimized for the organic photovoltaic application.  An advanced spray coating technique was used to fill the nanosheets with photoactive material, and photovoltaic devices were built and tested.  In addition, a technique was developed to transfer the nanosheets to a zero-thermal-budget substrate.  Lastly, an atomic-layer-deposition process was developed to conformally coat the nanosheets with a dielectric interface layer.  In Phase II, carbon nanosheet devices with superior photovoltaic performance will be demonstrated.  A prototype device \u00bf which will be compatible with a large-scale, roll-to-roll manufacturing process \u00bf with commercially viable conversion efficiency will be built and characterized. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Applications for the technology should range from rooftop photovoltaic systems to light weight, flexible solar cells integrated into tents, textiles, and small electronic devices (i.e. cell phones, PDAs, etc.).

The functional contrast will be provided by the Laser Optoacoustic Imaging System (LOIS) and the structural contrast will be provided by ultrasound imaging. In the course of the two previous projects sponsored by NCI (R33CA095883, R44CA089959) we developed a clinical prototype of two-dimensional LOIS and performed feasibility testing in 36 breast cancer patients. The clinical results enabled the receipt of over $3 million in private funding for development of the commercial clinical system. On the other hand, our clinical studies showed that 3D optoacoustic imaging and correlation of LOIS with ultrasound, current FDA-approved adjuvant to X-ray mammography, will permit realization of the full diagnostic potential of the optoacoustic imaging and expedite radiologist's acceptance of LOIS as a clinical diagnostic imaging modality for breast cancer. Therefore, we propose a fast-track SBIR project to resolve technical issues associated with ultrawide-band ultrasonic transducers made of a novel piezoelectric ceramics (lead metaniobate), novel hardware, firmware and software that combines LOIS and USI systems, and finally, pilot clinical testing of the new system. The proposed 3D system will display 2D images of breast slices in real time and display the final 3D image upon execution of the translation scan along the axis along the laser beam and orthogonal to the slices. The operator will have an option of imaging in the optoacoustic mode, the ultrasound B mode or the combined mode correlating two types of tissue contrast, anatomical and functional. The present methods of medical imaging are only marginally successful in differentiating between cancerous and normal breast tumors. Optoacoustic imaging utilizes the highest known physical or chemical contrast of cancerous tissues relative to normal or benign tissue based on absorption of blood in the tumor microvessels and provides images with excellent resolution of 0.5 mm typical of ultrawide-band ultrasonic imaging. Novel PET/CT and 3D CT and MRI systems being developed do not provide real-time images and will have multimillion dollar price tags. We will utilize electronic hardware and software developed in the course of previous and ongoing R&D projects for development of a more advanced system for breast cancer. The focus of the Phase-I project will be on development, fabrication and testing of a single transducer elements capable of ultrawide-band ultrasound detection and emission of ultrasound pulses with no ringing. The Phase- II project will develop an arc-shaped linear array of novel transducers and its mechanical translation that simulates 2D array, modify firmware and software of the present system to enable dual modality operation and correlation of the two types of images, and test the system in phantoms followed by clinical evaluation in 12 patients with breast cancer. Successful accomplishment of the proposed project will motivate our investors to engage in the commercial development and the process of FDA approval.",

The innovative, plasma-based, Archimedes Filter Technology (AFT) is an attractive option for SNF recycling because it can separate fission products from actinides by mass without explicit separation of plutonium.  Recent research also has shown that the AFT could be of great benefit to the UREX+ process.  However, implementation of the AFT requires development of a technique for vaporizing SNF for injection into the Filter device.  This project will develop this vaporization source, which will be critical for a demonstration of the existing full scale prototype. Numerical simulations in Phase I demonstrated that the AFT has the potential to separate actinides from fission products with sufficient throughput and separation quality to be of benefit to the UREX+ process.  The tasks defined the feed basis, used that feed to determine the relative decontamination factors for collisional versus collisionless operation of a commercial AFT, and determined the optimal operating parameters.  In Phase II, a vaporization technique for feeding SNF to the main AFT plasma will be developed, and a more efficient neutral collector, which will improve the decontamination of the heavy actinide product, will be designed. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Separation by mass would produce a proliferation-resistant actinide product that can be burned in a reactor.

In Phase II, a detailed design of the concept will be completed, which will focus on the development of a demonstration test article for future evaluation in a test engine.  Phase II also will involve the creation of manufacturing drawings. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The spar-shell blade represents a promising leap in gas turbine technology and should be applicable to 14% of today\u00bfs total world-wide power generation capacity.  The spar-shell blade also should be an enabling technology for advanced zero-emission gas and steam turbines such as the High-Hydrogen and Oxy-Fuel turbines.  Finally, the spar-shell technology could be leveraged to develop blade designs capable of enhancing existing gas turbine power plant performance and efficiency in Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) applications.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Experimental investigations have demonstrated that the delivery of HIFU (High Intensity Focused Ultrasound) to cancerous tumors results in the release of heat shock proteins and generates a beneficial immune response. T\nhe release of proteins into the blood as a result of HIFU therapy is further demonstrated by the spike of the serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level following a HIFU treatment of the prostate. The goal of this proposal is to build on the HIFU treatmen\nt of local tumors in order to address metastases. We propose to use an immunotherapy approach to address advanced stage and metastatic disease following the application of HIFU for the treatment of local disease. Our Phase I results have shown that HIFU al\none can generate both systemic and tumor-specific immune responses. Furthermore, successive applications of HIFU treatments (over the course of several weeks) can enhance these responses without hampering the body's ability to fight disease. HIFU is an ide\nal treatment modality for stimulating the body's own immune system, as  it is non-invasive and repeatable with the ability to precisely target tissue. We plan to build on these excellent results from our Phase I study in this Phase II study by accomplishin\ng the following specific aims: (i) determine the HIFU treatment sequence that generates the largest tumor-specific response in a small animal model; (ii) determine if the addition of GM-CSF (a stem cell stimulator) to the HIFU treatment sequence enhances t\nhe tumor-specific response in a small animal model even further; and (iii) verify the applicability of these protocols with a large animal canine prostate cancer model. The large animal model study will provide the final details on the effectiveness of the\n treatment and is needed to determine the preferred treatment parameters for both HIFU and immunotherapy. The proposed method of this Phase II of applying HIFU therapy sequences in conjunction with immunotherapy has the potential to expand the market for t\nhe Sonablate.500 prostate cancer HIFU system from its current indication of organ confined prostate cancer to include treatment of advanced stage prostate cancer with evidence of metastasis or a high risk of metastasis. This will provide a new curative tre\natment option to patients with advanced disease where none currently exists. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In 2007, an estimated 219,000 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and an estimated 27,000 men will die of prostate cancer in the U.S. Prostate canc\ner continues to be the most frequently diagnosed cancer in men. There exist a number of approaches to treat organ confined prostate cancer, of which High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is an example. To expand on the success of treating the local dise\nase non- invasively, the goal of this project is to address metastatic disease through the combination of HIFU treatment of prostate cancer with immunotherapy (a method stimulating the body's immune system to reject and destroy the cancer). Currently, no t\nreatment options (other than palliative) exist for men with metastatic disease.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ischemic stroke is a major source of illness burden in the US. Stroke survivors are at high risk for recurrence and therefore they are an important group for secondary prevention. However, gaps in knowledge among stroke\n survivors, including inadequate knowledge of the early warning signs of stroke, inadequate understanding of the purpose and goals of rehabilitation, and lack of awareness of personal risk factors, lead to preventable stroke-related morbidity. Education to\n address these knowledge gaps is typically inadequate during inpatient rehabilitation for stroke. An effective program of education for stroke survivors could improve stroke outcomes by promoting rehabilitation, reducing the risk of another stroke and redu\ncing morbidity of recurrent strokes. In the Phase I SBIR, we established the feasibility of developing a web-based education for stroke survivors and their families. We developed a prototype to impart basic knowledge about stroke, including warning signs, \nrisk factors, and management of one of the common risk factors (hypertension). This prototype is an interactive web-based educational program, using video format and animation, as well as self-assessments and adaptive learning through computer technology t\no address cognitive deficits. A pilot study of this prototype with 25 stroke patients and 7 caregivers was conducted, with approximately half of the subjects using the Web-based training without adaptive learning, and the other half with adaptive learning.\n The program was well-accepted and stroke-related knowledge improved significantly compared to baseline for all subjects. Without the adaptive learning, the mean improvement in correct answers on pre-post testing was 2.0. When the adaptive learning compone\nnt was integrated into the Web-based training, the mean improvement in correct answers on pre-post testing was 5.1. The Phase I prototype can be accessed for review at www.strokelearning.com. We now propose in Phase II to complete the development of this w\neb-based program, so that it addresses all of the main manageable risk factors, provides general stroke knowledge, and provides an understanding of stroke rehabilitation. Importantly, this program will maintain a focus on changing patients' behavior, empow\nering them to reduce their risk for further strokes and benefit more optimally from rehabilitation. The program will also adapt to patients' level of knowledge and cognitive impairments. It will iteratively measure gains in knowledge by patients and caregi\nvers and in doing so will reinforce learning over multiple sessions. As part of Phase II, we will test the efficacy of this program in improving patient and caregiver stroke knowledge at the time of discharge, and monitor change in risk- related behavior (\nsmoking) at 2 and 6 weeks post-discharge in a controlled trial of 200 stroke patients and family members. This program will be a marketable product to providers of medical treatment for stroke, including rehabilitation hospitals which must meet specific pa\ntient education requirements, hospitals which are seeking stroke specialty certification and nursing homes. Additionally, insurance companies that wish to improve stroke prevention efforts (and thus save costs as well as improve patients' quality of care) \nmay be a source of revenue. Stroke, the 3rd leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the US afflicts between 700,000 and one million Americans annually, with African-Americans at particularly high risk. The 4.8 million stroke survivors i\nn the US represent a large at-risk group for a recurrence of stroke. In fact, they are at 15 times greater risk of stroke compared to age-matched normals. The overall goal of this application is to develop a web-based interactive video program that would i\nmprove the education of stroke survivors and their caregivers while in rehabilitation and beyond, in order to identify personal risk factors, modify behavio",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2006, across the globe, more than 800,000 in-vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles were run. Of 150,000 cycles run in the US, roughly 10,000 involved pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Current PGD techniques are un\nregulated, expensive and highly unreliable: error rates for screening disease-linked loci or aneuploidy are on the order of 10%; each screening test costs more than  5,000; and a couple is forced to choose between testing aneuploidy, which afflicts roughly\n 40% of IVF embryos, or screening for disease-linked loci on the single cell. There is a great need for an affordable technology that can reliably determine genetic data from the single cell in order to screen in parallel for aneuploidy, monogenic diseases\n such as Cystic Fibrosis, and susceptibility to complex disease phenotypes for which the multiple genetic markers are known through whole-genome association (WGA) studies. The process of PGD during IVF involves extracting a single cell from the roughly 8 c\nells of an early-stage embryo for analysis. Since only a single copy of the DNA is available from one cell, direct measurements of the DNA are highly error-prone, or noisy. Gene Security Network (GSN) has developed a novel technology, termed Parental Suppo\nrtTM (PS), for determining the embryonic DNA at hundreds of loci together with copy numbers for 23 chromosomes, with error rates below 0.1%, from a single cell. The proprietary technique makes use of genetic data of the mother and the father, together with\n the knowledge of the mechanism of meiosis and noisy measurements of the embryonic DNA, in order to determine which segments of parent chromosomes contributed to the gametes that fertilized and hence to reconstruct in silico the embryonic DNA with confiden\nce exceeding 99%. Based on the results of our phase I study, GSN has executed letters of intent with the 5 leading IVF centers in the United States to use the GSN diagnostic service. In aim 1 of this proposal, we will demonstrate the ability of the PS tech\nnology to reliably reconstruct genetic data using the measured genetic data from isolated single cells from a born child, and parental genetic data. In aim 2 we will demonstrate the ability of the PS technology to detect aneuploidy at all 23 chromosomes, a\nlso using isolated single cell genetic data, by means of an innovative single cell model for aneuploidy that does not require direct work on embryos. In Aim 3 we will perform a clinical trial in conjunction with Stanford IVF Center, Boston IVF and Huntingt\non Reproductive Center that applies the techniques from aims 1 and 2 to real blastomeres in the IVF context and compare our predictions with truth measured on the child when born. One goal of the study is to generate data that will be used to obtain approv\nal of this diagnostic technique by the Food and Drug Administration. The PS technology of Gene Security Network will bring the domain of PGD into the realm of reliable diagnostics which can be regulated and used with confidence in clinical decisions. The s\nelection of the embryos to implant is a clinical decision that has direct and absolute impact on outcomes. Narrative and Relevance to Healthcare  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As data associating disease phenotypes with genotype continues to grow, the question \narises: how can this knowledge be used to improve the quality of life and health? With this grant, Gene Security Network will thoroughly validate a technology for screening embryos during in-vitro fertilization for a multiplicity of disease linked genes an\nd TM aneuploidy. This technology, termed Parental Support (PS) which is built on the fundamental principles of meiosis and data that has recently become available through the human genome project. Compared to existing technologies, PS enables: i) determina\ntion of disease linked loci with roughly two orders of magnitude lower error rates; ii) determination of multiple disease-linked loci in parallel; iii) dete",

In addition, the robustness and reliability of energy storage power processing circuits used in conventional power grid systems are enhanced significantly with the availability of sub-microsecond Thyristors. The voltage specification achieved is beyond the theoretical limit that can be achieved with contemporary Silicon technology, is within the room temperature corona limit, and is compatible with commercially available capacitors. These challenging specifications are enabled by fully exploiting the superior electrical and thermal properties of the emerging power semiconductor material of choice: Silicon Carbide (SiC).  In the Phase I, a nearly-ideal blocking voltage SiC Gate Turn Off (GTO) Thyristor was found to offer the best solution for the challenging requirements. Extensive simulations were conducted to model SiC GTO Thyristor devices and their performance was verified. Test structures were fabricated and power-packaging technology was explored.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose this Phase II SBIR program to further capitalize on the very promising results from our Phase I effort to develop a novel, handheld three-dimensional (3D) camera able to perform objective, quantitative, and t\nrue 3D measurements of the size, shape, volume, color, and healing status of wounds. Accurate measurement of wound healing enables clinicians to assess, document, improve, and individualize the treatment plan given to each wound patient. In current wound c\nare practices, clinicians often visually inspect the wound to evaluate the healing status. This is not an optimal practice because human vision lacks precision and consistency, and quantifying slow or subtle changes is very difficult. As a result, an instr\nument that quantifies both skin color and geometric shape variations would be particularly useful in helping clinicians assess healing status and judge the effect of hyperemia, hematoma, local inflammation, secondary infection, and tissue necrosis. Our han\ndheld 3D camera developed under this SBIR program will prove itself to have several unique advantages over traditional methods for monitoring wound care, to include:      Non-contact measurement: No risk of contaminating the wound site or disturbing the re\ncovering tissue.  Fast and easy to use: Acquires a single image in a fraction of a second and automatically merges multiple 3D images into a complete 3D model of the wound in real time; suitable for both hospital and homecare/telemedicine applications.  Hi\ngh Accuracy: Sub-millimeter accuracy with optimal depth of field to ensure that changes suggestive of healing are captured precisely and with minimal artifact.  Quantitative measurements: Both 2D color and 3D shape provide quantitative digital measurements\n of wound parameters such as area size, volume, length, depth, surface roughness, and its profile.  Handheld device: Not only is it a handy portable instrument, it also provides a unique ability to measure wounds that extend around limbs and that are not f\nully visible from a single position.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in every 8 American women develops breast cancer at some point in their lifetime. It is estimated that more than 225,000 new cases of breast cancer occur among American women each year. Breast Conserving Therapy (BC\nT), defined as excision of the primary tumor and adjacent breast tissue followed by radiation therapy of the breast and/or regional lymph nodes, has been widely accepted as a treatment option for most women with clinical Stage I or II invasive breast cance\nr. Among the various treatment mechanisms, partial Irradiation treatment through the clever use of megavoltage external beams (called partial breast irradiation (PBI) in this proposal) is a less invasive more focused treatment. It uses a treatment planning\n CT scan and combines multiple radiation treatment fields to deliver precise doses of radiation externally to the lumpectomy cavity. The major technical challenge for a successful PBI treatment is the precise delivery of radiation dose to the subsurface ta\nrget volume. Inaccurate localization of the target volume could result in PBI treatment failure due to recurrence caused by geometric miss of the tumor, and/or unacceptable toxicity caused by daily irradiating normal tissue at a high fractional dose. The p\nrimary objective of this SBIR program is to develop a novel, three-dimensional (3D), image-guided, adaptive therapy (3D IGAT) technique to improve the precision of radiation delivery during the procedure of Partial Breast Irradiation (PBI) treatment. We pr\nopose to develop a novel approach of patient repositioning and error correction based on accurate registration between the treatment-planning computed tomography (CT) scan and the 3D surface profiles of a patient's breast acquired during the treatment. Sin\nce 3D surface images can be acquired in real-time and will cause no additional irradiation, the proposed repositioning approach provides an elegant way to solve the two difficulties of the traditional laser line based alignment system. One is accurate loca\nlization of the lumpectomy field for dose delivery, and the other is accurate and fast patient repositioning for return visits. The major advantages of this novel technique include the following: 3D surface images.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Statins are the most prescribed drugs in the world. Their efficacy in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease as well as beneficial pleiotrophic and anti-inflammatory effects have fostered increasingl\ny aggressive usage and dosage. Their main clinically relevant safety risk is statin-induced myopathy (SIM) evidenced clinically as a constellation of neuromuscular side effects (hereinafter NMSEs). NMSEs are disabling to 3-20% of patients on statins, requi\nre alteration of therapy, and reduce compliance. NMSEs include myalgias (muscle aches, cramps, weakness) and myositis (monitored by elevation of serum creatine kinase [CK] activity). NMSEs vary in extent between drugs and from patient to patient. We will d\nevelop a novel product termed SIM PhyzioType  system to provide clinicians with individualized information for each patient on the safest statin drug among atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin, the 3 most prescribed statins. The PhyzioType consists \nof a multi-SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) ensemble that, interpreted with a biomathematical algorithm, predicts drug response. As part of our preliminary work, we have genotyped 242 statin-treated patients with a targeted array of 384 SNPs from 222 c\nardiovascular and neuromuscular candidate genes, and performed physiogenomic associations. We have developed a prototype PhyzioType system incorporating predictive models for myalgia, serum CK activity, and LDLc reduction for atorvastatin and simvastatin p\natients. We have discovered a mechanistic link between vascular homeostasis and CK elevation, and between serotonin receptors and myalgia. These results have been published in Pharmacogenomics and Muscle and Nerve. For this SBIR Program, the physiogenomics\n technology and state-of-the-art genotyping laboratories of Genomas will be combined with the clinical experience and resources of Drs. Paul Thompson, Alan Wu, and Bruce Gordon, respectively, at Hartford Hospital, Univ. California San Francisco and Rogosin\n Institute, through institutional subcontracts. We will recruit to obtain 250 patients treated with each drug and use existing clinical records to characterize their NMSE and LDLc responses. We will use physiogenomics to identify those SNPs that differenti\nate the risk of NMSEs among the 3 statins and combine them into the SIM PhyzioType system. In Phase I, we will continue genotyping with the hypothesis-driven array of 384 SNPs. In Phase II, we will incorporate a hypothesis-free approach by genotyping each \npatient at 550,000 SNPs with a total genome array covering all ~30,000 genes on all chromosomes and the mitochondrion. This work will also contribute to the pharmacology of SIM and unravel new pharmaceutical targets. We will create and validate the SIM Phy\nzioType system with clinically useful prediction of NMSEs and potency for each of the 3 statins. In Phase III a prospective trial is planned for FDA approval of the SIM PhyzioType product.",

The overall objective for the Phase I and the phase II projects is the development of an isobutanol production strain with a production yield high enough to enable commercialization in phase III.  During the Phase I project, microorganisms were engineered that produced isobutanol at yield, titer, and productivity values that proved feasibility of the technology.  The Phase II project will increase the yield of the isobutanol process to levels sufficient for commercialization.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Isobutanol has applications both in the transportation market as well as in the chemicals market. One of the biggest drawbacks with ethanol as a fuel is its hygroscopicity and the resulting inability to transport ethanol using the existing infrastructure.  Using isobutanol as a replacement for ethanol overcomes this limitation as well as increases the energy content per gallon, bringing it closer to gasoline.  In the chemicals market, the demand for isobutanol is growing at an annual rate of 4.5%. The growing price of oil has resulted in a corresponding increase in the cost of isobutanol.  This project will promote the establishment of a renewable process for isobutanol production that is economically competitive with the petro-chemical market. This not only delivers a better second generation biofuel but also reduces the dependence on imported oil, lowers green-house gas emissions, and expands the use of bio-based products in the chemicals market.",

To address the EPA's concern and need, this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue the developmental work started in Phase I to design, develop and demonstrate a simple-to-operate and advanced, novel electrochemical ClO2 micro sensor (sensor cell with integrated potentiostatic control and signal-processing circuit) and demonstrate its successful operation with wireless data transmission. The proposed micro sensor will be rapid (less than 30 seconds for 90% of full response, T90), accurate, selective and capable of measuring 0 to 3000 ppm ClO2 in real-time with a detection limit of 2 ppb. The unique and advanced sensing technology is based on integrated solid polymer proton conducting electrolytes and thick-film electrode (sputtered or screen printed on alumina substrates) technology. The proposed micro sensor will be configured for continuous unattended or handheld operation and it will be fully integrated with wireless data transmission and configured into a compact and lightweight monitor.\n\nCommercial Applications:\n\nAn accurate, portable and reliable ClO2 monitoring device capable of wireless data transmission could find a broad commercial use. The proposed handheld and inexpensive ($100 to manufacture in quantities greater than 10,000 units) electrochemical ClO2 monitor that is capable of monitoring ClO2 levels in real-time with a detection limit of 2 ppb could be used for applications intended to control microbiological growth in a number different industries, such as the dairy industry, the beverage industry, the pulp and paper industry, the fruit and vegetable industries, various canning plants, the poultry industry, the beef processing industry and miscellaneous food processing applications. In addition to the applications mentioned above, the proposed ClO2 monitor could also be used with chlorine dioxide generators to accurately control concentration of generated ClO2.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The ability of a drug to reach and penetrate its intended target within the body is critical to its success in treating disease. However, drug efflux proteins such as p-glycoprotein (pgp) actively pump hydrophob\nic drugs away from target tissues and are linked to low oral absorption and multidrug resistance in chemotherapy. Protein pumps are of increasing interest to the pharmaceutical industry, most importantly based on new draft FDA guidelines requiring knowledg\ne of whether a drug candidate is a substrate or inhibitor of pgp. Current pgp assays are cumbersome, expensive and unreliable. Our overall goal is to prepare and validate a novel assay reagent - Fluorosome-trans-pgp - which capitalizes on the Fluorosome Te\nchnology that we have developed for measuring passive permeability of small molecules through lipid membranes. Fluorosome-trans-pgp will provide a direct, reliable, simple, rapid and inexpensive assay to determine if a drug is a pgp substrate or inhibitor.\n Toward this goal, in phase I of this project we have:  cloned and expressed the human pgp construct containing a 10His tag in HEK293 cells.  isolated and purified the protein  pgp 10His  in lipid micelles.  demonstrated verapamil-stimulated ATPase activit\ny in the purified pgp 10His lipid micelles.  reconstituted the purified pgp 10His into liposome membranes.  developed the methodology for the manufacture and assay of Fluorosome-trans-pgp.  validated the test systems that will be used to screen potential p\ngp substrates and inhibitors. Phase II of this project will bring the Fluorosome-trans-pgp assay to the state of an important commercial product. To complete this development, the Specific Aims of phase II are to: 1. complete Fluorosome-trans-pgp productio\nn and validation. 2. scale up Fluorosome-trans-pgp production to commercial levels. 3. demonstrate the utility of Fluorosome-trans-pgp with representative pgp substrates and inhibitors. 4. optimize the properties of the Fluorosome-trans-pgp system. 5. deve\nlop data analysis software. Our overriding goal in Phase II is to bring Fluorosome-trans-pgp and accompanying software to market. Successful completion of phase II will satisfyi the increasing need for a reliable and economical method to measure a drug's s\nusceptibility to efflux by the pgp pump or to act as a pgp inhibitor. This project also lays the foundation for the design of Fluorosome-based systems to test for the susceptibility of drug candidates to other drug transport proteins. Markets include pharm\naceutical and biotechnology companies, contract research organizations, and in-house fee-for service assays. This project completes the development of a test which determines if drugs will be extruded from their target tissue by biological pumps. The test \nthereby allows the pharmaceutical industry to evaluate, at an early stage, the suitability of drug candidates for continued development. The test is reliable, simple, rapid, inexpensive and amenable to robotics.",

        "abstract": "In the US, Paralichthyd flounder, summer (Paralichthys dentatus) and southern (P. lethostigma) flounder on the east coast and California halibut (P. californicus) on the west, are high-value finfish with established markets worldwide. While the demand for flounder remains high globally, fishing pressure has significantly reduced wild catches, such that demand often exceeds supply. Meeting the increased demand for flounder in U.S. and foreign markets will therefore require establishing and optimizing production through aquaculture. Paralichthyd flounder are widely cultured throughout the world, particularly in Asia, where production of Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) exceeds 65,000 tons. Despite the high demand, and declining fisheries, flounder culture in the US is a nascent industry and we represent the only commercial producer of farm-raised summer flounder. With a decade of research, at various universities, on the reproduction, larviculture, and metamorphosis of summer flounder, we have sufficient technical information for commercial-scale juvenile production. In fact, we consistently produce 2-3 crops of up to 250,000 juveniles annually, and have done so for many years. To gain competitiveness on the global market, however, we must reduce the costs associated with juvenile growth to market size (\"grow-out\"). We believe this obstacle represents the last remaining hurdle for the expansion of the US flounder industry, and is the focus of this proposal. Key to viable flounder culture is the reliable production of faster growing, all-female stocks. Females grow 2-3 times faster and have larger maximum sizes than males. Our research demonstrated that the estimated breakeven costs for all-female populations of summer flounder are 35% less than that to grow mixed sex populations. By reducing the cost of production, both the US consumer and industry will benefit.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein-based therapeutic products have contributed immensely to healthcare and constitute a large and growing percentage of the total pharmaceutical drugs. The majority of these FDA approved products are manufactured u\nsing mammalian cell culture systems. Over the past 10-20 years substantial progress has been made to overcome some of the key barriers to large-scale mammalian cell culture. Despite these improvements, the development of new biopharmaceutical products rema\nins an expensive and lengthy process, where 20-30% of the total cost is associated with process development and clinical manufacturing. Currently most process optimization strategies are performed using a trial and error approach where cells are treated as\n a  black box' and process outputs are improved over several months by laborious experimentation. These empirical optimization techniques are widely used because in most cases little is known about the underlying physiological interactions that impact grow\nth and protein production in the host cell lines. A fundamental understanding of cell line physiology and metabolism, enabled by computational modeling and simulation technologies, can greatly improve and accelerate media and process development in mammali\nan cell line systems. In the Phase I of this SBIR research project, we utilized our computational modeling platform and expertise in metabolic modeling and mammalian cell culture to reduce byproduct formation in a GS-NS0 murine myeloma cell line in collabo\nration with SAFC (Sigma-Aldrich Fine Chemicals) Biosciences. To implement our model-driven media optimization approach, we reconstructed a metabolic model for NS0 cell containing 456 metabolites and 470 metabolic reactions. The model was used to develop nu\ntritional modifications to the basal media to reduce byproduct formation and improve growth and productivity. Experimental evaluation of our model-based media formulations in NS0 cell culture showed significant improvements over traditional methods for med\nia analysis and resulted in approximately 12% lower lactate and up to 67% higher final product titers. With the successful completion of our Phase I proof-of-concept study, we now put forth a Phase II proposal that aims at completing the development of a c\nommercial platform for media and process optimization that significantly improves the existing timelines associated with therapeutic protein production in mammalian cell lines. We plan to achieve this goal through: (1) refinement and expansion of the metab\nolic model of NS0 cell line, (2) integration of a transient flux balance approach for quantitative implementation of media designs, and (3) validation of the final framework using three case studies for antibody production in NS0 cell line. We will measure\n the overall success in Phase II by our ability to reduce the timelines to develop an optimized media that results in lower byproduct formation and higher productivity in cell culture. Successful completion of the specific aims outlined in the proposed pla\nn will benchmark the commercial value of a model-driven approach in recombinant protein production through rational selection of nutrient supplementation and process optimization strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-based therapeutic products have \ncontributed immensely to healthcare and constitute a large and growing percentage of the total pharmaceutical market. The majority of these FDA approved products are manufactured using mammalian cell culture systems. The proposed work aims at developing co\nmputational strategies that significantly improves the timelines and cost associated with therapeutic protein production in mammalian cells. Reducing the cost of therapeutic protein development and manufacturing would ensure that the next generation of med\nicines can be created in amounts large enough to meet patients' needs and at a price low enough that patients can afford them.",

Unfortunately, populations of smelt have been in decline in the Northeast for decades and in 2004, NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service listed rainbow smelt as a species of concern in the Gulf of Maine. It is inevitable that commercial and recreational smelt harvesting will be further restricted or halted as wild populations continue to diminish.

Despite the passage of OBRA guidelines in 1987, there is little evidence that this philosophy of care has been widely adopted.

What is needed is a training program for caregivers that focuses on understanding the philosophy of care, developing appropriate techniques to assist wit\nh activities of daily living, learning about useful assistive devices, and learning methods of motivating residents to care for themselves to the extent possible. The long-range goal of this proposed research is to improve the quality of life of older peop\nle who live in assisted living facilities by training staff in restorative care techniques. This goal will be achieved by developing and validating a comprehensive multimedia restorative care training program. Each module will use a three-part approach: in\nteractive computer-based training (for providing knowledge and improving attitudes), video-based instruction (for demonstrating techniques), and print materials (to instruct participants on how to practice skills with another staff member through role play\n.) Module topics will include: restorative care philosophy/benefits and specific ADLs, e.g. dressing, dining, ambulation, toileting, exercising, grooming, bathing, and cognitive and social skills. Researchers will also develop a module for facility owners,\n administrators, and family members on the benefits of implementing a facility-wide restorative care program.

Characteristics of older adults in long-term care, including impaired physical mobility, reduced cognitive functioning, diminished sen\nsory awareness, and chronic health conditions, create unique emergency planning challenges. When should a facility evacuate? Where will residents take shelter? How will they be transported? These are all difficult questions that long-term care facility own\ners and operators face. Despite state and federal requirements for emergency planning, there is growing evidence that suggests long-term care facilities are ill-prepared for a disaster. The purpose of the proposed research is to reduce the risk of disaster\n-related deaths and injuries to older adults in long-term care. This goal will be accomplished through the development and evaluation of a comprehensive emergency preparedness curriculum. The computer-based training materials developed from this curriculum\n will provide long-term care owners, administrators, and facility emergency planning teams with the knowledge, skills, and tools they need to develop, implement, and practice an emergency operations plan. During Phase I, researchers convened a multidiscipl\ninary advisory group of experts to discuss the challenges long-term care facilities face when developing and implementing an emergency plan and responding to an actual disaster event. The advisory group developed a detailed emergency preparedness curriculu\nm. Researchers evaluated the curriculum in a pilot test with 43 owners, operators, and facility disaster coordinators from assisted living facilities and skilled nursing facilities. Posttest results suggest that the curriculum as presented improved the par\nticipants' knowledge, attitudes, and intended practices related to emergency preparedness. The average improvement from pre to posttest was 31.71%, which was significant at the .0005 level. Participant evaluation of each module on six criteria (clarity, us\nefulness, importance, interest, comprehensiveness, and length) suggests a strong approval of the curriculum. During Phase II, the curriculum will be the basis for the development of an interactive, computer-based training program. Modules will combine text\n, graphics, animation, sound, and high-resolution video to create a fully-interactive media-rich, learner-controlled environment. The program will be evaluated in a national field test with small, medium, and large long-term care facilities, using a random\nized pretest/posttest experimental design with a control group.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It has been repeatedly emphasized in various reports and workshops [1-2] that the development of better X- ray fluorescence detector systems is urgently needed to solve the saturation problems with the currently availab\nle detectors. The multilayer analyzer array detector (MAAD) using linearly graded multilayers has been successfully developed to handle the large photon flux from the third generation synchrotron sources. However, this type of detectors has limited detecti\non solid angle restricted by its vertical and horizontal acceptance. The detectors will suffer largely degraded energy resolution and loss of throughput if horizontal acceptance angle is increased. In the Phase I proposal, we have proposed to develop multi\nlayer array analyzer detectors using radially graded multilayers. By largely increasing the horizontal acceptance per multilayer, this new design provides a 2.5 times of collection solid angle increase. Furthermore, the new design substantially reduces the\n energy resolution and improves the throughput of the analyzers due to the preferred gradient design and optimized deposition material selection. Thus we have demonstrated 6-8 times of combined improvement of performance over the previous analyzer detector\n design. In a subsequent investigation after the completion of our Phase II project (RR015994), we have demonstrated that large background rejection, in excess of 10,000, can be achieved with a dual multilayer analyzer in  plus  configuration, rather than \n minus  configuration that we have proposed previously. Thus we will combine the two technologies, namely the radially graded multilayer technology and the new dual multilayer analyzer configuration to fabricate very desirable fluorescence analyzer detecto\nrs to benefit the user community. In the Phase II project, we will design, fabricate and test one radially graded multilayer array analyzer detector (RMAAD) optimized for energies from 1.2 to 4 KeV, and one dual multilayer array analyzer detector (DMAAD) i\nn the plus configuration optimized from 3.5 to 10 KeV. We will adopt a modular design for the RMAAD unit, where smaller unit containing 5 miltilayers can be added to form a full-scale unit. The DMAAD unit can work as a RMAAD when large background rejection\n is not required. The proposed DMAAD will allow for the elemental detection in ppb levels or in Physiologically relevant concentrations. In addition to the improved detection efficiency, the proposed analyzer detectors extend the current fluorescence detec\ntion capability in two crucial areas: very dilute system regime and intermediate to lower energy regions, which are most relevant to biology. The market of the new detectors will no longer be restricted to synchrotron beamlines with intense flux, but all t\nhe beamlines which are involved in spectroscopy and fluorescence analysis. The advances made in this proposal will enhance the capability of research for x-ray spectroscopy and fluorescence analysis under high count rate achievable at the current and next \ngeneration synchrotron sources.",

Phase I SBIR research successfully established computer-automated assessment of depression severity using fully-structured interactive voice response system interactions with patients and demonstrated feasibility of obtaining valid meas\nures of depression severity and treatment response through vocal acoustic analysis of speech samples obtained over the telephone. As a result of the Phase I pilot study success, Healthcare Technology Systems was successful in persuading an industry sponsor\n to include vocal acoustic biomarkers as exploratory measures in a methodologically focused randomized clinical trial. This opening creates an opportunity to advance development of vocal acoustic biomarker research faster than would have been possible if P\nhase II efforts focused solely on technology evaluation in a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial, as initially envisioned. The Phase II efforts proposed focus on efficient automation of the analytic processes to reduce delivery costs, replicat\nion of Phase I results for further validation, generalized extension of the technology for applicability to other patient populations (non-English speakers, children/young adult, and geriatric), and derivation/optimization of multivariate acoustic models t\no enhance the biomarker sensitivity to treatment response and prediction of the response likelihood for individual patients. The additional data collection, analysis, and presentation of results will be done in collaboration with the Depression Clinical an\nd Research Program at the Massachusetts General Hospital. The product's commercial market is described and a plan for product launch is outlined. Major depression is involved in over 60% of suicides and is a leading cause of disability adjusted life years \nin the US and worldwide. Development and evaluation of depression treatments in clinical trials is hampered by use of unreliable outcome measures. Establishing a valid, noninvasive, easily obtained, and generalizable biomarker of depression severity and tr\neatment response will contribute to better understanding of depression and development of effective treatments.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of this project is to increase the number of Donation after Cardiac Death (DCD) livers available for transplantation by developing a new hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) solution for recovery and p\nreservation. Currently DCD livers are transplantable and have the potential to increase the donor pool 20-40%. However, they are largely under utilized due to poor preservation by the current method of simple cold storage (SCS). Studies show that HMP can i\nmprove graft survival in animal models. However, as warm ischemic time is increased, preliminary studies show that the current HMP solution is not sufficient to address the increased stresses of extended warm ischemia. A new solution has been developed to \nrestore depleted energy stores, maintain membrane stability, and minimize oxidation damage.         The Phase I project was highly successful in showing that the new HMP solution improved 5hr preservation of extended warm ischemic (60 mins) rat livers in b\noth isolated perfusion and transplant studies. The results showed improved recovery, a reduction in injury, and improved survival (7/9) compared with the UW solution alone (0/6).         The main goals of this Phase II SBIR are: 1) to strengthen IP protect\nion, 2) to minimize the potential of toxicity effects, 3) to reduce production costs, and 4) to begin testing the solution in a pre-clinical large animal DCD model. The following Specific Aims will accomplish these objectives: 1) determine the maximum sust\nainable warm ischemic time for livers to be reclaimed by the new perfusion solution and hypothermic machine perfusion, 2A) optimize the components and 2B) optimize the concentration of components of the new HMP solution, 3) test the new optimized HMP solut\nion in a porcine DCD liver model. To achieve these Aims, isolated perfused liver studies in the rat and porcine and transplant studies in the rat will be utilized. Accomplishing the objectives of this project will strengthen the value of the solution, incr\nease IP protection of the solution, lessen the potential for toxicity issues and form the basis for further testing in a pre-clinical large animal transplant and human ex vivo models in preparation for clinical trials. The success of this project will be d\nirectly related to the establishment of a critical partnership between the team of the transplant surgeon, the scientist and biomedical engineer who will collaboratively test and modify as needed the new HMP solution. In addition, HepatoSys, Inc. will coll\naborate with Organ Recovery Systems to test the new perfusion solution in their prototype Liver Transporter. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Donation after Cardiac Death (DCD) livers have the potential to increase the number of transplants 20-40%, however poor pr\neservation methods and solutions prevent the widespread use of these organs. A new perfusion solution combined with hypothermic machine perfusion preservation has been developed to reclaim these livers that have experienced extended periods of no blood flo\nw after cardiac death. The Phase I SBIR project was highly successful in showing that the new perfusion solution improved recovery and survival in transplant studies. This Phase II project will serve to bring this solution closer to clinical use by optimiz\ning the solution and beginning to test it in large pre-clinical animals that simulate DCD.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this project is to investigate novel methods aimed at achieving the highest possible spatial resolution with a new instrument being developed for biological microscopy. The device is referred to as a Laser-Plasma Microfluoroscope. In essen\nce, it is a miniaturized fluoroscope that uses low-energy x-rays to image individual cells and other thin samples. Specimens are placed in direct contact with a grainless fluorescent screen (scintillator) and illuminated with pulses of soft x-rays radiated\n by an extremely hot laser-produced plasma. The resulting unmagnified luminescent shadowgraph of the sample is viewed in real-time using light microscopy. The technique can be thought of as a hybrid of light microscopy and soft x-ray microscopy. The method\n produces images having extremely high depth-of-field, with three-dimensional information of overlapping features accessible using stereoscopic imaging methods or possibly tomography. Key advantages of the instrument's design are its relatively low-cost, v\nery compact size, and its ability to be used as an accessory device with ordinary light microscopes. Thus, it is not required to have a separate dedicated soft x-ray microscope. The instrument has the unique capacity to rapidly switch imaging modes between\n light microscopy and microfluoroscopy.  Previous research demonstrated a very compact Laser-Plasma Microfluoroscope that was used in conjunction with a standard inverted light microscope to produce microfluoroscopic images having a point-to-point spatial \nresolution near 200 nm. This represents the highest resolution ever achieved using fluoroscopic methods. In this project, we are seeking to dramatically improve this resolution to a level routinely below 100 nm, and below 50 nm for very thin samples. Such \nunprecedented performance levels in microfluoroscopy require the development of innovative new approaches.  Phase I work studied the technical feasibility of several approaches intended to extend the resolution performance of the current instrument below 1\n00 nm. The most promising directions for Phase II research were identified, which include applying very recently developed state-of-the-art optics in the deep-ultraviolet spectral range to this instrument. In addition to microfluoroscopy, more conventional\n microimaging modes will be investigated using the extraordinary high-performance optics being developed in this project. The goal of the Phase II effort is to produce a prototype instrument capable of extremely high-resolution imaging that is appropriatel\ny designed for subsequent Phase III commercialization. Maintaining reasonable cost and ease of use will be very high priorities with this microscope accessory. In addition to demonstrating outstanding resolution with simple test objects, we plan to apply t\nhe instrument to a real research problem during this project. The instrument being developed in this project is designed to be a relatively inexpensive accessory device that can be used with standard light microscopes in life-science laboratories. With the\n significant improvement in resolution that is achievable using this microscopy technique, it should find widespread use in such fields as medical research, cell biology, microbiology, and possibly clinical medicine. Due to the ubiquitous nature of optical\n microscopy, the commercial potential of this work is very large.",

Magnesium diboride (MgB2), as an emerging superconductor material, offers the possibility of fabrication into multifilament strand from inexpensive starting materials using conventional metalworking processes.  This project will development improved MgB2 superconductors with high critical fields and high at-field critical current density. Significant progress has been recently made for advancing the properties of MgB2, however current wires are characterized by upper critical and irreversibility fields that are too low, and most directly, critical currents that are too low in the 12 Tesla regime. This project will address these problems. The Phase I project fabricated wires with nano-powder additions for improving flux pinning and current density. Nano-ceramic, refractory metal, and metallic oxide powders were investigated.  Strands doped with either Zr-based powders or SiC were fabricated for improving critical current and upper critical fields. A third class of strands was fabricated with custom nano-powders for improving current density. Powder processing techniques were varied to optimize strand performance.  The Phase II project will fabricate MgB2 wires with improved in-field current densities, enhanced critical fields and increased connectivity. It will investigate making wires with specific classes of nano-powder additions to improve properties. Finally, a prototype solenoid coil wound with an optimized MgB2 conductor developed in this program will be fabricated.

By partnering with strategic vendors, the project will expand our current application to offer not only advanced remote-sensing data products and customized reports, but on-site, real-time weather data, GPS tracking, and full data transfer and communications networks (including audio and video). The project aims to ultimately provide end-users access to a complete team of expert analysts and engineers to gather, merge, and analyze fire-related data products through satellite communications networking. Our experts will then consolidate and simplify all the available data into custom, real-time data reports with geospatial context and delivery it to end-users to expedite high-level decision making, which can save valuable assets and lives. The platform will be amenable to the networking, visualization and analysis of a great number of issues in not only the natural resources realm, but also homeland security, disaster relief, global monitoring, and hazard mitigation.  The ability to quickly and efficiently collect, analyze, and share geospatial data (in particular, time-sensitive environmental data) across the World Wide Web is the cornerstone value proposition for this product. These combined abilities provide a critical and as-yet-unavailable\ntool for the fire management community. The project has both economic and humanistic benefits in that confinement strategies decided-on and applied during the early stages of fires can significantly reduce the cost of fire suppression by several millions of dollars. This increased information will also allow decisions to be made that keep firefighters as safe as possible. Additionally the project will offer advanced data products in formats designed specifically to address the aspects that influence these decisions. The combination of the hub solution and web browser interface as a flexible architecture, is based on open standards and therefore is agile, dynamically configurable, and interoperable holding significant value for applications such as natural disasters, pandemics, or homeland security. The overlay and visualization of that data will provide analyses of critical importance for decision and policy makers, as well as regular citizens, all seeking the best geospatial information possible and in a form they can use.",

This project will use a software environment that has demonstrated unique capabilities in modeling such flows accurately in complex and realistic geometries. These calculations tend to be enormously time consuming due to the extreme sensitivity of flow variables to small changes, the range of length scales that are to be resolved at high field values, and the stiffness caused by the multi-physical nature of the problem. This project will pursue a systematic sequence of advancements to overcome these constraints.  The Phase-I project showed promise in achieving an order of magnitude (or more) of speedup in the software. Hybrid grid and multi-grid features have been enabled in the code. A variety of implicit schemes and wall functions were studied, and run-time parameters were optimized. The Phase-II project will generalize these developments to complex flow situations.  A friendly graphical interface will be developed such that the total time from geometry to solution is minimized. A series of wall functions will be added to the code, based on the customizations made in phase-I.

Silicon carbide fiber-reinforced silicon carbide matrix composites have been shown to meet all of these requirements with the exception of the thermal conductivity requirement.  The Phase I results indicated that an engineered approach is more viable at achieving all of the requirements for the flow channel insert compared to a chemical modification of the material, which resulted in a reduced thermal conductivity, but not of the required magnitude.

Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The quantitative in situ TEM tensile technique should substantially improve our understanding of the relationship between and external applied stress and the materials\u00bf response at nano and even atomic scale, and thereby provide solid experimental parameters for optimizing the properties of components and products that result from nanoscience.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of this project is to develop rapid, accurate and reliable methods and test kits for iodine determination in urine. The methods and test kits must be inexpensive and easy-to-use to perform determinati\nons of iodine under field conditions. Dry-reagent test strip methods for detection of iodine in urine will be developed. The test strip method will detect iodine by a fast  dip and read  procedure. When the test strips are dipped in the tested sample, the \ncolor of the indicator pad will change in accordance with iodine levels. No separate chemical supply will be needed except for that included in the indicator pad. No time- consuming work with reagents such as weighing, mixing, volume measurement, etc. will\n be required.         Today, about 1.6 billion people worldwide still live under the threat of IDD complications that include: congenital myxedema (cretinism), brain damage, hypothyroidism and goiter. Because iodine deficiency could be readily cured by iod\nized salt supplementation, screening of the population in iodine-deficient regions is critical for effective planning, implementation and improvement of IDD-preventive measures. The best way to screen for iodine deficiency and intake in populations is to m\neasure iodine in urine. The screening is highly important for all poor, remote and underserved communities worldwide; it is also important in the developed world. In order to control IDD new, rapid, accurate, reliable and inexpensive iodine measurement tes\nt kits for urine need to be developed to replace currently used laboratory based methods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The primary objective of the proposed project is to develop a rapid, inexpensive, easy to use, dry-reagent method for determination of iodin\ne in urine. Determination of iodine in urine is necessary to target and monitor iodine supplementation programs worldwide. Severe iodine deficiency is rare in the United States, however, subpopulations including women of reproductive age are at risk of mil\nd to moderate iodine deficiency.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent decades the blood supply has been periodically contaminated by emerging infectious microbes with sometimes devastating consequences. Pathogens, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus \n(HCV), have caused many thousands of chronic infections and deaths in transfusion and transplant recipients prior to the implementation of post-tragedy screening. Although the current  hindsight  approach has resulted in a blood supply that is safe from kn\nown hazards, it is still vulnerable to unanticipated pathogens. We propose to validate a proactive approach to protect the blood supply against newly emerging agents and new strains of existing agents and, at the same time, enhance protection against agent\ns that are already of concern. We will develop a high-throughput nucleic acid test for analysis on the Ibis T5000 mass spectroscopy platform; the single-tube assay will use inexpensive reagents and provide detection of the known blood-borne pathogens, new \nstrains of these pathogens, and pathogens of concern that are not currently detected. The Ibis T5000 technology is uniquely suited to the fast, sensitive, and accurate detection and identification of known and newly emerging pathogens. This capability was \nsuccessfully demonstrated during the Phase I portion of this work by the creation of a single assay that has the ability to readily detect members of the extended families of six pathogens. In the proposed Phase II study, we will complete the assembly of a\n comprehensive screening test that will cover a variety of pathogens. We will first develop and validate primer pairs for the detection of parasites associated with Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi) and malaria (Plasmodium species, including falciparum, v\nivax, ovale and malariae). We will then validate the final single- tube multiplex blood screening test that will allow identification of all strains and variants of HIV-1 (Group M, subtypes A-G; Groups N and O), HIV-2, HTLV 1-3, HCV, HBV, all known flavivi\nruses (including the West Nile and Dengue viruses), all influenza viruses (including human and avian), parvoviruses (including B19), hepatitis A virus, human herpes viruses (1-3, 5,8, excluding EBV), trypanosomes, and Plasmodium species. Both calibrant and\n positive controls will be produced to support this assay. This screen will be fully validated and the system tested with large numbers of blinded samples and a large number of samples from blood bank specimens. The technology is extensible to a much broad\ner range of pathogens and will eventually provide a  seamless net  to protect the blood supply from pathogens that cause infectious disease.",

        "abstract": "IconoPsych Care, LLC is working toward commercialization of web-based mental health services which integrate the practice of video telepsychiatry with electronic medical record keeping. This research and development effort is in response to three problems: 1) the shortage of mental health providers available in rural areas , 3) stigma related to seeking mental health services, 3) the need for medical recordkeeping technology that enables improved communication between patients and mental health practitioners. Despite large rural mental health needs, very few rural communities have access to mental health services in their area. Over half of the counties in the United States have no psychiatrists, psychologists or social workers. Rural residents travel much longer distances to obtain health care services. Otherwise, rural communities must pay high costs for mental health professionals to travel to their local clinics. IconoPsych is positioned to be the first company to offer an \"online clinic\" video conference portal for mental health. Several large studies have found telepsychiatry and telecounseling by videoconference equivalent in outcome and patient satisfaction to face-to-face encounters. IconoPsych is pairing the videoconference functionality with an electronic health record, embedding the teleconferencer within the patient's electronic chart. Such a set-up will enable processes that promise to improve quality and efficiency of care, even in the context of traditional face-to-face mental health clinic visits. The patient is able to complete online questionnaires prior to the visit, e.g., from home. Questionnaire answers are formatted for use by the clinician, conveying the patient's history in a comprehensive and accurate fashion. Also, the clinician may post information for online access by the patient, facilitating understanding of the treatment plan and continuity of care. IconoPsych's \"completely portable\" online portal is to be called HomePsych. Although one or both parties are likely to connect from a clinic or community center, the patient and doctor could connect from their respective homes, given a high speed internet connection and web cam is available. If patients are given the option of seeing a psychiatrist from home, the risk of being seen entering a mental clinic is eliminated. This would allow patients to overcome the stigma barrier to seeking help.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plasmodium Genus Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (P-Genus FISH) assay targeted to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a method that detects all the species of malaria on an air-dried blood smear. PFV-FISH assay is a dual probe as\nsay for detecting and differentiating P. falciparum (PF) and P. vivax (PV) on a SINGLE air-dried thin blood smear. The P-Genus assay uses P-Genus specific probe labeled with Tamra. Thus all the Plasmodium species will fluoresce red under Texas Red filter. \nThe PFV-FISH assay uses PF and PV specific probes labeled with red and green fluorescent dyes, respectively. Thus, PF fluoresces red and PV fluoresces green under specific dual pass filters. The treatment for P. falciparum and P. vivax is different. Theref\nore, PFV-FISH assay would be very useful in areas where both P. falciparum and P. vivax are endemic. The assays are simple and in-expensive (lt  3.00/test and a one time expense of ~ 1000 for filters). The assays consists of five steps; fixation, hybridiza\ntion, washing, counterstaining and viewing the processed smear under a fluorescent microscope. The total assay time is less than 1 hour. In Phase I, we optimized the fixation and hybridization conditions and set up Quality Control Procedures for the FISH a\nssays. We demonstrated that the limit of detection was 1 to 9 parasites/300 fields at 1000X and that the FISH assays are very reproducible. Based on a clinical study performed on over 300 patient smears, the assay sensitivity was better than Giemsa. As com\npared to PCR the FISH assay sensitivity was 83-89%, whereas Giemsa sensitivity was between 54-60%. FISH assay specificity as compared to PCR was 100% for both assays. Specific Aims for Phase II (1) Purchase of equipment for Clinical Study and hoods for pre\nparing reagents for kits. (2) Kit manufacturing and determination of shelf-life of reagents. (3) Analytical Sensitivity to be performed on smears prepared by CDC from in monkey blood for P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. malariae; from chimpanzee blood with P\n. ovale. (4) Clinical Trials - 4a: Training and competency of Clinical Sites to perform assay. 4b: Reproducibility determination at Clinical Sites to perform assay; and 4c: Smear preparation and assay performance on whole blood samples at Clinical Sites. (\n5) Evaluations of inexpensive Microscopes and Filters. Proceeding to Phase III will be based on completing the clinical trials and demonstrating specificity of at least 95% specificity and sensitivity equivalent to or better than Giemsa stained smear as co\nmpared to PCR. Specific Aims for Phase III (1) Filing 510K or PMA. (2)Set up manufacturing in Kenya. (3): Marketing. (4) Work with WHO to obtain their stamp of approval. This will avoid long delays in approval of the tests in many countries. (5) Develop PM\nO-FISH assay for detecting and differentiating P. malariae and P. ovale on a SINGLE air-dried thin blood smear.        It is estimated that worldwide there are more than 350-500 million people infected with malaria parasites each year. Between 700,000 to 2\n.7 million people die of malaria every year, of which 75% are African children. Malaria can be life-threatening disease, especially in children, if left untreated and therefore, it is important to have a quick and accurate diagnosis. Even though malaria is\n a frequently encountered disease in many developing countries, it is difficult to make the right diagnosis relying on clinical signs only. Drug selection for the treatment of malaria depends on species of malaria present. Delayed or missed diagnosis of fa\nlciparum malaria increases the risk of complicated or severe disease, which may be fatal vulnerable populations. P. falciparum from much of the world is largely chloroquine resistant and thus the standard treatment for P. vivax cannot be used. To prevent u\nnnecessary anti-malarial treatment and future drug-resistance strains of malaria parasites, it is important to confirm clinical suspicious with a good labora",

The outcome will be blue emitting Plasma-spheres and improve red and green Plasma-spheres for use in a full color flexible plasma display. Plasma-spheres are placed on flexible electrically addressable arrays with the ionized gas glowing when a voltage is applied across the Plasma-spheres. This is due to the conversion of UV into visible light.  If successful this process will allow carpet size displays to be produced at a fraction of the cost of rigid glass displays. Unlike traditional one-piece rigid plasma display technology, the Plasma-sphere pixels are produced separately and applied to large flexible electrically addressable substrates using low cost wide-web processes. The separation of pixel production from substrate fabrication provides several advantages; 1) shortened cycle time (by eliminating a 19 hour gas processing step), 2) higher yields, 3) lower capital equipment investment, 4) lower production costs, 5) longer life, 6) smaller form factor, and 7) a greater percentage of biodegradable material.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder cancer is the 5th most expensive cancer in the US accounting for estimated $5.3 billion in direct medical costs in 2005. With bladder cancer patients having a 10 year survival rate of 77% and its known high rate of recurrence and progression, there is a need for the development of more sophisticated surveillance tools. Currently up to 6 random biopsies of normal appearing urothelium are taken in patients presenting with superficial bladder cancer at the time of the resection or biopsy of the visible tumor. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a new real-time optical cross-sectional imaging modality, capable of visualizing microstructural tissue changes associated with cancer and other pathological conditions. OCT systems like the Imalux Niris(tm) Imaging System can potentially guide or replace biopsies, as well as guide surgical treatment. It can detect changes associated with bladder carcinoma or even precancer conditions like dysplasia. However, the existing OCT systems have a slow image acquisition rate and can only perform single point imaging; therefore their ability to survey large surface organs like the bladder is limited. To be able to acquire OCT images at substantially higher rate (video rate), without compromising image quality would allow physicians/clinicians to survey large organs in an efficient amount of time. By detecting and treating additional foci of disease at a single point-of-care visit, video rate OCT during treatment could significantly decrease the recurrence rate of disease and thereby decrease the frequency of follow-up cystoscopy evaluations. We have an original, innovative concept for creation of a fast-scanning Frequency Domain OCT (FD- OCT) system based on common path topology. The FD-OCT image acquisition principle insures superior image quality at a fast acquisition rate. The common path optical topology, used in our Niris device, is insensitive to fiberoptic probe length, fiber type and polarization distortions associated with probe bending. Thus, our proposed imaging system is a video rate OCT device capable of endoscopic applications with uncompromised image quality. In Phase I, an experimental breadboard of the new optical layout will be constructed utilizing a tunable light source. In Phase II, a prototype OCT system with fast scanning, real time image acquisition and visualization will be built using the optical layout with proven feasibility from Phase I. Verification of the prototype system will be completed via performance testing, including ex vivo OCT imaging of biotissues. The long term goal of the project is to develop a Video Rate Optical Coherence Tomography System (VR-OCT) for early cancer visualization that will provide clinicians enhanced capabilities by allowing them to scan and survey large organs in real-time in addition to performing point imaging of smaller anatomical areas.",

Since Phase I we have cloned and expressed ~15,000 genes from nearly 20 different pathogens associated with biodefense and emerging infectious diseases. By probing the arrays with sera from individuals with well-defi\nned clinical stages of infection, we have built up a vast dataset concerning which antibodies are present in different stages of disease. By using statistical and bioinformatic algorithms, we can derive antigen sets that, when combined, can provide the bas\nis for serological tests able to discriminate between different infections, or even between different stages of the same infection. Phase II, ImmPORT will establish a GMP manufacturing facility and a Clinical Research Lab to offer diagnostic products and s\nervices to developers of novel vaccines, physicians and Phama. At the head of a product pipeline will be serodiagnostic immunostrips that will be evaluated for discriminating orthopoxvirus infections from clinically similar rash infections and for diagnosi\nng TORCH infections associated with problems during pregnancy. Aim 1: Clone an additional 2000 genes from various rash causing organisms and combine these with an existing inventory of orthopoxvirus and herpes viruses. These will printed on arrays and, in \ncollaboration with colleagues at the CDC, arrays will be probed with well characterized sera to define immunodominant and serodiagnostic antigens. From these data we will produce prototype immunostrips for manufacture and evaluation at CDC. Aim 2: Establis\nh a GMP protein purification and diagnostic reagent manufacturing facility at ImmPORT. The facility will manufacture protein arrays and immunostrips for its Clinical Research Laboratory , and assay kits that will be sold to biomedical research labs and ref\nerence laboratories, and as a pivotal FDA-required assay to support licensure of clinical products.

As existing therapies do not significantly increase survival rate, there is an urgent need to develop newer therapi\nes that can augment the existing treatments. The goal of the proposed work is to produce a safe and effective targeted chemotherapy for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To this end, a rapidly internalizing, humanized, anti-EGP-1 MAb, hR\nS7, linked to a potent topoisomerase 1 inhibitor, SN-38, was designed and evaluated in the SBIR Phase I study. The immunoconjugate, which was designed to allow for the intact intratumoral liberation of the drug, maintained its antigen-binding property and \ndrug potency, and produced significant and specific therapeutic efficacy in a nude mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, a 7-fold greater dose than that used for therapy was nontoxic. The drug component is the pharmacologically active form of an\n already approved cancer drug, CPT-11, which is advantageous in that the safety issues related to the drug are already well documented. The successful SBIR Phase I feasibility research portends a high potential for translation to novel therapeutic strategi\nes. The Phase II program will focus on cGMP manufacture and expanded preclinical studies. Specifically, the conjugate manufacture will be optimized, its storage format will be finalized, and a non-GMP lot (2 g) and two cGMP lots (2W5 g) of the conjugate wi\nll be prepared and evaluated for shelf-life stability. The product will be evaluated in a second model of non-small cell lung cancer and a CPT-11-refractory model, tested for potential immunogenicity due to the drug and the linker, and assessed for therape\nutic window and toxicity in nude mice. Most importantly, the product safety will be determined in a non-human primate species, which will delineate the safe starting dose in human. Finally, an Investigational New Drug application will be submitted to the F\nDA for approval to start a clinical Phase I dose-escalation trial in NSCLC patients in the SBIR Phase III period.

The Phase II project will focus on advancing this product for multiple myel\noma, a common plasma cell malignancy that is incurable at this time. The average 5-year survival rate for these patients is only 30%, and there is thus a continued need for the development of newer therapies. The proposed product consists of a unique, huma\nnized, anti-CD74 monoclonal antibody linked covalently to multiple molecules of the chemotherapeutic, doxorubicin. This agent was shown previously to induce dramatic cures in immune-compromised mice carrying human tumor xenografts of the disease.

Using the existing optimized procedure, a preliminary non-GMP preparation of the conjugate will be undertaken to test the scale-up process under controlled conditions, followed by a 5-g\n preparation and a 10-g preparation under cGMP conditions. Other aspects of the project will pertain to determinations of product stabilities to protracted storage, and validation of assays for various characterization and product-release criteria. Compara\ntive cardiotoxicity of the conjugated versus free form of the drug will be assayed in an in vitro experiment. Preclinical toxicology of the product will be evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys, non-human primate species expressing the CD74 antigen similar to hu\nmans.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias occurring in patients with structurally abnormal hearts are the most important arrhythmias in contemporary cardiology.1-3 they represent the most frequently encounter\ned tachycardias, account for the most morbidity and mortality, and, despite much progress, remain therapeutic challenges. Invasive studies of the electrical activity of the heart (electrophysiologic studies) are often used in the diagnosis and therapy of a\nrrhythmias and many arrhythmias can be cured by selective destruction of critical electrical pathways with radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation. Attempts at applying ablation to atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia have been made. Success has b\neen limited, however, by the long time duration of procedures, resulting from the difficulty of creating continuous linear lesions in a setting where areas of ablated myocardium cannot be directly visualized. Continuous linear lesions, without gaps, can bl\nock critical arrhythmogenic circuits and reduce the amount of electrically contiguous arrhythmoginic substrate, thereby eliminating arrhythmias. We hypothesize that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with MRI-compatible diagnostic and therapeutic systems; c\nan allow electrophysiology studies and catheter ablation to be performed without x-ray radiation. We also hypothesize that this technology will provide the ability to visualize ablation lesions, which should greatly simplify production of continuous linear\n lesions, and should improve the effectiveness of ablation procedures in general. In addition to electrophysiology, these methods may be applicable to guiding other diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. In Phase I, we completed a prototype steerable ablat\nion catheter that has allowed us to target any area of the endocardial surface of the heart. We also developed integral filters for protecting the catheters from excessive heating during MR imaging. We tested the prototype catheters in animals to show that\n electrophysiology studies can be done under MR guidance alone, that lesions can be produced and imaged, that linear lesions can be produced, and that MRI has sufficient resolution to allow detection of significant gaps in the lesions. In Phase II, we will\n develop, test, and prepare for manufacturing and marketing an improved, clinical-grade version of the ablation system, and apply for FDA approval for testing the technology. The improved, clinical-grade catheter system will incorporate all capabilities pr\neviously tested individually. The improved catheter system will both ablate cardiac tissue and sense cardiac activity. The improved catheter will also have improved filtering and shielding to allow all current clinical MRI pulse sequences to be used for im\naging. Further, the improved catheter system will have sensors incorporated into the tip of the catheters to allow accurate determination of the position of the catheter tip, enabling real-time manipulation of the imaging plane to always include the cathet\ner tip. Finally, the improved catheter system will incorporate temperature sensors for monitoring ablation temperatures at the catheter tip. Rhythm abnormalities of the heart, where the heart beats too fast, affect millions of people in the United States. \nThese abnormalities can cause substantial symptoms and/or death, and some can be cured by cauterizing (ablating) a small portion of the heart. Methods are being developed to use the real-time and high quality imaging of Magnetic Resonance Imaging to improv\ne substantially the safety and efficacy of these ablations, as well as extend these methods to procedures involving other organ systems.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NIH Roadmap recognizes the need for system-level, multidisciplinary research to successfully fight diseases such as cancer. However, collecting, integrating, and analyzing heterogeneous sets of data represent a subs\ntantial undertaking, both technical and managerial, that requires resources not available to most investigators. As the field continues to move into a direction that requires effective integration of diverse knowledge bases and technologies, there will be \nan increasing need for a robust, sophisticated, and commercial-strength bioinformatics framework that will allow researchers to meld their distinct expertise and most efficiently apply their contributions toward a comprehensive understanding of biological \nphenomena.     During the Phase I project, the project team performed a critical evaluation of available technologies and information resources and developed a proof-of-concept visual programming software to integrate protein mass spectrometry (MS) and gen\ne expression microarray (MA) data. During the proposed Phase II work, the software will be extended to allow multidisciplinary teams of researchers to meaningfully integrate knowledge about genes and proteins toward the systematic understanding of cancer b\niology. The proposed technology will be built upon an existing INCOGEN bioinformatics tool, VIBE, and will leverage extensive complementary expertise at the collaborating institutions (Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins University, Eastern Virginia Medical School,\n Northwestern University, and Biosystemix), as well as available community resources. To ensure a bioinformatics tool that is robust, extensible, and useful for cancer research, the software development will be performed in parallel with a multidisciplinar\ny, integrative biological study of renal cell carcinoma (RCC, or kidney cancer). The rare combination of solid experimental design, sophisticated bioinformatics, and ability to verify the results using state-of-the-art biological methods will enable us to \nnot only deliver a powerful bioinformatics tool to the community, but also provide significant contributions toward the systems understanding of RCC. The discovery of potential biomarkers and therapeutic strategies through this multidisciplinary project of\nfers clinically-relevant IP that can be licensed to pharmaceutical companies. In turn, these clinically relevant discoveries will serve to validate the approach and tools developed during this project, thereby driving the commercial success of the software\n.     The project objectives include: 1) Identification of statistically/diagnostically significant MA and MS features, 2) Merging of MA and MS data sets and generation of relation matrix, 3) Creation of cofluctuation networks and incorporation of existing\n biological knowledge into the networks, 4) Development of network visualization tools, and 5) Refinement of networks and biological verification of hypotheses in statistical and biological contexts.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The lack of effective syste\nmic therapy for complex diseases such as cancer is, in part, due to a fundamental lack of understanding of the molecular events that result in cellular transformation, carcinogenesis, and disease progression. The project team proposes to develop a software\n tool that will allow multidisciplinary teams of researchers to meaningfully integrate knowledge about genes and proteins toward the systematic understanding of cancer biology; thereby leading to significant health benefits associated with early diagnosis \nand early and appropriate treatment.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultimate goal of treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is to prevent degeneration of brain neurons and synapses. We screened a variety of generic drugs for neuroprotective effect using cell culture and animals mode\nls of AD immune pathology. One widely used generic drug with anti-inflammatory properties was found to be highly neuroprotective in cell culture and animal models. Although the same drug showed some clinical benefit, its level of effect was not sufficient \nto offer a useful therapy. For this reason, we sought to design more potent forms of this generic drug lead. A target discovery program has now identified 4 classes of analogs derived from the parent compound that show gt20-fold increase in neuroprotective\n effect in vitro and improved disease-modifying action against AD pathology in vivo. Importantly, these novel analogs have been designed to eliminate the major dose-limiting toxic side effect of the parent drug. This Phase 2 SBIR proposal seeks to further \noptimize the analogs for brain penetrating capacity while retaining potency and margins of safety in vivo. Successful completion of Phase 2 will allow selection of a drug, and its backup, for final pre-clinical development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At the \npresent time there are no effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease. This dementia is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of memory, declining motor function, and behavioral changes. Death of neurons caused by toxins generated Alzheimer's\n disease in the brain is thought to be the cause of the dementia. More research is needed to develop effective treatments that will both reduce brain injury and improve intellectual functions in the Alzheimer's disease patient. The proposal submitted here \nencompasses pre-clinical research on compounds that may help neuron survival and brain function. Exploration of these agents should accelerate the national effort to identify therapies for the prevention of dementia and /or the improvement cognitive functi\non in the Alzheimer's Disease population. .",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II SBIR application proposes the development of an interactive, web-based nutrition and physical activity (PA) program, called www.JiveforFive.com, to be offered to adolescents ages 14 to 18 through strategic\n distribution channels including schools, health insurers, and personal health management programs for individuals and families. This program is based on the 5-A-Day for Better Health Program and the USDA guidelines for nutrition and physical activity, as \nwell as theories of behavior change, social learning, and adolescent development. It is well established that poor dietary intake, minimal fruit and vegetable (FandV) consumption, excessive sweetened beverage intake, and low frequency of physical activity \nincrease the risk for obesity and serious health concerns, including cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Obesity prevention initiatives are critical, as the percentage of overweight children has nearly quadrupled over the past three decades. Current effor\nts in nutrition and PA education have either met with limited success, or when successful, have involved a tremendous amount of resources. The proposed Phase II product will be tested in schools as (1) adolescents spend the majority of their day in educati\nonal settings, and (2) schools are increasingly limiting access to health and PA programs due to budget cuts and reallocation of resources. Notably, gaps in targeted education for the older adolescent and diminishing resources in high schools place the res\nponsibility on the teen, parents or health insurers to address prevention/intervention efforts. Thus, there is a need for evidence-based nutrition and PA programs that are versatile, economical and easily integrated into the lifestyles of older adolescents\n. Thus, JiveforFive.com will serve as a comprehensive and convenient healthy lifestyle program for millions of adolescents across a variety of settings. The NIDDK omnibus solicitation (PA-07-280) supports the development of computerized interventions for i\nncreasing physical activity as well as assessing energy intake in the prevention of obesity. JiveforFive.com capitalizes on computer programming algorithms to personalize and tailor nutrition and PA information to meet the current needs of each adolescent,\n while providing developmentally appropriate and appealing content in the area of body image. Social networking and interactive games address both the importance of peers for adolescents and the high appeal of computer-based games, in an effort to engage a\ndolescents in the learning process. JiveforFive.com will integrate the use of wireless activity monitors to further enhance motivational and self-management aspects of the web-based program and increase rates of physical activity. If JiveforFive.com demons\ntrates effectiveness when it is fully developed in Phase II, it is likely that teens, parents, school personnel, and health insurers would regard it as a cost-effective way to provide nutrition and PA education for high school-aged adolescents. Public Heal\nth Relevance: JiveforFive.com addresses a key public health issue of obesity prevention among adolescents ages 14-18 by focusing on nutrition education, physical activity motivation, and body image concerns through the use of a web-based program utilizing \nalgorithms to personalize and tailor health goals.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II application continues development of the Pharmaceutical Risk Internet Surveillance Monitor (PRISM), an innovative approach to postmarketing surveillance of indicators suggesting diversion/abuse of opioid p\nharmaceutical agents. Public health relevance of PRISM includes providing reliable and timely data to allow health, law enforcement, industry, and community leaders take steps to limit potential damage associated with an outbreak of pharmaceutical drug abu\nse. PRISM will be the first, systematically developed and hybrid or partially automated Internet monitoring service to track, at a product-specific level, the chatter of recreational users of pharmaceutical analgesics as they discuss their use/abuse of suc\nh drugs. Those who abuse prescription opioids have open access to Web sites, providing an unvarnished picture of users' communications about these drugs, including ideas and beliefs about the drugs as well as discussions of trends and preferences. Thus, In\nternet monitoring of drug-related messages may be useful for anticipating an increased risk of an abuse outbreak. The potential of these Internet data has not been exploited in a systematic manner to inform drug policy and planning. In Phase I, collaborati\non with software developers of MIT's General Inquirer (GI) explored the contributions of automated natural language processing methods to the unstructured, fragmented, but revealing messages posted by the online community of substance abusers. Reliable cod\nes were achieved by human coders, supporting the feasibility of classifying content of Internet posts into meaningful categories of endorsing and discouraging abuse of different products. Completely automating such coding may be as yet out of reach. Furthe\nrmore, such codes may not have been the most meaningful qualitative information to draw from the posts. However, the overall level of chatter, based on counts of mentions of specific products, did appear to relate to measures of the attractiveness for abus\ne of target products. There are significant benefits of archiving such posts, using computer processing of raw posts to prep them for human coders, and searching among thousands of archived posts for selected topics of interest (e.g., sources, extraction m\nethods, adverse events, etc.). In Phase II, we will (1) develop software to find, harvest, and archive posts from eligible Web sites for subsequent analyses, (2) refine the nature and types of qualitative questions, (3) develop and test methods of using au\ntomated processing of raw posts to improve the reliability and efficiency of human coding, (4) continue exploration of methods to enhance automation of message coding, (5) refine automated data mining of posts discussions on specific topics including (extr\naction, sources of drug, extreme reactions, etc.) to target drugs, and (6) test external validity of data collected by PRISM. Given the extraordinary financial implications for pharmaceutical companies needing to demonstrate to the FDA that they have an ad\nequate Risk Minimization Action Plan prior to approval for new, potentially addictive medications, a tool like PRISM holds remarkable commercial appeal.                             Public Health Relevance: A system like PRISM to monitor the chatter about a\nbusable substances on Internet is widely recognized as having extraordinary public health importance by the FDA, DEA, and pharmaceutical companies. Ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of abuse trends detected from these Internet so\nurces will be essential to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health programs, closely integrated with timely dissemination of these data to those responsible for prevention and control.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The wealth of biological and biomedical data constantly being generated promises dramatic advancement in the life sciences. To realize this promise, this pool of rapidly expanding information needs to be efficiently int\negrated, that is, combined in such a way that it can be queried to extract relevant data that can be subsequently analyzed to answer meaningful research questions. The main objective of this proposal is to develop the GeneTegra System, an information integ\nration solution that provides a common interaction environment to query data and knowledge from multiple sources. Two main obstacles have to be overcome in order to attain an effective integration of knowledge from different data sources: syntactic heterog\neneity, where data sources have different representation and access mechanisms; and semantic variability, where similar lexical terms may refer to multiple concepts or dissimilar terms refer to the same concept. The GeneTegra System addresses these obstacl\nes through the use of Semantic Web technologies: ontologies constructed using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) as a common data and knowledge representation for data sources of diverse formats, automated mechanisms for the generation and maintenance of thes\ne ontology representations, and a robust system architecture based on reusable, service-oriented mediators. The core of the proposed system consists of general algorithms, procedures, and mechanisms developed during Phase I of this project, that enable the\n automatic generation of ontologies, the automated identification of semantic correspondences between ontology models, and the creation and execution of queries over these ontology- modeled, distributed, heterogeneous sources. In Phase II, the GeneTegra Sy\nstem will be developed, implemented, and tested as a human-centered solution building on the core components developed during Phase I, incorporating a highly usable interface for query creation and execution, a mechanism for registration, sharing, and re-u\nse of information using Web Services standards, a mechanism for determining quality of data and query reliability, and a security and privacy subsystem that allows the construction of collaborative communities while ensuring that users are properly authent\nicated and authorized to access information through the system. The GeneTegra System will be designed and evaluated to specifically address the integration of sources relevant to investigations of genotype-phenotype associations and to the identification o\nf genes responsible for human diseases and conditions.

As the frequency of digital communications approaches the frequency at which microwave ovens work, the importance of the dielectric properties of the substrate material on which digital circuits are formed is becoming of critical importance. This project will use material and processing strategies to increase the physical properties and reduce the cost of fibers based on cyclic olefin copolymers. These fibers will be woven into fabrics and made into prototype circuit board materials to show their utility. The anticipated results of the project is a fully developed fiber which is ready to be commercialized which can be combined with glass fiber to reduce the dielectric constant and dielectric loss of high frequency circuit board substrate materials, but in all other ways is compatible with processes and materials used to manufacture these circuits.  The broader impact/commercial potential will be the achievement of processing blends of amorphous and semi-crystalline polymers in fiber extrusion at speeds approaching 2 kilometers per minute. If successful, this project will introduce a low cost material that enables further advances in digital data processing and communication, with all the incumbent benefits, doing so with reduced energy dissipation in the circuit board materials. The materials\nare also lighter weight than their glass fiber predecessors, and therefore reduce the weight of mobile electronic and communication devices.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The functionality and user acceptance of prosthetic limbs can be substantially improved by providing sensory feedback.  The goal is to develop a sensory system which prosthetists can incorporate (or retrofit) into prese\nntly available myoelectric arms.  The system is non-invasive and based on an array of vibrating actuators on the skin (vibrotactors) used to input coded sensory information from the prosthesis to the skin of the residual limb.  Three categories of sensory \ninformation will be targeted for powered arms:  grasp force, object slippage and either wrist rotation (i.e. pronation/supination) or span of finger opening.  Prior work in developing vibrotactile strategies for sensory substitution has shown it is a promi\nsing approach.  The implementation of that research into the marketplace has been held up by a lack of vibrotactors that are small, power efficient and that can provide local stimulation with little cross-talk to adjacent units.  Further, optimal vibrotact\nile feedback codes require that the vibration frequency and intensity be independent.  Available vibrators such as cell phone rotary motor based vibrators or traditional solenoid based vibrators have strong co-dependence of vibration frequency and intensit\ny.  Further, solenoid based vibrators are only efficient at their resonant frequency.  A substantial portion of the Phase 1 effort was directed towards developing and testing a novel engineering approach to the actuators which de-coupled intensity from fre\nquency.  A prototype actuator and driving technique was developed which provides for independent frequency and intensity, is small, provides focal stimulation, consumes minimal power and will be inexpensive to manufacture.  This prototype was tested on sev\neral non-amputee and amputee subjects with excellent results.  The goal of this PHASE 2 project is to develop a sensory feedback system for users of powered artificial arms to provide reliable, useful position, force, and slippage information.  The vibrati\non actuators will be further developed into a readily manufacturable, inexpensive device.  These actuators will be smaller in diameter than a stack of 5 US dimes, weigh less than 10 grams, consume minimal power; be inexpensive to manufacture; be reliable f\nor one year of typical operation, and disposable.  Joint position sensors (eg wrist rotation) and force sensors (eg pinch force) will be selected for various prostheses.  A microprocessor will convert sensory data from the prosthetic sensor to appropriate \nactuations using the novel sensory coding algorithms demonstrated in Phase1.  The sensory feedback system will be tested extensively with 10 upper extremity amputee subjects to: 1) optimize the coding strategy; 2) develop a software training aid; 3) demons\ntrate the reliability of the system components and the system; and 4) determine the improvement in functionality of the prostheses when the sensory system is employed.  RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: The incorporation of sensory feedback could greatly improve\n the quality of prosthesis control.  Peripheral knowledge of object contact and grip force and object slippage will allow amputees to have increased confidence when using their prosthesis as well as make it possible to handle fragile items such as finger f\noods, engage in a hand shake greeting, or provide infant or animal care.  Such improvements in quality of life are important for amputees.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): According to the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center report, carbon monoxide is the leading cause of accidental death by poisoning. More recent estimates reveal 3,500-4,000 people die each year due to accident\nal CO exposure; and an additional 10,000 seek medical attention. Carbon monoxide exposure is especially dangerous for unborn babies, infants, and children because they have smaller bodies and faster metabolisms -- they absorb carbon monoxide quicker and at\n lower levels. Toxic levels of carbon monoxide can be up to ten times higher in the fetus than the mother. Possible mitigation requires a reliable, early warning CO detector. High sensitivity and complete reversibility are two desirable characteristics tha\nt are lacking severely in CO detectors currently available in the market. During Phase I, InnoSense LLC has demonstrated a thin film-based CO sensor sensitive to 5 ppm CO responding within five seconds. The sensor has also shown reversibility within five s\neconds. The Phase II project would: (a) Fine-tune the CO indicator for shortening the response/recovery times by 50% or more, (b) Conduct extensive performance studies to evaluate for how long and how effectively this sensor would perform reliably in the p\nresence of contaminants likely to be found in a typical household. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sensitive to Low PPM and Reversible Sensor for CO Phase II Project Narrative A key goal of the Phase II project is to fine-tune the CO indicator formulation. The Ph\nase II work builds on the thin film formulation developed during Phase I utilizing ormosil matrix. This formulation strategy along with the fiber bundle approach complements the Principal Investigator's earlier patents covering basic ingredients of the CO \nindicator. Together, the sensing platform is expected to offer devices that would have multi-analyte detection capability. InnoSense LLC has systematically assembled and developed chemical sensor capabilities, materials science expertise, and home-built op\ntoelectronic test and measurement devices. The company has also assembled a competent scientific team having seventy person-years of experience developing commercially viable sensor products. Given these resources and its commitment to the area of medicall\ny relevant sensors, InnoSense LLC is uniquely positioned to make effective use of the Phase II funding to study development of this life-saving device especially for a vulnerable portion of our populace - the elderly, infants and pregnant women carrying th\ne unborn.",

        "abstract": "The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and present for commercialization natural graphite (NG) reinforced Al (AlGr).  In this project, inexpensive natural graphite flake (NGF) will be manufactured into a preform and pressure infiltrated with Al-Si alloys to form composites with thermal conductivities (TC) from 600 W/mK to 750 W/mK and corresponding thermal expansion (CTE) from 7 to 4 ppm/K.  CTE is specified by controlling volume fraction of NGF.  TC is 1.5 to 1.9 times oxygen free high conductivity (OFHC) Cu at 25% of the mass and comparable volumetric cost to Cu with customized CTE enabling thermally efficient direct die attach.  High TC results from reaction of Si from the alloy with NGF surfaces to form low thermal impedance SiC interface.  These properties result from innovative preform architecture.  In addition, quasi-isotropic TC values (~700 W/mK) are achievable through further preform design.  For every 10C decrease in operating temperature, the life of an electronic device is doubled.  Conversely, more efficient cooling schemes enable devices to be manufactured with higher performance at higher power densities and in smaller spaces.  The materials developed in this project would enable such performance enhancements, and at lower cooling costs.  The proposed technology would reduce the dependence on copper for electronic thermal management applications and would find serious application in space and military radar and communication\nsystems as well as laser diode heatsinks, heat spreaders for notebook computers and other consumer electronics.",

The 18-lesson program will consist of a Teachers Manual including goals and objectives for each lesson, lesson scripts, class handouts, homework assignments, additional resources, and skill-based ev\naluation tools. In addition, the program will include a DVD with 18 multimedia PowerPoint-like presentations with integrated video and audio clips that are designed to be used while teaching each lesson. The program will be designed for use in a range of e\nducational settings including public and private high schools, and juvenile justice, after school, faith-based, and community-based programs. Program development in Phase I consisted of media literacy and substance abuse scientists, and substance abuse pre\nvention specialists across the country completing a web-based survey to guide the creation of the program Scope and Sequence and the first three prototypic lessons. Three methods were used to gather feedback for the revision process 1) high school students\n participated in three focus groups, 2) three media literacy and education experts provided a written critique, and 3) a public high school teacher piloted the three lessons in each of her three 9th grade health classes. These groups provided feedback abou\nt the format, goals, and content of the curriculum as well as the feasibility of disseminating the proposed program with high school students. Consumer satisfaction ratings from the teenage focus group participants, expert reviewers, and the pilot teacher \nwere extremely positive suggesting that the program prototype was promising, and ready for further development, completion, and evaluation. Thus, the present application proposes two primary goals including: (1) completion of all program components includi\nng the curriculum as well as supplemental program and evaluation materials, followed by pilot teaching of the program in two high school, health education classes, and (2) execution of an experiment with random assignment of high school teachers to interve\nntion and wait-list control groups to evaluate the effectiveness of the program in changing the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs and increasing media literacy-related critical thinking skills of stu\ndents.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue engineering and cell therapy is a new and exciting approach to the treatment of acute and chronic diseases. The potential success of this therapeutic approach lies in the growing appreciation that most disease pr\nocesses are not due to the lack of a single protein but develop due to alterations in complex interactions of a variety of cell products. Cell therapy is dependent on cell and tissue culture methodologies to expand specific cells to replace important diffe\nrentiated processes deranged or lost in various disease states. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome, or SIRS, is a catastrophic sequela of a variety of clinical insults, including infection, pancreatitis, and cardiopulmonary bypass, and claims over\n forty thousand lives in the U.S. each year. The exceptionally high mortality associated with the syndrome is due in part to the development of the highly lethal multiple system organ failure syndrome (MOF) in a subset of patients with SIRS. The sequential\n failure of organ systems apparently unrelated to the site of the initial insult has been correlated with altered plasma cytokine levels observed in sepsis. The data accrued in this Phase II proposal will develop a miniature cellular device which will be a\nccessed via an extracorporeal catheter system. This extracorporeal device, named bioartificial renal epithelial cell system (BRECS), will be developed and tested for efficacy in treating SIRS and sepsis in a pre-clinical large animal model of septic shock.\n At the end of Phase II, the developed pre-clinical data will be used for an IND application for the clinical testing of this therapeutic cellular device in treatment of septic shock and SIRS. Relevance: The goal of this proposal is to develop a cell based\n therapy that can be used to reverse the serious clinical events associated with patients who develop septic shock. The success of this project would decrease the very high mortality rate of septic shock and therefore contribute to patient recovery from th\nis devastating disease process. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop a bioartificial renal epithelial cell system (BRECS) that effectively adds therapeutic value to a variety of disease processes. The target application\n is in the treatment of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis. Severe sepsis with SIRS occurs in 200,000 patients annually in the U.S. and has a mortality rate of 30 40%, even with use of intensive care units and broad spectrum antibiot\nics. This device would greatly reduce the multiorgan effects of sepsis and SIRS, thus improving the clinical outcome of patients affected by these disease processes.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II SBIR project will develop manufacturing capabilities for MEMS electrical switches with a novel dual substrate design approach. The approach consists of dividing the switch components between two substrates, with the moving portion on an upper substrate, and the stationary contacts on a lower substrate. The moving portion will be formed from a stress-free layer of single crystal silicon, and so has no tendency to warp or distort. Using two substrates allows the contacts to be fully exposed throughout processing, and cleaned just before the substrates are bonded together to form the switch, thereby minimizing the contact resistance of the switch. Because the contacts are exposed, they can be effectively cleaned just prior to sealing in the hermetic seal between the two wafers, thereby reducing the contact resistance of the junctions. This Phase II effort will take the improved design into volume manufacturing to produce higher power, higher frequency, lower contact resistance and/or smaller footprint switches than competing ones while being produced at lower costs.  If successful, the approach described here will be used to produce MEMS cantilevered switches for a broad range of applications, from DC power handling applications to RF and radar applications. Because of their high current-carrying, high frequency characteristics with small size and low cost, the MEMS switches may serve as viable replacements for FET switches or micro relays in a wide range of devices. The approach may also be\napplicable to other sorts of MEMS devices, such as sensors and actuators, which may have a movable component suspended over a substrate which interacts with a fixed component on the substrate. This approach may therefore fundamentally alter how these devices are manufactured, and open up a wide range of applications not presently served by MEMS devices.",

Thus, a key DOE objective is to reduce the amount of catalysts while achieving improved performance.  It has been found that when commercial fuel cell electrodes are modified with a very thin layer of cheap carbon nanofibers, the activity of catalysts on these electrodes goes up many times, allowing far less catalyst to be used.  This project will apply this nanofiber modification technology to commercial fuel cell electrodes.  In Phase I, a series of commercial fuel cell electrodes were nanofiber-modified in order to identify (1) the type of nanofiber that works best, (2) the optimum thickness for the nanofiber layer, and (3) the best way to apply the catalyst.  Phase II will involve a thorough development program to use nanofiber modification to improve the existing products of a major manufacturer, which will be a collaborator on the project.  An improved product, which uses less catalyst and is readily manufactured, will be demonstrated.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The nanofiber modification of commercial fuel cell electrodes should improve catalyst output by many times, reducing the required catalyst content.  In turn, this improvement will drive down the cost for fuel cells in hybrid vehicles, backup power, portable power, etc.  The manufacturing partner on the project is a worldwide supplier of fuel cell materials, which means that the technology should have a large impact.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Image reconstruction in x-ray computer tomography (CT) scanners lags far behind the data acquisition. For example a whole-body scan using the latest 64-slice medical CT scanners, with sub-millimeter slice thickness, wh\nich takes about 10 seconds to acquire, requires about 20 times as long to reconstruct. This computational lag occurs despite the use of expensive special-purpose computing hardware. Faster image reconstruction is critical for life-threatening trauma cases,\n and is key to enhancing the use of x-ray CT as a dynamic real-time imaging modality for cardiac imaging, fluoroscopy and interventional applications. Furthermore, faster reconstruction is needed to enable new applications using computationally demanding i\nterative reconstruction methods that can overcome metal artifacts, improve image quality, and reduce the x-ray dose required to achieve acceptable image quality. Similarly, faster reconstruction is desired in CT security imaging, especially for scanning of\n checked luggage at airports. To date, acceleration of image reconstruction in CT scanners has been achieved only by scaling the computing hardware. However, because of the ever-increasing speed demands, simply scaling the hardware (parallelizing, upsizing\n, or using more processors) carries a prohibitive price tag. The objective of this project is to achieve very large speed-ups through the use of more clever image reconstruction algorithms (i.e. more clever mathematics), which were developed and patented a\nt the University of Illinois and have been licensed to InstaRecon. These algorithms reduce the mathematical operation counts for the reconstruction by factors of 10 to 50 for 512 W 512 pixel images typical in medical applications. We propose to develop, ev\naluate, and validate a hardware prototype of an ultra-fast algorithmically-accelerated image reconstruction engine for three- dimensional cone-beam CT scanners. The hardware platform will be a reconfigurable field-programmable object array (FPOA), which of\nfers an attractive tradeoff between cost, speed, and flexibility. Specific aims of this project are prototypes of (i) an ultra-fast algorithmically accelerated hardware backprojector for the 3D circular imaging scan geometry; (ii) a fast complete software \nreconstruction algorithm for the 3D helical cone beam geometry, for the so-called long object problem, applicable to diagnostic imaging; and (iii) an ultra-fast algorithmically accelerated complete hardware reconstructor for the 3D helical cone beam long o\nbject geometry. We aim to provide a speed-up of at least 20W relative to two benchmarks: (i) conventional algorithms implemented on comparable hardware resources, and (ii) current best-in class commercial CT reconstruction rates. These speed-ups can be use\nd to implement more sophisticated algorithms to produce better image quality and for low-dose imaging. Stringent control of image quality by both objective and subjective measures and experiments will be applied throughout the course of the project to ensu\nre that the unprecedented speed-up is achieved while maintaining pristine image quality.",

Other applications of Micro-CT range from functional imaging to use in material science.  Yet, high resolution reconstruction of a single data set can be extremely time intensive, thus limiting the use.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the increased use of x-ray CT, the development of a market for CT screening exams, and the imaging of younger patients, there is a growing concern about the public health risk caused by the radiation dose delivered\n by x-ray CT. The reduction of this dose has therefore taken on increased importance. The objective of this work is to develop a novel computationally-based approach to the reduction of patient x-ray dose in diagnostic CT scanners. The approach will use it\nerative algorithms for the image formation, which can produce high-quality images from low-dose data by incorporating detailed models of the physics and statistics of the data acquisition process. To date, such iterative algorithms have been little used in\n practice owing to their high computational complexity. This problem will be solved by using revolutionary fast algorithms for the backprojection and reprojection steps in the iterative algorithm. These fast algorithms were developed and patented at the Un\niversity of Illinois by members of the project research team and collaborators, and further developed at InstaRecon, Inc. Using this technology, speed-up factors of 10x - 50x have been achieved in software prototypes. Phase I developed fast statistical and\n physics-based iterative algorithms for reduced-dose and reduced artifact high-precision tomography for the 2D fan-beam imaging geometry. In Phase II, the methodology and algorithms will be extended to the dominant imaging geometries in modern multi-detect\nor-row diagnostic scanners: helical multislice, conebeam with a circular source trajectory, and helical conebeam. The success of Phase I suggests an acceleration of the iterative algorithm by a factor of 10 or better compared to previous, conventional impl\nementations. This large algorithmic acceleration will be further augmented by implementing the algorithms on a parallel computing platform. The resulting prototype reconstruction system will match the throughput of current CT scanners, while providing dose\n and artifact reduction. Significant attention will be devoted to thorough testing and quantitative characterization of the speed and image quality of the new dose reduction technology. Benefits of the new technology will include superior low-dose performa\nnce in dose-critical applications such as pediatric, screening for lung cancer or heart disease, and interventional imaging. Additionally, it will offer significant improvement in diagnostic quality of CT scans of large patients and of patients with prosth\netic implants or cardiac pacemakers. The algorithmic speedup allows for the system to run on a modest hardware platform, making this technology attractive for adoption by scanner manufacturers. This project promises to revolutionize CT as we know it, by ma\nking iterative algorithm-based dose and artifact reduction feasible for the first time.",

However, some of the most desirable types of GPCR drugs have also been some of the most difficult to discover. GPCRs \nare integral membrane proteins that are traditionally studied in live cells or cell membrane preparations, sources that limit the ability to purify and manipulate GPCR proteins. These limitations have hindered the discovery of drugs against many important \nGPCRs and drugs with pharmacologically-specific mechanisms of action. A novel method that aids in discovering new and improved GPCR drugs could have a major impact on human health. We have demonstrated the feasibility of a unique assay system for GPCR acti\nvation that offers the benefits of a cell-based system (relevant signaling pathways) without their drawbacks.

This project seeks to develop a suite of collaboration tools that have native support for mathematical notation, so that students and instructors can communicate scientific and mathematical concepts more effectively. This Phase II project aims to will extend the Lexicon adaptive authoring framework developed in Phase I, to support embedded semantic markup needed to deliver rich instructional content, and to position Lexicon to support a series of collaborative e-learning applications that are enabled by a relatively small amount of semantic markup: MathIM, an instant messaging application, prototyped during Phase I, that allows users include mathematical notation in person-to-person chat messages; MathWiki, a web-based forum application that supports communities of users who share an interest in topics that require mathematical notation; MathSpace, an online authoring environment for creating student worksheets; and MathME, or the Math Media Environment, a 'virtual notebook' in which students can record the work they are doing online.",

In Phase I, we have shown that our approach can deliver low packet loss, low latency, and smooth handoff solutions with minimum packet overhead. Further, our approach is resistant to node mobility thanks to the intelligent link management scheme. Our research on IEEE 802.21 shows that MIH (Media Independent Handover) may serve as a component in our integrated architecture, and our research will pioneer Ad-Hoc-MIH specifications. In Phase II, we will develop the proposed approach in a full-fledged manner by researching the unique challenges in routing imposed by multi-radio/multi-channel mobile devices, and investigating appropriate routing policies and metrics. During Phase II, we will also evaluate the interoperability of our framework with 802.21 MIH, and make technical contributions to the standard community. This Phase II will fully develop all the software managers and simulation platforms for performance evaluation purposes, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the solutions using physical experiments comparing the performance against current handoff schemes. In conclusion, our work represents the first complete solution that provides seamless handoff in ad hoc networks with minimum service disruption.",

For example, precise knowledge of th\ne genomic sequence within neoplastic tissues can be an indicator for treatment (similar to the erbB-2 receptor gene, Her-2, for breast cancer). Although much research and development effort has gone into the core chemistries and instruments which actually \nproduce sequence data, few new techniques have been applied to the preparation of samples for high-throughput or use in the clinic. In particular, sequencing systems that use beads as both the solid support for amplification and to help localize samples on\n a sequencing chip still require tedious processing by hand. As labs scale up to use the new sequencing technologies, they are very quickly realizing that the bottleneck in the operation is in the sample preparation. In this Phase II application, we propos\ne to take the sample preparation steps far beyond the original Phase I scope of library construction. We propose to automate the entire sample preparation process, starting just after DNA fragmentation, through library construction and ending just prior to\n attachment to a chip.

VEMPs are currently acquired using standard Auditory Evoked Potential (AEP) systems which do not provide adequate controls over background EMG act\nivity required to record consistent and valid VEMP responses. The proposed system will be made available either as a VEMP specific module within SmartEP, an AEP system manufactured by Intelligent Hearing Systems, integrating hearing and vestibular assessme\nnt, or as a compact portable VEMP device to be used for vestibular screening, testing, ototoxicity monitoring and other related applications. During Phase I, a VEMP module incorporating background EMG monitoring and patient feedback with video display rein\nforcement for testing children was developed and tested. Chained-Stimuli and CLAD high stimulation rate testing techniques were also successfully applied to VEMP testing. Acquisition and data analysis parameters were also optimized. During Phase II, a comp\nrehensive clinical trial will be conducted to obtain normative data from 300 subjects. A computer controlled skull tap stimulator and bone vibrator headband will also be developed to facilitate VEMP testing using these techniques.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Point of care (POC) testing (also referred to as near patient, bed side, or extra laboratory testing) can result in improved clinical outcomes in medical care. These improvements include faster decision making, earlier \nstart of treatment, improved adherence to treatment, reduced incidence of complications, more rapid optimization of treatment, reduced hospital readmission rate, and better patient satisfaction. Additional operational and economic benefits can also accrue.\n These potential benefits have created a growing market for POC tests that can aid in the diagnosis and treatment of a wide variety of medical diseases and conditions. To achieve effective and accurate POC testing, the assay methodology must be easy to use\n, provide accurate answers, provide results on a time scale, require handheld or small bench top instrumentation, and require minimal training of assay performers. A limitation to the methodologies currently seeking to meet the needs of POC testing is the \ncost and complexity of the instruments used, and the training required to correctly perform the assay procedures. To overcome this limitation, Intelligent Optical Systems proposes to extend a simple label- free clinical assay system to a wide range of POC \napplications, and to later use this same technology to address high throughput screening applications. The estradiol assay developed in Phase I work, which is based on the observation of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) on an array of Ag nanoplat\nes, will be extended to the development of a clinical assay panel for the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer. These panels will simultaneously assay several indicators used for the prognosis of breast cancer, and for fertility treatment. These are medically\n significant, commercially attractive applications that will allow the basic LSPR assay system to be developed into a commercial product. Designs will be developed for assay chemistries, disposable assay substrates, and a handheld instrument for operation \nof all assays. The commercialization of these products is expected to lead to further expansions of the assay technology, and as a platform for a wide range of POC testing. The assay system will also be expanded to address high throughput screening applica\ntions. Considerable savings in the time and cost of both types of assays is anticipated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It is now possible to perform many clinical medical tests in a short period of time at the location where patient care is being given. Many m\nedical benefits can be gained from such rapid testing. The proposed simple point of care clinical assay system has the potential of making more tests available to more patients at a lower cost.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endoscopic visualization is of primary importance for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) procedures and various clinical diagnoses. However, a known limitation of current endoscopic imaging technology for some procedures \nand applications is the limited field of view. For better comprehension of the operating field, it is highly desirable and in some procedures critically important, to be able to view panoramically. Under previous NIH support, InterScience, Inc. has develop\ned a  C-View  endoscope system which is able to capture a field of view larger than a hemisphere (3  steradian solid angle) onto a single 2D image plane. However, because this endoscopic system delivers a very wide 3D field of view to a single 2D image pla\nne, objects in the panoramic field of view suffer from the inherent barrel distortion when displayed on a traditional 2D display. The objective of this SBIR effort is to develop compatible display technologies that can present the panoramic image collected\n by such an endoscope to the clinician. Under the Phase I effort, two approaches have been pursued to achieve this. One is to optically recreate compatible panoramic images on a more than hemispherical 3D screen by the projection based on an innovative opt\nical system. The second approach is to display a small portion of the panoramic image in a head-mounted 2D display, and the different portion with different angle of view can be displayed by tracking the head motion. With a combination of a wide-field-of-v\niew endoscope and the proposed immersive display system, it will allow clinicians to situate in an immersive virtual reality environment as exactly what the endoscope locates. Clinical diagnoses and MIS will greatly benefit from such an endoscopic imaging \nand displaying system. During the Phase I effort, we have successfully developed the concepts and designs, and demonstrated a preliminary bench top projection system. This Phase II effort will focus on the advanced developments, implementations and tests o\nf the two proposed immersive display technologies for clinical applications. The specific Phase II emphasis is to optimize the optical designs, develop compatible software, fabricate the two different prototypes with software integrated, as well as conduct\n corresponding experimental tests and evaluations in collaboration with medical clinicians PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed enhanced endoscopic display technology will provide enhanced visualization and immersive display opportunities for all applicat\nions of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) including robotic surgery applications.

The C-View semi- rigid scope is broadly applicable to urological procedures, laparoscopy and endoscopic general surg\nery. In urology specifically, this technology will not only enhance the visualization of the entire bladder and urethra, but will also aid most urologic endoscopic procedures such as bladder biopsies and fulguration, intubation of ureteral orifaces for ret\nrograde pyelograms or passage of wires, intra-vesical injections and trans-urethral resections. Using this innovative technology, inspecting the bladder, photographing bladder lesions and other disease processes will aid in future surveillance with more a \nprecise location of prior therapy. The all viewing, single field of view minimizes procedure time and discomfort to the patient by eliminating intra-procedural swapping of various angled scopes and/or manipulation of the flexible scope tip, all while ensur\ning procedure thoroughness. The overall design of the proposed scope is a tremendous advance in endoscope technology, taking advantage of state of the art in optical design, optical component manufacturing, imaging sensors and illumination technology. This\n application is being pursued through fast-track based on the highly commercial nature of the technology and the impact on minimally invasive surgery applications. In an effort to streamline the research and development process of the C-View semi-rigid end\noscope, the Phase I effort is designed to provide a design, testing, and benchtop demonstration foundation for the continued development effort of Phase II and the commercialization beyond. The overall objective of the proposed Phase II effort is to advanc\ne the development of the C-View endoscope through the integration and assembly of working prototypes and cadaver model testing, based on the foundation established in Phase I.        Project Narrative         The C-View semi-rigid scope is specifically app\nlicable to bladder cancer surveillance, but also will provide benefits more broadly to urological procedures, laparoscopy and endoscopic general surgery. The unprecedented ultra-wide field of view of this C-View semi-rigid endoscope would greatly improve i\nmage consistency, and procedure thoroughness while minimizing procedure time.",

The development of new pharmaceuticals for neuropsychiatric disorders is limited by the lack of rapid and effective methods to evaluate potentially useful compounds that arise from primary high throughput screens. As a result of our Phase I grant, ITI has developed a technological platform based on measurements of levels of physiologically-relevant phosphoproteins involved in mediating the effects of neurotransmitters. This platform, based on measurements of changes in protein phosphorylation after treatment of mice in vivo with standard compounds, has been used to profile effects of all known antidepressant drug classes to produce a reference database. Results comprising this database, reviewed in this application, indicate that clinically-efficacious antidepressants characteristically increase the state of phosphorylation in vivo of the dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of Mr=32kDa (DARPP-32) and certain of its downstream targets, including the AMPA receptor subunit, GluR1. The comprehensive goal of this Phase II application is to establish and pursue a drug development program aimed at obtaining a small-molecule inhibitor of PDE1B, the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase 1B, suitable for use as an antidepressant medication, including depression in patients with AIDS or other CNS disorders. To that end we propose the following aims: (I) To develop a screening assay for identifying inhibitors of PDE1B, (II) To screen libraries for the purpose of generating lead compounds, (III) To utilize phospho-profiling methods developed during our Phase I award to assist in optimization of lead compounds, and (IV) To evaluate the efficacy of PDE1B inhibitors as antidepressant medications using a panel of behavioral tests for antidepressant action.  Recent results are promising and include: identification of a number of low nanomolar PDE-1B inhibitor \"lead\" structures, establishment of a high capacity screening assay, and cloning of a full-length human PDE-1B enzyme. In addition to substantial resources already committed, we plan to dedicate further resources in chemistry, and behavioral testing. We have developed a detailed plan to assess potential toxicities associated with PDE-1B inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Papaya is a major fruit commodity in Hawaii with over 28 million pounds utilized in 2006. 26.6 million pounds of the harvested papaya are used for fresh utilization and 2.3 million pounds for processed utilization. Processed utilization is currently for aseptic puree produced by a single processor. Additional processing of papaya would be valuable because there are an estimated 3.5 million pounds of culls that can be utilized annually. If not processed into puree, there is no income to the farmer and the packinghouse must dispose of the culls by discarding them, giving them away for livestock feed, or selling them in bulk to a broker for local utilization. The purpose of this project is to utilize these culled papayas and produce a consistently high quality, nutritional Individual Quick Frozen (IQF) product with increased food safety and sufficient stability to retain its value during frozen storage. Utilization of papaya culls would greatly benefit the Hawaii papaya industry and improve the economy of the state's rural communities. Successful project completion will result in a sound, proven concept for processing culled papayas into an IFQ product. This will ensure the microbial security of the product, eliminate the need for quarantine treatment, and preserve fruit quality. An IQF product would provide the industry another avenue to the export market rather than having the culls discarded or sold in the local market.

The Liat HPV Assay will utilize the Liat Analyzer to enable the minimally trained personnel to perform the HPV test at a hospital, clinic or physician's office in 1 hour. By enabling effective and sensitive single visit HPV testing, we expect that the Liat assay will allow clinicians to identify more women at risk for cervical cancer and provide immediate and effective intervention, thereby significantly lowering the incidence of cervical cancer. The Liat HPV Assay overcomes the limitations of current HPV tests, whose long turnaround time and technical complexity requires testing to be performed in centralized laboratories, resulting in missed opportunities for disease prevention due to significant patient loss to follow-up and lack of penetration into resource-poor regions in the US and abroad. In Phase I of this Fast Track project, we intend to prove the feasibility of developing a 1 hour sample-to- result Liat HPV Assay by developing melting-point PCR assays for HPV-16 and HPV-18 and Liat-based extraction for HPV nucleic acids from HPV-containing cervical cell lines. In Phase II, we propose to expand the assay developed in Phase I to include the majority of high risk HPV types that are found in cervical cancer, develop Liat sample preparation for cervical samples, as well as integrate all assay components, including internal controls, into a single Liat tube for multiplex HPV detection. We further intend to characterize and validate the Liat HPV Assay in a pre-clinical study. At the conclusion of this Fast Track project, we will be prepared to submit the Liat HPV assay for FDA- approved clinical study.

AO is a technology that enhances the performance of optical systems such as telescopes and microscopes by reducing distortion.  It can lead to significantly sharper images which can approach the theoretical diffraction limit. The increase in image sharpness also allows additional gains in contrast, thus allowing detection of faint objects.  Although AO has been significantly used for improving the performance of telescopes, an AO system based on MEMS deformable mirrors for use in biomedical applications has not.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Divorce is a serious public health problem. Over 50 percent of marriages end in divorce, generating family stressors that contribute to maladaptive child adjustment. The evidence is clear that providing parents with qua\nlity divorce parent education can mitigate the negative effects on children. Despite parents' key role in protecting children, many are ill-prepared for the task. Available divorce parent education programs are insufficient. Nearly 60 percent take place in\n one group session, leaving little opportunity for the development of lasting skills. Moreover, stressed divorcing parents face substantial barriers to attending group-based training. Most current programs do not target the variables known to buffer the ne\ngative effects of divorce and many are inaccessible to fathers. There is a need for accessible, skill-based theoretically sound, training for divorcing mothers and fathers.         Self-instructional parenting programs offer a promising alternative for div\norcing parents. They overcome barriers to attendance at parenting groups, and have shown promising effects in increasing parents' knowledge, efficacy, and skills. Little attention has been paid, however, to the potential value of low-cost, self-administere\nd, interactive multimedia approaches for divorcing parents. The central aim of this project is to develop and evaluate an innovative program uniquely tailored to meet the needs of mothers and fathers during the divorce transition. If the aims are achieved,\n the program will provide a resilience resource to bolster parental factors known to moderate the effects of risk factors on child outcomes, thus filling a significant public health need. The program will be a self-instructional, menu-driven, online curric\nulum containing eight media-led lessons with engaging, realistic vignettes; exercises for self-reflection, goal-setting, and skill-building; and a managed web community for parents to share information and experiences, and access links to resources on the \nWorld Wide Web.         In Phase I, we developed the first program and set up a web community room with input from divorcing mothers and fathers, the professionals who work with them, and our program consultants. We evaluated feasibility of the program by \nconducting a pilot study with mothers and fathers, and established the acceptability of the program with an advisory panel of professionals who specialize in the field of divorce parent education. The results of the evaluation were encouraging: parents rep\norted significantly less conflict from pre to post and we found a significant increase in parents' sense of efficacy in using their newly learned skills and in their behavioral intentions to use them. Moreover, social validity data from parents and profess\nionals indicate that participants found the website easy to access and navigate, the web content useful and easy to understand, and they expressed that they were able to complete tasks efficiently.         We propose to expand and evaluate the program in P\nhase II and to conduct an experimental randomized trial of the theory-based intervention with 318 divorcing parents.

Tremendous attention has been placed on medical management and adherence to programs that emphasize reduction or elimination of risk factors. Despite public health 'calls to action' for greater prevention and intervention efforts, the health statistics related to these health behaviors indicate that there remains a great need for effective interventions. Many barriers exist in primary care settings for initiating attempts at assisting patients in this regard. Research indicates that workplace-based interventions show much promise for reaching a large percentage of adults and encouraging positive health behaviors. Worksites provide access to over 65 percent of the population aged 16 and over and can be excellent settings in which to implement strategies for reducing the prevalence and burden of obesity, inactivity, and other unhealthful habits. Accordingly, workplaces are beginning to implement a variety of interventions to address the problem of cardiovascular disease and are exploring innovative and cost-effective means for reducing cardiovascular risk. [Building on ISA's extensive experience in worksite web-based health interventions (including previously developed and tested web-based interventions), the proposed project will develop and test an innovative web-based program - i.e., science-based, media-rich, tailored, and highly interactive - designed to reduce cardiovascular risk among working adults. The project will also include the development of a toolkit for managers that is designed to foster the adoption of policies and practices that support the web-based intervention and related worksite improvements. Phase I will involve the development and feasibility testing of the prototype, along with specific milestones that must met before moving to Phase II. Phase II will involve the full development of the Heart Healthy program for workplaces, followed by a field test of the web-based programs, including a randomized control trial with a sample of employees. The General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC), a company with whom ISA has tested previous health interventions, has enthusiastically agreed to serve as the site for both phases of the project.] The final program will be marketed to workplaces through concentrated efforts by ISA's Center for Workforce Health. Cardiovascular disease is the leading source of morbidity and mortality in the United States and with one of every five deaths attributed to a cardiac event, there exists a great need to find effective preventive tools. The outcome of this Fast Track project will be the development and test of a comprehensive, innovative, web- based cardiovascular risk reduction program for the workplace consisting of a self-guided tutorial for employees and a toolkit for managers. The effective development and test of this program could provide a mechanism for broad dissemination to workplaces and an ultimate decrease in cardiac-related morbidity and mortality.",

Most of this acreage is grown under contract with National Grape Cooperative for processing into Welch's grape juice and related products. Recently the grape industry lost a number of effective insect pest management tools, remaining with very few options for controlling insect pests. Meanwhile the key insect pest, the grape berry moth (GBM), damage to grapes increased substantially and now threatens the future of grape production in the Eastern-United-States. The goal of this USDA-SBIR project is to develop the pheromone product SPLAT-GBM for season-long control the GBM and mechanize its application with tools available to small farmers. In Phase II we will build on the successes of Phase I to increase the longevity of SPLAT-GBM from 4 to 6 months, extend the effectiveness of mating disruption from the interior to the borders of treated vineyards, optimize the mechanical applicator, and transfer technology constituents through our close collaboration with extension. If successful, SPLAT-GBM will be an affordable organic alternative to conventional forms of GBM control, fostering the economical viability of small vineyards in the Eastern-United-States.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The purpose of the proposed research is to continue development of the  SeeStar  system based on Phase 1 proof of concept results. Participant experiences with SeeStar under a variety of use conditions demonstrated the\n value of the system, and indicated where further development efforts will be required. SeeStar offers persons who are blind a  pair of eyes  via the use of a cell phone camera and data link to a remote assistant who can look at live images through that ce\nll phone camera and then describe the person's surroundings, indicating the location of salient landmarks and pathways to specific destinations. Also, using GPS, the assistant can employ Google Maps to orient the person to their farther reaching surroundin\ngs. The experiences of Phase 1 participants, as well as remote operators, made it clear that continued SeeStar development should focus on static rather than dynamic use scenarios -- that is, not attempt to provide  blow by blow  directions as the person i\ns walking. Further, participants made it clear that in the absence of an available remote assistant, an automated means of detecting salient visual landmarks and specific destination points would be most useful. The participants were most enthusiastic when\n landmark and text recognition algorithms were demonstrated in this regard. The experience of the remote operators of SeeStar also highlighted specific issues to be addressed in Phase 2: (1) difficulties in communicating caused by video and two-way voice r\neception latencies greater than 1 second caused by fluctuations in data channel capacity, (2) difficulty in orienting to a setting given the very restricted field of view of the camera lens, (3) low video image resolutions made it difficult to read signs a\nnd recognize objects easily, and (4) GPS coverage and errors. (5)Further, participants were split over whether they felt it was easier to hold the camera in their hands, or wear it around their neck, or perhaps even on their head. (6)Participants also want\ned a means of verifying their intended routes (indoor and outdoor) and destinations, locating and recognizing pedestrian crossing buttons, bus stop signs, bus or train numbers, elevator buttons, exits, bathrooms, office numbers, and street signs. The devel\nopment the automated capabilities will include a significant amount of existing of state of the art but off the shelf, image based landmark recognition, text sign detection and recognition, and automatic panorama creation software. Such landmarks and text \nsigns when referenced to a GIS database can provide a redundant method of positioning to GPS which may suffer from coverage and availability issues. The combination of object and text recognition will also enable location and identification of critical sal\nient features in the absence of an assistant such locating and recognizing bus numbers, street signs, elevator buttons, or pedestrian crossing buttons. Finally, more extensive and statistically relevant focus group and end user tests will be conducted to i\nnsure we have adequately addressed issues of concern for this very heterogeneous population.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using a from the consumer's perspective, SeeStar must level the playing field in a manner not yet in evidence  for:  In order to effectiv\nely function within society, all people must have the ability to plan comprehensible routes, follow routes, and maintain orientation along the way. People must also be able to traverse any given location without being struck by moving traffic, confounded b\ny new construction sites, or stumbling upon a decaying sidewalk or roadway. People who have visual impairments face unique challenges in achieving independent mobility, as there is no easy way for them to identify potential hazards, or to immediately acces\ns information about their surroundings without an assistive technology device or assistance from a sighted person  [T2RERC's Stakeholder Forum, 2003].",

In partnership with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP), JGP will develop and support numerous virtual community-building activities. Our first goal is to create a strong and active online network of suicidologists. This goal will be met through an active recruitment process and numerous virtual activities, such as virtual seminars, discussion forums, and wikis. Our second goal is to improve on an existing Collaboration MatChing Service (eMS) prototype module in the Virtual Collaboratory in order to foster research and training collaborations. The CMS draws from a People, Operations and Projects database that aggregates data from CRISP, PubMed and non-government funding agencies. CMS search outputs will be tailored for use by the suicidology community and will improve both tracking and project outcome measurements. The third goal of this contract is to evaluate how well the Virtual Collaboratory serves as a platform for network building and dissemination of critical knowledge with geographically-dispersed, multi-disciplinary audiences. JGP will research whether incorporating virtual communication technologies increases the rate and ease of dissemination of quality information and improves lines of communication. Achieving these goals will promote the growth and on-going development of a vibrant and dynamic suicide research community, both on site and online.",

        "abstract": "Hawaii orchid growers, of which there are more than 70, face increasing competition from mega-nurseries in California and Florida as well as from producers in Taiwan, Thailand, and Holland. The business model among Hawaii growers tends to small, family operated concerns, by choice and tradition. A single orchid nursery in Salinas, Calif., is larger than all Hawaii orchid nurseries combined. Hawaii, because of its ideal natural conditions and pure water, once was able to compete on price in mainland markets, not having the expenses of heating, cooling, and purifying water. But the industrial approach practiced on the mainland has brought down unit prices, and mainland nurseries have lower freight-to-market charges and growth media costs. Imported orchid bark and coconut chips, the main media constituents used in Hawaii, have nearly doubled in price in the last year, as has Perlite, an inorganic amendment. Orchid bark is subject to scarcity, and at times all media options have been unavailable to Hawaii growers due to supplier problems. Additionally, organic media breaks down, inviting a host of problems for plant, grower and end user. The new product (called, for now, RPM, recycled plastic media) is intended help growers be more competitive both with cost and plant performance factors. The PD will focus on feedstock from plastic types that presently are not collected for recycling and typically wind up in the nearly full landfill if not in the marine or terrestrial environment. Collection of the feedstock will be facilitated by Hawaii County recycling officials, private recyclers, and the American Chemical Council a national organization representing plastics producers.",

        "abstract": "Bright coherent light sources in the soft x-ray region of the spectrum are useful for a variety of applications of interest to the DOE.  However for many applications, such as nanometer-scale microscopy in the \u00bfwater window\u00bf region of the soft x-ray spectrum (300-500 eV), only large-scale synchrotron facilities are currently capable of generating the required flux.  Yet, the implementation of small-scale, tabletop sources of bright coherent soft x-rays would greatly expand the potential impact of the technologies developed at synchrotrons, allowing the source to be brought to applications in science and industry.  One promising approach to addressing this need involves the coherent upconversion of laser light to short wavelengths through the process of high-order harmonic generation.  The basic physics of the high-order harmonic generation process makes it easier to generate and phase-match shorter-wavelength harmonics when the process is driven by longer wavelength light.  This project will develop an ultrafast laser amplifier that operates at wavelengths ~3x longer than current generation ultrafast lasers.  This mid-infrared ultrafast laser will be integrated with a new set-up for high-order harmonic generation.  In Phase I, the temperature dependence of the absorption and emission spectra was measured for two gain materials, which could serve as the driving source for generating soft x-ray light through the high-order harmonic generation process.  The most promising gain material was selected, and a two-stage multipass amplifier system was designed.  In Phase II, the design will be implemented in the construction of the mid-infrared laser amplifier system, and the amplified pulses will be used to generate efficient high-order harmonic light at 13nm and 4nm, with sufficient flux for applications.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The development of these lasers should directly translate into brighter tabletop soft x-ray sources for applications in control, diagnostics, and metrology.  Currently, a $7B global laser market exists for ultraviolet, visible, and infrared laser systems.",

Reaching students with engaging information about human genetic principles can help create a new generation with scientific literacy on a topic that may \ndirectly impact their personal decisions about health and well-being in the future. During this Phase II project, KDH Research and Communication (KDHRC) proposes the continued development of the Genetics for Kids curriculum (GK). This curriculum for 7th an\nd 8th grade students features multimedia and print components. The objectives of the curriculum are to: 1) provide scientific information on genetic principles and human genetic variation; 2) increase appreciation of importance of genomic research to indiv\niduals and society; 3) discuss the legal, social, and ethical implications of this research; 4) increase interest in genetics and science in general; and 5) support teachers' instruction on this topic by providing materials that are standards-based, easy-t\no-implement, developmentally appropriate, engaging and scientifically rigorous. Working from the Phase I prototype, the goals of this Phase II project are to finish development of the multimedia aspects of the curriculum and to conduct a quasi-experimental\n, pre-test/post-test two-group design of the curriculum's effectiveness in reaching the above objectives. This evaluation will be conducted nationwide and will also include assessments by teachers and school administrators of GK's efficacy. At the conclusi\non of the project, journal articles and practice and policy briefs will disseminate information related to the findings of the evaluation. Simultaneously, the curriculum will be commercialized and disseminated as an evidence-based educational product.

Through our investigative and program development practices we: a) recruited and convened an Expert Advisory Panel (EAP) b) conducted a survey\n, card sort activities and focus groups that identified website content, features/functionality needs of PAN practitioners, c) discovered that users felt that they already had access to websites that provided content on evidenced-based strategies for plann\ning, implementing and evaluating community PAN programs; and d) developed and tested paper prototype representations of BITE web pages. After these investigations the BITE concept was refined to be more responsive to practitioner needs to: a) broaden partn\ner and public participation in community-level program planning processes; b) improve the quality and completeness of program plans such that they are more evidenced-based; c) help assure uniformity and quality of program evaluation data reported to lead a\ngencies by partners; and d) increase the likelihood of program success. The goal of this SBIR Phase II project is to build and test a dynamic, interactive web program that will assist public health practitioners and their partners as they plan, manage, and\n evaluate physical activity and nutrition programs that can be repurposed for use with other risk reduction and chronic disease programs. In Phase II, researchers at Klein Buendel, Inc.

Conduct a pair-\nmatched, randomized community trial in 40 communities from 8 states to test the impact of the BITE program on plan quality, planning efficiency, and program implementation The web program will contain project management tools including: a) online discussio\nn and decision- making tools, b) a centralized hub containing community plans with tasks, milestones and metrics, c) links to websites with evidenced-based PAN information, and d) interactive tools and features to support PAN practitioners. Web-based plann\ning and progress reporting will be strategically integrated with face-to-face meetings, telephone conference calls, and online/telephonic training opportunities. Secondary measures will assess Program Manager and user satisfaction with community planning a\nnd implementation processes, and attitudes on functioning of their community coalition/planning group using interview and survey methods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Balancing InTake and Expenditure website will contain project management tools to help co\nmmunity public health promotion staff plan and implement physical activity and nutrition programs.

Larval rearing trials will evaluate stocking densities and feeding regimes, and improve overall survival to metamorphosis.  Refined diets and passive larval grading mechanisms will be tested to reduce cannibalism around weaning.  Growout feed trials will compare affects of commercial diets on growth rates and feed conversion ratios.

        "abstract": "The overall goal of this project is to complete the research and development of an innovative process technology to enhance the economics of biodiesel production, through upgrading the byproduct glycerol to a propane fuel (LPG), which (a) is widely used today, (b) has an existing distribution system, (c) can accommodate the large volumes of byproduct glycerol, and (d) which has attractive economics to support the biodiesel production. The KSE upgrading technology does not require extensive supporting services, such as a hydrogen plant. The technology produces green propane, derived solely from renewable materials that are byproducts of biodiesel manufacture.\n\nIf biodiesel is produced to meet only 3% of the U.S. diesel fuel demand, over 1.8 billion pounds of glycerol, also known as glycerin, will be coproduced. The current annual worldwide demand for glycerol is only 0.5 billion pounds. As a result, the oversupply of glycerol has already depressed glycerol prices in the U.S. and in Europe. Not only will biodiesel economics thereby be depressed, but also the physical disposition of byproduct glycerol becomes a challenge. Hence, to fully exploit the potential of biodiesel, an effective glycerol upgrading technology is needed, the project of the current proposed research.\n\nThe program entails the development of new catalyst compositions for the glycerol conversion reactions: laboratory studies demonstrating the performance of the technology, including catalyst activity and selectivity: and economic analyses and life cycle assessments to demonstrate economic performance. Based on Phase I results. technology can be developed which converts glycerol into green propane at uniquely high yields, producing a high valued biofuels product with a large and dispersed market. The technology is simple, does not require an external source of hydrogen, and is inexpensive to build and operate. Even with Phase I economics, the KSE technology provides propane at manufacturing costs substantially below market clearing prices for propane. When the development program is completed, the Phase II technology can he utilized today, with current prices, to produce green propane, and will support more rapid exploitation of biodiesel as a component of the national energy balance The Phase I technology is clearly technically feasible and economically viable. It. is anticipated that tile application of the technology will significantly improve the economics of biodiesel production for the dispersed group of biodiesel plants in the US, and provide an economic disposition for the major quantities of byproduct glycerol, thereby facilitating rapid introduction of economic biodiesel manufacturing operations.",

This form of awareness has been called Theory of Mind (ToM). Unfortunately, the development of ToM is severely delayed or fails altogether in many children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Delays in the development of ToM ar\ne also seen in oral deaf children from hearing families (DH) who are not exposed to adequate language input, and others with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). The prevalence of ToM deficits in these populations contributes to mounting evidence that langu\nage plays a critical role in ToM development, perhaps by providing an essential framework for comprehending language about epistemic states. In the proposed research we seek to develop and field-test a curriculum and intervention software for children with\n ASD, SLI, and DH children that can be used to help remediate language deficits that are reliably associated with poor performance on classic tests of ToM development. Progress toward this goal will at the least provide children with a basis for understand\ning the language about the mind, and it is predicted, will also aid in the actual development of ToM abilities in many children for whom these abilities may otherwise be severely delayed or out of reach. In Phase I the investigators and consultants outline\nd a curriculum for the full project, and specified, developed, and field-tested prototype software with children in each of the populations listed above. The children were able to use the software and evidence of learning was obtained. In Phase II the same\n group will collaborate on development and field-testing of the full curriculum.

The proposed analytical platform is based on Penning Ionization Electron Spectroscopy (PIES) in plasma. PIES technology relies on a simple analog measurement configuration capable of unique identification of chemical species. No optical or high-vacuum equipment is required, which opens up the opportunity to make the proposed analyzer a miniature, low weight, low energy and low material consumption device. Phase I experiments demonstrated capabilities of PIES technology when PIES analytical spectra were obtained in a breadboard version of a PIES detector coupled with a gas chromatograph. In the Phase II project, each element of the Analytical Platform based on PIES technology (APP) will be miniaturized and combined in an integrated analyzer platform capable of in situ real-time identification  and monitoring of greenhouse gases. A prototype of the APP analyzer will be developed and tested. In Phase III, the APP will be realized on a single chip.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Instruments based on APP are intended to serve multiple needs for industries where size, weight, resource and energy consumption requirements are top priority. A portable and rugged APP analyzer will be particularly attractive in fields as: microelectronics (e.g. for monitoring the environment of pure industrial processes), home security, pharmaceutical, biochemical, petrochemical, forensics (e.g., drug screening and toxicology research), and hazardous waste treatment.",

Through rigorous testing we found the larger particle size portion of the byproduct to be economically and environmentally applicable as roofing granules (G-sand) for asphalt shingles and bituminous rooting applications. Surprisingly, we have also found great interest in industrial applications for the tine product remaining after screening the G-sand for the granule application. With these recently gained insights Lesktcch Limited is confident that commercial and industrial applications can be found to re-utilize 100%, of the stamp-sand by-product now exposed upon Lake Superior shorelines along the Keweenaw Peninsula in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Biological testing from the Phase I study has proven that the metallic copper existing in the G-sand rock matrix acts as an anti-algaecide agent.\n\nIn our Phase II study Lesktech will design and operate a 1-5 ton per hour pilot plant to process the stampsand material. The G-sand will be sized and stored to keep the material dry: shingle manufacturer specifications require granules to not exceed 1% moisture so as to assure the asphalt is capable of adhering to the mineral. Industrial sized testing trials will be negotiated with companies such as Johns Manville to process the required amount of G-sand in order 10 accommodate each plants requirement; we foresee test batches of up to 20 tons per plant. The remaining fines material will have a representative portion removed and submitted to scientists at the Institute of Materials Processing (IMP) Michigan Technological University (MTU) for industrial application testing. The other portion of the tines will be stored for future testing by industrial partners.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rather modest success has yet been achieved in expressing and purifying membrane proteins as a prerequisite to obtain high resolution structures. Only 124 unique structures for membrane proteins have been resolved out o\nf gt 30,000 soluble proteins. This  bottleneck  can be divided into at least three major parts: i) the difficulty to express quantitatively and qualitatively sufficient amounts, ii) the requirement for detergent-dependent solubilization procedures prior to\n purification, which can substantially reduce specific binding or catalytic activities and iii) the high sensitivity to degradation during purification resulting in instable material of short shelf-life. LifeSensors has developed a novel SUMO fusion techno\nlogy that will be improved and applied to enhance the expression and purification of a wide variety of membrane proteins in Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris). The key features of this technology are: 1) the fusion of the C-terminus of SUMO to the N-terminus of\n a membrane protein; 2) the enhanced qualitative and quantitative membrane protein expression by the inherent chaperoning effect of SUMO; 3) the exploitation of the robust properties of SUMO protease to generate a desired N-terminus. Phase I goals for this\n project were met using E.coli as the expression host; however, the detected expression levels of SUMO-fused eukaryotic membrane proteins with more than three transmembrane helices, such as GPCRs, were not very satisfactory. The yeast P. pastoris has been \nshown to be generally more compatible with the metabolic needs for efficient functional production of difficult-to-express eukaryotic proteins, such as glycoproteins and membrane proteins. The benefits of the SUMO fusion technology will be combined with th\nat of the P. pastoris expression system to quantitatively and qualitatively enhance the expression of membrane proteins. First, the utility of the SUMO fusion technology will be established by cloning and expressing 25 structurally and/or therapeutically i\nmportant membrane proteins in P. pastoris; next, the system will be validated by the demonstration of an at least 5-fold enhancement in the functional production of SUMO-fused compared to unfused membrane protein derivatives. Finally, the best SUMO-tag fac\nilitating enhanced quality and quantity of membrane proteins in P. pastoris will be identified. Appropriate P. pastoris vectors and strains will be marketed in a kit format as a novel SUMO-enhanced membrane protein expression system.Membrane proteins have \nbeen extremely difficult to produce in quantities sufficient for structural studies. One of the principal reasons for this deficit is that lack of a method of expression and purification that works well for this class of protein. LifeSensors has developed \na promising approach to this problem (called SUMO fusion) and has demonstrated in Phase I that membrane proteins can be expressed using it. For the most difficult groups of membrane proteins, however, called GPCRs, the bacterial system is unsatisfactory. I\nn Phase II it is proposed to apply the SUMO technology in a yeast system (Pichia pastoris) to express a group of GPCRs and to develop the optimized system as a kit for general use in expressing GPCRs.",

It can be described as a chronic inflammatory condition of the bladder wall, characterized by urinary frequency and urgency,\n and severe suprapubic and/or pelvic pain. Presently, there is limited medical therapy for IC and new and effective treatment is a major unmet medical need. Lipella Pharmaceuticals Inc. intends to be the leading company specializing in the use of intravesi\ncal liposome technology to treat IC. We have developed a method of formulating highly specific liposomes for intravesical instillation. The technology is licensed from inventions and research by Drs. Leaf Huang and Michael Chancellor at the University of P\nittsburgh. Based on their research that a liposome itself can provides a soothing effect to an irritated bladder (RO1 DK068556; Fraser et al. 2003), Lipella Pharmaceuticals expects that intravesical liposome formulations can present an improved activity in\n patients with IC. Prior to submitting this phase-II proposal, phase-I funding was used primarily to explore preclinical safety considerations of LP-08, a novel intravesical liposome therapy for IC, in a rat model.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutation to DNA is a primary mechanism by which cancers arise. These events have also been implicated in diseases such as atherosclerosis, and processes such as aging. Therefore, there is an important need for sensitive\n analytical methods which facilitate the study of mutagenesis, as well as the identification of chemical or physical agents that can mutate DNA. Methods for measuring in vivo mutation currently exist, each with their own advantages and limitations. While s\nome are based on colony formation and require tissue culture work, others rely on expensive, proprietary trangenic rodents. The in vivo mutation assay that is proposed herein is based on the Pig-a locus. The Pig-a gene product is essential for the biosynth\nesis of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. Mutations giving rise to nonfunctional GPI anchors prevent certain proteins from being expressed on the cell surface, and this represents a phenotype which can be measured by flow cytometry. Importantly,\n harvested cells are not cultured before analysis, thus the need for costly- and labor-intensive tissue culture work is eliminated. Furthermore, since Pig-a is an endogenous gene located on the X-chromosome, it is likely that this mutation scoring system w\nill be applicable to any mammalian species of toxicologic interest, including humans. As was the case for Phase I, the proposed Phase II experiments will focus on two readily obtained cell populations for the determination of GPI-anchor deficiency: periphe\nral blood erythrocytes (total) and an immature fraction of erythrocytes (reticulocytes). Whereas Phase I feasibility studies were conducted strictly with mice, these experiments will consider exposures of both mice and rats to each of six prototypical muta\ngens. The treatment schedule and the blood harvest times will be varied in order to determine the most appropriate experimental designs. Other experiments will involve isolation and DNA sequencing of GPI-anchor deficient erythroid progenitors from mutagen-\ntreated mice. The presumptive Pig-a mutant colonies will be sequenced to provide mutation spectra data that helps validate the system as an effective mutagenesis assay. Upon successful completion of these proposed experiments, society will benefit as pharm\naceutical and chemical companies eliminate genotoxicants from their new product development processes more efficiently. Furthermore, if the system proves compatible with human blood specimens, myriad other research activities will benefit as data generated\n in laboratory animal models are easily extended to include real-world human exposure scenarios, including: 1) clinical trials, 2) post-market survallience of drugs, 3) environmental exposures, and 4) occupational exposures. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is \nwell known that DNA damage is a precursor to the development of cancer and other significant diseases. It is, therefore, in the interest of public health to reduce the occurrence of mutagenic chemicals in the environment, in our drugs, and from our workpla\nces. This research project will refine and validate a powerful new method for detecting mutagenic agents, thereby enhancing the nation's ability to effectively reduce exposure to these toxic compounds.",

Examples of such applications include continuous monitoring of static and dynamic geo-fences, building dynamic mobile social networks, and mobile e-commerce. The Phase II effort will develop methods to push the efficiency of the location-based computation techniques, and develop methods for more sophisticated features such as privacy management and mobile power management, which will be crucial for the wider adoption of location-based applications. Location data is currently generated by continually moving physical objects equipped with location-based sensors, such as GPS and Wi-Fi based tags. Data management methods for these datasets require dealing with high update rates, large volumes of historical location data, and location-based triggers that raise an alert when the location of a moving object meets certain criteria (for example, if an object is beyond a well-defined boundary). Existing methods for supporting applications that have these requirements are not scalable.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Analyzing and processing free-text medical reports for data mining and clinical data interchange is one of the most challenging problems in medical informatics, yet it is crucial for continued research advances and impr\novements in clinical care. Natural language processing (NLP) is an important enabling technology, but has been held back because it is difficult to understand human language, since it requires extensive domain knowledge. In Phase I, we developed new statis\ntical and machine learning methods that apply domain specific knowledge to the semantic analysis of free-text radiology reports. The methods enabled the creation of two new prototype applications - a SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine--Clinic\nal Terms) coding service called SnomedCoder, and a text mining tool for analyzing a large corpus of medical reports, called DataMiner. In Phase II, we will accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Improve the semantic extraction methods developed in Phas\ne I, 2) Expand the semantic knowledge base and classify at least two million new unique sentences from multiple medical institutions, 3) Provide a SNOMED CT auto coding service (alpha service) to participating Indiana Health Information Exchange hospitals,\n and 4) Build a commercial version of the DataMiner software, and test its functionality using researchers at the Regenstrief Institute.         These scientific innovations will revolutionize the ability of health care researchers to analyze vast reposito\nries of clinical information currently locked up in electronic medical records, and correlate this data with new biomedical discoveries in proteonomics and genomics. The ability to codify text rapidly will extend the potential for clinical decision support\n beyond its narrow base of numeric and structured medical data, and enable SNOMED CT to become a useful coding standard. Phase III will offer coding and data mining services to healthcare payers (both private and government), pharmaceuticals, and academic \nresearchers. A key advantage of our approach over other NLP systems is that we attempt to codify all the information in the report and not just a limited subset, and insist on expert validation which provides a high degree of confidence in the accuracy of \nthe coded data.Project Narrative",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Research conducted over the last three decades demonstrates a connection between alcohol availability and public health outcomes (NHTSA 2005).  Approximately 85,000 Americans die each year from alcohol-related causes (\nMokdad et al 2004), 32 to 50 percent of homicides are preceded by alcohol consumption by the perpetrator (Spunt et al 1995, Goldstein et al 1992), and almost one in four victims of violent crime report that the perpetrator had been drinking prior to commit\nting the violent act (Greenfield 1998). However, the extant research, while limited, provides evidence that enforcement of alcohol laws will increase compliance with regulations and result in reductions in alcohol-related crime (Wiggers et al. 2004; McKnig\nht and Streff 1994) The Geographic Enforcement Management Service (GEMS), the focus of this Phase II proposal, is a fast, interactive, web application designed to assist those responsible for enforcing the laws that control the sale and service of alcoholi\nc beverages. It provides computer mapping, business analytics, and management reporting using an intuitive map-based interface to guide users to information they need. GEMS is an example of the Software as a Service (SaaS) business model, where a software \nvendor develops and hosts a web- based application application for use by it s customers over the Internet. SaaS offers organizations software services that are cost-effective, low risk and quick to implement. The Phase II proposal will build on the previo\nus research and experience by using GEMS to identify problem establishments within local jurisdictions and then focusing enforcement efforts on these areas. The implementation and systematic use of GEMS will be evaluated to see if targeted, increased enfor\ncement results in a reduction in alcohol-related calls for service and crimes. More specifically, the proposed Phase II effort seeks to capitalize on the success of Phase I by: a) integrating alcohol-related crime and compliance check data from local polic\ne departments, b) conducting short-term evaluation of GEMS  impact on state and local law enforcement practices and outcomes, c) creating templates for monitoring long-term impacts in public safety, and d) migrating the software application and to a more f\nlexible, industry platform that will improve the likelihood of further commercial adoption and eliminate current technical constraints on future development. GEMS will be ready for broad commercialization at the end of Phase II, so Phase III will focus on \nsales and marketing. Enhancing GEMS to integrate local crime data will add significant value to state and local agencies and was strongly advocated by potential customers and industry experts in Phase I. This should also improve affordability by potentiall\ny encouraging cost sharing among state and local law enforcement agencies. GEMS Phase II Narrative Research shows that enforcement of alcohol laws will increase compliance with regulations and result in reductions in alcohol-related crime. The Geographic E\nnforcement Management Service (GEMS) will assist those enforcement efforts by providing mapping, business analytics and management reporting to those responsible for enforcing the laws that control the sale and service of alcoholic beverages. This Phase II\n proposal will build on the previous research and experience by a) integrating alcohol-related crime and compliance check data from local police departments, b) conducting short-term evaluation of GEMS  impact on state and local law enforcement practices a\nnd outcomes, c) creating templates for monitoring long-term impacts in public safety, and d) migrating the software application and to a more flexible, industry platform that will improve the likelihood of further commercial adoption and eliminate current \ntechnical constraints on future development.",

        "abstract": "Carbonaceous aerosols warm the atmosphere while sulfate aerosols reflect sunlight, moderating climate warming. In laboratory experiments, sulfate aerosol formation depends, in a strong, non-linear manner, on ammonia concentrations.  There are limited field-studies, and uncertainties are partially responsible for limitations in predicting aerosol nucleation globally.  Improving scientific understanding of aerosol formation is crucial and timely because of the need to better characterize climate sensitivities and assess warming mitigation options that involve the use of aerosol injections into the stratosphere. Current ammonia analysis instrumentation is expensive, heavy, and requires cryogens. This project will address these problems by developing ultrasensitive airborne and terrestrial instrumentation capable of rapidly quantifying trace levels of ammonia, and other critical aerosol precursors. The Phase I project demonstrated technical feasibility by fabricating an Off-Axis ICOS analyzer that accurately measured ammonia in trace concentrations. The Phase I results were used to design a Phase II prototype.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The Phase II project will develop and deliver two analyzer systems capable of making field measurements of ammonia and other aerosol precursors at ambient levels.  The first instrument will be optimized for ammonia flux measurements and delivered to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories for field studies.

As a result, many processes operate with sub-optimal efficiency and release excessive toxic emissions, pollutants, and greenhouse gases.  This project will employ a patented Off-Axis Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy technology along with near-IR and mid-IR lasers to develop a field-portable gas analyzer for real-time quantification of several gases in high-temperature reactive flows.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the U.S. and currently affects more than 15 million people (13.5 million dry-form and 1.6 million neovascular-form). Despite the epidemic of vi\nsion loss caused by AMD, only a few therapies can slow the progression of AMD and even fewer can reverse vision loss. Currently favored therapeutic modalities include Lucentis and off-label use of Avastin, both of which target a single growth factor VEGF, \nand appear to exert most of their beneficial effect via an anti-permeability action resulting in resolution of intra and sub-retinal edema, as the actual CNV lesion does not markedly involute. Exudative AMD-related vision loss however, is not due solely to\n CNV induced sub-retinal and intra-retinal edema. Pathologic disruption and remodeling of the retinal and subretinal architecture caused collectively by CNV, sub-retinal fibrosis, edema and inflammation results in the loss of visual acuity associated with \nAMD. These multiple causes of retinal injury are not addressed by available treatments. Agents having the ability to treat the multiple mechanisms which underlie exudative AMD-related vision loss, beyond just treating vascular leakage, would be of great va\nlue and are likely to fulfill the unmet medical need associated with exudative AMD. Lpath has recently developed Sonepcizumab, a novel humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the bioactive lysophospholipid, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Sonepcizuma\nb represents the first successfully created monoclonal antibody against a lysophospholipid. Sonepcizumab acts as a molecular sponge to selectively and specifically with picomolar affinity, absorb S1P from the extracellular fluid, lowering the effective con\ncentration of S1P. Growing evidence suggests that S1P could contribute to both the early and late stages of maladaptive retinal remodeling associated with exudative AMD. S1P has a pronounced non-VEGF dependent pro-angiogenic effect. S1P also stimulates mig\nration, proliferation and survival of multiple cell types, including fibroblasts and endothelial and inflammatory cells that participate in the multiple maladaptive processes of exudative AMD. S1P is also linked to the production and activation of VEGF, FG\nF, PDGF MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8 and other growth factors implicated in the pathogenesis of exudative AMD. Inhibiting the action of S1P could therefore be an effective therapeutic treatment for exudative AMD that may offer significant advantages over exclusively \nanti-VEGF approaches or act synergistically with them to address the complex processes and multiple steps that ultimately lead to AMD associated visual loss. In Lpath's Phase I SBIR studies, the murine anti-S1P antibody demonstrated profound efficacy to re\nduce choroidal neovascularization as well as other vascular and extravascular processes of AMD in a murine model. In continuation of the RandD efforts initiated in Phase I, we hereby propose as series of Phase II studies to test whether neutralization of S\n1P with the humanized antibody, Sonepcizumab, is an effective strategy for the treatment of exudative AMD. The first goal of the Phase II research plan is to evaluate the pharmacological activity/efficacy of Sonepcizumab to reduce the multiple pathologies \nof exudative AMD in a laser-induced Cynomolgus monkey model of CNV. We will investigate the ability of Sonepcizumab to mitigate not only neovascularization and edema but also sub-retinal fibrosis and inflammation in comparison and synergistically with Luce\nntis, an anti-VEGF therapy. The second goal is to assess the safety of Sonepcizumab after repeat intravitreous administration to Cynomolgus monkeys. Finally, the mechanism of action by which Sonepcizumab is able to mitigate the multiple etiologies of AMD w\nill be investigated. The successful completion of these Phase II studies will demonstrate the efficacy and safety profiles of Sonepcizumab to support an IND fil",

In support of this goal, this project will demonstrate a low-cost flexible Spectrum Splitting Holographic Concentrator (SSHOC) that focuses light onto solar cells with high efficiency, thereby increasing the output of existing photovoltaic (PV) systems.  The SSHOC, which is based on four thin film holographic optical elements that are dispersion- and aberration-corrected, is easily manufactured, has 99 percent diffraction efficiency, is lightweight, and has low-cost.  Phase I demonstrated feasibility by theoretical analysis and computer modeling, and by fabricating a compact experimental prototype.  Spectral characteristics of the prototype were investigated through a series of laboratory experiments, performance tests, and the analysis of the results.  A number of advantages over existing techniques and approaches were demonstrated:  (1) highly stable spectral characteristics of volume holographic multilayer\u00bfs, (2) compact packaging into a single module for all wavelengths, and (3) tunable bandwidths over a spectral range from visible to near IR.  Phase II will complete the SSHOC development and optimize the holographic optical elements so that they will be mass producible and superior to state-of-the-art technologies in terms of both performance and cost.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The flexible SSHOC technology should primarily benefit concentrator PV systems for use with multi-junction solar cells, providing mass reduction, simplified deployment, and increased efficiency and power output.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disseminated peritoneal cancer is caused by the spread of primary epithelial cancer as a result of shedding cells followed by implantation into other tissues and organs within the peritoneum. It occurs in late stages of\n cancer but is also responsible for tumor recurrence in patients with resectable tumors that lack hematogenous or lymphatic metastasis due to the presence of residual or seeded (from surgery) disease cells. Thus an adjuvant treatment for this micrometastas\nis, typically chemotherapy, is required. However, recurrence rates are still unacceptably high and the therapeutic outcome is often uncertain. It is proposed to develop a new adjunct therapy using photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy that have been sh\nown in Phase I to be more efficacious than Photofrin at light induced killing of various cancer cell lines in vitro. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a procedure that uses a non-toxic photosensitizer (PS) and visible light to generate reactive oxygen species \n(ROS) that kill tumor cells. One advantage of PDT is its level of selectivity, achieved through PS that selectively target specific cell or tissue types, and the ability to control the illumination area. For intraperitoneal PDT, the peritoneum is filled wi\nth a light scattering fluid and PS. The cavity is then illuminated either immediately after surgery directly into the open cavity or with a fiber optic cable through a small incision. Because the entire cavity is treated, undetected micrometastases can be \neradicated. One major advantage of our PS is that laser light is not needed. In addition, because fullerenes do not absorb red light, phototoxicity related to deep tissue penetrating light is minimized. To accomplish the goals of Phase II, we will synthesi\nze new compounds based on established structure-activity relationships and screen them in vitro for PDT efficacy. The lead PS candidate along with the PS developed in Phase I will then be carried into in vivo studies in three mouse cancer models: ovarian, \ncolorectal, and reticulum cell sarcoma PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disseminated peritoneal cancer of various forms affect thousands of Americans every year. Current adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery has traditionally been the best line of defense against di\nsease recurrence. However, the unacceptably low 5-year survival rate necessitates the development of alternative treatments such as photodynamic therapy.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microfluidics is a branch of science dealing with the behavior, precise control and manipulation of microliter and nanoliter volumes of fluids. Its applications include blood-cell-separation, biochemical assays, chemica\nl synthesis, genetic analysis (e.g., gene-chips and proteomics chips), drug screening, electrochromatography, etc. One of the most difficult problems in bringing microfluidic products to the market is the lack of appropriate methods to accurately transfer \nand manage small quantities of fluid. Many microfluidic devices rely on relatively complex and costly mechanically activated pumps that are unsuitable for many applications. Techniques that are built into the microfluidic device and operate by electrically\n activated processes, such as electroosmosis and piezoelectrics, are often insufficiently reliable. Thus, there is a need to develop cheap and accurate fluid management systems and components. This proposal describes a novel, low cost micropump for fluid m\nanagement that is based on electrochemical (i.e., electrolysis and fuel cell) principles. Its benefits are: (1) accurate delivery of microliter quantities of fluids, (2) low cost of manufacture (it is based on a single moving part), (3) ability to operate \nat very high backpressures if required (gt100 psi), and (4) scaleable to meet a variety of user applications (flow rates range from microliters per minute to milliliters per minute). In Phase I, we streamlined the micropump assembly techniques and demonstr\nated the micropump's process and cost advantages. Practical uses of the micropump were demonstrated, such as for controlling a laboratory colorimetric enzymatic reaction on a microfluidic diagnostic chip. The micropump's reliability was also demonstrated t\nhrough long- term continuous operation. The low cost, accuracy, and reliability of the micropump strongly differentiates it from competing methods, making this micropump uniquely appropriate for inclusion into high volume medical products (cartridges and m\nicrofabricated fluidic chips etc.) that are designed to be disposable. This is important because the field of microfluidics is moving in this direction. The proposed Phase II project involves materials development, engineering design, process control devel\nopment and microfluidics applications testing that, if successful, will position the technology for future transition into a manufacturing or product environment. Our program includes working with a medical equipment manufacturer and with regulatory affair\ns specialists. The focus is on exploiting the unique features of the micropump for use in future drug infusion systems.

Symmetric electrochemical capacitors that consist of two identical electrodes currently utilize flammable, non-aqueous electrolytes to improve the energy density. Hybrid or assymetric configurations that utilize different electrodes result in significantly higher energy densities and can operate in aqueous rather than non-aqueous electrolytes. The objectives of the Phase II project are to optimize the material's synthesis, further characterize the material, perform electrochemical testing to evaluate the energy density, power density and cycle life of the material, optimize the electrode fabrication process and electrolyte composition, and develop a low-cost, large-scale manufacturing process to produce the material.

        "abstract": "Although water recycle and reuse is considered good environmental practice, its implementation is highly dependent upon the economics and hence can be challenging to implement. An example is the recovery of low quality heat as water condensate from industrial flue gases. In this case, tremendous quantities of energy and water are lost out the stack in the US today, since no conventional condensing technology is economically viable. In this proposal, we present a unique technology/process, the Transport Membrane Condenser (TMC), to recover water with concomitant energy recovery from these low quality industrial emissions. As a specific example, industrial boilers account for nearly 35% of US industrial energy consumption. It is estimated that about 70 billion gallons of water per year are available in the combustion flue gas generated from these boilers. Our TMC technology can be used to recover the water vapor and energy from this flue gas for boiler feed water makeup. Prior to the Phase I submission, our pilot testing of the proposed TMC demonstrated the technical feasibility for high purity water recovery from the flue gas with concomitant heat recovery. However, its payback period exceeded the targeted one year set by our commercialization partner During Phase I avenues for cost reduction and performance enhancement with the modification of our existing commercial membranes have been identified and evaluated using a bench-top unit simulated the flue gas environment. We were able to achieve a 60% reduction In capital cost of the TMC element via significant enhancement of the membrane efficiency and reduction in the production costs. This reduction was well in excess of the 33 to 50% reduction necessary to deliver a one year capital payback as required by our commercialization partner. In this Phase II proposal, we will develop this modified membrane, verify its functional performance in a finalized module configuration, and conduct membrane manufacturing development while assisting our commercialization partners in preparing the technology/product/system for field demonstration The successful completion of this proposed Phase II project will produce a commercially viable true green process for water conservation and reuse along with significant energy savings. In addition to the boiler flue, during Phase I, additional water recycle/reuse and energy recovery was identify by our proposed technology for numerous industrial emission streams. Further, this transport membrane condenser can offer a truly green agricultural greenhouse operation via water recycle. energy storage/reuse, humidity control, and elimination of fungicide use.",

The p\nrocess will be optimized to work with samples that contain nucleic acid in a range from picograms to micrograms. The novel method uses forward and reverse electrophoretic separation of genomic DNA from total cell lysate in a sampleprocessing cassette that \nhas sections of agarose cast on either side of sample loading wells. Cassettes can be constructed to contain multiple lanes, allowing multiple samples to be processed simultaneously during a programmed electrophoretic separation run. The sample lanes and l\noading wells can be miniaturized to allow simultaneous purification of a few, or hundreds of samples at one time. The method requires no moving parts and can be performed in less than 15 minutes. Trials with prototype cassettes constructed prior and during\n phase I, have shown that DNA prepared by this procedure is highly pure, and can be used in PCR amplification and other molecular biology applications. Our Phase II goal is to demonstrate that the electrophoretic process can be universally and reproducibil\nity applied to the purification of bacterial, mammalian, and plant DNA from a wide range of sample sizes. Phase I data showed that the method can purify DNA from samples containing only nanograms of genomic DNA. In Phase II, experiments will be carried out\n to improve the performance method developed prior to and during phase I, including steps to: (1) Further optimize the electrophoretic run programs to allow the shortest purification time (2) Refine the separation process to accept smaller sample volumes c\nontaining trace amounts of DNA. (3) Expand the list of sample types of bacteria, plant, mammalian cells, and yeast, (4) Further improve the lysis chemistry and pre-treatment conditions. (5) Assay the activity of the purified DNA using RFLP, and PCR DNA seq\nuencing. (6) Develop and test buffer wicks and pre-manufactured disposable wick-cassettes. (7) Develop a protocol for DNA purification from small volumes of whole blood or dried blood and buccal swabs. (8) Develop an improved version of the DC power supply\n that will deliver up to 300 volts. (9) Modify the operating software of the instrument to accomplish the genomic DNA purification. (10) Write an instruction manual and specifications for the developed product. The final product using this technology will \ncost less than  0.50 per sample with a processing device that is a relatively simple adaptation of the Mini-Prep 96 instruments that our company currently sells. These criteria compare favorably to current DNA purification kits that are typically  1 per pr\nep, and to automated instruments for this purpose, which are priced at  20,000 -  80,000. Because this new cassette has no moving parts, it can be constructed with a high density of sample lanes per cassette, such as 24 or 48 lanes within its 4.5  x 2  x 1\n  dimensions. This product will also be significantly easier to operate and require less bench space than any manual or instrumented product currently available. It will provide a less expensive, faster, and better solution to the problem of automating gen\nomic DNA preparations, and will be designed to fit the needs of the small laboratory. The products that will result from this work will address the 40,000+ molecular biology research labs worldwide, with a potential market of  35 million.

The specific aims are: 1) Improve magnetic nanoparticle labels and their conjugation to antibodies (d100 nm size with lt15% size variability, 10X reduced aggregatio\nn after conjugation to detect Ab, low aggregation in serum) 2) Build new instrument for rare cell detection (10X improved sensitivity, 20X higher throughput) 3) Demonstrate ultra-sensitive detection of  rare  cells in simple CLL model system with new instr\nument and reagents, compare to flow cytometry (detect 50 cells in background of 107 cells lt45 minutes) 4) Demonstrate rapid, sensitive magnetic cell assay for minimal residual disease assessment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in clinical samples (detect \nas few as 50 CLL cells in 107 leukocytes in lt45 min) The high sensitivity of magnetic platform enables the detection of rare cells (1 in 104-106), or cells expressing a low number of receptors. The  mix and measure  format significantly reduces assay prep\naration time and simplifies automation (no wash steps). This ability to work with little or no sample preparation facilitates rapid, high throughput testing on clinical samples. The interdisciplinary effort unites Moores UCSD Cancer Center and Nano Tumor C\nenter of Excellence for Cancer Nanotechnology, UCSD for the leukemia application, Immunicon Corporation for the custom magnetic nanoparticle labels and rare cell detection expertise, SoluLink, Inc. for the bioconjugation chemistry for attaching antibodies \nto magnetic nanoparticles, and MagneSensors, Inc. for magnetic sensors, instrumentation, and magnetic assay expertise.Project Narrative Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common form of leukemia in North America and Europe and accounts for over\n 30% of all leukemias. CLL remains incurable with the currently available treatments and the prognosis of patients varies substantially. Existing techniques available to assess minimal residual disease to optimize treatment, such as flow cytometry and poly\nmerase chain reaction (PCR), are inadequate for routine clinical use. A magnetic platform capable of rapid, ultra-sensitive, assays to detect rare leukemia cells could assess minimal detectable disease in CLL and have clinical utility for improving patient\n outcomes by enabling physicians to adjust therapies sooner than is currently possible.",

        "abstract": "With the continuing growth in the demand for shrimp and the ever-increasing reliance on imports to satisfy that demand, there is a tremendous and growing need for sustainable domestic sources of marine shrimp. Neither US wild harvest (~ 300 million lbs annually) nor the domestic outdoor pond-based farm-raised shrimp industry (8 million lbs annually) provides the solution, since these sources together produced only 15% of total shrimp consumption in 2004 and are significantly constrained due to the limits of nature, land, climate, disease, environmental concerns, and other factors. Magnolia has developed a technical approach using recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) technology that we believe can produce shrimp economically on a consistent basis. In order to be commercially viable, this system must be capable of achieving biological productivity sufficient to offset the higher energy and capital costs characteristic of such systems. In addition, since these systems can be located in-shore (inland) near attractive population centers, a premium price should also be achievable for fresh and even live product with an effective marketing and sales effort. In these niche markets, Magnolia believes it can be successful even though its production costs will be higher than the pond reared or wild caught animals. These production costs, however, are estimated to be dramatically lower compared with traditional methods of production and other competing re-circulating systems, e.g., our capitalization costs are much lower that what has been reported in the literature and we expect our productivity per unit footprint of building to be higher than other systems to date due to our selective breeding program and our high percentage coverage of floor area by water raceways. Based upon Magnolia's efforts over the previous 24 months, we have built a prototype production facility in Beaver Dam, KY that will be the basis of a refined system that is capable of producing a repeatable quality product on a continuous basis. The Phase II research will build on the results of Phase I to take the final step towards the successful development of environmentally-sustainable marine shrimp production.",

While GPS-based solutions show promise in outdoor environments, there are currently no widespread O&N devices that are designed for use in indoor environments. This makes it difficult for people with visual impairments to navigate through indoor public spaces. The purpose of this research will be to complete development of a new type of radio frequency identification (RFID) system, in which intelligent, variable-range active RFID beacons are programmed with information about their locations and placed through indoor environments like schools, shopping malls and museums. This information will be accessible to people with visual impairments via a small RFID receiver worn on the user?s belt. Information will be conveyed to the user via a text-to-speech interface. Results from field testing have demonstrated that the device helps people with visual impairments to navigate through an unfamiliar environment. Phase II research will complete development of the communications protocols and interface techniques that give the system its unique capabilities for delivering speech-based information to people with visual impairments.  There are 10.4 million people with visual impairments in the U.S., and this research will lead to an inexpensive commercial product that will greatly enhance their ability to\nnavigate in unfamiliar surroundings. The market for this technology includes those who will purchase the RFID receivers and the RFID beacons. This includes people with visual impairments, as well as the owners and tenants of public spaces, such as office buildings, schools, malls, museums and government facilities.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary focus of this Phase II proposal is development of a product against Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is an increasingly important cause of morbidity and mortality in both hospital and long term nursing homes as \nwell as in family environments. The direct and indirect cost of AD has been conservatively estimated at  149 billion in the U.S. Medicare expenditures alone are expected to increase to  160 billion by 2010. There is not yet any treatment that can delay or \nstop the deterioration of brain cells in AD. In the Phase I project, murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated against the A??amyloid peptide. The binding of these mAbs to different conformational aggregates of A??was measured and a number of mAbs\n that recognize soluble oligomers of A??with high affinity were identified. These mAbs were produced at high levels as mouse-human hybrids in a unique plant expression system. In addition, a phage display library of human ScFvs was constructed in order to \nidentify additional unique antibodies resulting from a human autoimmunity. In Specific Aim 1 of this proposal, new human mAbs will be evaluated and compared to the existing hybrids. The best five antibodies from this population will be tested in vivo in AP\nPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice to assess the impact of injected antibody on murine cognitive function (Specific Aim 2). In Specific Aim 3, the best mAb of the group will be produced in a GMP facility for use in IND-enabling studies to support a Phase 1 safety\n trial. In the final aim, Specific Aim 4, the cGMP produced mAb will be used to complete Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling studies (pharmacology and toxicology, CMC) to enable an IND submission. More than 5 million people in the U.S. currently have A\nlzheimer's disease (AD). At this time, there is no treatment that can delay or stop the deterioration of brain cells in AD. The aim of this proposal is to develop new antibody-based therapies for AD that, it is hoped, will ultimately act to both prevent an\nd treat the disease. The experiments in the proposal will provide the foundation for clinical evaluation of these potential therapies to ensure their safety and efficacy.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improving statistical methods to provide better classification performance and new analytical capabilities for categorical regression would be invaluable to the medical and health care research communities. Categorical \nregression models (e.g., binary logistic, multinomial logistic) are used extensively to identify patterns of alcohol-related symptoms, screen for disorders, and assess policies. In addition, such models are used extensively in other areas of research such \nas mental illness, cancer, traumatic injuries, and AIDS-related pathologies. However, many such models are developed with inadequate support to fully analyze and exploit the intrinsically probabilistic nature of their results. This is of critical importanc\ne as health researchers, clinicians, and administrators are often faced with classification decisions using categorical regression models to identify unacceptable risks, adequate outcomes, and acceptable guidelines for screening, diagnoses, treatment, and \nquality of care. Commercially available statistical software does not offer sophisticated methods for robust estimation of posterior probabilities in the presence of model misspecification, missing covariates, and nonignorable missing data generating proce\nsses. Such robust missing data handling methods provide natural mechanisms for dealing with verification bias and modeling correlated, longitudinal, or survey data with complex sampling designs. Moreover, commercially available statistical software does no\nt provide automated methods for using estimated posterior probabilities to make optimal classification decisions with respect to different optimality criteria. In particular, automated features such as optimizing multiple decision criteria (allocation rule\ns) that trade off specificity against sensitivity, decision threshold confidence intervals, statistical tests for evaluating correct specification of posterior probabilities, statistical tests for comparing competing classifier thresholds, and methods for \nmulti-outcome classification and inference are not readily available. Phase II research will extend Phase I findings for binary logistic regression to develop and implement automated robust classification methods for multinomial logistic regression modelin\ng, which also applies to the larger class of nonlinear categorical regression models that output posterior probabilities. The Phase II software prototype will provide: 1) new user-selectable robust decision threshold estimators, 2) robust confidence interv\nals on decision threshold estimators, 3) new classifier threshold comparison tests, 4) new outcome probability specification tests, 5) efficient missing data handling methods in the presence of nonignorable nonresponse data, and 6) second-order analytic an\nd simulation-based Bayesian methods for improved small sample and rare event outcome probability estimation. These new methodologies will be integrated into a prototype user-friendly software package, evaluated with extensive simulation studies, and then a\npplied to real world classification problems encountered in: alcohol, mental illness (depression, bipolar, schizophrenia), cancer (prostate), trauma (emergency room), and infectious disease (AIDS) through collaborations with domain experts in those respect\nive fields. In summary, Phase II research will establish the essential technical foundation for Phase III commercialization with the objective of providing a suite of new classification analysis methods as an advanced statistical tool that improves epidemi\nologic, clinical, and public health research.",

Phase I explored the use of solid microchannel regenerator cartridges instead of traditional regenerator beds packed with spheres.  Technologies were demonstrated for the fabrication of magnetocaloric CoMnT1-xT\u00bfx powders and for the fabrication of microchannel structures from these powders.  The basic requirements (with respect to source materials, methods of deformation, and consolidation of the powders) needed to preserve the magnetocaloric effect in the microchannel structures produced from these powders were established.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research program is to develop an efficient large-scale commercial system for manufacture of lentiviral gene therapy vectors in suspension cells. This proposal is submitted in response to PA-0\n6-013,  Manufacturing Processes of Medical, Dental and Biological Technologies.  There is a critical unmet need to develop robust, scalable, closed, cGMP-compliant manufacturing systems for generating and producing lentivirus gene therapy vectors that are \nsuitable for clinical and commercial use. Lentiviral vectors are being developed for a number of therapeutic applications and clinical studies are underway.  Unfortunately, lentiviral vectors are difficult to produce in large numbers due to the lack of sta\nble packaging cell lines and due to inefficiencies, lack of robustness, and limited scalabilities associated with standard methods using transient transfection, which is a key step in the manufacturing process. MaxCyte has developed a cell transfection and\n production system that is an efficient, scalable process for engineering cell function and enabling cell-based manufacturing for clinical applications. In Phase 1 of this project, we demonstrated that this system enables high titer lentivector production \nin adherent and suspension-adapted cells in both small and large scale transfections. The next challenge is to optimize and scale up an aseptic production system and demonstrate large scale lentivector production technology in a cGMP manufacturing facility\n. This achievement will enable the first application of an FDA-approved cell loading technology for scalable production of lentiviral vectors by transient transfection in non-adherent cells cultured in serum-free medium. Therefore, the Specific Aims of thi\ns Phase 2 project are to: 1) optimize culture conditions for culturing suspension-adapted cells for vector production; 2) achieve sterile integration of the MaxCyte cell processing instrumentation with the Wave cell production technology; 3) optimize viral\n production capacity by maximizing the number of infectious viral particles that can be produced by and collected from transfected cells; 4) demonstrate feasibility of the completely integrated viral production system at a small commercial scale; and 5) de\nmonstrate large scale lentivector production in a cGMP manufacturing facility.  The interest expressed in this application of the MaxCyte cell loading technology by Indiana University Vector Production Facility (IUVPF) and SAFC Pharma emphasizes the import\nance of the project. These facilities provide contract manufacturing services for lentiviral vectors (and a number of other viral vectors) for gene therapy clinical trials. IUVPF will perform cGMP manufacturing for Aim 5 and thereby demonstrate the ability\n to transfer the MaxCyte technology to large scale commercial manufacturing.        Public Health Relevance: There is a critical unmet need to develop robust, scalable, closed, cGMP-compliant manufacturing systems for producing lentiviral gene therapy vect\nors that are suitable for clinical and commercial use. The goal of this Phase 2 SBIR project is to optimize and validate a proprietary cell transfection and production system that provides an efficient, large-scale commercial process for developing and man\nufacturing lentiviral gene therapy vectors for clinical applications. The benefits of this production system will translate into safer, better, cost effective gene therapies on the market more rapidly to benefit patients in many disease areas with unmet ne\ned today, such as: Parkinson's disease, age-related macular degeneration, beta-thalassemia, sickle-cell anemia, muscular dystrophy, and a variety of lympho-hematopoetic pathologies including HIV infection, leukemias, and lymphomas.",

However, enterally-fed patients are vulnerable to adverse events when obtaining enteral access or during the delivery of EN (e.g. infectious, metabolic, gastrointestinal, and nutrition complic\nations), which can result in increased morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, many healthcare practitioners lack up-to-date training to deliver EN in the safest and most effective manner, in part because mastery of evidence-based knowledge and specialized\n skills can be challenging and time consuming; and a comprehensive, interdisciplinary EN training program is not widely available. The development of the Enteral Nutrition Practitioner Tutorial - An Online Case-Based Learning Program is proposed as a strat\negy to overcome these challenges.         Phase I was highly successful and resulted in: 1) the development of the proposed course curriculum; 2) identification of software features to maximize pedagogical effectiveness, 3) a content development plan for P\nhase II; 4) creation of the prototype content delivery platforms, with sample content for demonstration; and 5) two rigorous research designs to be conducted in Phase II.         For this Phase II SBIR project, MD Informatics (MDI), a medical education tec\nhnology RandD company, will collaborate with the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N., a professional nutrition support society) to develop the Enteral Nutrition Practitioner Tutorial (ENPT) courseware. MDI will then collaborat\ne with Intermountain Healthcare to validate ENPT's pedagogical approach for effectiveness in long-term knowledge retention and improvement in clinician practice behavior. Completion and evaluation of ENPT in Phase II will provide a much-needed EN training \nresource for interdisciplinary healthcare practitioners and fulfill the goals of: 1) promoting safe practices to maximize the potential benefits and reduce preventable EN-related complications, and 2) providing a research opportunity to identify educationa\nl methods that most effectively influence EN practice behaviors. This proposal is consistent with the mission of NIH by applying medical and behavioral research to reduce the nation's burden of illness. Furthermore, this proposal offers an innovative appro\nach to help fulfill the key healthcare aims set forth by the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) Quality Chasm reports by promoting safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable care to the increasing number of patients who require EN in in\nstitutional and home care settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A fundamental objective of medical education is to assure that healthcare practitioners incorporate best practice research into routine patient care in a timely manner. The product to be develope\nd, an Enteral Nutrition Practitioner Tutorial (ENPT), will offer innovative computer-assisted instruction (CAI) to facilitate healthcare practitioners' ability to translate evidence-based EN research into practice behaviors and system-wide protocols and gu\nidelines. MD Informatics (MDI) believes that: 1) the public health implications of the proposed ENPT will be to maximize the potential benefits, while reducing the incidence of preventable adverse events associated with the delivery of EN, and 2) research \nconducted in Phase II will demonstrate that use of the tutorial leads to favorable effects on long-term knowledge retention and clinician practice behavior.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MedArray has successfully developed under SBIR Phase I and II, a novel silicone membrane hollow fiber for use in blood oxygenators. Our patented silicone hollow fiber has great commercial potential for use in long term \nextracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as well as routine cardiopulmonary bypass. Because ECMO can last more than 1 day, dense rather than microporous membranes are typically used to prevent plasma leakage. The membrane of choice for ECMO is silicone b\necause of its excellent blood compatibility, and because it has no pores for plasma leakage. In the US, the only oxygenator currently FDA approved for use in long term applications is Medtronic's ECMO oxygenator. However, this spiral wound, flat sheet sili\ncone oxygenator's design dates back to 1963, and has many disadvantages including areas of blood stagnation, minimal convective mixing, large blood contact surface areas, and high hemodynamic resistance. The lack of a suitable dense membrane hollow fiber f\nor long term use in the US has prevented US manufacturers from developing a more efficient hollow fiber based long term oxygenator. Our studies in Phase I and II have shown that our silicone hollow fibers' performance is superior to the spiral wound silico\nne membranes, and comparable to microporous membranes in gas transfer and platelet trends. However, our silicone membrane cannot leak plasma or grossly embolize gas into the blood side like microporous membranes. Moreover, we have shown in an 11-day in-viv\no study that our membrane can perform and sustain the rigors of long- term cardiorespiratory support. MedArray's silicone membrane hollow fiber will enable a strong ECMO oxygenator market contender in the US and abroad. This proposal is aimed at continuing\n the development of our proprietary dense membrane hollow fiber while focusing on all aspects relevant to implementing our membrane in clinical oxygenators. Specifically, we will investigate the effects of membrane materials on safety, effectiveness, and b\niocompatibility following FDA guidelines to ultimately meet their requirements and expectations prior to clinical use. We will also rigorously test our membrane in oxygenators for gas transfers performance, and thrombogenicity in long-term in-vivo studies.\n Finally, we will continue refining our membrane fabrication processes by assessing the parameters pertinent to quality control and cost reduction to ultimately establish a robust and controlled process compliant with good manufacturing practices (GMP).Thi\ns research and development work will result in a membrane for long-term blood-gas transfer that can replace current membrane technology dating back to 1963. The proposed membrane will enable the manufacture of highly efficient blood oxygenators with superi\nor gas transfer, and reduced risk of deadly complications compared to currently used long term membranes.",

Evidence-based practices in mental health are an integral part of the plan to achieve this goal. This SBIR contract will work with experts to improve the quality of evidence-based mental health practices through the development of extensive curriculum, educational materials, and methodologies to educate young investigators and clinicians, graduate fellows, and undergraduate students with the hope of bringing them into the pipeline, creating a researcher base for future research, and training the end users to integrate it into their practice. Besides reviewing the existing strong evidence base, this program will also look into the evidence gap, identifying areas where more research is needed. The end product will be a Web based platform hosting expert panel discussions, interactive educational modules, and a host of peer reviewed resources. This initiative will create a credible, content rich, current, and innovative learning system that will be constantly updated and will become as the most authoritative online resource for promoting research and implementation of evidence based practices to improve the quality of care and patient outcomes for the elderly.

        "abstract": "The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes the design, development and commercialization of shape memory polymer orthopedic soft-tissue fixation devices. Current soft tissue fixation devices are primarily metal or plastic screws used to attach tissue grafts to bone in repair of torn anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL). These threaded devices commonly damage the tendon during insertion; reducing the effectiveness of the surgery. Shape memory polymers are a superior solution in that they can provide a simpler, stronger, and less damaging fixation method for these tendon grafts. Essentially, a shape memory polymer device can be; (1) delivered into the body in a compacted and less invasive state, (2) self-deploy at body temperature and (3) do so without sharp edges that might damage the tissue.  The proposed work has immediate commercial potential and direct societal benefit in the field of sports medicine with a significant market on the order of $210 million in ACL repair devices annually. Furthermore, the biomaterial developed for ACL reconstruction should have long-term impact on the 1.6MM orthopedic procedures performed each year to repair tendons and ligaments in knees, shoulders, and ankles and by reducing the invasiveness of surgery and improving the outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Although biobutanol has a number of clear-cut advantages over bioethanol as a renewable alternative fuel, biobutanol is not currently produced as a biofuel for economic reasons.  The current method of biobutanol production, by acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation and distillation, is too complex and energy-intensive.  This project will develop a novel membrane-distillation hybrid process for biobutanol separation and recovery that uses membranes for both butanol removal and dehydration.  Compared to conventional biobutanol distillation, the proposed technology could lower the energy consumption of the biobutanol separation steps by 87%.  In Phase I, two types of membranes were successfully developed to recover and separate ABE from ABE fermentation solutions.  The data obtained were used to conduct process simulations that confirmed the technical performance and economic feasibility of the process.  In Phase II, the membranes and process design will be optimized, and a hybrid membrane-distillation separation process will be evaluated.  A pilot system will be constructed to evaluate the performance of industrial scale membrane modules with both synthetic ABE solutions and real feedstocks.  The pilot system will used in a small field test to demonstrate the technology. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new membrane technology should enable economic production of butanol, a green fuel alcohol, from renewable resources.  Existing and future corn-to-ethanol plants could be retrofitted for butanol production if the technology were proven to be economic.  In addition, the technology could be adopted to replace petroleum-derived butanol and acetone.",

        "abstract": "In order to reduce the accumulation of greenhouse gases, it has been proposed to sequester the carbon dioxide from the flue gas of coal power plants by injecting the CO2 into unmineable coalbeds.  The methane gas displaced by the carbon dioxide could be recovering and sold, thereby covering the cost of sequestration.  However, nitrogen and oxygen typically is injected along with the carbon dioxide, which leads to a coalbed methane product contaminated with multiple impurities.  Conventional gas processing technology applied to such contaminated gas is expensive and complex.  This project will develop a membrane process that can remove all of the main impurities in a single operation.  In Phase I, membranes with good properties for separating carbon dioxide, nitrogen, oxygen, and water from methane were produced and evaluated as bench-scale membrane modules.  A preliminary technical and economic analysis showed that the process would be cost effective.  In Phase II, the technology will be scaled up, and pilot-scale or small-industrial-scale membrane modules will be produced and installed in a field test system at a coalbed methane gas processing plant.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The membrane process should find wide applicability in the treatment of natural gas containing multiple contaminants.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of children in the U.S. are at risk for learning to read well despite major advances in our understanding of the causes and cures for poor reading. In this Fast- Track proposal we propose to address this significant need and opportunity with a computer-based reading program that combines the power of one-on-one tutoring with the benefits of self-assessing, individualized, scientifically-based reading instruction. We plan to position this product, Foundations to Literacy(tm), as a service over the Web, so that it is accessible in classrooms and resource rooms, community learning centers and homes. The goal of the Phase I work is to demonstrate the technical feasibility of delivering an immersive, individualized one-on-one tutoring experience to children in organizations and homes using a scalable, cost-effective Application Service Provider (ASP) delivery model. Success in the Phase I project will be measured by satisfactory learning experiences by 16 children connected to a single server who are using the program simultaneously. The goal of the Phase II research and development effort is to enhance the functionality of the Foundations to Literacy program by incorporating a new set of learning activities into the program that teach children to read text fluently with good comprehension. Improving reading comprehension is a national priority, and research has shown that good comprehension requires sufficient vocabulary and the ability to read words in context fluently and automatically. We propose to develop a novel set of learning activities that facilitate acquisition of basic oral vocabulary-the meanings of spoken words-and also teaches children to recognize printed versions of these words accurately and rapidly. In addition, using speech recognition technology to measure the performance of students as they read text out loud, we will develop a set of learning tools that teach children to read fluently and expressively. The enhanced version of the program will be tested extensively in classrooms and homes, and refined based on user experiences. During the final six months of the project, formative and summative evaluation of the program will be conducted for children in first, second and third grade classrooms, and for children in these age ranges in their homes. Successful outcomes of the Phase II work will be measured by improved reading fluency and comprehension of texts by students randomly assigned to the new version of the program, relative to students randomly assigned to alternative treatments. Successful outcomes of the proposed work will result in an accessible and effective reading program for beginning readers that will facilitate learning of foundational reading skills and practice and improve these skills to teach them to read fluently and with good comprehension. The commercial proposal is to market the program initially to homes and to schools. Because there are millions of children who may never learn to read well unless they receive effective, individualized instruction and too few teachers to provide the necessary level of instruction in our schools, the network-based reading tutor could provide significant benefit to individuals and to society. The proposed wok will demonstrate the feasibility and potential of a computer-based reading program that is designed to teach children to read and learn from text through conversational interaction with a lifelike computer character that behaves like a sensitive and effective reading teacher. The research will extend an existing and efficacious treatment developed at the University of Colorado that has been tested extensively with kindergarten through second grade children, including students with cognitive disabilities and students at risk for learning to read because of linguistic and/or cultural challenges. If successful, the proposed work could improve the literacy skills and student achievement of millions of students.",

The approach defines a set of layered abstractions from the low-level display driver to higher-level protocols including multi-user display use and security. This model is the bedrock of a new display architecture that will not constrain future display innovations, allow content developers and producers to communicate to current and future display systems, and acts to isolate the underlying complexities of new display technologies from users. Building on this new architecture, the Phase II project will implement a software-based Display Operating System. The project is motivated by the perception that we will soon live in a world where displays cease to be individual discreet devices but rather become an extension of our environment; a limitless fabric of pixels.  The potential impact of this innovation is significant, by removing the usability and cost barriers normally associated with ultrahigh-resolution displays, applications once available to only a select few can become commonplace.

Inorganic scintillators have high output efficiency, but relay on the growth of bulk crystal that is still a challenging task.  Due to their relatively low cost and availability as large size sheets, organic scintillators are ideal for use in applications such as portal monitors and waste monitors. However, organic scintillators have low light output efficiency, and thus are not very suitable for detection of lower energy radiation.

The specific aim of the Phase II project is to complete the design and develop a full interactive virtual experience that will reduce the risk faced by Rail Workers, First Responders, and the community when dealing with incidents involving hazardous \nmaterials transported by rail. If First Responders and Rail Workers follow a systematic approach to handling emergency incidents, public safety and workers' safety and health will be better protected and disasters may be mitigated more rapidly. This resear\nch is relevant to public health due to the increasing level of hazardous materials being transported via rail, and the current lack of adequate training materials for emergency personnel responding to such incidents. Approximately 800,000 shipments of haza\nrdous substances travel daily throughout the United States, frequently through densely populated areas where the consequences of an acute release could result in environmental damage, severe injury, or death. In 2006 there were three recorded instances of \nchlorine tank car derailments in the United States. The DVD brings to life as a facilitated training exercise the catastrophic Norfolk Southern railroad derailment that occurred in Graniteville, SC in 2005. The collision released over 11,000 gallons of chl\norine gas, causing nine deaths, injuring hundreds, and displacing hundreds more civilians. We have incorporated compelling and realistic interactive video simulations of hazardous materials incidents, instructive three dimensional computer animations, and \nengaging team exercises to produce an effective training tool that successfully transfers knowledge as noted in the subsequent evaluation. MetaMedia's application of DVD technology will take advantage of the unique features of DVD, such as high-quality mot\nion video, interactive branching, and low-cost delivery systems to bring real-world simulations into the classroom. The deliverables for Phase II will be a completed DVD program providing up to 4 hours of content, including recommendations resulting from t\nhe evaluation, additional components of the interactive experience, and instructor and student guides. 4.4.7 Project Narrative This research is relevant to public health due to the increasing level of hazardous materials being transported via rail, and the\n current lack of adequate training materials for emergency personnel responding to such incidents. Approximately 800,000 shipments of hazardous substances travel daily throughout the United States, frequently through densely populated areas where the conse\nquences of an acute release could result in environmental damage, severe injury, or death. Exposure to chlorine gas shipments alone, traveling to drinking water and waste water treatment plants, exposes more than 25 million Americans who live near these fa\ncilities and one million more living in cities and towns along the rail delivery routes.1 DHS and security experts continue to warn of the risk for industrial chemicals used by terrorists as weapons of mass destruction. Terrorists have attacked and blown u\np several trucks carrying chlorine in Iraq. There are over 63,999 chemicals used outside the laboratory environment as reported by the Chemical Abstracts Service).

These limitations have prevented microwaves from becoming the dominant ablation modality, despite substantial advantages over the clinical standard, radio frequency (RF) ablation.  NeuWave Medical, Inc. (form\nerly Micrablate, LLC) is a spin-off company from the University of Wisconsin with a mission to commercialize a new microwave system - the TheraWave 100 - for image-guided tumor ablation that markedly improves physicians' ability to treat even the most chal\nlenging tumors. Key features of the NeuWave system under development include the industry's smallest-diameter needle and largest zones of ablation, a state-of-the-art integrated cooling system that prevents dangerous heating throughout the entire system, a\n novel power distribution design that improves system efficiency, increases power delivered to the tissue and reduces setup/takedown complexity, and a user-friendly design that will help improve adoption. We have reached the milestones set by our Phase I S\nBIR aims. In particular, we proved the feasibility of a prototype system having a cooled-antenna design that enabled a significant increase in power delivery while eliminating dangerous shaft heating, yet maintained a slim 17-gauge profile. The prototype a\nntenna was shown to create ablations 50 percent larger in volume with less variability than a clinical RF ablation system in normal lung. As a next step, the Phase II project will extend and validate our antenna development with modifications in system-lev\nel design that will create a more physician-friendly microwave ablation system. Upon reaching our Phase II aims, NeuWave will have several key advantages over existing commercial systems including: new techniques for antenna and cable cooling optimized pow\ner distribution to create a multiple-antenna system using a single generator, increased system efficiency, and user-friendly control interfaces. Our market analysis and feedback from potential customers indicates that these technological features will give\n NeuWave's system a significant competitive advantage over current commercially available systems. The company has set forth an excellent commercialization strategy and clearly has expertise in the area of commercialization of medical products. During the \ncourse of this project, NeuWave plans to file an FDA 510(k) application for soft-tissue use. The completed microwave ablation system will be tentatively scheduled for market launch in Spring 2011 and possibly marketed to companies at the forefront of medic\nal device and ablation technology, such as Johnson and Johnson or Boston Scientific. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: NeuWave Medical's microwave ablation technologies developed in this proposal will combine the best of engineering and medicine into a tool that cl\ninicians will use to treat cancer with minimal invasiveness, low morbidity and rapid recovery. Commercialization of this system will have a substantial impact on the treatment of cancers of the lung, liver, kidney and bone for maximum cancer patient benefi\nt.",

The sensor module will have superior field sensitivity with excellent linearity and orthogonality, thanks to a specialized control circuitry which allows the sensors to operate under optimal magnetic conditions. The sensor module will operate under ambient conditions, with no extra infrastructure required, and will therefore be easily integrated into a number of emerging applications. The field sensitivity of the sensor module will be more than a factor of ten larger than any commercially-available thin film sensor, giving it a dominant technical edge for high -performance applications. This sensor module will be realized through the synergy of three key innovations: enhanced device performance derived from magnesium oxide tunnel barrier technology, active sensor compensation via on-board current-carrying striplines, and anisotropy engineering using specialized annealing processes.  This research will create a new product family with greatly enhanced capabilities for use in many critical segments of the world sensor market, including remote sensing applications in the defense and homeland security segments, as a key component of non-destructive evaluation systems, and in emerging medical applications.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Implantation of multi-electrode arrays is becoming increasingly more prevalent within the neuroscience research community. Many of these studies have been influenced by the recent interest from the NIH and other agenci\nes toward the development of sensory and motor prosthesis. A motor prosthesis implant must record electrical activity from nearby neural elements, requiring a relatively passive electrode/tissue interface. A sensory prosthesis, however, must employ an elec\ntrode system, which can inject stimulus currents into the nervous system without damaging either nearby neural elements or the metal electrode. Both types of implants will require an electrode system that  floats  on the brain in order to minimize movement\n of the electrode tip, which can potentially damage nearby cells. Feedback from several neuroscience research groups have expressed the need for commercially available multi-electrode arrays that can penetrate into sub-cortical spaces sometimes extending 4\n to 10 mm below the cortical surface. Other researchers have also suggested the need for electrode systems that will provide arrays with electrodes having different spacing and depths. There is also a relatively small, but growing, community of researchers\n, at this time, which must not only record from their electrode arrays but stimulate through them as well. A multi-electrode system that is biocompatible, electrically and mechanically stable, and employs design features allowing flexibility in the geometr\nic layout and length of the individual electrodes within the array is needed in order to satisfy the multiple applications demanded by neuroscience researchers. An equally important component to the electrode fabrication and layout is the inclusion of remo\nte electronics buried beneath the scalp capable of electro-magnetically transferring information across the scalp. This two- way communications between the outside world and the microelectrodes can be used for sensing electrical activity of nearby neural e\nlements as control signals for a motor prosthesis or injecting currents into neural elements as part of a sensory prosthesis without the use of fragile wires and connector systems. Recent advances in laser machining of thin ceramic substrates, application \nof ultra-fine line gold conductors to ceramic, and the recent development of micro-circuit chips that can be bonded directly onto the ceramic substrate will provide the bases for the development of a  Active Floating Multi-electrode Array.  These arrays wi\nll be available as transcutaneous-wired ( AFMA), and wireless (WFMA) versions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development and commercialization of the  Active Floating Micro-electrode Array , AFMA, will provide the neuroscience community with a new tool for \nstable long-term recording and stimulation protocols using a minimal 4-wire cable and head connector, regardless of the number of electrode channels needing to be serviced. The AFMA design is the next logical step in the development of a wireless transmiss\nion system that will eliminate unreliable head connectors and cables. The AFMA will form the basis for development of a wireless system (WFMA) capable of sending and receiving information to the implanted microelectrodes by means of wireless transmission t\nhrough the skin and by RF transmission to nearby recording and stimulation control consoles. This new technology will provide an excellent tool for pre-clinical and eventual clinical trials associated with the development of motor and sensory prosthesis fo\nr people with paralysis and visual disorders respectively.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections continue to represent a major health concern in the immunocompromised population, especially recipients of bone marrow and solid-organ transplants. HCMV remains an important cause of congenital viral infection associated with deafness, mental retardation and mortality. Current therapy, which includes ganciclovir (GCV), cidofovir (CDV) and foscarnet (PFA), all suffer from dose-related toxicities, including neutropenia and nephrotoxicity, poor oral bioavailability and the development of drug resistant viral mutants. Therefore, the need is high for new orally active less toxic anti- HCMV agents. The methylenecyclopropane (MP) compounds are new anti-viral agents that have shown excellent anti-HCMV activity in vitro and in vivo. Based upon progress in the SBIR Phase I research plan, a lead MP compound, ZSM-l-62, has been chosen as a clinical-candidate for further Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling studies (SBIR Phase II application). ZSM-l-62 has been shown to prevent HCMV replication (5 log10 reduction, IC50 = 0.16muM), including GCV and PFA resistant virus. ZSM-l-62 (1-10 mg/kg) is orally active, 58% oral bioavailability, in two murine CMV (MCMV) models and two HCMV infection models in SCID-hu mice. ZSM-l-62 was superior to GCV and reduced mortality even when treatment was delayed 72 hrs. after viral inoculation and when GCV was without effect. ZSM-l-62 treatment resulted in a 3-5log10 decrease in liver, spleen and kidney virus titers. ZSM-l-62 was less toxic that GCV to human bone marrow cells and non-toxic in mice up to the highest dose tested (45 mg/kg, p.o., once a day for 28 days). An analytical method has been developed to measure ZSM-l-62 in body fluids and an improved chemical synthesis is now available to produce material for preclinical studies. The goal of the SBIR Phase II is to complete IND enabling preclinical toxicology and safety pharmacology studies and file an IND by the end of the two year SBIR for ZSM-l-62 for the treatment of HCMV infection. ZSM-l-62 has also shown good activity (EC50=0.7-7.8(iM) against other betaherpesviruses (e.g. HHV-6) and gammaherpesviruses (e.g. HHV-8). Therefore, the possibility exists that ZSM-l-62 may have broader activity and advantages against multiple viral pathogens in the immunocompromised host. The activity of ZSM-l-62 against these pathogens will be furthered explored and can be included in any future human clinical trial.",

Two systems will be created: a research oriented system, targeting manufacturers, for development of new explosive vapor trace detectors and production quality control and a portable system, intended for end users, for field testing and calibration. The use of digitally controlled ink-jet dispensing to precisely eject minute amounts of dilute explosive solutions and convert them into vapor has been demonstrated. We have also identified unique requirements of distinct vapor trace detector models and the actual needs of the marketplace. This project will: design and fabricate the two systems; generate the software control program; formulate explosive solutions customized for commercial explosive vapor trace detectors; develop test protocols for each system; evaluate the systems with commercial vapor trace detectors; and run reliability and repeatability testing. The research performed will also include: material compatibility studies; distribution of various explosive vapors by flow simulations and measurements; shelf life studies of the cartridges; and development of methods to calibrate the cartridges for explosive solutions.  The broader impact/commercial potential from this technology will be a method to evaluate the development of the next generation detectors. This project will lead to products (vapor generator systems and associated consumables). These products will\nprovide the means to compare the various explosive trace detectors and to identify the most accurate ones. Ultimately, the ability to further miniaturize the vapor generators will lead to units that are embedded into next generation detectors for real-time verification and calibration. The overall societal benefit of successfully developing vapor generator products will be improved protection of the public, both real and perceived, from terrorist threats while minimizing the cost and negative perception related to false alarms. Technological advances from this project will facilitate basic research on detection mechanisms for explosives, drugs and chemical threats. Researchers in government labs and academia will be able to use the vapor generator to evaluate and quantify improvements of promising detection methods. The technology also has spin-off opportunities in olfaction based medical diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MicroMRI, Inc. Development of a cost-effective pfMRI for in vivo structural examination of bone Abstract Osteoporosis is a systemic bone disease characterized by low bone mass and abnormal bone quality. The current \"gold standard\", dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), cannot assess bone quality and fails to detect > 50% of persons at greatest risk of fracture. MicroMRI is refining a new approach to non-invasively assess the micro- structural aspects of bone quality, at the wrist and ankle, using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Previously, this technology was coined \"Virtual Bone Biopsy\" by its inventor, Dr. Felix Wehrli. Our preliminary studies using coils that are \"add-ons\" to standard full-body MRI equipment indicate that bone structure parameters we determine have the necessary properties to monitor and direct appropriate treatment at the individual patient level. Thus, the company believes that fMRI is an important complement to DXA. While DXA remains the tool for diagnosis of osteoporosis for the foreseeable future, fMRI will be the tool of choice to measure disease progression and assess therapy response. The prevalence of osteoporosis requires that its diagnosis and monitoring remain at the physician's office, not hospitals. Appropriately, the majority of DXAs are currently located in out-patient settings. To fully capitalize on the promise of fMRI of bone, this technology should also be at the point-of-care in physicians' offices. In this grant, we are proposing to develop a cost-effective stand-alone MRI system for extremity measurement in the PCP setting. We have termed the proposed new technology pfMRI to remain in line with peripheral devices for studying the skeleton, using methods that expose the patient to ionizing radiation (pDXA, pQCT), . Extremity MRI scanners are already available for purchase but are either low-cost with low-resolution, or very expensive with high-resolution. In Phase I of this proposal, MicroMRI will test the feasibility of developing a technology which can produce high resolution images of similar quality as its existing fMRI system, yet cost-effective enough to be adopted by physician groups and in private clinics. In Phase II, we will develop a prototype of the pfMRI, and perform safety and efficacy tests. We will optimize this prototype, conduct accuracy and reproducibility measurements to establish that the data obtained are identical (within acceptable, pre- specified limits) to our existing fMRI method. Once these activities are completed, MicroMRI will use non-grant funds to complete the commercialization and product launch of the stand-alone scanner.",

The project will explore several contrasting agents for imaging applications, among these are; the traditional florescence and absorption dyes, to the latest semiconductor quantum dots and metallic nanoparticles. The recently engineered gold nanoparticles possess superior light scattering and absorbing characteristics as well as long-term stability, and when bound to antibodies, can enable high-contrast molecular and cellular imaging of various diseases.

The proposed accelerator employs a very short accelerating structure to accelerate a low-\nenergy electron beam to a final energy of 6 MeV in a highly efficient manner. The RWA offers twice the efficiency of conventional small accelerators in addition to having a greater degree of simplicity and a more compact design. Based on its high efficienc\ny and compactness, we estimate a reduction in the price of the entire system by a factor of 2. In Phase I we conducted a complete design of the RWA for radiotherapy applications including experimental testing of the RWA cavity as well as a large number of \ncomputer simulations and a conceptual RWA design. Our successful Phase I design studies corroborate our initial estimates and show that the RWA should be perfectly suited for medical applications while providing a substantial cost reduction when compared t\no conventional machines. We are now ready to proceed with the development of a 6 MeV accelerator system during Phase II. Once fully developed, the rotating-wave accelerator could be the basis for a new class of very compact 6 MeV radiotherapy accelerators \nthat should be affordable for small clinics and hospitals around the country. We anticipate that this compact accelerator will be able to provide 6 MeV electron beams for applications such as radiotherapy, sterilization of medical devices, food processing,\n and pollution control, among others.

        "abstract": "Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) are metal alloys (of Nickel-Titanium, for example) that can change their shape when heated. When drawn and processed in wire form, the shape change is an aggressive contraction, with useable lifetimes of millions of cycles. Despite this fact, SMAs have largely been a scientific curiosity, finding very little commercial use as actuators since their discovery over 30 years ago. The apparent lack of practical application may be attributable to their low recoverable strain (~4% of total wire length). MIGA Motor Company has numerous international patents covering Displacement Multiplication (DM) techniques that allow us to package large strokes in highly compact, lightweight packages.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PaC) is the fourth-leading cause of cancer death in the US, with 37,170 estimated new cases for 2007 and almost as many deaths. This high mortality rate is due to the fact that PaC is generall\ny detected at an advanced stage, and there is no screening test available. Detection of clinical disease at an earlier stage would effectively impact on patient survival enabling more patients to benefit from surgical resection. Our ultimate goal is to dev\nelop and commercialize new, sensitive, specific, non-invasive immunodiagnostic assays based on patient serum for PaC early detection. These assays would improve diagnosis, and disease management. In Phase I we have applied proprietary technologies to ident\nify serum biomarkers for the early detection of PaC. Our innovative antibody-based approach involves: i) a collection of polyclonal antibodies raised against known and unknown human proteins; ii) a proprietary protein array referred to as Matrix Protein Ar\nray Technology (MPAT) allowing multiplex analysis of a large number of clinical samples using a large number of antibodies; and iii) sera specimens from patients with PaC, benign and inflammatory conditions of the pancreas, and normal controls. We have sel\nected a number of serum biomarkers that discriminate PaC versus non-PaC. The goal of this Phase II proposal is to achieve validation of the biomarkers identified in Phase I, and to generate the reagents necessary for a monoclonal antibody-based immunodiagn\nostic assay. Specifically, in Phase II/Year 1 we will screen the biomarkers on 150 serum specimens from PaC and non-PaC controls using the MPAT. Statistical data analysis will enable us to select an optimal biomarker panel that shows statistically signific\nant differential expression in cases versus controls. In Phase II/Year 2 biomarkers will be expressed and purified, and specific monoclonal antibodies against the biomarkers will be generated as reagents for the immunoassay. Phase III will focus on product\n development, i.e. an ELISA-type immunoassay that will be commercialized in partnership with pharma-diagnostic companies. The proposal is designed for the rapid commercialization of an immunodiagnostic assay for PaC detection, with the support of clinical \ncollaborators, a biostatistics data analysis team, consultants and business advisors to ensure rapid and effective translation of the assay to the patients. As proof of concept and feasibility of our technologies, we provide data encompassing the entire pr\nocess, from biomarker discovery in lung cancer patient serum, to monoclonal antibody and ELISA-based immunoassay development for the early detection of lung cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth-leading cause of cancer death in t\nhe US, and has the shortest life expectancy of all malignancies when discovered. It is generally detected at an advanced stage, when cancer cannot be treated by surgery alone. The development of a simple immunodiagnostic assay based on patient serum to det\nect pancreatic cancer would have a profound impact on patient survival and reduce mortality from this disease.",

Envision the Rhythms of Life  instructs breast cancer survivors in the practice of individualized, emotionally supportive, and biologically accurate imagery and consists of 5, \n3-hour long, interactive classes and between-class instructor support. Instructional Options: Option 1 delivers the program technology (animations, PowerPoint, manuals, art, audio-art) with instructor and 15 participants in the same room. Option 2 delivers\n the program at-a-distance, to a small group of 15, via videoconferencing software and camera systems (Alaska and Seattle) to low, moderate or high bandwidth areas. Each option delivers program three times (total of 45 participants for each option). A webs\nite portal provides all program information and materials. Design and Method: Program will be delivered to 135 breast cancer survivors who have completed conventional care (surgery, radiation, IV chemotherapy) for at least six weeks. Differences in option \n1 and 2 outcomes will be compared to each other and to controls; combined outcomes of option 1 and 2 will be compared to controls; and waitlist control outcomes will be compared to their extended baseline. Long-Term Objectives: This innovative project inte\ngrates technology with bandwidth-sensitive multi-media conferencing strategies to deliver a virtual mind-body, imagery intervention.

        "abstract": "The phase II project combines fuel ethanol production with manufacturing of a protein concentrate to create a new industry in a rural south Idaho community. In phase 1 research, MMP demonstrated technical feasibility of a process to produce ethanol and protein concentrate as co products from barley. The use of barley addresses irrigation constraints in south Idaho by creating increased value for a less water consumptive crop. Phase 1 also demonstrated integration of wastewater from a local food process plant into the process, overcoming constraints to process water supply. In Phase 1 MMP worked with its USDA/ARS CRDA partner (Hagerman Fish Culture Experiment Station) to demonstrate potential markets for the barley protein concentrate (BPC) as a feed ingredient in the south Idaho farmed trout industry. The BPC, with 50 to 60% protein content has a high value relative to distillers grains and makes ethanol production profitable despite historically high grain prices and current low price for ethanol. Phase II research will generate the data necessary to determine capital and operating cost for a ethanol/BPC manufacturing facility; and establish BPC inclusion rates and value in trout feeds. MMP will optimize process variables including use of wastewater, construct and operate a pilot plant and work with our CRDA partner to conduct research trials and commercial demonstrations of BPC in farmed trout feed. In phase II MMP will advance commercialization with the technical and financial documentation necessary to finance design, construction and start-up of a commercial facility. &#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;",

However, the 2003 DOE Strategic Initiatives for Hydrogen Delivery Workshop determined that existing hydrogen compressor designs cannot meet the need for a reliable, efficient, and cost-competitive transportation infrastructure.  This project will develop non-contacting, low-leakage sealing technology for oil-free centrifugal hydrogen compressors capable of transporting up to 1,000,000 kg of hydrogen per day and compressing it from 300 psi to 1,000-2,000 psi.  In Phase I, an existing foil seal design was enhanced for use with hydrogen, a subscale version of the enhanced design was fabricated, and preliminary static testing was conducted with air and helium to differential pressures of 100 and 250 psig respectively.  The helium was used to simulate hydrogen.  Leakage flow coefficients were determined to be substantially less than any other dynamic shaft seal.  In Phase II, a full-scale seal will be fabricated, and low leakage will be demonstrated over a wide range of operating conditions.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The seal technology should allow higher efficiency natural gas pipeline compressors to be built and operated, thereby enabling large-scale hydrogen gas delivery.  Based upon the almost 50 million horsepower of natural gas pipeline compressors in service today, it is estimated that the use of oil-free, non-contacting bearings and seals \u00bf in both hydrogen and natural gas pipeline compressors \u00bf could yield a savings of 33,000 MW-hours of energy per year.   Significant potential also exists for application of the sealing technology to more efficient gas turbine engines for aircraft.",

A feature that distinguishes MDI \n301 from RA is its lack of irritation when applied topically to skin. Past studies from our laboratory have shown that topical pretreatment of diabetic rats with RA improves the healing of subsequently-induced abrasion wounds. The recently completed Phase \nI studies of this SBIR grant demonstrated that MDI 301 also improves healing of abrasion wounds in diabetic rats. The Phase II studies build on this. The workplan for the Phase II studies contains three specific aims: First, using the same model of strepto\nzotocin-induced diabetes in rats as used in the initial studies, we will determine the extent to which MDI 301 improves wound-healing in the skin. Second, using organ cultures of human skin obtained from diabetic subjects (skin from both at-risk and non-at\n-risk sites) we will determine the extent to which MDI 301 affects changes in physiology of human diabetic skin that contribute to successful wound healing. Finally, in aim three, we will continue the safety profiling of MDI 301 necessary for FDA approval.\n         The overall goal of the proposed studies is to determine if topical pretreatment of skin with MDI 301 will, like RA itself, improve healing of subsequently-induced wounds but do so without provoking irritation. If it can be shown that MDI 301 is a\ns effective as RA but without the negative consequence seen with RA, it will provide a better agent for development as a chronic wound preventative.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surfactant Protein B (SP-B) is crucial in the function of native lung surfactant, and is equally important for activity in clinical exogenous surfactants as well. Based on the known three-dimensional structures of prote\nins in the  Saposin  class, early SP-B models predicted that the disulfide cross-linked, N- and C-terminal domains fold as functionally essential charged amphipathic helices. For the current Phase II SBIR research, we have designed and chemically synthesiz\ned a 41 residue Super Mini-B (S-MB) peptide construct that emulates many of the in vitro and in vivo structural and functional properties of the 79 residue native protein. This S-MB peptide has activity exceeding that of the promising 34 amino acid Mini-B \npeptide studied in our completed Phase I SBIR and initial Phase II proposal (April, 2007). In the current application, S-MB peptide is combined with synthetic lipids to generate two complementary fully-synthetic exogenous lung surfactants (Minisurf(tm) and\n Minisurf-R(tm)) that have extremely high activity and commercial potential. Two types of synthetic lipids are utilized to allow the production of these S-MB surfactants: (i) a mix of synthetic lipids (L) modeled after those in native lung surfactant; and \n(ii) novel phospholipase-resistant lipids (RL) synthesized to have enhanced surface properties as components in therapeutic surfactants plus reduced degradation in inflammatory lung injuries where lytic enzymes are present in increased concentrations in pu\nlmonary tissue. In the current grant, we develop commercially viable production and quality-control methods for S-MB peptide and active synthetic L-SMB (Minisurf(tm)) and RL-S-MB (Minisurf-R(tm)) surfactants for treating acute respiratory failure in the Ne\nonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (NRDS), clinical Acute Lung Injury (ALI), and the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Minisurf(tm) and Minisurf-R(tm) surfactants can also potentially be used in novel pulmonary delivery systems for antibiotics,\n anti-inflammatory agents, and genetic material. This Phase II SBIR proposal comprises Aims leading to the following key Milestones: 1) to define and establish process development activities required to produce commercially-viable quantities of purified ac\ntive S-MB and; 2) to demonstrate that S-MB peptide can be reproducibly formulated and quality-controlled in final Minisurf(tm) and Minisurf-R(tm) formulations that have significant potential advantages in production economy, surface activity, inhibition re\nsistance, and physiological activity compared to current animal-derived and synthetic surfactant drug products while exhibiting minimal toxicity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This SBIR research will lead to the development and production of novel fully synthet\nic exogenous surfactants having significant advantages in production economy, activity, and inhibition resistance for future clinical use in treating prevalent and severe respiratory diseases (NRDS, ALI, and ARDS).         This SBIR Phase II application wi\nll synthesize, quality-control, and define the high activity of synthetic lung surfactants (Minisurf(tm) and Minisurf-R(tm)) based on the novel synthetic peptide Super Mini-B (S-MB), a 41 residue construct incorporating key functional domains of full-lengt\nh lung surfactant protein (SP)-B. This S-MB peptide has been proven in preliminary studies to be even more active than the Mini-B (MB) peptide used in our successful Phase I studies. The synthetic S-MB surfactants of this Phase II proposal are designed to \nhave significant activity in the therapy of the neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS), clinical acute lung injury (ALI), and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

We have shown that HSV2 VesiVax(r) vaccines targeted to single epitopes from the gD envelope protein are capable of protecting both female and male mice from mucosal HSV2 challenge (intravaginal and\n intrarectal, respectively) with increased survival and markedly reduced clinical signs of infection and further, actively stimulates effective T-cell immune responses in both sexes. In the Phase I studies, we demonstrated that an antigenic segment corresp\nonding to the entire HSV2 gD ectodomain (amino acids 1-306) provided protection from disease in both intravaginal (female) and intrarectal (male and female) mouse models of lethal HSV2 challenge with a significant reduction in primary disease and a trend t\nowards reducing recurrent infections in a guinea pig model. We now propose to take our lead vaccine candidate, L-HSV2gD1-306-HD, and move it towards clinical evaluation. To accomplish this objective, a number of technical objectives will need to be complet\ned. Our first step will be to determine the optimal antigen dose and schedule as well as different routes of administration (i.e., subcutaneous or intramuscular) required for effective immunization in male and female mice challenged intravaginally or intra\nrectally with a lethal dose of HSV2. The L-HSV2gD1-306-HD vaccine will undergo further testing by immunizing male and female guinea pigs with increasing antigen doses at the optimal dosing schedule and route of administration determined from the mouse stud\nies and then challenging the animals with HSV2 to determine their response to primary and recurrent infection. We will also characterize the immunological response of the male and female mice to the L-HSV2gD1-306-HD vaccine construct using the optimized va\nccination parameters. Concurrently, with the optimization studies, we will focus on developing the processes for manufacturing clinical grade batches of the L-HSV2gD1-306-HD vaccine. Our first activities will be directed towards producing a Development Cel\nl Bank. We will then prepare a Master Cell Bank and Working Cell Bank from the Development Cell Bank and characterize them. We will then optimize the HSV2gD1-306-HD production process by fermentation using standard equipment that is amenable to scale-up. T\nhe processes for isolating and purifying the HSV2gD1-306-HD protein will be based on modifications of existing methods and the development of the processing conditions to produce the L-HSV2gD1-306-HD vaccine in larger scale will be performed. We will also \ndevelop the analytical methods required for ensuring the quality of each preparation of L-HSV2gD1-306-HD. Using these assays, batches of HSV2gD1-306-HD will be evaluated for stress testing. Using these assays, batches of L-HSV2gD1-306-HD will be monitored \nunder different conditions (i.e., temperature, pH) for stress testing. Using these procedures, the L-HSV2gD1-306-HD vaccine will be scaled-up and pilot batches of material produced in conformance to FDA current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulation\ns. The pilot batches of L-HSV2gD1-306-HD will be prepared in sufficient amounts to allow for stability and equivalency testing, and eventual safety and immunogenicity studies. For the stability studies, vials of L- HSV2gD1-306-HD will be stored at selected\n storage temperatures and analyzed periodically for changes in the product. Lastly, the pilot batches of material will be tested in the male and female mouse models of HSV2 infection that have been used to develop the L-HSV2gD1-306-HD vaccine. The pilot ma\nterial will be compared against laboratory prepared material in terms of survival and reduction of the signs of disease following challenge with a lethal do",

The objective of this Fast track phase 1/2 SBIR is to produce and perform safety testing in humans of a new diagnostic drug product formulation of iobenguane I 123. The justification for requesting Fast Track consideration is to take advantage of the synergy of developing a diagnostic version of the high specific activity iobenguane I 123 using starting materials and facilities established for the development of the therapeutic I-131 agent. The goal of this proposal is to produce and test high specific activity Ultratrace iobenguane I 123 in normal human volunteers. The low specific activity iobenguane I 123 has been shown to be useful for the detection and staging of neuroendocrine tumors in adults and children and imaging neuronal activity in the heart. The innovation in this proposal is through the use of patented solid phase technology to produce a proven diagnostic agent at extremely high specific activity to increase sensitivity and specificity and lower radiation exposure to normal organs without the pharmacologically active cold carrier compound. The FDA considers iobenguane labeled with two different isotopes of iodine [I 131 and I 123] as two distinct drugs requiring distinct regulatory applications. To meet the required quality standards for the chemistry, manufacturing and controls component of an IND application, GMP quality polymer drug precursor will be used to generate the Ultratrace diagnostic iodine- 123 agent. Analytical methods must be validated with the proposed final drug formulation to demonstrate the final drug does not interfere with tests used to define the identity, purity, and strength of the agent. The drug product solution must also be verified to be apyrogenicity and sterility before human testing can be initiated. The formulation of the final drug product will be tested for stability and bioequivalence in norepinephrine-transporter expressing cells and in animals. The required IND application will be written and submitted to the FDA and the Duke Medical Center IRB. MIP will produce clinical trial material and conduct human testing of the radioactive drug substance for safety and superiority compared to conventional iobenguane I 123 in normal healthy volunteers.",

Shortcomings of current practice have motivated an important area of research involving statistically trainable deformable-shape models (DSMs) for automatic segmentation. The general approach is to apply a DSM to an image and cause the model to undergo a series of deformations converging to a close match between the model and the target anatomical object(s). The deformations are driven, in an appropriate statistical framework, by mathematical optimization. The overall aim is to develop and clinically evaluate a workstation for automatic segmentation of anatomical structures in the male pelvis from CT images for image- guided applications in radiation therapy using technology based on a particularly powerful class of DSMs called m-reps. Segmented CT images provide guidance for critical treatment planning and radiation delivery decisions in radiation therapy. It is likely that segmentation is performed more often for these purposes than for all the other medical applications combined. Current interactive contouring methods in clinical practice are extremely time consuming and expensive, and the contours demonstrate significant inter- and intra-user variabilities that adversely affect the clinical decisions that rely on them.

        "abstract": "Physics experiments often use low-energy beams of unstable particles that stop in a target in order to provide high sensitivity to rare processes with reduced backgrounds.  However, the stopping rate in the target is limited by the dynamics of the production process and by multiple scattering and energy straggling in the material used to slow the particles. As a result, the event rates and sensitivity to rare processes are limited.  This project will apply new six-dimensional beam cooling inventions, improved capture techniques, and new simulation tools to develop designs for low-energy beam lines to stop many muons in small volumes.  It will develop the helical cooling channel (HCC) and the newer pion momentum spread reduction schemes for experiments such as mu2e as well as for others that require polarization.  We will use G4beamline to improve the mu2e experimental sensitivity and to develop methods to understand and suppress rare background events.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The use of the HCC and other new ideas for stopping muon beams will provide a new level of sensitivity for experimental physics searches for rare processes such as the direct conversion of muons into electrons. Many applications of intense stopping muon beams, such as spin-resonance investigations and muon-catalyzed fusion, will also benefit greatly.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate significantly improved output power, temperature range of operation, and reliability of red VCSELs. Commercialization of red VCSEL technology has been plagued by the limited temperature range and output power of the devices and unknown reliability characteristics. The Phase I project demonstrated the 1) feasibility of improving output power and temperature range through a number of techniques, 2) that the fundamental limit of the temperature range is at least as high as 125\u00fd\u00fdC, and 3) dramatically improved reliability. The Phase II approach proposed here breaks away from traditional models for fabricating VCSELs and consists of a variety of growth and fabrication methods allowing us to provide a high thermal conductivity path from the active region to the package. The goals and expected technical results are to demonstrate > 0.5mW single mode, and >1mW multi-mode useful output power at 670nm at 85\u00fd\u00fdC, and the same power output power objectives for 655nm at 65\u00fd\u00fdC on a reproducible basis. This project will also demonstrate greater than 10,000 hours device lifetime at 85\u00fd\u00fdC continuous operation. Project activities consist of design, wafer growth and fabrication, performance testing, and reliability testing.  To date, the only commercially available VCSELs have been at 780nm to 850nm, due to the substantial materials challenges at other wavelengths. This proposed effort is applicable to a variety of VCSEL wavelengths (similar thermal\nissues exist at 1310nm to 1550nm), as well as other optoelectronic devices. Commercially, a significant enhancement in red VCSEL performance can enable the migration of plastic fiber based home and auto networks to higher data rates, faster and higher quality laser printing, longer distance and more precise motion control sensing, new types of portable or wearable medical sensing, and improved robustness and cost of radiography equipment. The success of this project not only creates a significant business opportunity for a red VCSEL supplier, but also enhances the competitiveness of customers by making available a valuable new technology. The reduction in power consumption and improvement in medical technology costs address particularly important societal issues.",

        "abstract": "Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), which uses a gasilier to convert coal to fuel gas, and then uses a combined cycle power block to generate electricity. is one of the most promising technologies for generating electricity from coal in an environmentally sustainable way. IGCC has many advantages over traditional technologies including: higher efficiency, lower pollutant emissions, and a possibility of carbon capture and sequestration. One of the remaining challenges for the IGCC is the need to develop a cleanup technology to remove reduced sulfur and nitrogen compounds from the hot fuel gas at gasification operating temperatures.\n\nNanoScale Corporation proposed development of nanocrystalline sorbents and catalysts for hot gas cleanup technology to allow for removal of reduced sulfur (H2S and COS) and ammonia pollutants from coal-generated fuel gases at gasification operating temperatures. In Phase I, several sorbents and catalysts were synthesized and evaluated with real fuel gas from the gasifier at Western Research Institute (WRI). These sorbents and catalysts were tailored to selectively react with reduced sulfur and nitrogen compounds present in fuel gas and were found to be immune to other components of the fuel gas. Two materials, a sorbent for removal of reduced sulfur pollutants and a catalyst for ammonia decomposition, were found to be particularly effective approach proposed by NanoScale utilizes manufacturing methods that are easily scalable, cost efficient, and environmentally friendly.\n\nIn the proposed Phase II project, the most effective Phase I materials will be optimized, and their ideal predominance parameters will also be determined to enable most efficient operation under IGCC fuel gas conditions. The testing will include both laboratory scale experiments, as well as pilot-scale demonstrations with real fuel gas at WRI. The results of the proposed project should clearly demonstrate the advantage of using nanocrystalline materials for hot fuel gas cleanup and the feasibility of the NanoScale approach.\n\nThe proposed project offers environmental benefits that can revolutionize current control methods by providing sorbent and catalyst materials that are technically superior to existing materials. Possible applications of the proposed technology include IGCC plants and other pollution control systems. Benefits offered by nanocrystalline sorbents, including enhanced chemical kinetics and increased removal capacities, have been demonstrated for many toxic chemicals and pollutants.\n\nNanoScale is uniquely qualified for the proposed development since it is a leader in the field of reactive nanocrystalline materials.",

This goal will be accomplished by producing a lightweight, chemical protective garment material, having a limited number of distinct laye\nrs, which in turn can be assembled into a breathable, protective garment wherein the particular layers impart at least one key property to the composite material. Non-breathable materials retard the human body's process of heat dissipation normally achieve\nd through the evaporation of perspiration. Without significant transmission of water vapor, or breathability, prolonged use of non-breathable materials can result in intolerable discomfort and even death to a person wearing garments made from these materia\nls. The novelty of the proposed approach is the development of granulated reactive NanoActive(r) sorbents containing composite layered textile material that protects the sorbent from contact with and contamination by liquids, and that has good vapor permea\nbility thus providing for passage of air and water vapor as well as sorption of harmful and noxious vapors and gases. Based on the outcome of Phase I research, it is clear that granulated mixed metal oxide nano formulations are required for a broad-spectru\nm reactivity. As a result, this Phase II project will begin by developing methodologies for granulation of mixed metal oxides based on NanoActive materials. This will be followed by performance screening of formulations against toxic industrial chemicals a\nnd chemical warfare agent simulants by a breakthrough testing procedure. The down selected formulations will then be incorporated into down selected textile materials with optimum air and water vapor permeable properties. Next, these composite fabric test \nswatches will be evaluated for a number of criteria using industry recognized ASTM test methods. The top four granulated nanoparticles embedded fabrics will be tested for chemical resistance against four toxic chemicals using a standard ASTM procedure. The\n project will conclude by pilot studies involving scale-up of granulated nanoparticles and composite textile preparation followed by production of prototype chemical protective clothing. /Relevance Major deficiency of the available chemical protective garm\nents is the failure to provide desired levels of toxic vapor sorption and still maintain sufficient transfer of heat and moisture to keep a wearer cool and comfortable.

        "abstract": "There is growing concern about how to limit the release of mercury into the environment. One significant source of mercury is found in fluorescent lamps. Recently, however, compact fluorescent lamps have been heavily promoted in order to conserve electrical energy. While it is true that switching to energy efficient lighting is one of the easiest ways to save energy, reduce CO2 emissions, and save money in the short-term, fluorescent lighting is not the ideal long-term solution precisely because fluorescent lamps contain toxic mercury vapor. Solid state lighting (SSL), on the other hand, holds even greater promise. White LEDs are already more efficient than fluorescent lamps, do not contain heavy metal toxins, and are available with decent color rendering abilities. What holds SSL back is the high price per lumen ration. Only if the cost can be reduced with SSL be able to make significant progress in replacing incandescent and fluorescent lighting. One way to do this is to improve the luminous efficiency of the white LEDs so that more light is emitted at the same price.\n\nNN-Labs proposes to complete line of transition-metal doped semiconductor nanocrystals (D-dots \u00bf) to be used as nanophosphors for white LEDs. Current white LEDs rely on micron-sized phosphors that suffer up to 50% losses in efficiency due to backscattering of fluorescence. Nano-sized phosphors, because they are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light, do not scatter light. By using D-dots \u00bf nanophosphors, white LEDs could improve their luminous efficiencies up to 100% compared with bulk phosphors. Furthermore, D-dots \u00bf are more ideally suited for use in LEDs than other kinds of nanophosphors, such as quantum dots, because D-dots \u00bf are immune to re-absorption losses that plague intrinsic nanocrystal emitters.\n\nThis SBIR Phase II project will develop a full spectrum of D-dots \u00bf emitters with high photoluminescence quantum yields, optimal absorption profiles, and long photo and thermal stability lifetimes required of high brightness (HB) LED phosphors. Also, NN-Labs will work together with its industrial collaborator, Dow Corning, to develop manophosphor/encapsulant composites and fully integrate them into HB LED manufacturing processes.\n\nThe market for HB LEDs was $4.2 billion in 2006 and is expected to grown to $9 billion in 2009. Estimations show the LED Phosphor market associated with HB white LEDs was $180 million in 2006 and should reach $2.3 billion by 2015. NN-Labs predicts revenue from sales of D-dots \u00bf to reach $383 million by 2015.",

        "abstract": "The cost of reducing mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants is an impediment to the implementation of new mercury emission standards, particularly in older power plants.  The use of a sorbent to capture mercury from the flue gas is considered to be the most effective approach, but issues pertaining to secondary emissions and the degradation of the fly-ash byproduct (which results from entrained sorbent) are yet to be resolved fully.  This project aims to overcome these barriers by developing an environmentally benign sorbent powder that also renders the fly ash usable.  Although the sorbent has a novel composite morphology, it is anticipated to be highly cost competitive.  Sorbent powders were produced in Phase I and tested at a host utility in the western United States.  In addition, to obtaining excellent mercury removal efficiency, it was demonstrated that the sorbent powders are more concrete-friendly than most state-of-the-art commercial sorbents.  Phase II will involve the further development and optimization of the morphology of the sorbent particles.  The production process will be scaled to a commercial level by working in partnership with a leading powder manufacturer based in the United States.  Mercury removal efficiency initially will be tested in a slip stream at a utility, followed by full-scale tests in year two.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The federal government\u00bfs Blue Skies Initiative targets a 70% reduction in mercury emissions by 2018.  A new sorbent technology that could be readily used by coal-fired power plants with a minimal overall cost impact should help achieve this target.  The market for sorbents to reduce mercury emissions is projected to be $1billion over the next ten years.",

Major CDC- and/or WHO-authored reviews and surveys of treat\nments for women infected by HPV16 typically refer to  follow up  observation and surgical intervention as the only options available, and rarely even suggest that antivirals might soon provide hope for treatment. We propose preclinical development of antiv\niral compounds we have discovered that posses potency in the low nanomolar range for treatment of HPV16 in human cell culture. These compounds, which target the HPV origin of replication (ori) and were designed, synthesized and tested with the support of a\nn NIAID-AT-STTR Phase 1 grant, possess exceptional antiviral activity in cells. They hold considerable potential as antiviral agents that will add an important tool to complement the HPV vaccines, allowing both HPV+ and HPV- patients to be treated. The pro\nposal puts forward 5 specific aims and a comprehensive chemistry plan that, when completed, will have laid the ground work for GMP synthesis of an optimal drug formulation and filing of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) with the FDA. The propos\nal outlines Milestones and Go/No Go decision points that have been developed in close collaboration with NanoVir consultants and the Stanford Research Institute, International (SRI), a GLP-approved facility with considerable history and expertise in the de\nvelopment of vaginally-delivered drugs and contractor for many NIAID assays. The plan describes a required series of preclinical development studies. Specifically, in the proposed work we will: 1) select one Commercial Lead compound (CL) and one back-up ba\nsed on efficacy and pilot toxicity in vitro and in vivo; 2) scale-up synthesis of the CL and one back-up, prepare 25 formulations of the CL, identify the five best topical formulations of the CL via in vitro efficacy and delivery testing in monolayer and r\naft cultures, and demonstrate effective cervical delivery via vaginal administration in rabbits; 3) select CL formulations for additional pilot toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies, including vaginal irritation and sperm motility assays; 4) scale-up chemic\nal synthesis and formulation of the CL, determination of a GLP Certificate of Analysis (COA) for the CL, and GLP preparation of the lead topical formulation and an IV formulation; 5) complete GLP pharmacokinetic and toxicity testing. Completion of these st\nudies will help prepare us for GMP synthesis and submission of an IND for testing in humans. The Commercialization Plan quantifies the market opportunity and describes the steps preceding market launch of the product. Successful completion of these studies\n offers the hope of treatment for millions of women currently infected by the primary cancer-causing form of HPV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is currently no antiviral treatment or cure for Human Papillomavirus (HPV)16 , the virus that causes most cases\n of cervical cancer in the world. The work described in this proposal is designed to lead to a treatment for HPV16, the most prevalent, cancer causing form of the virus. Potent HPV16 inhibitors were identified in Phase 1; in this Phase 2 work, we seek to c\nomplete most of the tests required by the FDA prior to submission of an Investigational New Drug Application to the FDA and initiation of clinical studies.",

The program, LifeSkills Train\ning Transition to Work (LST-TW), will [provide students with the self-management and interpersonal skills needed to resist internal and external influences to use substances, as well as build competencies in terms of employability skills and effective func\ntioning in the workplace.] LST-TW will be based on the model program LifeSkills Training (LST), a cognitive-behavioral, skill-based substance use prevention program for middle and junior high school students. The effectiveness of the LST approach has been \nwell established in over 20 peer-reviewed publications, with behavioral effects on substance use and related risk behaviors lasting until the end of high school and beyond. [The goals of the eight unit LST-TW program are to prevent the onset or progression\n of substance use, reduce use among those who already use substances, and improve job related outcomes such as work performance and job satisfaction. These goals will be achieved by combining key drug prevention and life skills taught in LST with a focus o\nn relevant employability skills required in today's rapidly changing workplace. A variety of interactive skills training techniques and classroom exercises will help students learn and master these skills and apply them to issues specific to the transition\n to work, such as starting a new job and career advancement. Thus, LST-TW will aim to improve skills, attitudes, and behaviors related to health, drug use, and work.] In Phase I, two prototype units of the LST-TW program were developed, evaluated by CTE te\nachers and administrators [and employers of CTE graduates], implemented in CTE classrooms, and evaluated by students from these classrooms. In Phase II, the written curriculum (Teacher's Manual and Student Guide) of the full eight units and accompanying we\nbsite will be finalized after teacher and student focus groups and consultation with experts. The completed program will be tested in a rigorous, randomized controlled field trial including 30 CTE program sites that will be randomized into an intervention \nor control group condition. LST trainers, who will serve as providers of LST-TW, will attend a training workshop prior to implementing the program. The randomized controlled field trial will include a pretest survey, implementation of the LST-TW program to\n those in the intervention group, and the collection of 30-day posttest surveys along with process data. A 12-month follow-up will be competed after participants from both conditions have graduated from school and are working or seeking work. Project activ\nities will also include conducting a training-of-trainers (TOT) workshop for CTE teachers from the participating sites to become program providers of LST-TW after the study has been completed.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of people in the U.S. diagnosed with dementia related to Alzheimer's disease is expected to exceed 15 million by 2050, out of a total of 80 million worldwide. Market potential is expanding for the creation of\n computer-based learning materials involving effective interventions for persons with cognitive disabilities associated with dementia. In particular, students in masters-level speech-language pathology (SLP) programs need to acquire such clinical job skill\ns before beginning their professional careers. One example of an effective intervention for persons with dementia is Spaced-Retrieval (SR). SR is a method of learning and retaining information by recalling that information over increasingly longer periods \nof time. It is, in essence, a shaping paradigm applied to memory (Bjork, 1988; Camp and McKitrick, 1992; Landauer and Bjork, 1978). Another area in which SLPs are designated to provide therapy is the diagnosis and treatment of swallowing disorders (dysphag\nia), which is commonly seen in persons with dementia. In addition, students generally do not learn how to effectively communicate with persons with dementia in their standard coursework. This Phase II SBIR project will capitalize on the expertise of Nation\nal Rehabilitation Services (NRS), which has created and successfully marketed products for the education of rehabilitation professionals. NRS also successfully concluded the Phase I SBIR on which this proposal is based, involving creation of a web-housed, \ntext-based course on the use of SR. For Phase II, we wish to adopt the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) as our specification standard to develop an initial product line of SCORM-based courses for SLP students in masters-level programs, using\n the concepts drawn from the SCORM model in a self-contact Rich Internet Application (RIA) product. These courses will involve: the use of SR, diagnosis and treatment of dysphagia, and communicating with persons with dementia. In this 2-year project, 200 S\nLP students at four universities will participate in alpha and beta version creation and testing of the three proposed courses, in addition to 150 older adult clients with dementia in university affiliated clinics. Our objectives are to: 1) Create alpha an\nd beta versions of three SCORM-based courses for SLP masters- level students focusing on skills necessary to work effectively with clients with dementia; 2) Document that these SCORM-based courses can produce comparable results to traditional, face-to-face\n delivery versions of the courses in terms of knowledge acquisition; 3) Determine whether knowledge acquired in these SCORM-based courses can be effectively implemented by students when working with older adult clients with dementia; 4) Determine whether i\nmplementation of knowledge acquired by students in these SCORM- based courses results in corresponding health-related improvements in clients with dementia; and 5) Create the necessary final modifications to the courses so that they will be market ready by\n the end of the project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The number of people in the U.S. diagnosed with dementia related to Alzheimer's disease is expected to exceed 15 million by 2050, out of a total of 80 million worldwide. Other forms of dementia also will be\ncome more prevalent as the number of older adults increases in the future. Educational material designed to train therapists to facilitate higher levels of independence in people with dementia is beneficial to all members of society. National Rehabilitatio\nn Services (NRS), with a history of developing and presenting such materials, will use this Phase 2 SBIR project to create state-of-the-art, computer-based content for training students about to enter the field of Speech-Language Pathology. This will serve\n to enhance the skills of these future professionals, as well as to encourage more of them to work with geriatric clients with dementia.",

        "abstract": "Utility-scale wind turbines are getting so large that transportation limitations are driving final, onsite assembly costs.\u00a0 To address this problem, this project will design an apparatus for placing wind turbine components \u00bf the nacelle, generator, gear box, rotor, and blades \u00bf on top of an in-situ-fabricated, self-erecting tower, without using an external crane.  The approach builds on UltraTall, the result of a National Renewable Energy Laboratory funded project, in which a self-erecting tower (4 sections, 1:15 reduced scale, 5.3 meter tall) was fabricated and tested.  However, it was beyond the scope of that project to develop a nacelle placement apparatus.  In Phase I of this project, four different design concepts for the nacelle placement apparatus were prioritized and a detailed design of the leading concept was completed.  Phase II will conduct a detailed Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of the nacelle placement system (tower plus nacelle placement apparatus), develop a full scale prototype, and then test the apparatus.  The plan is to erect three sections of a full-scale UltraTall tower and use the prototype nacelle placement system to lift an equivalent weight.  (The construction of a full-scale wind generating system for testing the nacelle placement system is beyond the scope of Phase II.)  The nacelle placement apparatus and tower sections will have a complete set of sensors, and a structural health monitoring system will be used to collect data on the structural behavior.  That data will be used to validate the FEA.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The plan for Phase III is to erect and demonstrate a full-scale wind energy system that utilizes the UltraTall tower.  The site, which is on a farm in eastern Oklahoma, already has two transmission lines from utilities that have on-going wind-energy programs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Project Abstract     Urinary urge incontinence, also known as overactive bladder, is characterized by a strong desire to urinate followed by involuntary contractions of the bladder resulting in a quick release o\nf urine. Approximately 13 million Americans suffer from urinary urge incontinence. The annual cost of routine care and treatment for urinary urge incontinence in the U.S. is estimated at  16.3 billion. Conventional methods to treat urinary urge incontinenc\ne include behavioral, pharmacological, surgical, and neurostimulation treatments. However, current treatments for urge incontinence are often inadequate and poorly tolerated, and most people resort to relying on absorbent undergarments. The previous Phase \nI study demonstrated the feasibility of treating urinary urge incontinence by electrically stimulating the dorsal genital nerves with a percutaneous system. The objective of this Phase II project is to conduct a pilot clinical trial of electrical stimulati\non of the dorsal genital nerves to treat urinary urge incontinence using a novel miniature implantable pulse generator system. The primary objectives of this Phase II study are to determine whether our therapy is safe and whether it has an effect on the sy\nmptoms of urinary urge incontinence. The specific aims of this project are to evaluate the effect of dorsal genital nerve stimulation on urinary urge incontinence symptoms in females who are unresponsive to conventional therapy (medications, behavior thera\npy, etc.) and evaluate the possible placebo effect of dorsal genital nerve stimulation on symptoms of urinary urge incontinence. At the completion of this Phase II project, we will have tested a novel approach to the treatment of urinary urge incontinence \nusing an advanced neurostimulation system. The results of this pilot study will be used to design a larger pivotal study that will be used to support an FDA pre-market approval (PMA) application for commercialization.         Project Narrative     Urinary \nurge incontinence is a major clinical problem that affects over 13 million Americans and costs over  16 billion each year in the United States. Bladder dysfunction can become an insurmountable barrier, often preventing an individual from maintaining health\ny social interactions and from re-entering the work place, and the present treatment options are inadequate and lead to unwanted side effects. We propose to develop a novel therapy that uses electrical stimulation to treat urge incontinence without the sid\ne effects of currently available therapies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Copious amounts of water are used for rinsing and cooling purposes in restorative and surgical Dental procedures. Bacterial fouling due to biofilm formation in the Dental unit waterlines that deliver this water is a per\nsistent problem in clinical Dentistry and Dental surgery. Biofilm formation starts within minutes when soluble proteins and other macromolecules from the water non-specifically adsorb to the insides of the water lines. These macromolecules provide an ancho\nr for bacteria, which recruit other bacteria. Eventually a colony of multiple bacteria, protected by a  slime layer  of secreted exopolymers, develops. While the risk of bacterial infection is slight in most healthy patients, those patients with compromise\nd immune systems due to disease or drug therapy are at elevated risk. Additionally, Dental healthcare professionals are subjected to chronic exposure to contaminated water and aerosols generated from the Dental unit. Existing approaches to combat bacterial\n contamination and biofilm formation are typically ineffective in reducing bacterial counts to levels recommended by the American Dental Association. Finally, the majority of the existing approaches rely on healthcare workers to adhere to specific maintena\nnce schedules that, if not followed, render the approaches largely ineffective. New approaches to Dental waterline antifouling that would significantly reduce or eliminate the need for routine decontamination maintenance are of great interest to the Dental\n healthcare community. Surface coatings which repel bacterial attachment and biofilm formation on Dental waterlines would significantly reduce these health risks. If bacteria cannot attach to the surfaces of Dental waterlines, they will not be able to form\n biofilms to allow them to reproduce in large numbers and contaminate the water supply. Our Phase I research has firmly demonstrated feasibility for this type of approach. Development of these bacteria-resistant coatings will continue in Phase II with the \nrefinement and optimization of the coating process. We will determine the biocompatibility and long-term efficacy of the coatings. Finally, we will assess the compatibility of these new coatings with existing DUWL treatments, and will explore potential rou\ntines for coating renewal. Copious amounts of water are used for rinsing and cooling purposes in restorative and surgical Dental procedures. Bacterial contamination of these water supplies is a chronic and serious problem. Coatings for waterlines that are \ndesigned to prevent bacterial growth would largely prevent this problem, reducing health-related risks to both patients and Dental care workers.",

The key difference between the NFT approach and the traditional approach is that with NFT the computers and Internet connections of the viewers watching a broadcast help deliver that broadcast on to other viewers.  Network Foundation Technologies' products and technology have the potential to significantly impact the way television-style broadcasting is conducted over the Internet, greatly increasing the number of voices that can be heard.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program will develop novel software and methods for monitoring distributed patterns of brain activation using real time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI). This technology will be applied to the pain perception and regulation system with the ultimate goal of better understanding and controlling pain. These investigations further the NIH mission by advancing understanding of the functional importance of distributed brain mechanisms and their role in pain processing. This enabling technology will be useful for both the research community and potentially for monitoring and treating disease, including chronic pain. The work hypothesizes that it is possible to monitor distributed patterns of brain activation using rtfMRI; that subjects can be trained to control distributed patterns of activation; and that this training will impact cognitive processes. This application will produce the first commercially available software product designed for determining precisely when distributed patterns of brain activation occur in fMRI data, and the extent to which they are present. The software will compare the level of similarity at each moment, for example once per second, between the subject's brain activation pattern at that moment and a pre-defined 'reference' spatial pattern of brain activation, indicating when a given reference pattern is present, and to what extent. Previous fMRI methods have either focused on determining what the pattern of brain activation associated with a task is, by averaging over repeated trials, or measuring changes in activation in a single brain region of interest (ROI). fMRI benefits from its ability to measure activation from a very large number of brain regions simultaneously. The present method uses computation to harness this measurement and statistical power of combining the patterned activation data from hundreds or thousands of brain voxels at each time point. Previous work has established that human subjects can learn to control single regions of brain activation using rtfMRI, including regions involved with pain processing, with resultant changes in perceived pain. Successful preliminary pilot results have demonstrate that it is possible to monitor complex patterns of brain activation second-by-second in real time by measuring distributed fMRI patterns, that this information can be used to infer the cognitive/behavioral state of subjects in experimental paradigms, and that subjects can be successfully trained to control complex distributed patterns of brain activation. This project addresses two questions: 1) Is it possible to monitor distributed patterns of brain activation in real time? 2) Can subjects be trained to control/mimic distributed activation patterns? There are six specific aims:1) Generate a production quality version of rtfMRI pattern comparison software, 2) Write a software quality assurance module, 3) Test fMRI pattern comparison software and methods, 4) Demonstrate that subjects can learn to mimic reference activation patterns in the pain control system, 5) Compare different pattern comparison methods, 6) Measure changes in pain perception that result from rtfMRI-pattern training. The proposed research and development program will create a software application and methods for monitoring the pattern of activation in a person's brain second by second using functional magnetic resonance imaging while the person is inside an MRI scanner. Measuring the pattern of activation in a person's brain may allow physicians to monitor the impact on the brain of disease processes or treatments. This technology will provide a more powerful means than has previously been available to train patients to control their own brain activation through feedback in order to treat disease, and may become a method for treating chronic pain, one of the largest public health issues in the United States.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of the project is to build and test prototypes for a research tool for investigating pain mechanisms and for screening prospective new pain-relieving drugs for their effect. The system consists of hardware and\n software designed to measure thermal pain sensitivity of rodents (rats and mice) based upon learned (cortically mediated) escape behaviors that are induced by thermal stimuli (hot or cold) to the paws. The apparatus features a testing chamber with two tem\nperature-controlled floor areas (one typically at a painful temperature, the other thermally neutral). The delay with which the animal escapes from the painful to the neutral area is the measured response. After each escape the animal is motivated to retur\nn to the stimulus surface by turning on a bright light (bright light is aversive to rodents and they will escape it). This allows conducting multiple escape trials in an automated manner without the need for handling the animal between trials. The system i\nncludes a control test for measuring effects on the escape response that are not pain-related. A major advantage over existing pain tests is that the measured escape responses can be elicited by moderate stimulus intensities and serve as a model of human c\nlinical pain that depends on temporal integration of nociceptive signals. The new method provides the scientist and drug developer with a methodological alternative that takes into account the contribution of higher level pain processing to a much larger d\negree than traditional reflex-based rodent pain tests. The method therefore extends the range of tests that are possible with animals and reduces the need for potentially risky and more expensive human experiments. The new test is more humane and less stre\nssful than traditional reflex-based tests because the animals are not restrained, not in contact with humans during the test and in full control over stimulus onset and end. This project will refine the hardware and software of the new thermal operant pain\n sensitivity test to the point that it is a reliable, flexible and user-friendly tool for investigators that is commercially marketable.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In Phase I we showed that our measurement of free zinc in expressed prostatic fluid is a promising clinical indicator of prostate cancer. Indeed, in our two pilot studies and one prior published study, prostatic fluid z\ninc scores gave areas under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of .79, .92, and .99 for detecting biopsy-confirmed prostatic adenocarcinoma. Our test is non-invasive, requiring only a few drops of prostatic fluid obtained from the urethral meatus during \na rectal prostate examination with brief prostate massage. The zinc measurement is fast, cheap, easy, and exquisitely accurate. Our Phase II study has two components. In Study IIA we will increase our sample size to better estimate the sensitivity and spec\nificity of our test. We will collect samples of prostatic fluid from a carefully selected sample of approximately 100 men expected to have prostate adenocarcinoma and approximately 100 men expected to be cancer free. Upon histopathological confirmation of \nadenocarcinoma or the absence of adenocarcinoma in all men, a receiver operating curve analysis will be conducted to determine the sensitivity, specificity and overall area under the curve (AUROC) for the detection of adenocarcinoma by the measurement of z\ninc in prostatic fluid. This study will show how useful the zinc test is for detecting prostate cancer. The subjects in this study will be (i) men scheduled for prostatectomy (ii) men scheduled for cysto-prostatectomy (iii) men scheduled for saturation (64\n core) needle biopsy and (iv) men scheduled for conventional biopsy. In Study IIB we will establish which prostatic disease conditions are accompanied by the loss of zinc sequestering and secretion. Thus, we will take tissue sections from the prostate glan\nds of the subjects in Study IIA, stain them with HandE and (in some cases) antibodies to disease- defining proteins. Regions with specific prostatic pathology such as PIA (proliferative inflammatory atrophy), PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) or ad\nenocarcinoma will be marked on digital images of the sections, then adjacent sections will be imaged in X-RAY fluorescence and zinc histofluorescence microscopy to show the distribution of elemental and free zinc , respectively. Comparison of the classical\n histology with the zinc maps by digitally superimposing them will show how zinc sequestration (and therefore secretion) changes in each of the different types and stages of pathology. Data in the literature indicate that zinc sequestration and secretion a\nre suppressed in PIN and suppressed in healthy-appearing acini that are near an adenocarcinoma, suggesting a field effect. If confirmed by our work, this would explain how even relatively small adenocarcinomas markedly suppress zinc secretion of the gland.\n Every year in the US about 1,500,000 prostate biopsies are done, revealing only about 300,000 cancers. Still, about 30,000 men die from cancers too advanced for effective treatment. We believe our zinc test could allow earlier and more certain detection o\nf potentially aggressive cancers, thus saving lives. PUBLIC HEALTH NARAVTIVE: This Phase II SBIR is designed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of a zinc test for prostate cancer. The test measures zinc in massage-expressed prostatic fluid, and i\nt only takes about 60 sec to get the fluid and about 60 sec to make the measurement on a table-top,  5000 instrument. The test is intended to supplement other tests, including the PSA and DRE. Because the zinc falls in cancer but does not fall in BPH, the \nzinc tests has the potential to distinguish these two conditions.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It has become increasingly accepted that successful intervention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) relies on characterization of decline in cognitive function in the earliest stages that can be reliably detected\n. The most sensitive and specific method of detecting the  preclinical  stage of AD, including subtle distinctions between  normal aging  and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is through multifaceted cognitive assessment. At present, the majority of multi-c\nenter research and controlled trials utilize paper-based forms of well-established tests (Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), Trail Making, Category Fluency, etc.). However, multifaceted cognitive assessment by arrays of paper-based forms and kits is ine\nfficient, error prone and does not meet the needs for standardization across multiple sites. Computerized versions of these tests have rarely been applied in AD research or clinical trials. Even in the current NIA-sponsored Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging\n Initiative (ADNI), paper versions are used in all 46 centers. Wide acceptance of computerized versions of these tests will require a versatile platform as well as a large normative database that stringently excludes subjects with MCI. The project objectiv\ne is to develop a Computerized Early Dementia Assessment System (CEDAS) that provides a master set of the most widely accepted and applied cognitive tests, sufficient to meet the requirements of a minimum of 75 percent of controlled clinical trials as well\n as related research. A large normative database (N=600) will be compiled in a geographically diverse sample of subjects matching the demographic composition of the national census and meeting stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria. The CEDAS will be u\nniquely capable of administering a wide range of tests in elderly subjects due to an advanced, interactive, dual-display and control architecture that integrates a human examiner, enabling precise control of every step of the administration process. During\n a testing session, an examiner can  pause , repeat (or supplement) digitized instructions, score both simple and complex verbal report, as well as overt behavioral performance, thus enabling computerization of tests not possible on single-display systems.\n The CEDAS will also host an advanced, computer-assisted, telephonic assessment module that will support cost-effective remote assessment, large cohort tracking, and integrate the processes of screening and recruitment for population-based, epidemiological\n studies. Advanced CEDAS utilities will also include: (a) integral, multimedia-based, examiner training for all tests; (b) automated project reporting and documentation; (c) automated patient enrollment tracking and scheduling; (d) comprehensive multilingu\nal support; and (e) integrated web-based services, including automated electronic database transfer. To ensure relevance of the assessment battery as well as system functions for application in controlled trials, multi-center research projects, or clinical\n practice, CEDAS development will be guided by an Advisory Committee of leading authorities in the field, including the Chair of the ADCS Instrument Committee. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The CEDAS will provide a highly efficient, computerized method of perfo\nrming sensitive and specific cognitive assessment of early stage AD. The CEDAS normative database will be the largest of its kind and is critically needed for distinguishing normal aging from  preclinical  AD. The CEDAS will be applied in clinical trials a\nnd wide-ranging research to find treatments for Alzheimer's disease in the early stage. Integration of a flexible, computerized telephonic assessment module will provide an associated means of early stage assessment as well as an automated means of screeni\nng and tracking participants in clinical trials and large scale epidemiological studies of AD.",

As a result, continuing education is the primary source of specialty training in geriatric care for BSW\n and MSW practitioners and the principal venue in which to develop required knowledge and practice skills to work with older adults. To address a need for evidence-based continuing education, NERI has partnered with the Institute for Geriatric Social Work \n(IGSW) at Boston University to develop and test a training program, the Working with Older Adults Program, for practicing social workers that maximizes the transfer of practice skills, employs proven techniques of professional education, and can be deliver\ned conveniently and cost-efficiently in the workplace. The program takes an evidence-based, client-centered approach to working with older adults, will be readily incorporated into existing training, and accessible to schools of social work, community-base\nd agencies, and individual practitioners. Consistent with evidence from educational research on how adults learn new skills, a major objective of the program will be to model appropriate assessment and communication skills through the use of professional-q\nuality videotaped dramatic vignettes. The Aims of Phase I included: 1) development of a detailed content outline for the series of videos in the full program; 2) development of a script treatment for the prototype video and the content for the associated T\nrainer's Guide; 3) production of the prototype video and related sections of the Trainer's Guide; 4) assessment of the feasibility of the training program; 5) development of the Phase II production schedule; and 6) development of a commercialization plan. \nThese Phase I Aims were achieved. Importantly, the Phase I evaluation established the feasibility of the program and the testing methodology. The Aims of Phase II are: 1) development of full content for the entire program (8 modules); 2) development of scr\nipt treatments for eight videos and the associated content for the Trainer's Guide; 3) production of the videos and related sections of the Trainer's Guide; 4) evaluation of the program's effectiveness; and 5) dissemination of the CE program in collaborati\non with the Institute for Geriatric Social Work (IGSW) at Boston University.

Further, the use of crop-derived bio-fuels for generating electrical power is a CO2-neutral approach and thus greatly reduces global warming effects due to greenhouse gas emissions. Since SOFC's do not require dry feeds, energy will be saved in the ethanol purification process to produce a usable fuel.",

Superconducting versions of these guns could operate continuously with high average current beams that would open a broad range of applications from x-\u00c2\u00adrays for cancer therapy and sterilization, to tunable x-\u00c2\u00adray and gamma ray sources, to high energy electron coolers. This project will develop a low frequency superconducting RF electron gun. By using low frequency with a small gap, the electrons will transit the accelerating region in much less time than an RF period so the fields are nearly electrostatic. Also, the low frequency reduces heating and other difficulties of the cathode, thereby allowing removable room temperature and cryogenic cathodes.  Phase I demonstrated the technical feasibility of the project by completing the preliminary gun and cryomodule design, and a beam dynamics study. Phase II will finalize the design, and fabricate and test the superconducting RF gun.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Cryogenic tests will be carried out at Brookhaven National Laboratory to make use of their test facilities, cryogenics and laser systems.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The global small-animal/molecular in-vivo imaging market is vast and growing as more pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions realize the scientific and economic benefits of incorporating this approach in dise\nase and drug development research. In the U.S., the preclinical imaging market has transitioned from an emerging market in 2002 to an established one today. American manufacturers presently project the cost of developing a new pharmaceutical to be as high \nas  300 million for each released drug with an average 12-year development time. In the currently used method of histopathology, a large number of animals are sacrificed to obtain samples for evaluation at different points in time. On the other hand, small\n animal imaging involves non- invasive imaging techniques that enable molecular targets and genetic processes to be visualized and measured in living laboratory animals. The various imaging modalities (optical, magnetic-resonance, x-ray, nuclear) allow res\nearchers to use the same animal repeatedly thus dramatically reducing overall costs. Small animal imaging manufacturers are unencumbered by the regulatory approval process that is required for clinical diagnostic and therapeutic imaging equipment. This fav\nors rapid commercialization of breakthrough imaging products which should accelerate drug discovery and help make medicinal cures more affordable. We propose to develop a novel computed tomography (CT) system for small-animal imaging. The proposed micro-CT\n system will use a photon-counting approach to achieve multi-energy imaging capability that will overcome many of the limitations of current dual-energy CT systems. Improvements over those systems will include significantly better energy resolution, more e\nnergy levels, flexibility in the selection of the energy ranges, and simultaneous detection of all photon energies in the same detector volume. This last item eliminates problems related to registration of the images that can be a concern in the traditiona\nl dual-kVp or dual-detector approaches to dual-energy CT. Our Phase I study demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed small-animal CT detector. During this study we clearly defined our detector concept, tested precursor pixel detector readout devices, p\nrepared preliminary specifications and performed initial design work and circuit simulations. We also reviewed/refined the overall system requirements for small-animal CT with our academic and industrial consultants. Moreover, we investigated various optio\nns for detector supply, processing and assembly to ensure Phase II project success and Phase III product viability. During Phase II we plan to develop the components for the CT detector devices and then assemble and characterize their performance under sma\nll-animal imaging conditions. The prototype detectors will be evaluated at NOVA and leading academic and industrial laboratories. We likewise plan to develop a prototype small-animal CT system to make larger images (e.g., of phantoms). During Phase III we \nwill seek funding for preclinical trials and pursue commercialization with our industrial collaborators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our proposed small-animal CT system would provide both anatomical and functional information within a single imaging modality \nas enabled by breakthrough multi-energy x-ray detector technology and innovative contrast agents. An important niche application would be that of advanced studies of soft-tissue structures, processes and disease mechanisms based on animal models. These are\nas of research are growing with the demand for new therapeutic approaches against heart failure, colorectal cancer and osteoarthritis.",

        "abstract": "NOVA Scientific proposes Phase II development of a solid-state, high-efficiency neutron detection alternative to 3He gas tubes employing neutron-sensitive microchannel plates (MCPs) containing 10B and/or Gd. This program supports the DNDO development of technologies designed to detect and interdict nuclear weapons or illicit nuclear materials. This solid-state neutron detector would permit operations in wide-ranging environments limited with 3He. The small prototypes resulting from the Phase II effort will be designed and sized to support the Intelligent Personal Radiation Locator (IPRL) hardware. Phase I neutron detection efficiency measurements of greater than 25 percent were rigorously carried out using a 252Cf source. With a surrounding gamma scintillator measuring the instantaneous 478 KeV gamma from the boron-neutron interaction, an electronic coincidence procedure verified a neutron event with high confidence, rejecting spurious counts and interference from gamma photons at a level of 10-4, comparable to the selected 3He tube used as a standard. The objective of Phase II Year 1 is to move the MCP component capability to its projected full potential of 60-75 percent detection efficiency for thermalized neutrons from a fast source and develop the surrounding scintillator system configuration to establish a gamma rejection of 10-5 to 10-6. This would effectively match or exceed 3He tube performance. Additionally a high yield, low noise vacuum encapsulation of the MCP and algorithm peak search will be carried out. Year 2 will assemble repetitive prototypes, establish a breadboard electronics power and data package, and carry out an assessment of pre-commercialization readiness for field operations. \nNOVA Scientific is teaming with several experts for support; St. Gobain Crystals for expertise in high speed scintillators; VPI Engineering for power and readout electronics and packaging; Sensor Sciences for test and characterization support; and American Electro-Optics for vacuum tube encapsulation.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project has the objective of implementing a commercially-competitive, host-based, malware detection and prevention system. During Phase I, a host-based malware detection system that demonstrated the practicality of detecting a malicious process by dynamically monitoring its system events was developed. The prototype called SAFE (Secure Activity Filtering Engine) filters system events using a stateful policy engine whose policies specify malicious behavior and the appropriate response. Because the technology does not rely upon the detection of signatures (i.e. patterns of bytes), it can detect previously unseen malware. During Phase II a number of significant enhancements to the policy engine including a checkpoint/rollback capability will be developed. The proposed functionality removes file system and registry changes associated with a process when a policy violation is detected. The ability to delay detection of malicious behavior until detailed system events are observed provides a just-in-time detection capability that increases the accuracy of the detection process while reducing false positives.   The SAFE technology has the potential to demonstrate an effective approach to combating at least two of the dominant trends in the threat landscape.  One such trend is the crafting of blended threats which use multiple infections vectors like email readers, web browsers, and messaging software to infect a host computer. Another trend is the popularity of malware toolkits which can be used by malware writers to quickly\ngenerate multiple variants of the same virus. The rapid proliferation of obfuscated variants is a potent threat to traditional signature-based solutions on two fronts: the rate of malware infection may overwhelm efforts to produce signatures to detect these variants and the logarithmic increase in the size of signatures databases reduces the performance of signature scanning. The SAFE technology addresses both of these trends. The stateful policy engine can correlate non simultaneous events across multiple sub systems and processes and thus detect and block blended threats.  If successful, the architecture of the proposed system will have the potential to address a myriad of security threats and make a commercially-significant impact.",

This laser will provide high reliability, excellent beam quality, compact size, low power consumption, and room-temperature single-frequency operation. It can be combined with a rugged, miniaturized gas sampling system, or be used in a unique, open-path configuration to enable long-term measurements of trace gas fluxes and concentrations in the field.

Preliminary designs for a multi-species Phase II sensor were produced, including designs for extending the laser technology to new wavelength regimes. The Phase II work will continue the core Phase I technology development and employ this new laser platform to produce a prototype system. The system will be rigorously tested to demonstrate system efficacy for autonomous greenhouse gas monitoring for extended periods of time. The Phase II work will also demonstrate the efficacy of the core sensor technology platform for other gas sensing applications.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The convergence of recent advances in genome sequencing, genotyping and identification of disease markers has led to the development of the nascent field of personalized medicine, in which an individual's biomarkers can\n be used to predict his or her disease risks and responsiveness to treatments. Omicia is in the business of developing tools and diagnostics in the field of personalized medicine for cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD is the leading killer of both men and w\nomen and is known to have a strong genetic component Here we propose to develop several tools that aim to identify the genetic components of CVD on a whole-genome scale. The research proposed in this application has three aims. In aim 1, we will update and\n improve Omicia's Gene Disease Association Database (GDAD) and software, developed during the SBIR Phase I project, to allow whole genome association (WGA) studies to be filtered, annotated, and queried. This will develop into a CVD-centric knowledge resou\nrce that will be useful for wide-ranging CVD-related research. Furthermore, this knowledge system will be an essential resource as we carry out in aim 2 a WGA study of myocardial infarction (MI) in women, using a two-stage case-control design involving 1,0\n00 female MI cases and 1,000 female controls. This study will detect novel MI- related markers as well as validate already-published markers. To our knowledge, this will be one of the largest MI risk association studies in women to date. CVD kills more wom\nen than men, and 63% of the women who die of a heart attack had exhibited no prior symptoms, so early detection of women's CVD risk is of particular importance. The significant markers from the WGA study will form the basis of a CVD SNP panel that will be \ndesigned in aim 3. The GDAD knowledge system as well as the CVD research SNP panel will be commercialized as products directly developed from this SBIR Phase II project. In addition, we expect to identify a number of susceptibility genes that will be furth\ner validated by Omicia in other retrospective (and eventually prospective) rigorous clinical studies. Eventually, Omicia plans to develop a CVD risk assessment test that will be of particular importance in the appropriate application of preventive measures\n in women and has the potential to attain broad clincial acceptance. The outcome of this project will be a research SNP panel to identify markers that are found to be associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women. This SNP panel, along with Omicia'\ns Genome/Disease Association Database (GDAD) knowledge system, will be marketed to CVD researchers to aid them in their quest to uncover the genetic basis of this complex disease. Omicia's ultimate goal is a SNP-based test that will identify women at high \nrisk for CVD, thereby enabling them to begin preventive care before symptoms appear. Since CVD is the leading cause of death and disability in the developed world, and more than half of the women killed by it had exhibited no prior symptoms, Omicia's plann\ned CVD risk assessment test has the potential to significantly improve public health.",

Issues related to the integration of the developed novel miniature inertial igniters into thermal battery housing as well as high G hardening are fully addressed. The developed novel miniature igniter concepts are very simple in design and manufacture, occupy very small volume, and are purely mechanical and contain no damping elements to ensure consistent operation and very long shelf life of over 20 years. Extensive dynamics modeling and model validation tests have provided the means to optimally design inertial igniters for almost any gun-fired munitions environment, while achieving designs that are significantly smaller than all those that are currently available.

        "abstract": "Reactive power is both a problem and a necessity for the electric grid. Loads on the electric grid such as AC electric motors need reactive power to function and this requires the electric grid to deliver the reactive power. Reactive power occupies valuable capacity on the electric grid and can prevent loads from sourcing adequate real power, leading to brown-outs and black-outs such as the New York blackout on August 14, 2003. By enabling distributed energy resources (DER) like fuel cells, reciprocating engine generators, etc. to provide real and reactive power closer to the loads that require it, the operating margin of the electric grid and therefore its stability, reliability, and efficiency can be substantially improved. This project will develop a controller for commercial distributed energy (DE) inverters that enables DER to deliver both real and reactive power.  The controller is based on technology that delivers a new paradigm: active conversion of 3\u00c2\u00adphase power without software. The technology enables a ten-fold reduction in circuit complexity and the elimination of control software to provide a substantial boost in system reliability and performance, necessary for large-scale deployment on DER. The Phase I project demonstrated a prototype able to rapidly deliver real and reactive power to the grid for voltage support without software. The Phase II project will develop a prototype that leverages the controller from Phase I to commercial size. The resulting controller product will interface with existing commercial DE inverters to accelerate market adoption. A streamlined subset of tests will be developed that facilitates regulatory approval for manufacturers who adopt the controllers for their end-user products.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The controller has commercial applications on fuel cells, micro-turbines, and reciprocating engine generators. The primary benefits are high-quality power, high reliability (due to low component count and no software), and reactive power injection/absorption when needed to support the grid.",

Phase I demonstrated that the innovative recycling process can produce materials for new batteries from spent batteries. The Phase II recycling research objectives will (1) Survey advanced battery technologies (2) Improve process efficiency and (3) Recondition used materials. Starting with spent batteries, the project recovers materials, examines utility, and develops methods for recondition based upon physical or chemical limiting issues. The anticipated result of this development is establishment of the most efficient process to recycle high performance battery materials.  The proposed project establishes the most environmentally friendly advanced battery recycling technology as the solution to the next generation's significant environmental challenge. Today's battery recycling options inefficiently bury, burn, or melt spent batteries. This project addresses needs from battery-reliant industries for low-cost recycling with minimal environmental impact; the developed recycling process is the basis for jobs fundamental to the future portable electronics and electrified vehicle markets. The innovation is based upon knowledge from battery life-limiting mechanisms coupled with green-chemical processing techniques. The research actively involves undergraduate researchers at Willamette University in the development and commercialization of energy efficient technologies.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to refine an algorithmic approach and develop prototype software for workforce optimization with a focus on diversity planning and management. This project is expected to achieve the following four major objectives: 1) further enhance and extend the core technology created during Phase I and endow it with added capabilities that will be valuable for marketability as well as effectiveness; 2) enhance external communications - the software must communicate effectively with the user and database systems. In Phase I, rudimentary communications were established. During Phase II, the system will be greatly enhanced to allow for more effective use; 3) develop software as a service architecture - for greatest market penetration, the software will be deployed via the web. The system architecture will be redesigned to accommodate this requirement; and 4) perform alpha-testing - internal and external testing is critical to releasing a high-quality product. The Phase II research will strengthen the technical aspects of the product while significantly improving its ease of use, producing a system ready to enter the market.  The commercial applications anticipated for the software system are to first enhance the performance of workforce diversity planning and then evolve to supporting the optimization of the entire workforce. The technology is expected to have a significant impact on the broader inclusion of under-represented talent in the workforce.\nWe also expect the technology to lead to improved organizational performance by enabling better decisions in recruitment and retention of all employees. The software will permit an organization to model and simulate critical patterns between policies, programs, initiatives, as well as other factors such as practices and compensation. The impacts of this research include the potential to: 1) design a more effective approach (simulation/optimization) to diversity planning and workforce optimization, increase workforce diversity, capabilities, and performance; 2) support a significant social and economic initiative; 3) become appealing to attract investments as it significantly increases return and minimizes risk in diversity and workforce planning; 4) add to the body of knowledge in human resource management and decision sciences that may be leveraged to permit additional research and development.",

Lanthionines are found in nature and have been isolated from a variety of sources. Although amino acids, lanthionines are not components of  proteins.  They are however, constituents of a group of naturally occurring peptide antibiotics called lantibiotics, which includes nisin (a food preservative), subtilin, epidermin (an anti staphylococcus and streptococcus agent), and ancovenin (an enzyme inhibitor).  Due to their mechanism of action, resistance to lantibiotics is uncommon and as such they can be of value for treating antibiotic resistant bacterial infections.  The technology under development would allow the synthesis of novel lantibiotics that may be effective against the growing number of antibiotic resistant bacteria and would expand the therapeutic arsenal available for treating such infections.  It would therefore have a profound impact on public health and the control of infectious diseases caused by bacteria.",

        "abstract": "Currently available neutron detectors are limited in their ability to be used with the intense neutron beams used for the advanced study of materials at large-scale national facilities.  A large number of neutron-scattering experiments require beam monitors to operate in an intense neutron beam flux of more than107  neutrons per second per square centimeter.  For instance, a 4 cm x 4 cm intense beam flux of 6.25x107 n/s/cm2 at the Spallation Neutron Source will put a flux of 1.00x109 n/s at the beam monitor.  Currently available beam monitors will need to be replaced in less than two years of operation due to wire and gas degradation issues.  There is also a need for beam position information that is beyond the capabilities of currently available 3He and BF3  neutron beam monitors.  This project will investigate the use of pixel-cell technology for developing a new generation of stable, high-count-rate neutron beam monitors and position-sensitive detectors.  In Phase I, a prototypical 2 x 4 Pixel-Cell Neutron Beam monitor was conceptualized, designed, and constructed.  The prototype unit was successfully tested and evaluated in a neutron beam at the High Flux Isotope Reactor in Oak Ridge.  In Phase II, the pixel cell technology will be tested further with the prototype beam monitor, leading to refinement and optimization of the technology.  Using these refinements, a two-dimensional pixel-cell area detector will be designed and built for testing at a neutron beam source.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should lead to the development and commercialization of advanced neutron beam detectors that would directly benefit the Spallation Neutron Source and other intense neutron sources such as the High Flux Isotope Reactor.  Advancing the detector capabilities is equivalent to increasing operational efficiency and reducing the experiment beam time at these facilities, which, in turn, results in important savings in operation cost and increased experimental output.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Caring for an elderly family member with dementia is burdensome and stressful to the majority of caregivers, and contributes to psychiatric morbidity in the form of higher prevalence and incidence of depression. Psycho \neducational formats and cognitive-behavioral approaches have been shown to be the most effective psychosocial interventions in reducing caregiver depression. This project will develop and evaluate an interactive multimedia intervention designed to reduce d\nepressive symptomatology and prevent depressive disorders among at-risk family caregivers of older adults with dementia. The intervention will attempt to modify depressive risk factors and promote protective factors. In order to reach wide-ranging target p\nopulations, it will be developed for delivery via the Internet/intranet and CD-ROM. Based on empirically-validated intervention approaches, the self-administered intervention will consist of eight knowledge- and skills-based modules including: understandin\ng caregiver depression, mood monitoring, engaging in pleasant activities, managing the care receiver's behavior, increasing positive thinking, pleasant activities with the care receiver, planning for the future, and skill integration. The competency-based \ninstructional design will be structured for multiple sessions using video-based tutorials, testimonials, and behavior modeling vignettes. Additional browser modules will include: self-screening for depression, getting support, learning to relax, problem so\nlving, articles library, and caregiver resources. The program will be targeted to the gender and kinship of family caregivers including: female spouse/partners, male spouse/partners, female adult offspring/other, and male adult offspring/other. The basic s\ntructure of the program will be the same for each target population, but specific content will be customized to each group. The Phase I prototype, targeted to female adult offspring caregivers who reported elevated depressive symptoms, provided training on\n understanding depression, monitoring mood, and engaging in pleasant activities. It was evaluated in a within-subjects design feasibility study in which participants were followed over a 1-week period. The results indicated significant pre to post change i\nn depressive symptomatology, pleasant activity engagement and enjoyment, knowledge, and self-efficacy to use the skills taught. Subjects found the program easy to use and gave it high user satisfaction ratings. The fully developed Phase II product will be \nevaluated in a large randomized trial (N = 360); participants will be followed over a three-month period. Results are expected to show reductions in depressive symptoms and caregiver burden. These changes in the outcome measures are expected to be mediated\n by changes in the specific skills (e.g., increasing pleasant activities, decreasing negative thinking) acquired through the intervention. The potential commercial applications of the Phase II product are to employee assistance programs, behavioral health \norganizations, health insurance companies, and caregiver support organizations.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The rates of Alzheimer's disease continue to rise, with the majority of those suffering from it being taken care of at home by a family member. Pro\nviding care is significantly burdensome and stressful, often contributing to caregiver depression, which has been shown to be associated with impaired functioning and poor quality of life as well as behaviors that are potentially harmful to the care receiv\ner. Given the evidence that psycho educational and cognitive-behavioral approaches are effective for addressing caregiver depression, there is a critical need to develop a program that can be easily implemented and widely disseminated.",

The system will manage population and health data of any type, including hierarchical cross-sectional microdata, longitudinal data, and small-area summary files. The technology used for retrieving and manipulating data has remained virtually unchanged since the first statistical packages were introduced almost four decades ago. As long as researchers used simple small surveys and employed only one data source at a time, the old technology worked adequately. In recent years, however, the scale and complexity of population and health data has expanded rapidly. Many sources incorporate multiple levels of hierarchy, often including a longitudinal dimension. Researchers are increasingly merging data from different sources to carry out their analyses. Moreover, the scale of available data resources is expanding at an unprecedented pace with the release of large administrative datasets and high-density census microdata samples from around the world. Reliance on antiquated data management tools imposes heavy costs on the research community. The PHDM will reduce the costs of research by allowing analysts to manipulate data without the assistance of professional programming staff.

Achieving proper alignment is currently a t\nime-consuming and imprecise art that requires considerable skill and effort on the part of the prosthetist, and permits no direct control by the patient. The proposed project will significantly advance the alignment process. The objective of the proposed w\nork is to refine a Robotic Prosthetic Alignment system (RoboPAL) that enables the alignment of lower limb prostheses to be rapidly adjusted by robotic control. A prototype system developed in Phase I successfully allowed both the prosthetist and the prosth\nesis user to specify alignment changes via a hand-held control unit communicating wirelessly with an actuator unit integrated with standard modular components. The technology permits the prosthetist to concentrate on  the big picture  (i.e. eliminate time \non the floor with wrenches in hand), and will enable the patient to participate more fully by directly controlling adjustments. In addition, the system will be capable of accepting input from the Computerized Prosthetic Alignment System (ComPAS), a separat\ne technology that measures loads transmitted through the prosthesis, calculates magnitude and direction of misalignment, and outputs direction and magnitude of advised alignment modifications. When RoboPAL and ComPAS are used together, the result is an aut\no-aligning limb.

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE. This project will advance the important process of aligning the \ncomponents of lower limb prostheses. The technology will allow the prosthetist to adjust the alignment quickly, easily, and in a more well-controlled manner than is currently possible.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The disparity between the size of the frail, aging population and the nursing workforce that provides care for the elderly is growing, and will continue to expand at an alarming rate. Though the government and the publi\nc may demand that nursing homes provide high quality of care to elder residents, the current prospective payment system does not sufficiently reimburse facilities to hire and retain appropriate staffing levels. The correlation between a resident's quality \nof life and the amount of direct care time spent with nursing staff is well documented; however, without significant changes to the reimbursement system, residents should expect even less time devoted to direct care in the future. Incontinence is a conditi\non for which many older adults are institutionalized. Staff time required to provide incontinence care is substantial. The proposed study will investigate the efficacy of a technology-assisted management of incontinence (TAMI) system that addresses three o\nf the key quality indicators used to measure the quality of care provided by all nursing homes. Investigators hypothesize that use of the TAMI system will reduce the total time required to deliver incontinence care, while simultaneously improving individua\nlized care. The overall potential benefits for residents, staff and management of nursing homes include improved quality of life for residents, higher staff productivity, and reduction in cost and suffering caused by skin breakdown related to time spent in\n wet conditions. Ultimately it is expected that nursing homes can utilize net savings in labor to further focus attention on other basic and preventive care processes. The proposed clinical study will be conducted in 3 nursing home facilities using a repea\nted measures design to determine if use of the proposed technology 1) incurs time savings in the provision of incontinence care, 2) reduces skin wetness upon change of briefs, 3) reduces incidence of blanchable erythema, 4) is consistently and effectively \nutilized when research staff are not present, 5) is cost effective from the perspective of facilities, and 6) results in perceived improvements in care for which families are willing to pay. The commercial potential for this process quality control system \nis discussed. Previous attempts to introduce similar technology into the nursing home facility have met resistance primarily due to the cost, unwieldy operation, and ineffectiveness. Moreover, the systems were not designed to meet the needs of the most cri\ntical element within the nursing home care process: the nurse aide. Incontinence is a condition for which many older adults are institutionalized and are labor intensive to prevent and to treat. We hypothesize that use of Technology Assisted Management of \nIncontinence: TAMi will reduce the total time required to deliver incontinence care through targeted intervention and that nursing homes can utilize the net savings in labor to attend to other basic and preventive care processes. The overall potential bene\nfits of this time savings include improved quality of life, higher staff productivity, and potential cost savings resulting from avoidance of adverse outcomes.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  OsteoGeneX is developing a therapeutic directed against the new bone target Sclerostin (SOST) for the treatment of osteoporosis and related bone disorders. Through genomic approaches Sclerostin was identified as a mast\ner regulator of bone mass affecting men and women. Using proteomic approaches Dr. Ellies and Krumlauf discovered and patented Sclerostin's mechanism of action. Since then, Dr. Ellies was awarded an NIH Phase I SBIR  proof of concept  grant to screen for co\nmpounds that would block SOST function. This library was hand picked by Dr. Gunda Georg, University Distinguished Professor of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Kansas. The NIH has identified Dr. Georg as one of the top 5 percent of researchers receiving \nfunding from the NIH for her work in medicinal chemistry and drug development and discovery.  Dr. Ellies has identified many lead candidates that work to block SOST. These candidates need to be authenticated using a novel biochemical approach looking speci\nfically at the binding of SOST to its receptor - LRP5. The binding of these proteins is what regulates new bone formation. Recent news about bone building therapeutics - PTH and analogs - having to carry a black box warning has created a need for a new bon\ne building therapeutic. An alternative to PTH therapy is through the use of Sclerostin as an ideal anabolic target for drug development. The purpose of this SBIR Phase II application is to identify the most optimal dosing of a single or couple of authentic\nated lead candidates that will build new bone. To accomplish this end, we propose to carry out the following specific aims; authenticate positive lead candidates; calculate effective dosage and delivery; and analyze their effect in rat models for osteoporo\nsis.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Osteoporosis is one of the most prevalent problems in our society. New drug targets for controlling bone deposition must be identified, as our understanding of the molecular control of bone deposition is poor. While there is \nno cure for osteoporosis, the FDA has approved the use of certain drugs to prevent and treat osteoporosis. These drugs, especially those directed against bone resorption, cause undesirable side effects and may not significantly reduce fracture risk in the \ntarget populations. Thus, there is a critical need to identify new and better therapeutics that would result in better patient outcomes. This proposal is aimed at authenticating novel drugs that increase bone deposition, rather than prevent resorption, to \noffset the bone loss of osteoporosis. Furthermore, this proposal will establish a dosage regime and delivery, and show proof of concept in animals.",

Under the Phase II effort, the P2SI Team will develop these materials and characterize the fundamental structure-property-processing relationships to enable manufacturing scale-up and commercialization.  The P2SI concept is for an Engineered Material where the processing behavior and the resulting macroscopic performance (thermal conductivity) is a unique function of the composite architecture.  Building the proposed ultra-high isotropic thermal conductivity materials from a multi-scale constituent level represents a leap in technology that was first developed from the fundamental level and validated in the Phase I program.  The impacts of this research are twofold: providing a foundation for a new technology in materials science research; and utilizing these fundamental findings to develop and engineer enabling materials to meet growing needs in industry for thermal management applications.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The intended outcome of this SBIR proposal is a commercialized physical model of the lumbar spine (S1 - T12) that will consist of synthetic, normal or osteoporotic vertebrae, intervertebral discs, ligaments and facet j\noints.  The anatomical and mechanically qualified analogue lumbar spine model will be engineered to provide clinically relevant measurements of disc pressure and facet joint loads from embedded instrumentation.  This technology will create a standardized e\nxperimental spine model with low inter-specimen variability that can be used to elucidate fine differences in spinal implants and surgical procedures that would otherwise be difficult to discover through tests on largely variable cadaver spines.  The overa\nll objective of Phase II is to commercially manufacture and validate a synthetic mechanical analogue spine model with embedded instrumentation.  Previous work from Phase I resulted in the transfer of current research concepts to create commercially manufac\ntured mechanical analogue soft tissues for the lumbar spine and anatomical vertebrae.  PRL demonstrated the ability to control and reproduce analogue tissue specimens, however difficulties were encountered with environmental sensitivity of the urethanes af\nfecting the mechanical properties.  Quality control measures will be implemented in manufacturing to ensure reproducible and reliable mechanical properties are achieved.  Assembled models were evaluated for their mechanical performance in bending and compr\nession.  Results indicate that more iterative steps are needed to fine-tune a few parameters of the assembled model.  Phase II will continue the work from phase I to; manufacture synthetic vertebrae designed to have mechanical behaviour similar to normal a\nnd osteoporotic vertebral bone; assess the fatigue performance of the analogue spine model; develop a computational model; develop simple, reliable and cost effective disc pressure and facet joint load measuring techniques and lastly, qualify the manufactu\nred model with embedded instrumentation and qualify the instrumented model for use in medical device quasi-static testing by comparison to human cadaveric specimens.  The PI and co-investigators envision that these models can be used in a variety of capaci\nties for spine research and product development.  The models will aid in understanding the effects of surgical procedures and implants on potential patient outcomes.  An analogue spine model will also be an efficient way to perform biomechanical tests and \nproduct development.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is an urgent need for improved therapies for acute and chronic myocardial ischemia. Bone marrow-derived stem cells (SC) injected into acutely injured as well as chronically ischemic myocardium improve left ventric\nular function. However, a major limitation of direct infusion or injection of SC is the targeting and retention of these cells at the site of myocardial injury. To address these problems, we have developed an improved, proprietary approach using bispecific\n antibody (BiMab)-targeted SC. This approach is less invasive, more specific and more efficacious. In phase I we used a xenogeneic rodent model of myocardial infarction (MI) to demonstrate that CD34+ SC derived from human peripheral blood can be antibody-t\nargeted to injured myocardium when injected intravenously. In these studies an anti-CD45 antibody recognizing the CD34+ enriched SCs was chemically conjugated to an antibody recognizing myosin light chain (MLC) exposed in injured cardiac tissue. Starting t\nwo weeks post-MI and extending for at least 3 months, individuals receiving BiMab-armed SC had significantly improved myocardial function vs. those receiving unarmed SC. These exciting results provide proof-of-concept for antibody-targeted SC to enhance my\nocardial repair. In Phase II, to further develop and improve this technology with the ultimate aim of filing an IND, we will identify and characterize human antibodies recognizing CD45 and MLC. The recombinant human monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) will be lin\nked to create a BiMab,  CorTarga,  which will be evaluated using a preclinical rat model of myocardial infarction. Efficacy will be improved by optimizing cell types and numbers, timing of and strategies for administration of CorTarga. Finally, pre-clinica\nl pharmacology and toxicology studies will be initiated. Successful outcome of this work will demonstrate a general method to improve the use of stem cell therapies for severe cardiac disease as well as many other indications in cell-based regenerative med\nicine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Myocardial repair by targeted stem cells Major problems of cell targeting and retention limit the efficacy of stem cell therapy for myocardial injury. Bispecific antibodies recognizing an injury specific target and an antige\nn on the stem cells provides a novel means to greatly improve the efficiency of cell-based regenerative therapies.",

Anima\nl studies indicate that the extracellular domain of RAGE (soluble Rage, sRAGE) can inhibit RAGE function and ameliorate these pathologies, however this form of the protein has unfavorable pharmacokinetics. The overall goal of the present proposal is to fur\nther develop an immunoglobulin Fc fusion protein of sRAGE as a novel inhibitor of diabetic complications. The Fc domain is expected to extend the serum half-life of sRAGE which will greatly facilitate its use for chronic disease. In phase I, a series of re\ncombinant, soluble RAGE-Fc fusion proteins was created and the optimal RAGE-Fc construct was selected based on in vitro functional studies as well as simple in vivo models. Phase II will focus on preclinical animal efficacy studies in preparation for an IN\nD.    We hypothesize that RAGE-Fc will exhibit superior pharmacokinetics compared to sRAGE (our main competitor for potential RAGE-neutralizing therapeutics). This will be tested directly in Phase II work. Furthermore RAGE-Fc will be compared to sRAGE in t\nhree different murine models of diabetic complications: diabetic nephropathy, diabetic atherosclerosis, and diabetic retinopathy. Based on the favorable functional performance of RAGE-Fc as compared to sRAGE in several assays performed during Phase I studi\nes, we expect that RAGE-Fc will also produce results superior to sRAGE in the proposed animal models.

Moreover, our efforts to control insect pests have caused massive environmental contamination and continue to cause human and animal fatalities annually. Biotechnology offers alternatives to conventional pest control that have great promise although, like other technological innovations, there is resistance to its use and it carries some risks with which we have little prior experience. Baculoviruses, which are common pathogens of many important pest insect species causing frequent and dramatic epizootics that produce major declines in pest populations in cropping and landscape systems have been intensively investigated as biological pesticides. However, baculovirus biopesticides, with a few notable exceptions, have not been commercially successful due to high production costs. One increasingly important aspect of biotechnology is its potential to replace conventional products with process and materials that are more environmentally sound. Paratechs biology-based baculovirus production (B3P) technology is an example of such a green process in that it has the potential to produce cost-competitive biopesticides that can be used to replace chemical pesticides and relies upon natural biological processes rather than synthetic chemicals to do so. Such a technology would have important commercial impact and also have beneficial environmental and health effects.",

A major obstacle for building a case for future muon colliders or neutrino factories has been the lack of an experimental demonstration of the principle of ionization cooling of muons and, in particular, six-dimensional (6-D) cooling and emittance exchange.  Past work has focused on lattice design, simulation studies and magnet design for a compact gas-filled storage ring for 6-D cooling of muon beams. The Phase I project extended those design results. The Phase I feasibility studies made advancements, as beam cooling was observed under two of the five cases studied. The Phase II project will continue the refinement and optimization of the preferred lattice of a 6-D muon cooling system using achromat bends. Work will continue to define and develop a credible beam injection/extraction scheme.  A high temperature superconducting (HTS) solenoid, a crucial sub-system of the 6-D muon cooling machine, will be designed, built, and tested during this phase.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A robust, simple and economical cooling system to cool ion and particle beams has use in ion lasers, biotech, medical, and nanotechnology applications.  Development of HTS magnet technology may revolutionize future medical and accelerator facilities.  Various magnets in muon colliders, hadron colliders, and facilities for rare isotope beams benefit significantly from the ability of HTS to produce high fields and to handle and economically remove large energy depositions.

Our innovation is based on a micromachined membrane that serves \nas both the sensing element for a microphone and simultaneously the actuation surface for the earphone. By collocating the earphone and microphone, our device eliminates the acoustic phase delay between the ANR sensor and actuator, thereby enabling feedbac\nk algorithms with higher gain at higher frequency than is possible using separate devices. Current hearing protection designs provide approximately 30 dB of attenuation at the ear. This level of protection is not sufficient to allow long exposures in many \nindustrial noise environments (which may exceed 130 dB) while maintaining the at-the-ear sound levels within prescribed safety limits. In order to keep within current NIOSH and OSHA noise exposure standards, new technologies are needed that will protect in\ndividuals from long-term exposure to harmful noise levels that could potentially result in temporary or permanent hearing threshold shifts. During the Phase I project, we demonstrated the feasibility of our innovation by fabricating and testing prototypica\nl devices. The results we achieved showed the sensitivity of our microphone design, demonstrated the sound production capability of our earphone design, provided a manufacturing plan for fabrication of the co-located earphone/microphone during Phase II, an\nd demonstrated the noise reduction capability over the frequency range of 300 Hz 8000 Hz.

        "abstract": "Key factors determining reproductive efficiency are control of estrus and ovulation in weaned sows and in gilts, which have already begun to display estrous cycles. Weaning sows at 3 weeks or greater of lactation results in a high percentage of them displaying estrus 5-8 days later. Feeding the orally active progestin, MATRIX, to gilts for 14 days results in greater than 85% of them displaying estrus 4-9 days after last feeding of MATRIX. The 4-6 day range in onset of estrus after weaning in sows and after MATRIX in gilts requires labor intensive estrus detection, and variation in ovulation relative to estrus precludes optimal artificial insemination (AI) timing and single fixed time AI. Thus, a treatment, which will synchronize ovulation more precisely will enable all females in a group to be inseminated on the same day without regard to estrus. Pennatek LLC has developed OvuGel, which delivers triptorelin acetate in a slow release formula via an intravaginal delivery system. Triptorelin mimics a peptide hormone released by the brain that stimulates release of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary gland, which stimulates ovulation. This project will determine optimal time of OvuGel treatment to obtain optimal fertility when paired with a single fixed-time AI in the morning 5 days after weaning in sows and 5 days after last feeding of MATRIX in gilts, if gonadotropin (PG 600) treatment of sows after weaning and gilts after last feeding of MATRIX affects OvuGel synchronization of ovulation and fertility and if OvuGel is effective in major commercial operations.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Warfarin is the most commonly used oral anticoagulant medication. Because an individual's proper warfarin dose is difficult to assess, most physicians initiate therapy at a standard dose and follow up with an INR blood\n test to ensure the medicine is working properly. Unfortunately, therapeutic warfarin doses vary significantly from patient to patient, so that even a standard dose can cause life-threatening hemorrhaging. Genetic and non-genetic factors both influence an \nindividual's warfarin dose requirement and response characteristics, and although the importance of pharmacogenetics to warfarin therapy is understood, clear guidance for how such information should be applied to patient therapy is woefully absent. The Per\nsonalized Medicine Interface (PerMIT) software utility supplies this critical guidance by modeling the dose requirements and response characteristics of individual patients based on their genotypic and physical characteristics. Using state-of-the-art multi\nvariate computations, PerMIT conveniently calculates a warfarin maintenance dose estimate and models the influence of repeated dosing on plasma drug concentration. PerMIT provides guidance during the transition from induction to maintenance therapy and lim\nits the potential for misinterpretation of INR measurements by clearly displaying the relationship of the dosing regimen to the progress toward steady-state. The specific aim of Phase I was to develop a computational model that estimates the most appropria\nte warfarin maintenance dose for an individual, accurately estimates the plasma concentration of S-warfarin following each warfarin dose, and provides a visual estimate of the time to reach steady state. PGXL Laboratories has accomplished this specific aim\n with the creation of the graphical patient care interface, PerMIT. The specific aim of Phase II is to demonstrate the power of PerMIT in guiding superior clinical management of patients taking warfarin. Three technical objectives will demonstrate that the\n software functions as intended, that it is user friendly, and that it is clinically effective: (1) Validate the analytical accuracy of computational algorithms which drive the PerMIT module; (2) Drive design improvements through Usability Testing; (3) Mea\nsure the clinical value of PerMIT in a prospective trial of PerMIT-guided therapy versus standard of care. Completion of the above-stated objectives will: (1) confirm that the computational basis of PerMIT is consistent with the state-of-the-art in warfari\nn dose estimation and plasma concentration modeling, (2) assure the highest quality user interface based on a validated approach to Usability Testing, and (3) demonstrate the utility of PerMIT for improved efficiency of patient care.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVAN\nCE:  Warfarin is the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant, but managing patients on warfarin is difficult due to variability in patients' response to the medication; indeed, adverse reactions to warfarin are second only to insulin in frequency. Inhe\nrited differences account for approximately 40% of the variability in warfarin dose response between individuals, but clinicians thus far have had no clear and easy methods or tools to help them understand and account for this variability when directing pa\ntient therapy. PerMIT:Warfarin provides muchneeded guidance to clinicians throughout the course of warfarin therapy and limits the potential for misinterpretation of blood test results (INR measurements) by clearly displaying the relationship between a pat\nient's dosing regimen and their progress toward stable therapy.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability in the U.S. Evidence from randomized trials suggests that when medications for hypertension and lipid disorders are used at standard dosages, the\ny have a significant risk-reduction effect. Yet, adherence problems to lipid management and antihypertensive medications are well known. In 2002, the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute's Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blo\nod Cholesterol in Adults (ATP III) reported that poor adherence crosses ethnic and age groups, socioeconomic strata, acute and chronic diseases, and treatment regimens. The consequences of absent or partial adherence are observed in all types of clinical s\nettings. The ATP III also reports that there is no one cause of poor medication adherence. Since there is no single cause, there is not likely to be one approach to improve adherence in all persons. The goal of this Phase II application is to continue deve\nlopment and conduct efficacy testing of this practical and easily delivered intervention system to assist patients with lipid disorders and hypertension to take advantage of several strategies for improving adherence to medications. The intervention will u\ntilize a computer-based software program during routine clinic visits to: (1) assess a patient's unique medication adherence challenges; (2) provide him or her with tailored information on adhering to medications prescribed by his or her physician; and (3)\n provide suggestions for that patient's physician based on the patient's medication adherence assessment. Several other approaches are available to improve medication adherence. Yet, this proposed system offers unique features. It utilizes very-low-cost te\nchnology to direct a patient to adherence enhancing strategies that fit his or her unique needs. The patient assessment occurs just prior to seeing the physician so physician efficiency in dealing with medication-related discussions can be improved. The sy\nstem should increase the consistency with which physicians address key adherence issues. Additionally, the physician's influence with the patient is potentially leveraged. Because this intervention approach relies on the physician's understanding of patien\nts' current physiologic characteristics, most recent prescribed medications, and knowledge of side effects a patient may be experiencing at that visit, this system should have a quality advantage over some competing systems. In Phase II, we will enhance th\ne system based on Phase I results, and conduct a prospective efficacy trial to test the ability of the system to improve medication adherence using an intervention groups with 154 patients and a usual care of 154 patients being treated in internal medicine\n, cardiology and community health center clinical settings and their physicians (N=16). Public Health Relevance: Heart disease is the leading cause of death and disability in the U.S. Most people have problems taking their prescribed medications. If the pr\noposed system proves to be effective in helping people take blood pressure and cholesterol-lowering medicines, it can reduce the costs of healthcare and improve the quality of life for people who have a risk for heart disease.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to continue development of a new, high-performance X-ray phosphor, based on zinc telluride (ZnTe), doped with oxygen. Currently, our phosphor is at least 3-fold brighter than present technology and further im\nprovements are expected in Phase II. This increase in brightness will solve a major problem in the design of these detector systems. Simply stated: ZnTe:O will have a major impact on protein crystallography. Our project will be most valuable to this major \nfield, which is extremely important to NIH. Every synchrotron beamline, assigned to structural molecular biology (there are ~20 of these), has a detector, for which NIH has already paid ~ 1million. Our phosphor will improve the performance of each of these\n substantially. PhosphorTech Corporation (PTC) is highly experienced in this area. In 2002 we developed ZnSe:Cu,Ce, a zinc selenide (ZnSe)-based phosphor, in collaboration with Bruker-AXS Inc., for use as an X-ray screen phosphor in their chemical crystall\nography detector system  Apex.  ZnSe:Cu,Ce has proven to be an outstanding phosphor for this application, being about 3x brighter than Gd2O2S:Tb the  standard  phosphor for CCD crystallographic detectors. ZnSe:Cu,Ce exhibits a time response (afterglow) con\nsiderably faster than Gd2O2S:Tb, which is another positive feature. Bruker AXS now dominates the chemical crystallography market in the USA and Europe, with over 85% market share. This is in part due to the remarkable success of our phosphor, and the stron\ng acceptance of this phosphor by Bruker customers. PTC supplies this phosphor to Bruker through commercial sales and thus the contribution of PTC to chemical crystallography has been profound. We propose in this project to make an equally profound contribu\ntion to another scientific discipline structural molecular biology. However, detectors used for protein crystallography cannot use ZnSe:Cu,Ce phosphor because it contains selenium (Se). Protein crystallographers today solve their structures by  multiple en\nergy anomalous dispersion  (MAD) phasing methods1,2. About 80% of these studies make use of Se, chemically replacing sulfur in the amino acid methionine, as the atom providing this anomalous scattering signal. Since Se in the ZnSe:Cu,Ce phosphor will manif\nest the same discontinuous change in its X-ray absorption spectrum as the Se in the protein crystal sample, at precisely the same X-ray energy (12,658eV), it is inappropriate for the detector used in these measurements to contain Se. ZnTe has very similar \nchemical and physical properties as ZnSe. The two zinc-blend structures have virtually the same lattice constant of 6.1037E, and similar band gaps (2.3eV for ZnTe; 2.7eV for ZnSe). But the absorption edges of tellurium (4,341eV, 31,814eV) are far away from\n the selenium edge. Thus, in addition to higher efficiency, there is a strong motivation to produce ZnTe phosphor powders that can be used to make large screens for imaging the diffraction of protein crystals. We have completely met our Phase I goals. We f\nabricated a ZnTe-based phosphor, ZnTe:O, that is as bright (and could potentially be brighter) than our ZnSe phosphor. We have also established fabrication procedures that seal the ZnTe:O phosphor from the outside environment, thus preventing its oxidative\n degradation that was the original problem for this project. The light emission of our ALD- coated ZnTe:O phosphor is now time-independent and compatible with commercial screen processes. We therefore propose, during Phase II of this project, to develop th\ne means to synthesize larger quantities of high quality ZnTe:O phosphor powder, and optimize the large screens necessary for protein crystallography CCD detectors. ZnTe:O phosphor converting films will be most useful for protein crystallography detectors u\nsed at synchrotron beamlines, enhancing their value to NIH and to the molecular biology community as a whole.

The MIC is 2 mm in diameter, robust, and sensitive. It fits easily into the e\nndotracheal tube, or into a sampling line of non-intubated patients. The device is immune to interference from other gases exhaled by the patient, to atmospheric pressure, and to humidity, and it has high carbon dioxide resolution and accuracy, and short r\nesponse time.

        "abstract": "One of the barriers to a hydrogen economy is the absence of a cost effective method of producing clean hydrogen.  The direct electrolysis of water using solar energy (e.g., a photoelectrochemical process) would be ideal.  However, this solution requires new semiconductor photoelectric materials with high energy conversion efficiency and high durability, along with the ability to cost-effectively synthesize these materials.  This project will develop a new method of inexpensively synthesizing, processing, and stabilizing semiconductor photoelectric materials that can satisfy the performance criteria for photoelectrochemical cells.  The approach is based on the electrochemical deposition of A2B6-based semiconductor heterojunctions, both n-type anode and p-type binary cathode.  In Phase I, the system was designed and its feasibility demonstrated through simulation and a series of proof-of-concept experiments, including the validation of fabrication steps.  The results suggested a hydrogen-production efficiency greater than 12% with a durability longer than 5000 hours.  Phase II will involve optimization of the design, exploration of more A2B6 semiconductor films, maturation of the electrodeposition process, and development of a fully functional prototype.  The prototype will be tested at a national laboratory to demonstrate its conversion efficiency, durability, and economic viability.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The semiconductor-based photoelectrochemical system for generating hydrogen by solar energy conversion should significantly increase the efficiency of hydrogen production in industrial processes, in particular for hydrogen-hungry industries such as transportation.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising cancer treatment. PDT uses the affinity of photosensitizers such as hematoporphyrin derivative (HPD) and other compounds to be selectively retained in malignant tumors. When tum\nors, pretreated with the photosensitizer (PS), are irradiated with visible light, a photochemical reaction occurs and tumor cells are destroyed. Oxygen molecules in the metastable singlet delta state O2(1 ) are believed to be the species that destroys canc\nerous cells during PDT. An optically- based imaging device that can visualize spatial maps of both the singlet oxygen production and the location of the PS in a tumor during PDT would be a valuable tool for PDT research and more effective treatments. In a \nPhase I program Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) developed and demonstrated a 2D imaging system and successfully produced spatially resolved images of photosensitizers and singlet oxygen both in-vitro and in-vivo. The in-vivo images were from mice containing t\numor models. Based on these successful Phase I results, in Phase II, PSI proposes to design, build and test a complete and ruggedized 2D imaging sensor for simultaneous, co-registered singlet oxygen emission and PS fluorescence. The system will use a fiber\n coupled diode laser for light irradiation and two CCD cameras with a spectral discrimination method. A novel, intensified, near-IR array camera will be used for the detection of singlet oxygen emission. The 2D spatially resolved image of singlet oxygen em\nission will be correlated with PS fluorescence obtained with a visible imaging camera. The system will be tested on in-vitro photosensitizer samples at PSI. Comprehensive in-vivo tests will also be performed on tumor models in laboratory rats with our coll\naborators at Dartmouth College. A fully developed instrument will be a valuable tool for several aspects of PDT research including: elucidating kinetic and physiological phenomena, assessing new photosensitizers targeted to specific tissue areas, correlati\nng photosensitizer concentrations with singlet oxygen production, and evaluating the relationship between singlet oxygen production with tumor regression. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will demonstrate a novel diagnostic for improving the treatment\n of cancer by light activated cancer killing drugs. A successful program will produce high resolution images of the location of an excited form of oxygen (produced by the light activated drugs within tumors) that is responsible for killing the tumor.

(CIL), have performed Phase I investigations successfully demonstrating the feas\nibility of a rapid, 13C labeled dextromethorphan (DM) breath test to assess CYP2D6 enzyme activity. Under the current Phase II application, PSI, in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, proposes to carry out investigations to establish the pote\nntial utility of this simple breath test for predicting 2D6 enzyme activity in a cohort of breast cancer patients initiating tamoxifen therapy. The predictive capability of the breath test will be established by evaluating the correlation of the subjects' \nmeasured breath test phenotypes with their steady state plasma concentrations of endoxifen and metabolite ratios of endoxifen to N-Desmethyltamoxifen (NDM). Breath test results will also be correlated with separate determinations of CYP2D6 genotype made in\n the same cohort. There now exists a large body of research that shows that endoxifen plasma concentrations in women undergoing tamoxifen therapy are highly associated with CYP2D6 genotype and concomitant potent CYP2D6 inhibitors and may have an impact on \nthe response to tamoxifen therapy. Furthermore, preliminary clinical studies (including those performed by our Mayo Clinic collaborators) have shown associations between clinical outcomes of tamoxifen and CYP2D6 genotype/phenotype. The potential advantages\n of the proposed phenotyping breath test over genotyping to predict a subject's response to tamoxifen are: 1) unlike genotyping, the phenotyping test can account for drug-drug and other in vivo interactions affecting a patient's actual metabolic capacity, \nand 2) the proposed phenotyping test may help resolve the significant intersubject variability of endoxifen concentrations that has been observed within genotype classes (even when accounting for medication history). If successful, the proposed research co\nuld lead to a very useful, office- based test for guiding and optimizing the use of tamoxifen therapy in breast cancer patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANC:The proposed research seeks to develop a rapid, non-invasive breath test that can accurately assess an i\nndividual's activity for a key liver enzyme involved in the metabolism of a wide range of drugs. Examples of these drugs include certain anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, analgesics, and tamoxifen for breast cancer therapy. The information gained from thi\ns office-based test could ultimately enable physicians to tailor drug selection and dosing according to the individual, thereby reducing adverse drug events such as toxic reactions and poor therapeutic response.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a relatively new, rapidly developing, and promising modality for cancer treatment. PDT uses certain compounds known as photosensitizers (PS's) that are preferentially retained in malignant tumors. With visible light, the photosensitizers initiate a reaction that selectively kills the malignant cells to which they are attached. FDA approval has been granted for treatment of esophageal and certain lung cancers. PDT is being used in clinical trials for bladder, brain, skin and other cancers. PDT is also being applied to important areas outside of cancer treatment including age related macular degeneration and actinic keratosis, a pre-cancerous skin condition. There is considerable evidence that singlet molecular oxygen (O2(a1?)) is the active species in cancer cell necrosis. A real-time dosimeter for singlet oxygen produced during PDT would be a valuable tool for better understanding the PDT process and for improving treatment outcomes. The overall objective of the proposed SBIR Fast Track program is to build upon our recent success in developing a prototype, real-time detector for singlet oxygen to complete focused, but extensive pre-clinical studies. In Phase I we will significantly improve the sensitivity of the sensor and quantitatively demonstrate these improvements in a series of in-vitro and in-vivo studies. In Phase II we will incorporate the lessons learned in Phase I and build an upgraded, fieldable version and deliver it to the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) for an extensive series of animal and human studies. One critical study will be to demonstrate the quantitative relationship between PDT treated tumor regression and the amount of singlet oxygen produced during the treatment. Carefully constructed protocols for the animal studies will examine important PDT parameters including PS type and concentration, light intensity and total dose, and the time between PS infusion and PDT treatment. These studies will use only FDA approved photosensitizers (ALA and BPD) to maximize the relevance of the results to PDT in humans. Near the end of the three year program, MGH will complete a study of PDT generated singlet oxygen from healthy human subjects with topical ALA on their skin. The Fast Track program will result in a robust and statistically significant data base that will be submitted to the FDA at the end of the program. The goal is to obtain FDA approval to market the singlet oxygen monitor to PDT researchers as the initial target market. This program will be relevant to an emerging form of cancer therapy and will provide validation of a real-time sensor that has the potential to improve PDT treatment outcomes. PDT is a growing and promising modality, and the results of this project will not only provide important data that could improve treatment outcomes, but also facilitate FDA approval of the device so it would be available to more researchers with the goal of advancing PDT.",

The new generation seismometer will use improved electrochemical transducers built into three similar orthogonally mounted sensors, the latter based on conceptually new design ideas that, when implemented, will result in a drastic increase in signal to noise ratio.  The project will present the principles of operation and detailed noise analysis of electrochemical motion sensors along with the explanation of how such major noise reduction can and will be achieved.  At each developmental milestone, prototype instruments will be vault-tested side-by-side with Strekeisen STS2 seismometers.  The complete digital seismometer is expected to consume less than 750mW.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Domestic violence is a pervasive problem in our society that impacts women and their families as well as the multiple social institutions and agencies that must grapple with its effects: Child Welfare, Mental Health, La\nw Enforcement, and Domestic Violence. Women who are abused are likely to find themselves in a pattern of revictimization, endangering not just themselves but their children as well. The Polaris DV-MH system will help providers' better coordinate their trea\ntment strategies as they work with women and their families to establish a safe home, improve well-being, and reduce the risk of revictimization. Polaris DV-MH is a computer-supported assessment system designed to address long-term mental health and functi\noning issues that are a result of exposure to trauma. The system is intended for use by domestic violence agencies and other providers who treat abused women. It will enable interagency treatment team members (from physicians to legal advocates to child we\nlfare and domestic violence case workers) to access case information useful in monitoring recovery from co-morbid mental health problems and abuse. Women will complete assessments on the Internet using HIPAA compliant software; once finished, a clinical re\nport is automatically generated for immediate use in the treatment process. Polaris DV-MH reports are used to improve the detection of prior abuse, co-morbid mental health problems, and a woman's compensating strengths that move her and her family towards \nimproved resilience. It will improve the ability for all agencies to detect factors associated with revictimization as well as the subtle changes in relational schema that will help the woman avoid revictimization in future relationships. Polaris DV-MH wil\nl contribute to the safety and well-being of women and their children by the assessment of mental health co-morbidity as well as relational schema associated with future revictimization. The Phase II specific aims are to: (1) enhance the DV-MH Update Repor\nt to include indicators associated with revictimization; 2) modify software to administer update assessments in English and Spanish; (3) build an algorithm to detect inauthentic responses in abused women, (4) develop predictive models for revictimization, \n(5) develop automated aggregate data access and reports, (6) write implementation and system documentation and (7) generate web-accessible provider training materials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Polaris DV-MH will contribute to the safety and well-being of w\nomen and their children by the assessment of mental health co-morbidity as well as relational schema associated with future revictimization. Polaris DV-MH will provide multi-agency domestic violence professionals with reports documenting progress in changi\nng high- risk attitudes, behaviors, and the relational schema to self and others that put a woman and her children at further risk for violence. It will also provide treatment teams with information relating to co-morbid mental health conditions that impac\nt the woman's rate of recovery from abuse as well as information about her readiness to change relational patterns. It will improve the quality and coordination of services provided by providers seeking to support women in their long-term recovery from abu\nse, to develop compensating resources to effectively care for themselves and any children who are also dealing with the impact of abuse. Key components of Polaris DV-MH include: (1) focusing on the common cross-agency goal of preventing revictimization; (2\n) streamlining interagency communication; and (3) emphasizing women's empowerment and resilience from abuse. Polaris DV-MH is designed to support domestic violence professionals as they: (1) decide if mental health intervention is warranted; (2) decide if \nthe woman is in immediate danger from the abuser; (3) assess the woman's strengths that may be useful in treatment planning; (4) assess factors related to v",

        "abstract": "This proposal provides for an enhancement of the Phase I core curriculum to include information on specific sociodemographic groups (women, minorities, elders, juveniles), issues relevant to myriad legal practice settings (domestic violence), and those suicides which leave a wake of pain and suffering for communities and families, murder-suicides. Furthermore, the curriculum will address the ethical conflicts suicide and mental health awareness presents attorneys in their case deliberations. As such, the curriculum will target attorneys and administrative law clerks (as a secondary means of also reaching judges) and pretrial services staff in the criminal and civil court systems. The final curriculum will be packaged into both an instructor-led continuing legal education (CLE) program and a web-based CLE program. Since CLE credits are a requirement of all new and experienced attorneys in 41 states, including mandatory credits in the ethics and professionalism topic area in many states, this commercial mechanism has the potential to reach the target population through multiple modalities at a national level. Goals for participants in the Phase II curriculum include the ability to: Recognize the symptomatic and behavioral indicators of suicide risk Accurately identify individuals \"at-risk\" for suicide based on this knowledge, applying behavioraland situational indicators to assist in making this determination Make appropriate and judicious referrals to qualified mental health personnel for screening andassessment of those individuals identified as being \"at-risk\" for suicide Understand the ethical issues present when confronted with possible suicide risk Recognize additional needs and considerations when dealing with special situations such as domestic violence and murder-suicide A rigorous research evaluation of the enhanced core curriculum and its modular components, including two Beta-1 and six Beta-2 national multi-site pilot tests, will be conducted. For both sets of tests, evaluation plans have been developed to assess the impact and effectiveness of the training, selection methodology, and diversity within the composition of training participants. In addition, the final curriculum will be integrated into existing curricula in law schools and a learning transfer evaluation at three test sites, similar to the Beta Test evaluation, will also be conducted. The law school implementation and evaluation is included as a method by which emerging professionals in the criminal and civil court systems may be targeted for early training prior to their entry into the court system. To build community capacity to further evaluate the effectiveness of such prevention efforts beyond the scope of the Phase II effort, this proposal also includes a community-based participatory research capacity strategy that piggy-backs on an already existing NIMH-funded initiative to enhance the quality and number of junior research faculty who focus on suicide. This R25 grant will dedicate two suicide research institutes to providing an opportunity for key community stakeholders to partner with academicians to assess the impact of suicide prevention in their communities across broad nontraditional mental health strategies. The proposed Phase II project is one that has the potential for having a significant national impact. The potential for this project to have a significant impact on public health is paramount, as is its potential to act as a vehicle for creating, facilitating and integrating successful community partnerships .",

        "abstract": "Component failures resulting from degradation within insulation systems represents a significant contribution to reliability and cost issues facing the nuclear power industry.  For example, the Electric Power Research Institute found that 37% of motor failures were due to winding failures, many of which involve failure of the insulation system.  Although a number of visual, tactile, or electrical tests exist for detecting and locating insulation problems, current methods are complex and expensive, and require considerable expertise, or they are subjective and require shutdowns and/or disassembly.  This project will develop a new sensing technology, called AgeAlert, which will provide the first direct measurement of insulation degradation, both in situ and in real time.  In this approach, a tiny low-cost sensor \u00c2\u00bf installed in the windings of a motor, generator, or transformer \u00c2\u00bf responds to actual environmental conditions in the motor and accurately correlates to insulation degradation.  Because AgeAlert sensors are conductive composites made with the same insulation resin of the insulation being monitored, the sensors respond in exactly the same manner, and under exactly the same conditions, as the insulation itself.  Phase I developed prototype AgeAlert sensors and demonstrated feasibility by accurately tracking the insulation in a reactor coolant pump motor.  In Phase II, expanded aging trials will be conducted on additional insulation systems in thermal, radiation, and humidity environments.  The prototype sensor will be tested in a realistic nuclear component test bed, and an integrated system design will be completed for the incorporation of AgeAlert sensors in plant-wide condition-monitoring systems.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The AgeAlert technology should reduce the cost of screening individual electrical components for insulation deterioration and provide advance warning of insulation degradation.  In addition to the application to the nuclear power industry, the sensors should be applicable to degradation monitoring of virtually any polymeric material, opening possibilities for use in wire and cable systems, seals and gaskets, hybrid automobile motor/generators, tires, belts, and aerospace composite structures.",

        "abstract": "This Phase II SBIR research develops innovative nanotechnology to allow the use of bioplastics for food packaging. Polylactic acid (PLA) is an environmentally beneficial bioplastic made from renewable resources; however, the properties of PLA are limited.  This makes it unsuited for use in microwaveable food packaging. In Phase I, university expertise resulting from earlier NSF funding was used to formulate a bioplastic with suitable properties, including cost. In Phase II, a viable manufacturing route towards food packing trays will be demonstrated at the pilot plant level working in close collaboration with a large industrial manufacturing partner.  The broader impacts of this Phase II SBIR research will be manifold. The new bioplastics are quantitatively more environmentally benign that petroplastics. Bioplastics are made form renewable resources and therefore simultaneously help decrease dependence on foreign oil while providing environmental benefits. Using a domestic biomass resource provides a competitive advantage against low labor cost manufacturers like China helping to stem job losses in the plastics industries. Presently, polystyrene is largely used for tray applications and foamed with 3-5 weight percent hydrocarbons. PLA can be foamed with carbon dioxide so the new technology has the additional benefit of displacing at least 1 million pounds per year of the pollutant volatile organic carbons (VOCs).",

        "abstract": "To provide electricity for distributed and mobile applications, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have the potential to operate with much less fuel than that used by generators based on internal combustion engines.  However, these systems also must have long life and sell for a price that is competitive with other technologies.  Conventional SOFC systems either require makeup water, an expensive logistics burden, or suffer from low durability due to the formation of carbon deposits in the system generators.  This project will develop an SOFC fuel reformer that operates at water neutral conditions and enhances the durability of the fuel cell system.  The reformer is based on a technology that has been proven effective and durable in military applications, and is inherently cost-effective enough for use in commercial applications.  In Phase I, a full-scale reformer was demonstrated, and preliminary durability tests were performed with a demonstrator solid oxide fuel cell system.  The reformer met or exceeded all performance targets.  A system containing all necessary components for stand alone operation was designed, and its subcomponents were tested at full scale conditions.  In Phase II, a stand-alone prototype reactor will be designed, fabricated, and tested with a commercial fuel cell stack for long term durability confirmation.  Component cost requirements and simplifications needed to meet commercial targets will be identified and detailed. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should help boost market opportunities for fuel cell systems, thereby greatly reducing dependence on oil resources for power generation and transportation, while substantially cutting emissions.  Specific applications could include distributed home electric power generation and heavy truck auxiliary power units.",

        "abstract": "Isobutene/olefin alkylation is a major refinery process in which light hydrocarbons (isobutene and, mainly, C3 and C4 olefins) are converted to a high octane gasoline feedstock.  Alkylate currently accounts for a key fraction of the total U.S. gasoline pool; in fact, concerns over emissions have led to an interest in increasing the amount of alkylate used in gasoline.  However, environmental and safety concerns present a barrier to this increase, as current processes for alkylate production employ hazardous liquid acids.  As yet, a practical process based on solid catalysts has not been identified \u00c2\u00bf conventional fixed bed processes have faced rapid catalyst aging and downtime for regeneration.  This project will develop a novel reactor approach to solid-catalyzed isobutene/olefin alkylation in which olefin polymerization at the catalytic surface is limited, thereby avoiding the primary issue with solid catalyzed alkylation.  Moreover, the proposed approach offers the potential for higher quality alkylate.  Phase I demonstrated the validity of the system to limit olefin polymerization, produced high quality alkylate via the reaction of isobutene with 2-butene, defined the basic parameters of the system (including coatings, reactor configuration and operating conditions), and documented stable operation over a 100-hour test run.  In collaboration with a major petroleum refiner, Phase II will optimize the reactor configuration (geometry and catalyst selection) and operating conditions (feed rates/ratio, system temperature, and system pressure), and demonstrate long-term life (high productivity of high octane product for 1000+ hours of continuous operation).  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as by the awardee:  The replacement of liquid-acid-based HF and sulfuric acid processes with solid catalyst process should improve yield, eliminate environmental and safety complications, simplify plant design (e.g., by avoiding acids handling and refrigeration steps), reduce capital costs, and reduce energy consumption and operating costs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An estimated 18.2 million people (6.3 percent of the population) in the United States have diabetes; 90 to 95 percent of all diagnosed cases are type II diabetes (NIDDK, 2005). The search for new and more effective ther\napies to address the growing number of Americans with type II diabetes and related conditions is currently hindered by the lack of a research animal model that closely resembles the human diabetic condition. All rat models currently available commercially,\n related to metabolic syndrome and overt type II diabetes, have a genetic defect in leptin-receptor. On the contrary, leptin and leptin-receptor defects are not common causes for the etiology of obesity and diabetes in the human population. A rat model wit\nhout this defect would more closely resemble the human condition and thus be more appropriate for the study of diabetic-related conditions and metabolic syndrome. PreClinOmics (PCO) has begun to develop a new rat model without leptin/leptin-receptor defect\ns by crossing a selected rat model with the propensity to develop diabetes with a model that has the propensity to develop obesity. The long-term goal of this project is to create a rat model that will be accepted by biotech and pharmaceutical industries, \nand the research community to advance the study and development of type II diabetic therapies in humans. PCO achieved and exceeded its specific aims in Phase I of this project. Phase II will focus on the continued development, defining, characterization an\nd utility of the new diabetic rat model.         This project has six specific aims: 1) Continue selective breeding and utilize genetic monitoring to achieve genetic and phenotypic homogeneity. 2) Use dietary manipulation to modify obesity, other character\nistics of  metabolic syndrome  and the age of onset and synchronization of the onset of diabetes. 3) Test therapeutic compounds for the prevention and treatment of obesity and diabetes. 4) Evaluate the time of appearance and levels of known markers and end\npoints of obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. 5) Evaluate leptin tolerance. 6) Collaborate with University and pharmaceutical partners to generate interest, independent data and publications. A strong commercial market exists for this new rat model; \ndrug developers including Eli Lilly and Company, Glaxo Smith Kline, and others PCO has met with have already expressed a strong interest in establishing collaborative arrangements and eventually purchase agreements.        Project Narrative: Current commer\ncially available animal models that are used for obesity and diabetes research and drug development have genetic defects that cause obesity. These defects are not found in the typical obese and diabetic individuals where polygenetic genes seem to be respon\nsible for the condition. The purpose of this project is to develop and produce a new animal model that has polygenetic obesity (does not have a leptin or leptin receptor defect) which develops into diabetes. This should be a very important model to develop\n drugs that will control obesity and adult onset diabetes.",

Upon removal of their primary stage I-III operable tumors, breast cancer patients must decide whether or not to receive adjuvant therapy such as chemotherapy, or hormone therapy.  Currently, the physician and patient can arrive at the decision by relying on several published guidelines whose accuracy is limited by the fact that they are based on general clinicopathologic data such as tumor size and grade.  Thus the majority of patients are recommended to receive adjuvant therapy, although only a small fraction of them benefit from it.  Availability of a set of reliable markers that can predict recurrence of tumors would allow tailoring of adjuvant therapy for each patient and is thus likely to reduce the chances of under-treatment and over-treatment.

Comparative profiling of disease-relevant species will lead to a marketable product - \nthe PPM Cardiovascular Health and Wellness Report. Molecular profiling is accomplished using novel IMS-MS instrumentation and a three-minute analysis pioneered by PPM in Phase I work. Very short experimental timescales are required to analyze the large num\nber of individuals necessary to obtain statistically relevant healthy and disease profiles. To accomplish this, PPM has selected a highly innovative approach in combining targeted proteomics with IMS-MS techniques. Here PPM will target low- abundance prote\nins using extensive abundant protein depletion as well as the immunoaffinity selection of the apolipoprotein family of proteins. It is important to note that this approach is distinguished from other immunoaffinity selection approaches in that a high-level\n of sample complexity is retained after sample workup. This is possible because of the reduction in spectral congestion associated with the analytical instrumentation to be used. Innovation thus lies in the marriage of the lowered-selectivity sample prepar\nation to the instrumentation capable of managing the moderately complex sample. The end result of the comparative profiling studies is a Cardiovascular Health and Wellness Report to be provided to patients and their physicians. The significance of the Phas\ne II work is difficult to understate. Nearly a quarter of the US population has some manifestation of cardiovascular disease. The generation of a tool that not only allows patients to track their cardiovascular health but also prompts them to do so because\n of its simplicity and attractiveness is highly needed. Additionally, it is important to note that PPM will extend the Cardiovascular Health and Wellness Report to a Cardiovascular Health and Wellness Plan. Here individuals would purchase a subscription to\n the Health and Wellness Report where they would periodically monitor their progress. During this phase of business development, the Cardiovascular Health and Wellness Report will be linked to medical information associated with proper cardiovascular care.\n Individuals deficient in one or more areas as determined by the Cardiovascular Health and Wellness Report would be prompted to improve their lifestyle.

Anomalies of mitochondrial physiology have b\neen implicated in a range of disorders, including stroke, heart disease, diabetes, obesity and ageing.  Mitochondria are increasingly popular targets in modern studies. In addition to their importance as potential drug targets, functional mitochondrial iso\nlates could be crucial in high-throughput drug screening. Pressure Cycling Technology (PCT) uses controlled hydrostatic pressure pulses to disrupt membranes and release cellular components. The feasibility experiments in Phase I, demonstrated that alternat\ning pressure can be    used to disrupt parts of the cellular structure while leaving others intact. These selective effects of PCT are based on the target's reaction to rapid changes in pressure. It has been shown that fine tuning of PCT parameters can be \nused to isolate subcellular structures with a level of control and reproducibility that is superior to that of traditional methods. Subcellular proteomic profiling can be complementary to studies that often focus on intact cells or whole cell lysates. By r\neducing the complexity of intact cells or tissues, the isolation, fractionation and concentration of subcellular components according to their cellular localization can be very useful in the quest for low abundance protein biomarkers. This Phase II SBIR pr\noject is designed to develop a robust platform technology that will facilitate the isolation of intact and biologically functional subcellular components for biomarker research, diagnostics and drug discovery. Our initial effort will be placed in a develop\nment of the advanced PCT sample preparation system for on-demand isolation of intact mitochondria from cultured cells and tissues. Functional mitochondria as well as other organelles of significance will be extracted using this system. Optimization studies\n of PCT methods will be carried out to maximize yield and integrity of mitochondria from a set of clinically relevant tissue types - liver, lung, brain, heart, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. It is anticipated that, once the cells are ruptured by PCT, \nsubcellular components in additional to mitochondria, such as nuclei or membrane fractions, may be isolated efficiently by slight modification of the protocols optimized for mitochondrial extraction. Furthermore, A PCT-based sub-mitochondrial fractionation\n methods will be studied for the enrichment of low abundance proteins localized in specific mitochondrial compartments.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It has been become commonplace in the last few years for health plans to determine the quality of care provided by their physicians by evaluating the contents of electronic claims data records. Physician-ordered service\ns contained in the records are compared with those recommended in established guidelines of care for particular ailments, and physicians are informed of their compliance with these guidelines in an effort to improve treatment practices. This approach has p\nroved itself very successful in the adult health arena, with a variety of organizations constructing sets of  indicators  or  measures  to rate care quality. Each measure is essentially a set of standards that apply a specific ailment, and can be implement\ned in software to evaluate the total number of case of the ailment and its compliance rate.  But such an approach has not yet gained widespread use in the pediatric community. This is largely due to the lack of available measure sets specific to the condit\nions of children and adolescents. To help rectify this situation a set of forty to fifty measures will be developed covering a wide variety of pediatric conditions. An expert panel of pediatric generalists and specialists will be consulted in conjunction w\nith established treatment guidelines to ensure correct and effective measure development. This set will be thoroughly tested on actual claims data to ensure optimal measure performance. The panel will be informed of the results of the testing and the proce\nss will be iterated until the set is honed to a level sufficient to provide accurate evaluation of pediatric care quality when using real claims data. Various methods of reporting the results of measure compliance to physicians will next be developed in co\nnsultation with industry leaders in health care. Once this is completed the measure set along with the software required to properly operate it will be marketed under software license. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is relevant to the current public\n need for improvement in pediatric health care. It is furthermore relevant to the National Institutes of Health's call for closing the gap between research and practice.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Systemic AA Amyloidosis is characterized by the accumulation of insoluble fibril deposits containing the AA amyloid protein in different organs throughout the body including heart, kidney, liver, spleen, lungs, skin and\n gastrointestinal tract, whereby such amyloid fibril accumulation leads to pronounced organ dysfunction. Systemic AA amyloidosis is associated mostly with chronic inflammatory disorders and includes patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteomyelitis, ankylo\nsing spondylitis, inflammatory bowl disease, tuberculosis, leprosy, Hodgkin's disease, renal cell carcinoma, and Familial Mediterranean Fever. The consequences of fibrillar AA amyloid deposition in systemic organs are usually fatal to patients, with most p\natients dying within 3-7 years from disease onset due to kidney or heart failure. Currently there is no effective cure treatment for AA amyloidosis and a new therapeutic is desperately needed for the ~100,000 cases currently in the USA. In our completed Ph\nase I SBIR studies we designed, synthesized and tested our own unique library of small molecule compounds (representing new chemical entities) for inhibition of AA amyloidosis both in vitro and in vivo. Using a variety of in vitro screening methods to iden\ntify specific potent inhibitors of AA amyloidosis, we discovered that a number of our small molecule compounds markedly disrupted/inhibited SAA/AA amyloid fibrils in vitro. Using a relevant animal mouse model of experimental AA amyloidosis we now have iden\ntified 2 lead compounds (i.e. PTI-19 and 51) that remarkably inhibit AA amyloid deposition in tissues (i.e. spleen, liver and kidney) by gt50-60% following oral administration. PTI-19 and 51 represent new chemical entities and our established synthetic rou\ntes for the repeated production of each of these compounds demonstrate a pure product (gt98% purity) that consists of only 1 compound and 1 stereoisomer [(as determined by detailed analysis including HPLC/mass spec, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, DEPT, and x-ray crystal\nlography (for PTI-19)]. These studies suggest that these small molecule lead compounds show great promise for the development of new effective treatments for systemic AA amyloidosis and warrant further investigation as described in this Phase II SBIR proje\nct. In proposed Phase II studies we will work with two world class organic chemists and optimize, test and further develop these small molecule compounds (including our 2 lead compounds) that we anticipate will inhibit/retard and cause a clearance of aggre\ngated/fibrillar AA amyloid deposits in humans. In vitro testing against human AA amyloid fibrils will include newly designed analogs optimized for oral bioavailability and enhanced PK characteristics, while maintaining non-toxicity and potent efficacy. Con\nfirmation of each final product synthesized and the possible existence of stereoisomers will be determined using 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and DEPT. X-ray crystallography will also be used for promising lead compounds in which absolute determination of stereochemist\nry cannot be fully verified by NMR. Oral administration and time-dependent efficacy for prevention, reduction and clearance of AA amyloid deposits in systemic organs will be assessed using two experimental AA amyloid mouse models. PK and toxicity studies w\nill help us optimize a novel small molecule compound (and its back-up) that will be developed for human clinical trials and commercialization, and that has promise to serve as a new treatment for systemic AA amyloidosis and related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH \nRELEVANCE: Systemic AA Amyloidosis is usually a fatal disease characterized by fibrillar amyloid deposition throughout the body that leads to organ dysfunction and eventually death in 3-7 years (due to kidney and/or heart failure). We have designed and dis\ncovered new small molecule compounds that effectively reduce/inhibit amyloid deposition in organs in a relevant animal model that mimics the human disease. In",

The goal of the proposal is to use an innovative behavior-dri\nven approach to psychiatric drug discovery to overcome the major limitations associated with target-driven approaches that have impeded the discovery of new and improved medications. In Phase I, we applied the SmartCube. high throughput, automated, in vivo\n discovery platform and used it to demonstrate that an efficient and powerful behavior-based system can be used as a primary screen to identify novel hits for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. That approach proved to be extremely successful as we alr\neady have identified 125 SmartCube hits. Ten of these have novel and diverse target profiles and their therapeutic potential for treating depression, psychosis, or anxiety has been confirmed in multiple standard behavioral assays. In Phase II we will demon\nstrate that SmartCube. can be used to enable behavior-driven lead optimization and use it to advance three of our most interesting and novel lead compounds to become clinical candidates. This will be accomplished by using SmartCube in combination with stat\ne of the art computational chemistry and capitalizing on the rapidly growing availability of commercial analogs. It will involve 1) thorough characterization of key in vitro and in vivo drug-like properties of these compounds including oral bioavailability\n, chronic efficacy, in vitro metabolic stability, in vitro cardiotoxicity and in vitro genotoxicity to identify properties that need to be optimized; 2) exploring the mechanism of action of the two most novel lead compounds; 2) creating a Structure Activit\ny Relationship for behavioral activity with computational tools and commercially available analogs; 3) synthesizing focused series of novel analogs predicted to have desirable drug-like properties under the guidance of experienced medicinal chemists; 4) sc\nreening these analogs in SmartCube and then demonstrating improvement in key features; and finally; 5) testing the most promising compounds in toxicity assays in order to select an Early Development Candidate (EDC).

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This SBIR project addresses an important medical need for improved, new technology-based assays for detecting autoantibodies relevant to Type 1 diabetes (T1D). T1D affects a million Americans and its incidence is incre\nasing at an alarming rate of 2 to 5% per year. In T1D, circulating autoantibodies against islet cell antigens reflect the process of autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells. Auto antibodies are clinically useful because they are present \nearly in the immune process, often years before patients develop hyperglycemia and can be used as markers to identify individuals at risk for T1D and to predict risk, particularly when autoantibodies against multiple antigens are present. Current assays, b\nased on radio immunoadsorbant (RIA) or enzyme linked immunoadsorbant assays (ELISA) methods test for one antibody per assay and are cumbersome, expensive, and some have poor inter-laboratory reproducibility. Recently, a single ELISA assay that is used to d\netect two antibodies simultaneously but cannot assign antibody specificity became available. New intervention strategies for T1D prevention depend on early detection of pre-T1D and sensitive and reliable analytical techniques are crucial. The Phase I feasi\nbility studies of a new multiplex protein microarray assay, based on our novel colloid technology to simultaneously and specifically detect three autoantibodies i.e. IAA, GAD-65 and IA-2 that are informative for T1D risk, have been very successful. In Phas\ne II, we will develop the  T1D- Autoimmunity Array Testing System  for clinical diagnostic use. The fully integrated system will include disposable assay biochips, an automated processing station that includes a low cost fluorescence reader, sample trackin\ng and analytical soft-ware. At the successful conclusion of Phase II, we will have developed protocols, procedures and the fundamentals of product specifications that will form the basis for production design of the  T1D- AutoimmunityArray Testing System  \nas a low cost, reliable, accurate testing product that meets the requirements of a broad range of clinical and research environments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Prediction of T1D through antibody testing is critical for the proper identification of at-risk \nsubjects and for risk quantification. In T1D, despite the higher risk in relatives, 90% of new cases are sporadic cases occurring in families with no prior family history. Thus, in the absence of the capability to screen populations at large, most children\n with T1D do not have the opportunity for early treatment unless they are screened because they are related to someone with the disease. Clearly, new assays with a better cost-benefit profile are needed to extend the benefit of autoantibody testing to the \nmajority of individuals who develop T1D and other autoimmune diseases. A multiplex microarray methodology that would allow testing for numerous significant T1D autoantibodies should also allow for early identification of asymptomatic individuals and provid\ne better chances of preventing disease.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project focuses on bringing the power and benefits of artificial intelligence tutoring technology to the arena of teacher professional development (PD). The proposed innovation is a teacher professional development system built on the principles of artificial intelligence, and delivered via the Internet. Similar to a flight simulator, this technology will offer a realistic but benign opportunity to test and expand a teacher's preparedness through practice with realistic classroom situations. A key objective is the creation of a classroom simulator which incorporates a virtual master teacher, to help teachers deepen their content understanding, learn to respond to student questions more effectively, practice proven pedagogical techniques for improving student understanding and conduct self-monitoring and assessment before getting in front of a live class.  An increasing number of schools are forced to rely on new or out-of-field teachers to fill the gap for teaching science and mathematics, often resulting in a substantial decline in quality, depth and individual attention students receive. Because of the well-documented problems of teachers teaching out of their content areas, and low-performing schools having greater percentages of lesser-qualified teachers, states have established stronger criteria for in-service teachers and newly qualifying pre-service teachers. Middle and high school\nscience and mathematics are the areas where most out-of-area teaching is occurring. In the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) report, 'The Condition of Education', a key finding is that high school students in high-poverty, high-minority schools were more often taught science, mathematics and English courses by out-of-field teachers than their peers in low-poverty, low-minority schools. This research is expected to impact these issues and in addition address the goals of the American Competitiveness Initiative and the requirements for highly qualified teachers identified in the 'No Child Left Behind' initiative.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent tragedies at the Sago Mine, the Aracoma Alma Mine No. 1, and the Darby Mine No. 1 have focused renewed attention on an old problem: situational awareness in mine emergencies. Improved communication is a partial, \nbut not complete, solution to the problem. Mine emergencies often involve dense smoke and dust that impair visibility and disorient even those familiar with the mine layout. And miners overcome by carbon monoxide cannot communicate useful information to po\ntential rescuers. Location awareness is an important aspect of the overall problem of situational awareness. In too many cases, mine fatalities might have been avoided if rescuers knew the location of trapped or disabled miners. The more quickly a rescue t\neam can reach miners at risk, the more likely the rescue operation will be successful. Currently, there is no technology capable of determining the precise location of underground miners with reasonable accuracy and cost. The principal benefit of the propo\nsed effort lies in bringing to fruition a technology that can provide critically needed location information and thus aid in rescuing miners in emergency situations. Q-Track is the pioneer in Near-Field Electromagnetic Ranging or  NFER(R)  technology. NFER\n(R) systems operate in the MF band under Part 15 limits as low-power unlicensed transmitters. By using relatively low frequency, long wavelength transmissions, NFER(R) signals can propagate in complicated industrial environments with minimal impact from mu\nltipath. Furthermore, because these systems operate in the near-field zone, they have available much more tracking information than comparable high frequency or microwave systems. The specific aim of the Phase II effort is to develop prototype NFER(R) syst\nems for wireless location in mines. The anticipated outcome of the proposed Phase II effort will be a prototype miner tracking system with the following characteristics: Range: gt400m Accuracy: 10m or better Support for integration of sensors and transmiss\nion of low data rate telemetry.  Public Health Relevance: Miners are not the only workers in dangerous environments who would benefit from location information. Soldiers, nuclear and chemical workers, and emergency responders all face comparable dangers an\nd would all be helped by the availability of location data. By sponsoring the proposed effort, NIOSH will not only promote miner safety but also promote worker safety in a wide variety of secondary industries.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to delineate the ex vivo serum-free culture conditions to expand CD34+ cells derived from cryopreserved umbilical cord blood cells to levels that will support its use in the adult transplant setting. The disadvantage of umbilical cord blood for adult transplants has been attributed to having too few long-term engrafting cells/hematopoietic stem cells in the cord blood. Studies presented herein suggest that this problem can be circumvented based on 1) the development of a clinical grade serum-free medium designated especially for the ex vivo expansion of CD 34+ cells derived from cord blood, 2) the successful expansion of CD 34+ cells from cryopreserved umbilical cord blood to levels adequate to support adult transplantation using the clinical grade serum-free medium with the early acting cytokines, Flt-3 ligand, stem cell factor, thrombopoietin, and Interleukin 6, and 3) the ability of these ex vivo cultured CD 34+ cells to engraft long-term in the fetal sheep model for human hematopoiesis. The Phase I milestone will be to repeat and extended these initial studies and assess the long-term engrafting ability of these cultured CD 34+ cells in increased numbers of animals and evaluate longer culture periods. These critical results will form the basis of the Phase II proposal to determine if 1) the long-term engrafting cells are being expanded or maintained under these ex vivo serum-free culture conditions, 2) define the optimal culture period yielding high quality long-term engrafting cells, and 3) evaluate other cytokines in combination with the above cytokine platform. The ability to expand the long-term engrafting cells would be invaluable in the adult transplant setting. The efforts from this proposal will yield clinically relevant data on the optimal conditions necessary for use of cryopreserved cord blood for adult transplantation. . The products derived form this proposal will support the ex vivo culture of CD34+ cells derived from cryopreserved umbilical cord blood and the maintenance of these cells ability to engraft long-term. Since cord blood has few long-term engrafting cells /hematopoietic stem cells it can only be used for infant transplantation, not adult transplantation. The ability to develop a serum-free clinical grade culture system that will support the expansion of the long-term engrafting cells will facilitate the clinical use of these cells in adult transplants.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability of plants to be used as factories for the production of biopharmaceuticals has the potential to dramatically cut costs of production of many current biotherapeutics and will encourage development of new drug\ns and vaccines that can be genetically inserted into the genome of certain plants. Production via plants by growing biomass from plants that are genetically engineered to carry a specific biopharma product will allow for a fast and cost-effective multiplic\nation of drugs that can be delivered to consumers at a substantial discount, and will allow numerous other advantages from current production methods. A significant roadblock to the production of plant-made-pharmaceuticals is the fact that plant materials \ncontaining a pharmaceutical gene could escape into the wild and genetically contaminate the food chain. To prevent escape of transgenic materials strict regulations have been put into effect by government agencies as a matter of oversight. In fact, it is n\not actually possible, nor is it practical to grow a crop of pharmaceutical plants in a farm production field, consequently, the need to produce pharmaceutical crops in fully controlled containment facilities that accommodate zero-tolerance regulations are \nnow a necessity for entry into the plant biomanufacturing business and a biomanufacturing system to address these problems is a focus of this SBIR. In the current application we provide an example of a plant-made-pharmaceutical (recombinant hepatitis B vac\ncine) that we propose to take all the way from large scale controlled containment growth, secondary processing to provide stable shelf life and a human clinical trial in healthy adult volunteers. The award of the Phase I SBIR allowed us to establish the bi\nomanufacturing baseline for measuring the antigen production levels of several HBsAg varieties of potato, for selection for highest antigen yield and increased production levels of the plant biomass. The plant production system being tested was developed b\ny the SBIR Company, Quantum Tubers Corporation, and provides up to six crops per year in a computer controlled, modular system designed for biomanufacturing of potato plants. The QT Biomanufacturing System can provide as much as 36:1 production advantage o\nver a seasonal greenhouse of the same size, and will provide exact and reproducible growing conditions to increase recombinant hepatitis B vaccine production in a GMP manufacturing environment. The Phase II SBIR application necessarily combines the logical\n path of progression for documentation of the QT Biomanufacturing System technology combined with the production of hepatitis B vaccine-bearing potatoes, verification of their vaccination potential through a Phase I Clinical Trial of the hepatitis B vaccin\ne produced from the transgenic potato plant, and then the secondary processing of the raw biomass into a stable oral dose. The specific aims of the Phase II SBIR are : A) To quantify the economic production parameters providing for a best growing time vs. \nyield scenario for growing plant-derived hepatitis B vaccine using the QT Biomanufacturing System. B) To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of orally delivered HBsAg that is formulated as an expressed protein in transgenic potato tubers \n(HBV-EPV) administered with a mucosal adjuvant to healthy adult subjects who have evidence of immunity to hepatitis B derived from previous immunization with licensed recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. C) To determine through RandD the most effective seconda\nry processing system for potato leaf and tuber biomass to provide for the formulation of a shelf-stable, oral dosage of (HBsAg) hepatitis B vaccine and to evaluate in a preclinical model the in vivo immunogenicity of the processed material.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The current state of the art of in silico drug discovery relies almost exclusively on molecular mechanics force fields, such as AMBER, and empirical potentials. It is well known that while these approaches are excellent for certain applications, they have thus far proven less then satisfactory for thorough understanding the interactions of enzyme-inhibitor systems. To address these issues, our linear scaling, quantum mechanics (QM) algorithm will be applied in the Phase I effort to further research, transfer, and validate a QM-based tool to derive the pairwise energy decomposition (PWD) between a set of targets and a large population of inhibitors. Further, the multifaceted workflow of this process will be fully explored with the Discovery Machine (DM) platform in order to set the groundwork for continued development and to begin to address the ease of use concerns with this level of theory. In the Phase II effort, this PWD technology, along with our proprietary QMScore technology, will be developed as an InteractionProfiler tool and validated against a number of structures by leveraging new industry collaborations. We will also develop the client/server software and database backend necessary to properly exploit these powerful QM tools in an industrial or a government setting. DM will continue to play a significant roll in this process, and the ultimate goal of this fast track SBIR will be an intelligent and adaptive system for QM-based drug discovery with the capability of expanding the user's understanding of the types and strengths of enzyme-inhibitor interactions that play an important roll in the user's in silico drug discovery efforts.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac Synchronization Technology (CST) will provide external chest compressions synchronized with the weak residual mechanical heart action present in Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA) cardiac arrest, and will resul\nt in higher systemic blood perfusion pressures and improved outcomes for PEA cardiac arrest patients receiving CPR. CST uses innovations in digital signal processing of ECG signals to control automated CPR compression devices and enable chest compressions \nsynchronized within 10 milliseconds of the residual central pressure pulse, providing an improved resuscitation therapy for pulseless cardiac arrest. Phase I work successfully demonstrated that synchronized compressions provide up to 110% increase in coron\nary perfusion pressure (CPP), and indicated that even correctly synced compressions resulted in 46% lower CPP if given after out-of-phase compressions. Phase II work will develop next generation digital circuitry and algorithms in a CST prototype device fo\nr controlling the timing of chest compressions in a pre-clinical animal study. CST will provide an accurate trigger signal to automated CPR life support compression devices, such that the compressions are precisely synchronized to the aortic pressure pulse\n. Phase II development includes a novel method of using ECG data to predict the aortic pulse arrival time and feedback control mechanisms that enable CST to be integrated with automated compression devices and AED's for use by pre-hospital Emergency Medica\nl Service personnel. Specific goals of this project are to demonstrate CST can synchronize cardiac compressions to real-time ECG data with five millisecond accuracy; demonstrate CST can adjust for physiological differences in the aortic pulse arrival time;\n demonstrate feedback signals from external Doppler ultrasound sensors and accelerometers can improve compression timing; integrate CST with a commercial automated CPR resuscitation device; demonstrate increased coronary perfusion pressure and cerebral per\nfusion pressure of synchronized compressions; and demonstrate improved Return Of Spontaneous Circulation and short term survivability with CST compressions versus current standard clinical practice asynchronous CPR. In Phase II development, a CST prototype\n will be designed, built and tested. Knowledge will be obtained of the effectiveness of this new technology and how to integrate it into existing resuscitation devices. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE: Each year approximately 340,000 people die from sudden cardiac\n death in the United States alone, with estimates of costs for failed treatment and lost productive years of life over  400 billion per year. While other areas of medicine have experienced significant reductions in mortality, little progress has been made \nin resuscitation medicine where the rate for successful resuscitation of cardiac arrest patients using CPR is quite low, and in particular, there are no truly effective resuscitation methods for patients with pulseless electrical activity (PEA) cardiac arr\nest. Cardiac Synchronization Technology (CST) aims to increase survival rates for patients experiencing PEA, using advanced circuitry, signal processing and algorithms to synchronize automated life support devices to the residual heart rhythm and aortic pr\nessure pulse. Especially for the aging U.S. population, where cardiac arrest is a major health issue and cause of death, improvements in resuscitation techniques could have tremendous societal, economic and personal benefits.",

The knowledge of the longitudinal profile and bunch length of the short pulses is necessary for performance optimization and benchmarking to computational models.  Thus, in order to achieve successful beam operation, it will be essential to measure these short pulses in a single-shot, in real time, and with sub-picosecond time resolution.  This project will develop a real-time bunch-length interferometer utilizing a novel beam autocorrelation technique.  In this approach, the interference of the beam with itself takes place on the plane of a terahertz detector array; the spatial interference is correlated to the horizontal position along the array.  Phase I consisted of theoretical calculations and modeling of coherent radiation sources typical of accelerator facilities, and the design of an interferometer scheme efficient in the terahertz regime.  Laboratory testing and a detector survey also were conducted.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The real-time interferometer would be of great use to the accelerator community.  In addition, the real time interferometer could be incorporated into a feedback loop to lock the bunch length of the beam, thus guaranteeing consistent parameter sets for Free Electron Laser, Compton Scattering, and collider facilities.

Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis is the most economically promising method of converting coal into transportation fuels.  Although the FT process is run on a commercial scale in both South Africa and Malaysia, three significant challenges remain:  (1) the attrition resistance of the catalyst, (2) difficulties in separating the catalyst from the hydrocarbon wax products, and (3) an inability to carry out the water-gas-shift conversion and FT synthesis in the same unit.  This project will develop a unique catalytic material that can address all three technical challenges.  In Phase I, a highly active catalyst for the both the Fischer-Tropsch and water-gas-shift synthesis reactions was developed.  By selecting the right promoters, a CO-rich coal-derived synthesis gas was converted into a desired molecular weight hydrocarbon wax product with great efficiency.  Sorbent life was demonstrated in a long-term test under representative conditions, and a preliminary analysis demonstrated the economic viability of the process.  In Phase II, catalyst performance will be improved, and production will be scaled-up using commercial manufacturing techniques.  A prototype test unit will be designed and fabricated to demonstrate the concept at a larger scale.  Finally, a detailed system analysis and engineering assessment will be conducted to fully quantify the benefits of the new technology.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A viable alternative to crude oil is needed to moderate the effect of oil price hikes and provide an interim bridge until some other fuel source can commercially supplant petroleum-based fuels.

Unfortunately, many Western Hemisphere crudes are highly aromatic and contain more metals and sulfur than the light crudes that are currently processed in refineries.

This project will develop a new catalytic additive that can be used during normal FCC operations to (1) increase the conversion of the high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons (bottoms) found in heavy FCC feedstocks into valuable products; and (2) simultaneously lower the vapor pressure of the FCC gasoline stream, so that, when blended with ethanol, the FCC gasoline can meet the vapor pressure specifications for reformulated gasoline.

        "abstract": "Biodiesel does not contribute to global warming, is non-toxic and reduces our nation's dependence on foreign oil while promoting economic opportunities for agriculturally related communities in rural America. However, the process of extracting and purifying the crude or recycled oils adds significantly to the cost of the fuel. What is needed is a new biodiesel production process that can tolerate crude, unrefined oil or waste oils and fats and produce ASTM grade biodiesel. This would significantly reduce the cost of biodiesel. The current biodiesel industry is limited in size because the production processes requires a highly refined (expensive) vegetable oil, and the cost of biodiesel is almost entirely determined by the cost of the feedstock. Furthermore there is a limited supply of vegetable oil in excess of what is needed for food and animal feed. TDA Research has identified a new process that should expand the possible biodiesel output, utilizing any oil or fat feedstock including pure refined oils and less expensive grades that contain moderate or even very high levels of free fatty acid.

        "abstract": "The off-gases from various refinery operations could be converted into valuable chemicals, such as hydrogen, instead of being sent to flare, where they contribute to energy loses and greenhouse gas emissions.  However, refinery off-gases contain large concentrations of sulfur and other impurities.  Before these gases can be converted to hydrogen, sulfur and other impurities must be removed to prevent poisoning of the reforming catalysts used in the conversion process.  Traditionally, desulfurization has been achieved by a two-step process consisting of hydro desulfurization (HDS) and subsequent removal of H2S with an expendable chemical absorbent.  Although this approach has long been used for the desulfurization of natural gas feed stocks (where the sulfur level does not exceed 5-10 ppmv), its utility for use with high sulfur off-gases is cost prohibitive.  This project will develop a novel physical adsorbent to desulfurize refinery off-gases.  The sorbent, which will be operated either in an expendable or regenerable manner, operates at near ambient temperatures (20-60oC) and reduces the sulfur content of the gas stream to ppb levels, thereby protecting the catalyst used in the downstream conversion process.  Unlike conventional sorbents, the material removes not only H2S but also organic sulfur compounds (such as mercaptans, sulfides and thiophenes) with high capacity and higher removal efficiency.  Phase I (1) developed low cost, regenerable sorbents that can remove sulfur compounds from refinery off-gases with very high capacity; (2) demonstrated that the regenerable sorbent maintains its capacity for over 20 absorption/regeneration cycles; and (3) established the potential for the cost-effective production of hydrogen from sulfur-contaminated refinery off-gas streams.  Phase II will improve sorbent performance, scale-up its production using commercial manufacturing techniques, design and fabricate a prototype test unit, and carry out a detailed system analysis and engineering assessment.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new sorbent technology should provide U.S. refiners with a cost-effective way to remove sulfur from refinery off-gases.  The cost of the process should be low enough to allow the resulting gases to be profitably used as a low cost feedstock for hydrogen production.  The sorbent also could be used to desulfurize any light hydrocarbon stream that is used as a feedstock for catalytic chemical conversion or as a feed for a fuel cell.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely believed that digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has the potential to replace mammography in the future, based on preliminary clinical results. At least eight companies are currently developing DBT imaging \nsystems, three of whom have little or no experience developing primary review workstations. Real-Time Tomography (RTT) has the experience to develop medical workstations. RTT is currently in the process of developing a physician review workstation for the \nprimary diagnosis of digital breast tomosynthesis images. We believe that a dedicated workstation is necessary based upon the large size of DBT datasets, the stringent image quality requirements for breast imaging, and the need for high-throughput in both \nbreast screening and diagnosis. To address the need for high-throughput, we specifically propose to develop and implement a reconstruction algorithm that will allow dynamic real-time reconstruction and rendering (DRR) of arbitrary planes through the breast\n volume on a dedicated high-end PC-based graphics processor unit (GPU). We believe that the advances in GPU technology make it both possible and preferential to reconstruct tomosynthesis images on demand. There are many reasons to favor DRR. First, the GPU\n hardware that exists today allows nearly instantaneous back-projection and filtered (BPF) reconstruction of tomographic images; this hardware is essentially off-the- shelf and readily available. Second, breast tomosynthesis datasets currently being produc\ned are anisotropic, having in-plane resolution of approximately 0.07-0.1 mm2 and out-of-plane resolution of 1 mm. This anisotropy is necessitated by the size of the resultant image set, and the time required to produce those data. However, in DBT it is pos\nsible to reconstruct images at any location; DRR would allow arbitrary reconstruction without adversely impacting either storage or speed. The long-term goal of RTT is to develop a primary review workstation based on the DRR principle. In this Phase II pro\nposal, we seek to refine our existing DBT reconstruction algorithm and filters to enhance the different clinical indications of breast cancer that is crucial for proper diagnosis. Our ultimate goal is to achieve a reconstruction rate of at least 20 frames \nper second (fps). In Phase II, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Refine our backprojection operators on a GPU using general-purpose GPU programming techniques. (2) Refine our imaging filtering methods to specifically enhance images of calcificati\nons and masses using general-purpose GPU programming techniques. (3) Develop thick-slice rendering methods and implement them on a GPU. (4) Explore methods for handling large data sets on the GPU. The University of Pennsylvania will provide assessments of \nimage quality of the image reconstructions and will provide simulated phantom images to allow optimization of the image backprojection and filtering methods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mammography (including digital mammography) is subject to a number of fun\ndamental limitations because 2D images are made of the 3D breast anatomy. Mammograms can produce false positive findings due to the superposition of normal tissues, and cancers can be missed in mammograms because normal tissue hide or mask the cancer. Digi\ntal breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a tomographic imaging method with the potential to solve both of the above problems of mammography. Tomosynthesis imaging systems are being developed by multiple manufacturers. However, as has been made clear from the ongo\ning deployment of clinical digital mammography systems, the development of the acquisition technology is only a small part of the effort that will be required to make DBT a clinical reality. We propose to develop a primary physician review workstation for \nDBT. This is an essential part of any clinical DBT system.",

Fat and oil based PCMs currently produced by the company both out-perform paraffin-based PCMs and cost less.  While customers have overwhelmingly accepted these renewable PCMs, they overwhelmingly expressed their desire that fire-retardant phase change materials be developed.  The broader impacts of this research includes the incorporation of PCMs into applications that would have impacts for both general public and the military/emergency response personnel.  Phase change materials find a range of applications, including clothing, construction materials, and food containers.  The introduction of lower-cost fire-retardant phase change materials will have broader impacts through improved utilization in consumer products.  Applications not previously pursued will be open to use of these materials because of reduced risk of fire.  When used in buildings, the phase change materials can reduce energy costs year-round.  An improved understanding of the associated fat and oil chemistry will likely find other applications in the fat and oil industries.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop the Engine Combustion Simulator (ECS), an innovative software product that will enable researchers to develop and apply accurate chemical reactions for the design, control and optimization of the automotive engine and exhaust gas after-treatment devices. The ECS will reduce the costly and time-consuming experimental testing, as well as enable the researcher to probe concepts that are difficult or infeasible to test experimentally. These developments will accelerate the development of more fuel efficient and environmentally cleaner automobiles. At the core of the ECS is a suite of advanced database technologies and computational algorithms that enable the user to easily build accurate reaction mechanisms, and quickly perform simulation studies using these mechanisms.  The broader impact/commercial potential from this technology will result in cleaner and more fuel-efficient vehicles. Even a small gain in fuel efficiency can translate to billions of savings in fuels as well as reduced dependence on foreign oil. Less fuel consumption directly scales to reduction in emissions thus lowering of greenhouse gases while improving the human health. The ECS will be made available at no-charge for use in education and research in academia and some of the key components will be made available as an open-source to the research community to foster collaboration between researchers.",

Modeling is becoming increasing important, motivated by the FDA's drive to modernize the drug discovery process and the advent of emerging fields such as Systems Biology. A broad adoption of modeling has been limited, however, because the current practice requires programming and computational skills not typically possessed by experimental researchers in biological sciences.  In the Phase II project, the tool's capabilities will be augmented by allowing users to calibrate models by including experimental data, adding innovative advanced modeling tools such as model building.  The potential commercial value of this workbench is high as the pharmaceutical industry is investing significantly in mathematical modeling and Systems Biology aiming to overcome both the high costs of drug development and the stagnation in the discovery of new drugs since the 1990's. Further, aging populations in developed countries are going to cause sharp increases in health care costs, while at the same time there are serious budgetary pressures (both from government and private insurers) to keep health care costs under control. Thus, methods that speed up the research cycle and reduce development costs for new drugs and treatments are going to become increasingly important.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term aims of the proposed project are to improve image quality during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by elimination of motion artifacts. MRI is highly susceptible to motion during scan, and the elimination of\n the motion-induced artifacts will be based on real-time motion tracking of the imaged body and the application of the tracking data to re-align the gradients of the MRI scanner, in order to compensate for motion. This new technology can have significant i\nmpact on the health care system as motion artifacts degrade image quality in about 20% of performed studies and often require repetition of the study. Furthermore, new MRI modalities like functional and diffusion MRI are severely affected by motion, and th\ne elimination of motion artifacts will facilitate their clinical use. Following feasibility demonstration during Phase I of the project, we continue into Phase II. The specific aims of the project include: A - To modify the FDA-cleared EndoScout tracking s\nystem that is clinically used in MRI-guided surgical interventions into a motion tracking system that can be interfaced with major types of diagnostic MRI scanners; B - To modify routine scan sequences of interest into motion-immune sequences by gradient r\ne-alignment using motion information supplied by the tracking system; C - To test the hypothesis that motion compensation through gradient re-alignment based on motion tracking can improve image quality in research and clinical MRI and is superior to curre\nntly used methods for motion artifact elimination. The technology will be developed through a collaboration between Robin Medical, Inc., and the Massachusetts General Hospital: Robin Medical will develop a new generation of the EndoScout tracking system th\nat can become a standard components on diagnostic MRI scanners; Dr. Van der Kouwe at the Massachusetts General Hospital will modify various research and clinical scan sequences that will be needed during human tests of the system. Following the demonstrati\non of successful motion artifact mitigation through technical testing with moving phantom, the system will be tested on volunteers and through on going research and clinical MRI human studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed motion artifact mitigatio\nn technology may reduce healthcare costs associated with the common need to repeat MRI scans that are compromised by patient motion. In addition, as many diagnostic MRI scans are degraded by motion but not repeated due to the high cost of MRI, the new tech\nnology can improve the diagnostic yield of MRI by providing higher quality images. Furthermore, the motion-immune sequences may be used with pediatric patients and reduce the need for anesthesia in some age groups of this population.",

It can find, ingest, and extract energy from biomass in the environment (and other organically-based energy sources), as well as use conventional and alternative fuels (such as gasoline, heavy fuel, kerosene, diesel, propane, coal, cooking oil, and solar) when suitable.

        "abstract": "Radio frequency (RF) heating systems are vital components of plasma fusion facilities.  The increasing scale of present and planned fusion experiments requires a similar increase of scale of RF systems, usually involving multiple RF sources. The complex controls for these systems must manage numerous fault scenarios, monitor key signals, and interconnect key power systems to provide the required  performance. At the same time, pressures of cost, space, reliability, and safety are crucial to the operation of the facility.  Modernization of RF subsystems is a necessary step in advancing towards a fusion demonstration plant.  This effort will target the transmitter protection circuits for a tokamak Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) RF system.  The specific application of the Alcator C-Mod tokamak LHCD experiment at MIT provides a convenient target of opportunity. This modernization will coincide with the upcoming expansion of their tokamak\u00c2\u00bfs LHCD system.  Under Phase I, advances in analog and programmable digital circuit design were used to greatly enhance the reliability, compactness, and safety of the transmitter protection controls.  The Phase II project will fabricate and assess a suite of first article control systems, and deliver them to the C-Mod LHCD team for installation. This design will then be generalized for future availability for fusion, high energy, phased array radar, and other customers.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The result of this effort will be a template for a modernized transmitter protection system, applicable to any multi-VED (Vacuum Electron Device) RF system for a fusion or similar facility.  The immediate beneficiary will be the Alcator C-Mod facility, which will use the upgraded transmitter protection system with the expanded LHCD system beginning in 2009.  Non-fusion applications that use multiple VED arrays (such as phased array radars) may also benefit from these results.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sepsis is a frequent and serious problem in neonatal intensive care units, particularly in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Over 20% of all VLBW infants experience one or more episodes of late-onset sepsis. Unfortunately, diagnosis by blood culture is difficult, time consuming, and lacks sensitivity. Delaying treatment until symptoms arise can be life threatening. On the other hand, recurrent treatment with antibiotics in non- infants holds potential risks to these infants by furthering the development of resistant organisms. A number of research groups are performing detailed studies of individual biomarkers that have shown altered expression in septic infants and may be relevant to the development of the condition. However, the standard method for measuring plasma or serum levels of cytokines, chemokines or other biomarkers is to measure them one at a time using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Clearly, no single molecular marker, or small group of markers, will be able to accurately classify individuals at highest risk. In addition, one-at-a-time assessment of each putative biomarker incurs considerable time, cost and sample volume. The ability to systematically identify protein profiles, predict risk of clinical events, evaluate therapeutic response, and define underlying mechanisms is thereby limited severely. The recent development of bead-based multiplex immunoassays provides an efficient approach for performing a rapid assessment of large numbers of protein antigens. Rules- Based Medicine (RBM) has extended this approach to perform Multi-Analyte Profiles (MAP) of blood proteins using very small sample volumes (10-20 fL) with a dynamic range of fg/mL to mg/mL. This technology is well suited for screening large numbers of markers in parallel to identify protein profiles associated with late-onset sepsis. During Phase I, RBM, and the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center (UNMHSC), propose to characterize the progression of protein profiles in the blood of VLBW infants with late-onset sepsis vs. normal VLBW infants over a seven day period, and identify biomarker patterns associated with late-onset sepsis that will significantly improve clinical diagnosis. In addition, a new source for obtaining a diagnostic [blood] sample will be evaluated. During Phase II, a prospective validation of the MAP identified for late-onset sepsis in VLBW infants during Phase I efforts will be performed. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for each analyte, as well as, the MAP of biomarkers for predicting late-onset sepsis will be determined. In addition, a proposed normal physiological range of MAP analytes for VLBW infants based on gestational age, birth weight and postnatal age will be developed. The identification of novel biomarker patterns of infants in the early stages of late-onset sepsis, as well as infants at high risk for developing late-onset sepsis, will allow for improved management of the condition by shortening the time course of antibiotic administration, aiding the determination of treatment effectiveness, and will provide a framework for developing and evaluating new treatments.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The blood-brain barrier (BBB) represents both a safeguard against the penetration of physiologically harmful substances into the central nervous system (CNS), as well as a considerable hurdle to the delivery of therapeu\ntic agents. A technology allowing safe, targeted, reversible opening of the BBB would potentially revolutionize both the study and treatment of CNS disorders, including neurodegenerative conditions and brain malignancies that have proven resistant to conve\nntional approaches. In Phase I studies, a low intensity directed ultrasound (LODUS) system was built and used to effectively open the BBB in nonhuman primates. In addition, methods were developed to assess penetration of macromolecules such as IgG from blo\nod. LODUS parameters were elucidated to safely open the BBB. These observations substantiated a prior incidental discovery that LODUS could enhance extravasation of MRI contrast material without evidence of injury in a human. Building on these proof of con\ncept Phase I results, the goal of Phase II is to provide substantial and compelling preclinical evidence that LODUS effectively and safely, and reversibly opens the BBB in nonhuman primates. The proposed experiments would not be possible in non-primate ani\nmal models due to anatomic limitations and poor relevance to humans or in human subjects due to cost and ethical concerns. The Specific Aims are: 1) to quantify the efficacy of LODUS by examining uptake of fluorescent dextrans of different molecular weight\ns; 2) to determine the kinetics of LODUS mediated BBB permeabilization and investigate possible mechanisms of the effect; 3) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of repeated LODUS delivery; and 4) to demonstrate that LODUS can safely deliver clinically rele\nvant macromolecules such as trastuzumab (Herceptin) to the brain parenchyma. To ensure success in this project the expertise of scientists and engineers from four organizations are being utilized. Successful completion of these Phase II studies will facili\ntate development of robust and clinically relevant protocols for the reversible opening of the BBB for research and therapeutic applications to treat neurodegenerative diseases, brain cancer and other CNS conditions. This proprietary technology will also e\nnable offering of attractive preclinical services to customers and potential partners developing CNS therapeutics and diagnostics. Blood vessels in the brain differ from those in the rest of the body in that they prevent most drugs from entering the brain.\n While this is often beneficial, it can prevent many potentially beneficial therapies from reaching their sites of action where they could successfully treat diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and brain cancer.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an interactive symbolic geometry system that integrates algebra and geometry and focuses on high school mathematics. The absence of such a system has led to a technology gap in mathematics education between the geometry year in high school and the college level calculus sequence. The result of this project will be a software system along with learning materials which fills that gap. The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) standards include the visualization of three-dimensional figures and the mapping between certain three-dimensional surfaces and their two-dimensional unfolding or projection onto the plane. To address this, the project will create a three dimensional symbolic geometry system and in the process will break new ground both from an algorithmic and a user interface perspective. The creation of geometric models dependent on discrete but possibly indeterminate parameters, for example, a  general n-gon, is an important pedagogic device for the study of the limits of geometrical figures. Such a facility poses new design and user interface challenges ranging from the definition of the general form of the dependence to the display of a geometrical figure with an indeterminate number of primitives.  This Phase II project addresses the need for solid mathematics skills required for college-bound students and for those going directly into the workforce. Specifically, this project focuses on the learning of algebra, and its linkages with geometry. To\ndate, no application exists that integrates algebra and geometry. The integration of technology itself within the learning of mathematics is one of the NCTM's six key principles of school mathematics. The project will incorporate geometrical constraints in addition to geometrical constructions and hence, unlike any other current educational system, directly address the workforce/professional requirements of a geometry system.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to distribute limited mental resources among tasks or stimuli and to efficiently shift the  internal spotlight  of attention is critical to adaptive functioning in a demanding and complicated world. The pref\nrontal regions of the human brain are critical for multiplexing attention, which is frequently impaired in neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions associated with frontal pathology. Current static  frontal executive system  task derived from tradition\nal paper and pencil neuropsychological tests have a number of limitations, foremost the inability to adapt in difficulty and provide a consistently challenging level across subjects with varying ability. This project aims to develop a dynamic, adaptive att\nention switching  stress test,  the Multiplexing Test (MT), to address the need for a modern test of this essential cognitive function. As a research and clinical assessment instrument used with or without brain function monitoring, the MT could serve as a\n standardized activation procedure for testing patients whose attentional multiplexing abilities might be diminished due to illness, medication side-effects or advancing age, and as an outcome measure in treatment efforts to ameliorate cognitive impairment\ns. Building on the achievements of projects that developed the MT for young adults and children, in Phase I we pilot tested and refined the MT for use with elderly subjects, and then applied it to 22 new subjects with and without mild cognitive complaints.\n The results demonstrated that the MT is suitable for this population, producing highly reliable task performance and associated EEG and evoked potential data comparable to data from younger subjects, yet differed between elderly subjects with and without \nobjective signs of mild executive dysfunction. The results provide strong support for the scientific and technical feasibility of the MT as an executive brain function test applicable across the life span. In Phase II we plan to extend and further validate\n the MT on a healthy normative population of middle-aged and elderly adults and on patients with disorders producing mild executive impairment, integrate the MT with our automated cognitive neurophysiological EEG testing system, and subject it to independe\nnt evaluation by collaborators. The data collected from these studies will be used to determine the test's psychometric properties in this population and its suitability for evaluating the effects on attentional multiplexing of normal aging and several com\nmon disorders that affect middle age and elderly people, including multiple sclerosis, obstructive sleep apnea and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The MT will also be used in a collaborative pilot fMRI study, and MT performance plus EEG results will be co\nmpared with FDG PET scans in a subset of the MCI patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to efficiently switch attention is critical to functioning in today's complex world, and many diseases like dementia impair it. Surprisingly, there is no modern\n test of this fundamental cognitive function. The Multiplexing Test (MT) is a next-generation dynamic and adaptive test of attention switching that is applicable across the lifespan from 6 to 90+ years of age. The MT is designed for simultaneous measuremen\nt of brain function with EEG, fMRI or PET for improved research and patient care. In addition to commercializing the MT as an essential part of the SAM Exam automated, high-throughput, clinical neurophysiological testing system, The MT will also be made av\nailable as a stand-alone test at no charge to Federally funded cognitive neuroscience researchers.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, measurements of a child's cognitive brain function are made during repetitive, artificial psychometric tests. The generalization of inferences from such measures to a child's actual real-world learning abilit\ny may be limited. Accordingly, we propose to implement a first-of-its-kind automated system that conveniently and accurately measures learning-related neuroelectric EEG signals of children engaged in learning exercises and games. Building on recent technol\nogical and scientific advances in our lab, the proposed device will provide otherwise unavailable information to both educational researchers and to clinicians about a child's regional cortical brain activation during learning. Such information will help t\nhe former to more accurately evaluate educational strategies and courseware, and the later to assess a child's neurocognitive capabilities during the functionally critical and developmentally essential process of learning. During Phase I, we demonstrated t\nhe scientific and technical feasibility of the proposed system. In particular, we illustrated that neuroelectric EEG signals of regional cortical activation of children engaged in complex computerized tasks such as video game play could be validly monitore\nd. The Phase II work will extend the feasibility study and will develop, test, refine, and validate automated EEG measures of a child's brain function during computer-based learning activities in both normative and learning-challenged clinical populations.\n The measures will be incorporated into a high-throughput automated testing system. This system will enable systematic research on computer-based learning for children, and development of preliminary norms will pave the way for the system to be used clinic\nally to evaluate and refine therapeutic interventions. The technology could also be instrumental in future  closed-loop  neuroadaptive systems that use real time monitoring of task-related neural activation to improve courseware and learning efficiency. PU\nBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The Children's Learning Brain Meter is a promising new automated high-throughput technology that measures brain electrical signals as a child engages in computer-based learning exercises and games while sitting at a desk in an ordinar\ny room. It will provide otherwise unavailable information to educational researchers and clinicians about a child's regional cortical brain activation during learning.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria causes 500 million clinical cases and gt 1 million deaths annually, is responsible for a loss of gt 1.3% of GDP in Africa annually, and is a serious concern for travelers and the military. A vaccine would be the\n ideal preventive and is perhaps the only intervention that could facilitate eradication of the disease. When attenuated P. falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ) are administered by bite of infected mosquitoes, gt 90% of human volunteers are protected against exp\nerimental Pf challenge and protection lasts at least 10 months. Sanaria's goal is to develop and commercialize an attenuated PfSPZ vaccine that produces gt 90% protective efficacy, for 3 markets with a potential for gt  1 billion annual revenues; 1) Travel\ners from the developed world, 2) Infants and young children in the developing world, and 3) Adolescent girls in the developing world. In a separate Phase II SBIR and with other funds Sanaria has developed and manufactured under current Good Manufacturing P\nractices (cGMPs) the PfSPZ vaccine using the cryopreservation and irradiation methods developed in our Phase I SBIR. The vaccine met all release specifications, is now in pre-clinical IND-enabling toxicology studies, and is expected to enter clinical trial\ns in the U.S. by the last quarter of 2008. The goals of this proposal are to facilitate rapid testing in Africa by translating the successful cryopreservation protocol developed in Phase I, into a comprehensive system to support clinical trials in Africa, \nand to facilitate scale up, large scale Phase 3 clinical trials, and vaccine launch by establishing the capacity for scaled-up vaccine production in the area of cryopreservation. This proposal has 2 major components, 1) Work designed to provide the foundat\nion for vaccine distribution in expanded Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, and during commercialization (Specific Aims 1-3), and 2) Work designed to scale up vaccine production for Phase 3 trials and commercialization (Specific Aims 4-6). The Specific A\nims are to: 1. Develop methods for storage, inventory control and recovery of vaccine batches for shipment and use in clinical trials; 2. Establish and validate a below -140oC cold chain for all vaccine movements and all transit points between site of vacc\nine manufacture and testing centers in the U.S., and expansion of methods and infrastructure for vaccine delivery to Africa; 3. Establish in-clinic protocols for thawing and diluting cryopreserved vaccine and preparation for injection, and development and \nvalidation of vaccine point-of-administration protocols for use under conditions in Africa; 4. Extend vaccine viability and potency during cryopreservation steps; 5. Create initial daily cryopreserved vaccine production sub-lots, which are then combined in\nto single large vaccine lots, and 6. Automate the protocol for cryopreserving large vaccine lots. These Aims will include establishing quality GMP/GCP control procedures as units of vaccine move to the clinic. There is an urgent need to extensively test th\ne PfSPZ vaccine in Africa as soon as possible. Achievement of the Aims of this proposal will facilitate this testing and decrease time and cost to registration of the PfSPZ vaccine, thereby facilitating delivery of the vaccine to the African children, who \nneed it most.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malaria causes 500 million clinical cases and 1-3 million deaths annually, is responsible for gt1% loss of GDP in Africa annually and is a serious concern for travelers and military personnel. Sanaria's goal is to de\nvelop and commercialize a gt90% protective malaria vaccine for three primary markets with a potential for gt 1 billion annual revenues: 1) Travelers from the developed world to malaria endemic areas. 2) Infants and young children in the developing world. 3\n) Adolescent girls in the developing world.

        "abstract": "It is likely that next generation electron sources for future accelerators will initially utilize a direct current gun based injector with a semiconductor photocathode for electron production.  The goal of this project is to create a recipe or series of recipes that will immunize a photocathode against the background gasses likely to be found under operation in a generic RF gun, thus reducing or eliminating the need to restrict operation to vacuum environments.   The protected/immunized photocathode will retain sufficient quantum yield to satisfy charge requirements and be capable of high polarization electron emission.  The process by which such an emitter can be produced and introduced into an RF gun capable of hosting and maintaining these high polarization photocathodes will be generated.  The Phase II work will include optimization of the current activation recipe for high polarization photo emitters, quantification of the reactivity of the stabilized surface to other gasses, determination of the effects of the stabilized surface on electron-spin polarization, characterization of the stabilized surface using synchrotron light-source photo emission ,and testing of a-Si emitter layers as a means to achieve even greater immunity.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The improved environmental immunity as defined by this work will allow these more robust photocathodes to be used in appropriately designed accelerator injector RF guns. Better immunized photo emitters can also have applications in other low emittance sources. Longer lived photo emitters are desirable to manufacturers of imaging, e.g. night vision, and photomultiplier tubes.",

        "abstract": "Currently, no low-cost capacitors provide an elevated temperature, high reliability solution to the DC Bus Inverter need in hybrid electric vehicles.  In previous work, an annular film capacitor design, which showed potential for use in the DC Bus application, was developed.  The unique shape of the capacitor enables the potential use of polypropylene film at 105\u00c2\u00b0C, a requirement for this application.  However, the characteristics of the device in this application over transportation lifetimes need to be understood, and the overall design must be optimized.  In Phase I, the characteristics of all of the materials that make up the capacitor were profiled as a function of temperature and fed into a sophisticated modeling program.  The results, which were compared with actual tests of an annular film capacitor, confirmed the reliable 105\u00c2\u00b0C operation of the device as a DC Bus Capacitor.  In Phase II, the final material selections will be optimized for reliability, a low cost but reliable interconnect scheme will be developed, and a test package (which will allow power-train transportation designers to confidently specify the device) will be produced.  In addition, modeling simulations to predict failure modes and lifetimes will be compared with actual test results of manufactured capacitors.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A low-cost, polypropylene film used as a DC Bus Capacitor, which requires nothing more than available 105\u00c2\u00b0C engine coolant, would enable the potential elimination of a separate coolant loop and reduce the cost and weight of hybrid electric vehicles.",

        "abstract": "With the drive towards higher-field dipole magnets, the material requirements for superconductors have exceeded the performance of existing metal-based super conductor materials.  For this reason, the ceramic superconductor, bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO-2212), in the form of a multifilamentary Ag alloy composite, is beginning to attract interest for future extremely-high-field magnets or magnet-insert coils.  The material must achieve a critical engineering current density (Je) of at least 250 A/mm2 in a magnetic field of 12 Tesla at a temperature of 4.2K.  This project will produce a commercially viable BSCCO-2212/Ag composite multifilamentary round wire with a Je value equal to or exceeding 600 A/mm2 at 12T and 4.2K.  Phase I demonstrated the flux pinning properties of dopant materials added to BSCCO-2212, which improved the Je of superconducting BSCCO-2212/Ag composite tapes.  Phase I also indicated that Je values equal to or greater that 600 A/mm2 could be achieved.  The plan for Phase II is to scale-up the powder and wire production processes so that kilometer-length BSCCO-2212/Ag composite multifilamentary wires, with Je values equal to or greater that 600 A/mm2 at 4.2K and 12T, can be reliably produced. The initial commercial application for the BSCCO-2212/Ag composite wire should be in high field magnets for high energy physics experimentation.

In this proposal we suggest using the novel hydroxyl radical induced dissociation (HRID) technique, developed in Phase I Studies, that offers various advantages, specific to ECD/ETD methods. The benefits of the \nHRID technology are clear and substantial. The HRID technique can be used as an orthogonal to standard CAD fragmentation method in order to minimize the probability of false positives which are considered as one of the serious problems in the  bottom-up  i\ndentification strategy. Importantly, the HRID technique is able to provide ECD/ETD-type tandem MS data even for singly charged peptides that will certainly be very attractive feature, for instance, for AP-MALDI users. We believe that the  top-down  approac\nh used with the HRID technique will provide the same key features as ECD and ETD methods, namely: (1) the efficient sequencing of large intact proteins and (2) the direct determination of the site of post-translational modifications in proteins.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Phase II Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) application is to fill a major void in the undergraduate neuroscience curriculum: A lack of educational materials that give students the opportunity to\n learn neuroscience by working hands-on with neuroimaging data. The NeuroVisions: Teaching neuroscience with neuroimaging data project will create six Blackboard course cartridges to supplement curricula used in undergraduate neuroscience, psychology, and \nbiology courses and serve as replacement units for course laboratories. The modules will involve students in discovery-based explorations of neuroscience topics with real data provided by leading neuroimaging scientists. Two innovations introduced in the m\nodules are: (1) a decision-modeling tutorial that guides students through the process of posing a research hypothesis and choosing an appropriate research design; and (2) an image analysis tool built into structure of the module that is used to gather data\n for statistically testing the hypothesis posed earlier. The project's emphasis on image manipulation and image analysis will afford a novel and accessible learning experience for today's visually oriented undergraduate students. The NeuroVisions project w\nill build the instructional materials around an image analysis tool adapted for educational use from professional software employed by biomedical researchers worldwide: WebImage. WebImage is a Java-based image processing and analysis program adapted from t\nhe open-source ImageJ software by Science Approach. WebImage will be integrated into the course cartridges to be produced by the project. By reducing the rich, but complicated, set of selection, measurement, calibration, and data rendering tools available \nin ImageJ to only those functions needed to accomplish specific research tasks, NeuroVisions will greatly simplify the process of analyzing data and thus give novice users the opportunity to experience neuroimaging research first hand. The NeuroVisions mat\nerials will be based on the 5E model developed by BSCS and recently evaluated by BSCS for the Office of Science Education at the National Institutes of Health. The 5E model specifies a lesson structure with the following elements: engage; explore; explain;\n elaborate; and evaluate. The materials will be developed by Science Approach, LLC, in collaboration with four advising faculty, six neuroscience researchers, and the West Texas Office of Evaluation and Research (WTER). The following milestones will be acc\nomplished: (1) Work with the collaborating neuroscientists to identify research scenarios and data to be used in the NeuroVisions modules; (2) Make needed improvements and modifications to WebImage; (3) Create additional data analysis, simulation, and mult\nimedia objects needed for the modules; (4) Develop six NeuroVisions modules for field testing; (5) Submit pilot modules for independent review; (6) Field test the modules in development; and (7) Use formative feedback from all project phases and the result\ns from the evaluation program to revise the NeuroVisions modules and prepare the series for publication.    Project Narrative/Relevance to Public Health: The proposed NeuroVisions project will provide opportunities for college faculty and undergraduate stu\ndents to explore neuroimaging data in a manner that is currently not available in most college classrooms. Not only will the proposed instructional materials highlight the key role that NIH-supported research plays in improving biomedical diagnoses, treatm\nents, and research, NeuroVisions will promote development of a scientifically literate public that can carry forward the endowment of science and technology that has made the United States a leader in the field of biomedicine and provided its citizens with\n the high standard of living the nation enjoys.",

        "abstract": "Recent work on distributed multi-spacecraft systems has resulted in a number of architectures and algorithms for accurate estimation of spacecraft and formation states. The estimation accuracy achievable during spacecraft formation operation depends not only on the algorithms, but also on their actual implementation and communication related delays. Typically, the algorithms are implemented on a real-time multi-tasking processor that allocates on-board computational resources to multiple tasks according to some scheduling policy. The processor's task scheduler may induce delays and preempt measurement processing and estimation tasks in favor of other tasks. Hence, estimation accuracy and in general the performance of any embedded algorithm can be significantly lower than expected during execution. The goal of this project is to develop distributed spacecraft state estimation algorithms that account for real-time multi-tasking processor constraints and delays in the availability of measurements and make the best use of limited onboard computing resources. We bring together new advances in advanced Kalman filtering techniques to develop an innovative framework for the design of embedded distributed state estimation algorithms and software. We will deliver to NASA JPL a novel ``any time'' Kalman Filter (AKF) architecture and software for distributed state estimation that, i) selects and uses the best measurements under given CPU constraints, and ii) continues to improve the accuracy of estimates by opportunistically using any additional CPU resources that become available.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on fabrication of flexible display backplanes using transfer printed electronics. The display industry has been successful at fabricating amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin film transistor (TFT) backplanes on rigid glass. However, a-Si TFT manufacturing does not easily translate to flexible substrates due to handling issues and the high temperature process of a-Si deposition. In transfer printing, a novel elastomeric stamp is used to pick-up specially designed circuits from the parent wafer and transfers the circuits to the desired target substrate. The parent wafer is fabricated using a standard silicon IC foundry and the single crystal silicon transistors have much better performance than the a-Si counterparts. The SBIR Phase I project demonstrated chip transfer printing process yields of 99.9% and chip placement accuracies better than +/- 5 \u00c3\u00bd\u00c3\u00bdm. Phase II objectives include design, fabrication and characterization of flexible backplane prototypes and further optimization of transfer printing by increasing throughput and demonstrating rework methods. The anticipated result is a manufacturing approach to flexible electronics that is cost competitive, low temperature and well suited to handle flexible substrates.  The competitive advantage of the proposed approach is the fact that all the demanding fabrication process steps necessary to fabricate high performance electronic systems are performed on the ?mother? substrate and\nnot on the final plastic substrate. If successful the inherent mechanical or chemical instabilities of the receiving plastic substrate do not limit the choice of semiconductor manufacturing processes for fabricating devices. The ability to manufacture flexible display backplanes to the demanding standards of the display industry will open up a broad market of opportunity in flexible electronics far beyond displays, including configurable X-ray sensors, RFID tags, and wearable electronics and biosensors. In displays, backplanes using the proposed technology will be utilized by all major display manufacturers and many specialty manufacturers.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project continues SteriCoat's development of a permanent antimicrobial coating for use on central venous catheters.  Current leaching antimicrobial technology does not possess the duration of efficacy required to protect these devices over the lifetime of implantation, especially for peripherally inserted central lines (PICCs).  Research during this Phase II project will focus on the integration of proprietary polymer technology with tethered antimicrobial peptide (AmP) technology developed in Phase I to maximize the efficacy and bioavailability of the immobilized AmPs in vivo.  Work will also be performed to ensure the manufacturability of SteriCoat's coating technology, including prototype production. After transitioning this formulation to the intra- and extraluminal surfaces of a polyurethane tube, efficacy and biocompatibility will be demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo.  By the end of this Phase II project, SteriCoat will have an antimicrobial CVC model with efficacy proven in vivo using the models designed by industry thought leaders and will be ready for scale-up and manufacturing.  This SBIR Phase II project addresses the hospital infections afflicting 1.7 million patients and killing 99,000 in the US annually, the majority of which are associated with medical devices.  Existing slow-release antimicrobial coatings are insufficient in addressing device infection.  They have a limited lifespan and concerns over drug resistance and toxicity\nbecause the drug gets distributed in the bloodstream.  SteriCoat is developing a permanent coating using antimicrobial peptides (AmPs) to prevent bacterial colonization of central venous catheters (CVCs), a $350M market.  The goal of this project is to deliver a polyurethane-based antimicrobial CVC model which incorporates a surface functionalization with AmPs and to test the ability of this approach in resisting bacterial colonization.  By the end of this phase II project, SteriCoat will have verified in vivo efficacy of prototype catheters and be positioned to begin GLP studies for FDA product approval.  In addition, achievement of the technical objectives of this Phase II will open up avenues for additional investigation in the field of bioactive ligand presentation as the developed technology could lend to the efficacy of many biomaterial applications in addition to antimicrobials.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is aimed at developing a new class of drugs, which act by inhibiting pathogenic activities of senescent cells. Cell senescence occurring as a result of aging or cellular damage, is associated with upregulat\nion and secretion of proteins implicated in many age-related diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis and arthritis. These proteins are induced in response to the expression of cell cycle inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibi\ntor (CKI) family, such as p21Waf1/Cip1 or p16Ink4A. Senex Biotechnology has identified a novel class of drug-like small molecules, SNX2-class compounds, which reduce the induction of disease-associated genes, senescence-associated morphological changes and\n secretion of tumor- promoting factors by CKI-arrested cells. Phase I studies of this project revealed that SNX2-class compounds affect CKI interaction with cyclin/CDK complexes in such a way that CDK2 kinase activity becomes much more susceptible to the i\nnhibition by CKI, whereas transcriptional activation by CKI is greatly diminished. Thus SNX2-class compounds both prevent the upregulation of disease-associated proteins and enhance the tumor- suppressive activity of CKIs. The first aim of the Phase II pro\ngram is to define the target of SNX2-class compounds at the biochemical level, as an approach to target-based design of drugs with the same activity. To test a hypothesis that SNX2-class compounds act by affecting post-translational modifications of the pr\notein components of CKI/cyclin/CDK complexes, the component proteins will be analyzed for changes in their modifications upon treatment with SNX2-class compounds. Once the protein modifications susceptible to SNX2-class compounds are identified, the corres\nponding modifying enzymes will be tested as targets for inhibition by these compounds in cell-free assays. In another line of analysis, components of p21-containing protein complexes, the binding of which is affected by SNX2-class compounds, will be identi\nfied. The potential role of such proteins in CKI-induced transcription will be tested by RNA interference assays. The second aim of the program is to carry out chemical optimization and structure-activity analysis of lead compounds of SNX2 family. The opti\nmization strategy, based on the activity of 40 SNX2-related compounds, will guide the synthesis of chemical derivatives, which will be tested for efficacy in preventing the induction of transcription by p21 and for their effect on the target enzyme activit\ny, as identified in the first aim. These assays will elucidate the structure-activity relationship of SNX2 family proteins for designing more efficacious compounds of the same family. The third aim of the program is to test lead compounds of SNX2 family fo\nr acute toxicity in mice and for ex vivo and in vivo efficacy in inhibiting the tumor-promoting activity of senescent fibroblasts. These studies will provide an in vivo proof-of-principle for therapeutic use of SNX2-class compounds. Successful completion o\nf Phase II will allow us to generate strategies and candidate compounds for preclinical and clinical development of drugs with a novel mechanism of action and with broad applicability to cancer and Alzheimer's disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With the agi\nng of the American population, chronic age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, chronic renal disease and cancer, are becoming an increasingly greater burden on the society. There is a great need for developing novel pharmaceutic\nals that would be efficient against these largely incurable diseases. Senex Biotechnology, Inc. is a small drug discovery company that targets a newly discovered biological regulatory pathway, which causes increased production of proteins implicated in man\ny age-related diseases.

        "abstract": "Wind energy has numerous benefits as a power source, including price stability, lack of greenhouse gas emissions, and lack of dependence on imported fuels.  As wind increases its penetration into the U.S. power market, it is imperative to minimize costs and maximize reliability, so that it can fully compete with traditional power sources.  The primary recurring cost of energy in wind turbines is maintenance.  Studies have shown that a few subsystems tend to account for most unscheduled maintenance costs, and for in-service failures and downtime.  These subsystems include the gearboxes and the generator.  Although technologies to monitor both of these systems already exist in a rudimentary form, these technologies require a large array of costly sensors and data acquisition hardware.  This project will develop a low-cost, robust health monitoring system applicable to a wide range of commercial wind turbines.  The approach involves the utilization of industry-standard vibration signal processing and condition indicators, which have been developed for aerospace applications.  Phase I focused on demonstrating the underlying diagnostic algorithms.  Phase II will develop several complete prototypes and demonstrate them on operating wind turbines.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A low-cost, high-payback health monitoring system would have a significant positive impact on wind turbine operations and maintenance costs.  In turn, the net cost of energy for wind power would decrease, providing a good ROI for wind farm operators.  Moreover, the reduced cost of energy and increased reliability would accelerate the adoption of this clean energy source.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians treating tuberculosis (TB) today are in desperate need of new, efficient, and effective antibiotics to improve both time of treatment and durability of cure in multi-drug resistant (MDR) as well as uncomplica\nted TB. In the completed Phase 1 grant (Final Report below), we evaluated an exciting new drug candidate, SQ641. SQ641 has activity superior to Isoniazid (INH) and all other TB drugs and, under appropriate conditions, rapidly reduces Mycobacteria in our tw\no best TB disease models; macrophages and mice. We briefly describe the drug properties, including its exceptional bactericidal activity, its target and mechanism of action (Translocase I), and our efforts to date to develop an oral formulation. In this Ph\nase 2 proposal, we outline the next steps to identify a commercially viable oral formulation(s) of SQ641 for oral treatment regimens, and a parenteral formulation(s) which would have the potential to create a new treatment paradigm; a single, parenteral do\nse administered at the time of diagnosis. Compared to the current standard of care for TB, both formulations, and associated treatment regimens would dramatically and quickly reduce bacteria in tissues and drastically shorten and improve TB treatment time.\n INH is used for the first 2 mo of intensive chemotherapy as a cornerstone drug of TB therapy because of its ability to quickly kill rapidly replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in infected tissues and reduce the number of infectious bacteria in pu\nlmonary secretions. As evidenced by Early Bactericidal Activity (EBA) clinical studies, INH is clearly the most potent of all currently available TB drugs. Interestingly, compared to SQ641, INH is a relatively slow-acting drug in vitro that requires severa\nl days to kill MTB, and has a post antibiotic effect (PAE) of only 17 hr. Based on a relatively short half- life, the drug is administered daily. Despite daily administration, recent studies demonstrate that the number of viable bacteria remains sufficient\n to promote physiologic (Siddiqi et al. 2007) and genotypic drug-resistant bacteria. After 48 hr of exposure to INH, ~10% of MTB are killed, but still morphologically intact. In contrast, SQ641 kills 90% of MTB in this timeframe and the bacteria are lysed \n(liquid cultures are clear). Moreover, SQ641 has a PAE of 55 hr, 3 times the INH PAE. The best way to prevent drug resistance is to act quickly, before bacteria have a chance to adjust to the presence of the drug. SQ641 is highly effective in preventing de\nvelopment of drug resistant mutants in vitro and has marked synergistic activity in vitro with several antituberculars: Ethambutol (EMB), streptomycin, and the new Sequella drug, SQ109. SQ641 has excellent in vitro activity against drug susceptible and MDR\n MTB, M. kansasii, M. abscessus, and M. avium, and could also be developed for nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) diseases. In spite of the remarkable antibiotic properties of SQ641 against Mycobacteria, a practical method to deliver this drug remains a ch\nallenge. We discovered that SQ641 activates the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) drug efflux pump in macrophages, and therefore does not accumulate to bactericidal concentrations inside these important cells that harbor MTB in infected mammals. As expected, P-gp effl\nux inhibitors markedly enhanced the activity of SQ641 against intracellular MTB; SQ641 was equivalent to or better than INH (the most potent single drug in this test system). In mice, orally administered SQ641 is poorly absorbed. For numerous reasons (pati\nent acceptability, convenience, and cost), oral delivery is the preferred method to administer TB therapy. Poor bioavailability combined with rapid efflux from macrophages meant thinking creatively about drug delivery. Fortunately, we solved both efflux an\nd insolubility problems by combining SQ641 with TPGS, a vitamin E analogue routinely used to improve drug solubility and hence bioavailability (EASTMAN and",

The proposed fabrication processes will significantly improve the throughput of plastic lab-on-a-chip manufacturing processes while making the process more reliable. The processes developed in this work will allow (a) Siloam to successfully commercialize lab-on-a-chip applications under development and (b) serve as cornerstone of development for the BioMEMS industry by offering fully-automated processes for lab-on-a-chip fabrication. The current plastic lab-on-a-chip production processes include a mix of processes with varying throughput. Low-throughput processes such as drilling, dicing, microfluidic interconnect assembly present significant bottlenecks to the high-throughput desirable of production processes. This effort proposes a systematic development of plastic microfabrication processes that can completely eliminate the low-throughput processes. Furthermore, the newly developed process sequence will allow for a fully-automated process flow which can dramatically enhance the throughput as well as reliability of a production process. During Phase I efforts, research efforts will focus on development of the high-throughput plastic microfabrication processes. A double-side injection molding process is proposed that can enhance the functionality of the injection molding process by allowing for fabrication of (a) through-holes geometries (eliminates drilling), (b) automatic definition of chip size (eliminates dicing), and (c) self-alignment during assembly (increases accuracy and reliability). Also, a novel mechanically-assisted thermoplastic fusion bonding protocol is proposed which can dramatically increase the throughput for the bonding step (few seconds per device). This process relies on a high density array of interlocking pillar-hole structures (fabricated using double-side injection molding) which allows for rapid chip assembly (at room temperature). Following assembly, a batch of assembled chips is simultaneously annealed (at high temperature) which leads to chemical bond formation across the interface. Finally, self-aligning microfluidic interconnects which can be incorporated as a part of the assembly process will be developed. A multi-layer microfluidic device using all of the above processes will be fabricated as a proof-of-concept demonstration vehicle. During Phase II efforts, the merit of the newly developed fabrication processes will be demonstrated by fabrication of lab-on-a-chips for specific BioMEMS applications. The use of the new technology will (a) either improve existing microfluidic devices or; (b) make possible microfluidic devices that were not possible with current fabrication processes. POCT diagnostic tools, using disposable lab-on-a-chips will allow for frequent patient monitoring leading to more informed and clinically relevant decisions from physicians. The manufacturing processes proposed in this work, for microfluidic lab-on-a-chips, are crucial for successful commercialization of this technology.",

It is hypothesized that continuous monitoring and analysis of simple gait parameters in children with CP outside the clinical laboratory and during normal daily activities will provide clinically useful outcomes data that are not currently available and critical diagnostic data for determining intervention timing. There is a clinical need for objective, quantitative data to assess the severity of toe walking and its progression over time as the child develops and intervention strategies are implemented to improve his/her mobility. Also, extending such assessment to the home and community settings is critical in order to allow clinicians to evaluate whether clinical interventions are effective in improving mobility outside of the clinic and overall the quality of life of the child. The key innovation is the development of a miniature extremely low-power data acquisition/recording device, which can be worn non-obtrusively by children with CP during activities of daily living (ADL's) to measure ankle angle and center of pressure trajectories during ambulation. In Phase I, hardware/software development and validation will be followed by a pilot study of children with CP to compare measured in-shoe gait parameters against gold- standard laboratory kinematic and kinetic data. Data clustering techniques will be employed to determine the feasibility of classifying these motor tasks from the in-shoe monitoring data alone, and to identify different ambulatory activities (i.e. level walking, ramp ascending and descending, and stair ascending and descending). In Phase II, the hardware is incorporated into the sole of a sneaker, a multi-stage classifier is developed and validated, and a pilot longitudinal study is performed to evaluate the development of a novel Toe Walking Severity (TWS) index. The long-term goal of this research and development project is to address clinical problems associated with objective quantification of gait abnormalities and the success of clinical interventions by developing low cost, readily available in-shoe monitoring tools and analysis methods to quantify longitudinally the severity of toe walking outside the clinic environment. If successful, the proposed technology carries significant potential for monitoring gait in patients affected by other pathologies in which gait parameters are expected to change over time as a function of the progression of the disease (e.g. shuffling in patients with Parkinson's disease, progressive loss of ankle control in patients with multiple sclerosis). The proposed ActiveGait device provides the enabling technology to continuously monitor toe walking at home. Outcome measures quantifying the success and timing of clinical interventions for toe walking will be developed based on extremely large data gathered from the individual's walking at home and over long periods of time. If technically and economically feasible, the additional up-front cost of the monitoring system in the shoe will be far outweighed by reduced health care costs associated with treatment and rehabilitation for toe walking.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the development of an electronic replacement for reading materials currently used by the majority of biology undergraduate students. This replacement will combine smaller reading sections with more active learning components such as simulated experiments. The system to be developed will be open to contribution from a wide variety of authors and subject matter experts. Textbooks are currently used in most college biology environments to present material to students. However, learning through textbooks occurs primarily through memorization. This project is developing new innovative ways to facilitate productive learning techniques, and for configuring take-home assignments of biology students to be more active, without losing the content needed for understanding biological systems.  This project has the potential to transform one of the pillars of science education, the textbook, from a passive reading instrument to an active learning tool. This could contribute to the improvement of learning gains for the at least one million students per year that participate in college level biology classes each year in the U.S. On a broad scale, this project eventually could help improve learning across all the sciences.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Company is developing SmartInsulin(tm), which is intended to be a once-a-day, self- regulating insulin injection for the treatment of Type I diabetes. It is designed as a \"drop- in\" replacement product for the 4 million insulin-using diabetics in the United States. SmartInsulin is designed to provide significant benefits to insulin-dependent diabetics including fewer injections, less frequent blood sugar monitoring, reduced incidence of low blood sugar levels and single-dose control of both fasting and mealtime blood sugar levels. SmartInsulin is a nanostructured material that self-assembles from two biomolecular building blocks: a glycosylated insulin-polymer conjugate (IPC) and a multivalent glucose-binding molecule (GBM). The work covered in this submission is built on the successful results of a two-year NIH SBIR Phase 1 grant, an NIH SBIR Phase 2 grant, and preliminary results from a DOD grant regarding the safety and efficacy of SmartInsulin in large animal models. These results show that SmartInsulin has met its \"proof-of-concept\" technical goals, but IND- enabling studies must be conducted in order to bring SmartInsulin to the clinic. This requires very detailed and expensive GLP toxicity/ADME studies and a GMP manufacturing process before obtaining an IND from the Food and Drug Administration. This project is intended to provide a clear path to GMP-quality SmartInsulin by establishing formulation stability, supporting assay development, qualification and validation activities and allowing the sourcing of the raw materials to key suppliers. The impacts to public health as a result of this project are potentially significant. Poor glycemic control has been shown to cause a host of diabetic complications which result in over $54 billion annually in medical costs. The landmark Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) have clinically proven that tighter glycemic control, as measured by lower glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, significantly reduces the incidence of these complications. SmartInsulin is designed to provide tighter glycemic control, lowered HbA1c levels, and thus decreased incidence of diabetic complications. SmartCells is developing SmartInsulin(tm), which is intended to be a once-a-day, self- regulating insulin injection for the treatment of Type I diabetes. Poor control of blood sugar levels has been shown to cause many diabetic complications which result in over $54 billion annually in medical costs. SmartInsulin is designed to provide tighter control of blood sugar levels and thus decreased incidence of diabetic complications.",

Prior to this SBIR project, no suitable fabrication technique existed to produce spherical retroreflectors with the required graded index of refraction structure. This project will produce spherical retroreflectors with compositional grading from center to surface.  This approach combines the well-established technology for fluidized bed processing with existing technology in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of optical materials. The Phase I project demonstrated technical feasibility of the approach. The Phase II project will further optimize properties, improve production, and extend the process to other coating materials for application at different optical wavelengths.  Also during Phase II, sample quantities of miniature spherical retroreflectors will be produced and delivered for evaluation by DOE.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In addition to remote laser sensing, the spherical retroreflectors will be useful for many other sensing, tracking, and free-space communications applications.

        "abstract": "SMK Plants LLC will use plant tissue culture to quickly produce large numbers of acid-soil heavy-metal tolerant (AHMT) locally-adapted native plants suitable for revegetating land contaminated by hard rock mining wastes. Large numbers of AHMT plants are in demand because of the immense area of degraded mine land needing to be reclaimed. It will take billions of dollars to reclaim these lands. We proved in SBIR Phase I the principle that we can find, collect, and tissue culture native plants which grow directly on acidic heavy-metal (AHM)contaminated soil. These plants multiply and root similarly to commercial ornamental plant species with similar production costs, making them economical for reclamation. The goal for our SBIR Phase II project is to tissue culture locally adapted native plant species growing on AHM soils, then successfully grow and over-winter them under commercial greenhouse conditions, and eventually use them to revegetate AHM sites. We will prove that our plants are AHMT with greenhouse and field trials over the two year project term. We will identify native plants that are highly desired by mine land reclamationists by using end-user surveys and canvassing our own contacts. We will have an inventory of AHMT plants for use by August 2010. Revegetation of degraded mine land will benefit society by reducing wind and water erosion from these lands,reducing human exposure and improving human health. Reclamation and revegetation will also improve wildlife habitat, improve aesthetics and recreational values, and may help endangered species.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the U.S. teen pregnancy rate has declined significantly over the last decade, it remains higher than that of many other industrialized countries and U.S. teens remain at high risk of acquiring HIV and other STI\ns. A number of behavioral interventions for teens have shown efficacy in reducing unsafe sexual practices that lead to pregnancy and STIs/HIV. These interventions recognize the importance of social influences on youth behavior and have a significant focus \non behavioral skills building exercises that emphasize problem solving, communication between partners, sexual negotiation and abstinence. However, teachers and practitioners often find it challenging to implement these programs as they require use of inte\nractive activities such as role- plays and group discussions that require more student participation in the classroom than conventional lectures, something that many educators are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with. Teachers often resort to either redesignin\ng these interactive activities within the lessons, or completely eliminating them. The proposed project, entitled the Abstinence and Contraception Education Storehouse (ACES), proposes to develop a library of educational resources that can be used to suppl\nement and enhance skill-building activities in teen sexual risk reduction interventions. The ACES educational resource has a two-fold aim: (a) to train teachers and practitioners to implement interactive skill-building program components by offering demons\ntrations/training in interactive teaching, and (b) to offer teachers/practitioners a variety of interactive skill-building activities and exercises from effective teen pregnancy/STI/HIV prevention programs that can supplement and enhance their own curricul\num or intervention. ACES will have two product components corresponding to these aims: (1) The ACES Teacher Training Library that contains video clips offering guidance on conducting interactive teaching sessions and facilitating group participation, and (\n2) the ACES Youth Activities Library that contains a series of video vignettes and clips that will demonstrate a variety of role play scenarios and group discussions organized around key topic areas in the area of teen pregnancy/STI/HIV prevention. The rol\ne-play and group discussion video vignettes in the ACES Youth Activities library will be drawn from Sociometrics' Program Archive for Sexuality, Health and Adolescence (PASHA), a collection of replication kits for 34 teen pregnancy and STI/HIV prevention p\nrograms selected as effective by a Scientist Expert Panel in preventing teen pregnancy/STI/HIV or their risky sexual behavior antecedents. Development of ACES will be informed by usability testing with representatives of the product's adult (teacher, healt\nh practitioner) and youth target audiences. A two-part field test will examine ACES' potential outcomes for enhancing providers' motivation, skill, and confidence in implementing sexual health interventions as well as youths' knowledge, attitudes, and beha\nvioral intentions regarding safe sex, and youths' satisfaction with the prevention program.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The ACES product will promote public health education in several ways. It will: (1) offer teachers/practitioners a variety of intera\nctive skill-building activities and exercises that can supplement and enhance program content and activities in the intervention being implemented by them, (2) train teachers and practitioners to implement interactive skill-building program components by o\nffering demonstrations/training in interactive teaching, and (3) increase student interest and engagement in prevention programs by incorporating such participatory activities. More highly skilled health educators and stronger, more efficacious, and more c\nost-effectively- produced youth-focused prevention programs should be the result.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the passage of the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities Act (SDFSCA) in 1986, funding for school-based drug use and violence prevention programs has increased substantially from both public and private agenc\nies. At the same time, there has been increasing emphasis on accountability by both government and private funding sources. For example, the U.S Department of Education (DOE) requires school districts to implement evidence-based programs and periodically e\nvaluate their programs against measurable goals if they are to continue receiving prevention funding. This places substantial pressure on school districts who report that their greatest need is technical assistance in evaluation. Conducting an efficient an\nd scientifically valid evaluation of a drug prevention program needs considerable expertise and funding, which schools often lack. The proposed Substance Abuse Prevention Evaluation Consultant (SAPEC) is an Internet-based evaluation tool that will assist s\nchools and small community-based organizations to conduct a scientific evaluation of their alcohol, tobacco and other drug (ATOD) prevention programs as mandated by their funding agency. SAPEC is designed to facilitate the evaluation process by enabling pr\nactitioners and school staff to turn to the computer for key data collection and evaluation tasks (such as survey creation, administration and data analysis). It will enable school staff and practitioners to develop customized, measurement instruments that\n reflect the goals and objectives of their program. An online Computer-Assisted Self-Interview interface will allow students to self-administer the questionnaire developed by the practitioner. Practitioners can access their data at anytime for analysis pur\nposes, and will be assisted by simple data analysis tools. Alternately, they can have the data analyzed by in-house personnel at Sociometrics. Finally, all replication studies conducted through this system will be available online in a database. In-built p\nrogramming safeguards and training tutorials will guide program staff at every step of the evaluation process. Public Health Relevance: Statement Funding for ATOD and violence prevention efforts is increasingly being tied to evaluation. By helping schools,\n colleges and CBOs meet federal and state guidelines on program accountability, the application advances the adoption of science-based programs and practices in youth ATOD prevention efforts, thereby contributing to a safer, drug-free climate in schools.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychological tests - whereby specific replicable procedures are applied to quantify behavior - are commonly used for the measurement of human behavior by numerous groups, such as in education, business and industry, le\ngal system, hospitals and clinics, and research labs. At least 20,000 tests have been developed since the inception of psychology as a science and over 4,000 are commercially published currently. However, there is no single resource to aid the many who nee\nd to select a test for a defined purpose, obtain that test to use, or gain knowledge about test development and evaluation. The best test therefore may not necessarily be used, to the detriment of the individuals being tested and society as a whole. Conseq\nuently, the goal of this project is to develop an internet-based resource to facilitate selection of, access to, and education about the nearly 2,000 psychological tests for children and adolescents, named the Psychological Test and Assessment Resource (Ps\nyTestAR). By the end of Phase II, three integrated components will constitute PsyTestAR, jointly providing a wide range of essential online resources on tests and assessment: (1) The Psychological Test Selection and Access Resource will enable the user to \nenter search parameters representing an existing assessment need. The search interface examines the test information data base and returns a list of tests apparently meeting that need. Selecting a test in this list presents detailed information from the da\nta base on that test. The user gains access to all tests appropriate to his/her qualifications either: (a) immediately in downloadable PDF files held on the PsyTestAR server containing the test form(s) and related material (e.g., manual) or (b) a web link \nor e- mail address referral to the company or person who distributes the test when PsyTestAR does not have a distribution agreement. (2) The Test Development and Evaluation Tutorial provides education on psychological test development, evaluation, and sele\nction in an engaging interactive online format best conducive to learning. (3) The Test and Assessment Resources Links provides access to extensive internet resources on tests for children and adolescents and psychological assessment in general. The intend\ned consumers of PsyTestAR include test users in all areas (e.g., clinicians, researchers, students, teachers) who need information about and access to psychological tests for children and adolescents or want to be educated about tests and assessment genera\nlly. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Although psychological tests are regularly used for the measurement of human behavior in a wide array of situations by numerous types of administrators it is often difficult to identify the best test for a specific purpose from\n among the more than 20,000 commercial and non-commercial psychological tests available. This project will aid those who need to select a psychological test for a defined purpose, obtain that test to use, or gain knowledge about test development and evalua\ntion. The increased access to tests and education will increase the levels of accurate and appropriate psychological testing, ultimately advancing scientific research and increasing good mental health among the public.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to the National Institute on Aging (NIA) request for applications to develop user-friendly mechanisms that facilitate secondary analysis of complex longitudinal or population-based surveys on adult health and aging, Sociometrics proposes to create a didactic (instructional) archive of social, behavioral, and medical research on aging in the United States and around the world. The main goal of this project is to provide data and services that support an infrastructure for the sharing of valuable public use datasets related to aging adults and that provide resources for learning how to use data more effectively. The foundation for these services is based on Sociometrics' more than 20 years of experience in data archiving, data dissemination, and provision of technical and research support to data users. The proposed archive will meet the objectives of the RFA by providing three products for a broad spectrum of data users who analyze, consume, or use data on the aging population to make informed decisions or influence policy. The proposed products are intended for academia, private industries in pharmaceuticals and health care, insurance providers, health maintenance organizations, and policy institutes devoted to health and the elderly. Three products will be produced by the completion of the Phase II project period: The Archive of Public Use Data on Aging will comprise a collection of existing public use files and new datasets that become available during the project period. Complex datasets will be modified for more effective secondary use and data extracts will be created for specific topically focused or subpopulation analysis. Data sets will be archived in a standardized and easy to manipulate format. The Analysis Guide for Data on Aging will offer instructional materials for data users, instructors, students, and those in industry that wish to gain a more complete understanding of how to manipulate and use complex datasets. The XML Codebook Repository will be created using a new program developed for converting dataset information into the XML codebook standards of the Data Documentation Initiative. There are many well-respected social science data archives in the United States. Data on the aging population are held by several organizations, including the National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging at the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), the National Institute on Aging, the National Center for Health Statistics, the U.S. Census Bureau, and University of Michigan. For this project, our purpose is to create an additional resource for data on aging; to provide options and alternatives for data users who may need didactic materials, updated or improved versions of public use data; to create data extracts covering specific topics or subpopulations of interest; and to make available codebooks and supplementary information produced with current data processing standards. In this way, our efforts can only complement the work and offerings of other data archives. Sociometrics proposes to develop an easy to use data archive and accompanying data analysis resources that facilitate secondary analysis of complex longitudinal or population-based surveys on adult health and aging.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women of color, particularly African American women, are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS. African American women account for 66% of estimated AIDS cases among women, aged 13 and older, diagnosed in 2005, but onl\ny 12% of the U.S. population of women. Several behavioral prevention interventions tailored for African American women have shown efficacy in reducing sexual risk behaviors. Their successful replication has been hampered by cost, implementation difficultie\ns, and participant retention issues. The proposed project seeks to address these barriers to reducing HIV/AIDS rates in African American females by developing and empirically validating computer enhanced, individualized versions of efficacious group-admini\nstered HIV prevention programs for African-American females. Specific objectives include: (1) to increase service agencies' ability to implement efficacious HIV interventions with fidelity; (2) to increase African American females' participation in efficac\nious HIV interventions; and, (3) ultimately, to reduce sexual risk behaviors and HIV infection rates among African-American females. In Phase I we developed a computer enhanced, individualized, multimedia version of SiSTA, a group-administered HIV preventi\non program for African- American women that has demonstrated efficacy in reducing sexual risk behavior. We called this computer version SAHARA, for Sistas Accessing HIV/AIDS Resources At-a-click. In Phase I we also successfully validated the effectiveness \nof SAHARA through a randomized controlled trial. In the proposed Phase II continuation, we will repeat these successful development and validation methods with two additional efficacious group programs for African American females: SiHLE (for adolescents a\nge 14-18) and WiLLOW (for women living with HIV age 18 and older). Once again, Digitized SiHLE and Digitized WiLLOW will be developed and evaluated in collaboration with their developers, Drs. Gina Wingood and Ralph DiClemente.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVA\nNCE The proposed research will make efficacious HIV prevention programs for African American adolescents and women available to health service organizations at low cost, and will facilitate their cost-effective, faithful implementation. It will also promot\ne community members' participation in the interventions by permitting sensitive topics to be addressed privately (i.e., one-on-one with the computer) and according to a flexible schedule. Ultimately, it will help to reduce sexual risk-taking behavior and H\nIV infection rates among African American women, who are disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.",

        "abstract": "NASA often must deal with the issue of protecting EMI sensitive payloads and instrumentation from damage due to radiated energy.  Many of these EMI sensitive payloads can be damaged by seemingly benign sources such as communication networks or microwave ovens. The problem becomes more difficult when these sensitive payloads and instrumentation require movement from one location to another.  It is extremely difficult and time consuming to identify and characterize the potential threat to these payloads with current tools and techniques. \n\nSoneticom proposes to utilize a small network of sensors to quickly and efficiently identify and locate sources of EMI radiation. Once the source is located Soneticom will utilize available signal parameters such as Received Signal Strength (RSS) at each sensor to estimate the signal strength at any point within the network's coverage area.  Figure 2.1 is a conceptual diagram of how this innovation might look once displayed on a map. \n\nSoneticom will utilize the existing Lynx Geolocation platform which has the capability to identify and locate an EMI radiation source in the 20 MHz - 30 GHz range.

        "abstract": "One of the key technical issues associated with agricultural irrigation is that effective management of water requires excellent measurement and control. If irrigation districts cannot provide reliable and flexible water delivery, this prevents growers from utilizing modern, efficient on-farm irrigation technologies. Great advances were made to flow measurement technology in the 1980\u00c3\u00bd\u00c3\u00bds and 1990\u00c3\u00bd\u00c3\u00bds; however, volumetric measurement still remains problematic under many conditions. Flow measurement is extremely important: the water resource cannot be effectively managed unless it is measured and controlled throughout the web of water delivery systems. In the entire western United States there is a need to monitor flow in small irrigation canals that are typically a few inches to a few feet deep. The present practice of flow measurement in these situations either uses inaccurate methods with inexpensive instruments or accurate methods with expensive instruments and time-consuming calibration procedures. There is a pressing need to have an appropriately priced, highly accurate instrument that requires little maintenance or calibration and can be used under a variety of circumstances. SonTek/YSI will apply its expertise in acoustic Doppler technology in developing a flow measurement sensor for small irrigation canals. Doppler technology is uniquely suited to these types of measurements. The new sensor will provide an accurate measurement in a wide range of environmental conditions and will work effectively within existing irrigation infrastructure. Work during Phase II will include improvements in measurement accuracy, new production techniques to reduce the manufacturing costs, application research to minimize the total cost of establishing and maintain a flow measurement site, and the construction and testing of prototype sensors. By the end of Phase II we will be able to quantify the performance of this sensor in a variety of environmental conditions and to provide guidance for its effective operation. We have identified a strong market need for this device for irrigation applications not only in the United States, but also in Australia, Southern Europe, and Central Asia. We are confident that this research will lead to a successful, commercial viable product that provide a valuable tool for improving the efficiency of irrigated agriculture both in the United States and around the world.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This Phase II program intends to continue to develop an improved brachytherapy delivery system for treatment of lung cancer by incorporating radioactive 169Ytterbium sources into surgical staples used in lung resect\nion. For patients with compromised cardiopulmonary status, the inclusion of brachytherapy with sublobular resection has shown a significant improvement in therapeutic outcome over sublobular resection alone. Brachytherapy has the obvious advantage of maxim\nally irradiating the tumor bed while sparing surrounding normal tissue from the field of radiation. This approach has been especially useful when the required radiation dose exceeds the tolerance dose of the surrounding normal tissues. However, logistic is\nsues have limited the application of brachytherapy in these lung cancer applications. This development will facilitate and dosimetrically improve the delivery of this therapy. The incorporation of 169Ytterbium sources into the surgical staples normally use\nd during the lung resection procedure will permit the application of lung brachytherapy at the same time as the surgery is being performed. The problem facing the current technique is in the ability to precisely deliver the brachytherapy sources intraopera\ntively to achieve the proper dose distribution and minimize the radiation dose to the clinicians performing the procedure. Our development would facilitate the precise placement of 169Ytterbium sources relative to the surgical margin, assure the sources re\nmain fixed in their precise position for the duration of the treatment, overcome the technical difficulties of manipulating the sources through the narrow surgical incision, and reduce the radiation dose to the clinicians. We anticipate that this developme\nnt will extend the use of brachytherapy to a much larger number of compromised lung cancer patients for whom more traditional surgical procedures, such as lobectomy, are not an option.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This development will afford the ad\nditional clinical benefit of brachytherapy to patients with compromised cardiopulmonary status, thereby improving their outcomes. The improved dose distribution resulting from more precise source positioning and fixation is expected to improve the currentl\ny identified clinical benefit of brachytherapy due to the limitations of the current technique. Because lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, any improvement in clinical outcome resulting from this program will translate i\nnto significant societal benefit.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The epilepsies are a family of disorders of brain dynamics. Epilepsy patients are susceptible to seizures (changes in sensation, awareness, or behavior caused by brief electrical disturbances in the brain). Often, the e\nlectrical disturbances originate from a  focus  or  epileptogenic zone  in part of the brain, from which the disturbances are propagated to other parts of the brain. Epilepsy affects approximately 2.5 million persons in the United States, and over 50 milli\non persons worldwide, and 150,000 to 200,000 new cases occur annually in the U.S. Although most epilepsy patients can control their seizures with the use of antiepileptic drugs, between 20% to 25% of patients cannot bring their seizures under control using\n drug therapy. Many patients with pharmacologically intractable seizures can eliminate their disability largely or completely by neurosurgical intervention, which typically involves resection of tissue in the epileptogenic zone to prevent the spread of ele\nctrical disturbances. Candidates for epilepsy surgery are generally evaluated first with scalp EEG. In approximately 20% of cases, however, intracranial telemetry (iEEG) with brain surface (ElectroCorticoGraphy, or ECoG) and/or depth electrodes is required\n to determine the site(s) of seizure onset, but determination of the seizure onset zone is often ambiguous. We propose to develop software tools that will aid the clinician in the identification of the epileptogenic zone from iEEG data, through the multimo\ndal integration of iEEG data with structural and functional imaging data, visualization of iEEG data, both in space and time, and analysis of iEEG data. During Phase I, we designed, implemented, and validated software to integrate the visualization of ECoG\n electrode locations on sMRI data, on a subject-specific basis, and visualize ECoG activity patterns in both space and time. During Phase II, we will extend these results to include depth electrode data. We will also develop, implement and verify statistic\nal signal processing tools to aid in the identification and localization of the seizure onset zone. These methods will be validated by comparison with clinical findings. A principal design objective is the creation of software that can be used by a trained\n technician to produce a reliable visualization with less than 1 hour of preparation time. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The work described in this proposal addresses the need to develop improved software tools for the visualization and analysis of intracranial\n electroencephalographic (iEEG) measurements obtained from the surface (electrocorticography, or ECoG) or from the depths of the human brain. If successful, these tools will advance the clinical practice of surgical management for epilepsy, as well as prov\niding an enabling technology for basic and clinical human brain research.",

Islet transplantation is a method of treatment that has successfully reversed insulin dependence in Type 1 diabetics in clinical trials. However, one of the most significant issues with br\ninging pancreatic islet transplantation to the greater public is the difficulty of isolating a critical mass of healthy, viable islets from a single donor pancreas to achieve a successful clinical transplant. Current isolation and purification techniques l\nose 30-50% of the original islet mass and result in cellular apoptosis and/or loss of viability. This loss of viable islets almost always results in the need to utilize two pancreases for a single transplant (the  Edmonton Protocol ). The proposed innovati\non is a revolutionary device that is capable of magnetically isolating pancreatic islets with the goal of successful single-organ islet transplantations. The ultimate goal of this research is to increase the quality of healthy, viable, isolated, and purifi\ned islets recovered during the isolation process yielding purified islets ideally suited for transplantation into Type I diabetic patients. This new purification system is based on Quadrupole Magnetic flow Sorting (QMS) technology, which has been licensed \nby IKOtech from The Ohio State University and Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Available QMS hardware is capable of separating cell-sized particles (6-40 5m diameter); however, processing the larger islets (150-350 5m) requires significant modifications to the\n QMS hardware. During Phase I research SHOT successfully developed the key technologies required for the processing of intact islets by QMS. The new QMS will solve some of the well- known problems associated with human and xenogeneic islet preparations. Fo\nr this proposed Phase II project, SHOT will (1) complete the design and manufacture of a QMS system capable of isolating pancreatic islets, (2) in conjunction with external colleagues, research and identify available magnetic reagents with a particle size \nand magnetic susceptibility that is optimized for isolating islets in three porcine isolation trials and that meets appropriate biocompatibility (i.e. cytotoxicity and immunogenicity) requirements, and (3) verify the performance of the technology by testin\ng the QMS system and reagents together in three standardized porcine pancreatic islet isolations in collaboration with the islet isolation team at UofM. Islet isolation quality will be assessed via islet count, Oxygen Consumption Rate (OCR) and OCR per mg \nof DNA (OCR/DNA) measurements, proteomic and genomic molecular profiling, and diabetic nude mouse bioassays. The Phase II effort is designed to prove the reasonable safety and efficacy of the QMS technology for isolating pancreatic islets and will result i\nn preclinical data in support of a Phase II Competing Continuation grant for required testing, eventually leading to an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approving QMS for clinical trials.        Project Narrative: The project  Magnetic Flow Sorter fo\nr Pancreatic Islet Isolations  is relevant to public health as an enabling technology for pancreatic islet transplantation, which is a promising and minimally invasive cure for Type 1 Diabetes currently undergoing clinical trials. Type 1 Diabetes currently\n afflicts an estimated 800,000+ nationally with 60,000 or more cases diagnosed each year. Severe organ procurement limitations currently restrict the number of patients that can be treated via islet transplantation (which is compounded by the need for more\n than one organ per transplant), so success with the proposed technology will double the number of patients that can be cured with islets transplanted from",

Current airborne in situ instruments are limited to microphysical measurements on scales of cubic centimeters up to a cubic meter. This project will develop a dual-wavelength in situ cloud light detection and ranging (lidar: the optical analog of radar) system capable of measuring volumetric cloud properties over scales of millions of cubic meters.  The Phase I project included simulations and laboratory evaluations of components critical for development of the lidar system.  SPEC previously developed a signal-wavelength system from which several components will be incorporated into the dual-wavelength (near infrared) system, thereby providing a significant cost savings to the DOE.  The development of a near infrared high-power laser system with custom avalanche photodiode detector was a major challenge that was overcome in the Phase I research.  In Phase II, SPEC will build the dual-wavelength in situ cloud lidar, and in cooperation with the Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Studies (CIRPAS), install it in a research aircraft which will be used in the DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) field campaign in 2009. Calibration flights will be performed and SPEC staff will deploy to the field program to train CIRPAS personnel on the operation of the equipment.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infection is a major problem affecting function and longevity of dialysis catheters. Catheter-related sepsis occurs at alarmingly high rates, and often necessitates intervention or catheter removal. This grant is evalua\nting the hypothesis that a covalently attached selenium coating can reduce bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on the surface of dialysis catheters, thereby lowering the incidence of device-centered infection. Selenium is an essential dietary requ\nirement for humans. Selected selenium compounds are catalytic and produce superoxide radicals (O2-) by their reaction with thiols. High local concentrations of these superoxides cause lysis of bacterial cells, and could be particularly effective in prevent\ning biofilm formation, since the mechanism of action for the superoxide does not require cells to be metabolically active. In fact, in one study, Se compounds were shown effective against 90% of clinically-isolated MRSA strains. Since it is catalytic, the \ncovalently attached Se compound will remain on the surface and be active permanently, unlike conventional eluting coatings that are often gone within 30 days and that can elicit deleterious systemic effects. Additionally, since the superoxide radical has o\nnly a very short diffusion lifetime, the selenium coatings will be only locally active and will not adversely affect biocompatibility of the device with neighboring human cells. Phase I successfully demonstrated significant (gt90%) reduction in biofilm for\nmation for both gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and gram negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria on selenium coated polyurethane catheter material. Selenium coatings were attached to the surface utilizing a unique combination of plasma pre-treatme\nnt surface activation process followed by a chemical deposition step. Investigations of coating density revealed that the process can be tailored to control Se concentration on the surface. Following the successful Phase I project, Phase II will extend the\n results to produce a commercially viable anti-infective coating technology. A key objective in Phase II is coating processes optimization, where the goal is to determine optimal levels of selenium coating concentrations, considering antimicrobial efficacy\n, biocompatibility, and robustness of the process. Using both microtiter plate assays and a multi-cell flow-through continuous-culture system, the program will examine effectiveness of the coating against both single  and dual-species biofilm formation. Co\nating stability will be monitored over long time periods to demonstrate ability of the technology to prevent infection in chronic applications. Finally, an animal model (murine) will be employed to demonstrate in vivo efficacy. This study will utilize biol\numinescent strains of bacteria to permit dynamic assessment of biofilm formation for periods up to 25 days. Relevance: The proposed research is developing selenium coatings to reduce biofilm formation and device-centered infection on dialysis catheters. Th\ne coating could provide significant benefits to dialysis patients by preserving access and reducing secondary complications resulting from infected catheters. Due to the prevalence of dialysis catheter infection, an effective treatment could significantly \nimpact cost of healthcare delivery for patients using catheters as their primary access. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hemodialysis is a method of filtering blood of impurities in patients whose kidney function has either failed or has become severely diminishe\nd. The hemodialysis process uses an extracorporeal system to cleanse the patient's blood of toxins. Catheters are one of the methods used to provide the vascular access to these patients.

This figure does not include billions of dollars that come into each reservation through grant funds from other agencies, private philanthropy, the $14.1 billion brought in from tribal gaming or other tribal enterprises. Much of this money never reaches its intended recipients, being lost through expense accounts being used for personal benefit and payment of individuals for hours they did not work. Ethical violations are costing tribal organizations hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Most of these costs are not in large-scale embezzlement or kick-backs on multi-million dollar contracts. Small violations on a large scale are what bleed money from tribal and federal funds. The problem to be addressed is how to develop and implement a character education-training program that will cause a significant decrease in funds lost through ethical violations. Our product will train tribal leaders to make viable business decisions based on their tribe\u00c3\u00bd\u00c3\u00bds traditional values. It is very common for elected tribal leaders, managers, and program directors to have less than a college education, often less than high school. Tribal council representatives are often elected because they have large families on the reservation, who will vote and campaign for them, and because they are gifted public speakers. Similarly, program managers and governing board members are often hired/ appointed due to their political clout.

Spirit Lake Consulting, Inc. offers an innovative approach to the problem of character education for tribal communities that combines 1) knowledge of Native American history, 2) psychological research on effecting pro-social behavior and 3) technical knowledge of effective computer-based training. In the past three decades, tribes have attempted to revive their culture. Many tribal members proudly say, \u00c3\u00bd\u00c3\u00bdI\u00c3\u00bd\u00c3\u00bdm traditional\u00c3\u00bd\u00c3\u00bd. Tribal traditions are stressed in our project; our courses cast doing personal errands during work hours, misuse of travel funds, hiring unqualified relatives as \u00c3\u00bd\u00c3\u00bdstealing\u00c3\u00bd\u00c3\u00bd and \u00c3\u00bd\u00c3\u00bdlying\u00c3\u00bd\u00c3\u00bd to tribal members something traditional tribal leader never did. The TLI program aims to increase negative consequences of social disapproval, enforcement of tribal policies and cognitive dissonance. People change behavior due to legal, social, and moral consequences. TLI will directly impact social and moral effects of ethical infractions on the reservation. Through repeated examples and feedback of community members\u00c3\u00bd\u00c3\u00bd views on the most common ethical violations, tribal employees will be faced with the unacceptability of their behaviors.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Drug abuse-associated behavior continues to be a significant factor in the spread of HIV/AIDS in the United States - both directly and indirectly. The use of injection and non-injection illicit drugs, as well as alcoho\nl, can increase HIV transmission risk through its impact on decision making and sexual risk taking. To address this issue, State of the Art, Inc. (SOTA) proposes the development of an interactive educational resource entitled  HIV and Sober Intimate Behavi\nor  (HSIB) for gay men in substance abuse treatment that addresses the intersection of HIV risk and substance use within the context of the recovery process. At the center of the HSIB package is a computer-based, interactive simulation program that allows \naudiences to not only learn important skills, but to practice them within a virtual environment. HSIB strives to provide skill-building information for re-engaging in intimate behavior and relationships within a sober context, in order to help those in rec\novery reduce their HIV risk and avoid relapse in the face of psychosocial challenges. To accomplish this long-term objective, HSIB materials aim to 1) increase knowledge around healthy intimate behavior and reducing HIV risk, 2) teach skills around healthy\n intimate behavior that will help those in recovery to navigate obstacles, to maintain sobriety, and to reduce HIV risk, and 3) provide an opportunity for men in recovery to practice these skills and build self-efficacy around them. In Phase II, HSIB mater\nials will be produced based on research and prototype materials developed in Phase I, and qualitative and quantitative evaluations will be conducted. In-depth interviews with gay men in recovery and a focus group with substance abuse professionals will tak\ne place during the materials developmental stage in order to help ensure that HSIB materials match the values and needs of these audiences. Interviews and focus groups will be conducted by trained interviewers/moderators using standard qualitative research\n methods (Krueger, 1998), and cross-group comparisons will be made between treatment groups. A content review of materials by project advisors will supplement research and highlight any additional areas in need of revision. After revisions and production o\nf the final HSIB materials, a quantitative evaluation will measure their effectiveness in educating gay men in recovery about maintaining sobriety and reducing their risk of HIV infection/transmission, as well as building their motivation, self-efficacy, a\nnd intent to engage in preventive health behaviors. [Using a randomized control trial design, gay men in recovery will be randomized to a study group and post-intervention questionnaires will be administered one week and one-month after exposure. A compari\nson of intervention and control group scores on four-point scale measures will determine if responses significantly migrate toward opinions expressed in the materials.]         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The HIV/AIDS epidemic has had a dramatic effect on subs\ntance abuse treatment. HIV exposure has been directly linked to injection drugs through needle sharing, however non-injection drugs are also a factor as they impair judgment and elevate risk through unprotected sexual contact, a greater number of casual pa\nrtners, partners of unknown serostatus, an exchange of sex for drugs, and other high-risk behaviors. As the importance of drug abuse treatment in reducing the spread of HIV is recognized, emphasis is being placed on getting substance abusers into treatment\n and preventing relapse into prior high-risk behaviors. HIV prevention efforts for those in recovery must address sexual transmission risks as well as risks associated with injection drugs. By promoting HIV prevention within the context of recovery, HSIB r\nesearch and resources have the potential to help men initiate positive health behaviors that promote the maintenance of sobriety and the reduction of HIV ri",

OEC materials, including a DVD, parent booklet, and\n facilitator's guide, will be packaged for use by parents/significant caregivers of children ages 3-5 and by education and healthcare professionals who work with these parents and families.] [OEC strives to prevent childhood overweight and obesity by helpi\nng parents learn about and initiate nutrition and physical activity behaviors for their young children. To accomplish this objective, OEC materials will innovatively apply a cluster of three proven behavior change theories (Self-Management, Social Cognitiv\ne, and proven core parenting principles i.e. contingency management, praise and reinforcement, parent to child modeling, and consistency) with the following aims: 1) to increase parental knowledge around nutrition, physical activity, and screen time 2) to \nteach parents strategies for achieving success in health behavior change including the self- management skills of setting realistic goals, starting with small changes and creating progressive, short- term action plans 3) to motivate parents to adopt change\ns in these areas by showing profiles of real families modeling how to recognize an area for improvement and successfully navigate obstacles to change behavior. 4) to prevent increase in child BMI] In Phase II, OEC materials will be produced based on resear\nch and the revised creative plans. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative evaluations will be conducted. Prototype materials will be revised based on feedback from advisors and target audiences. Focus groups with target audiences (parents and professio\nnals who work with parents) will take place during the development stage to help ensure that OEC materials match the values and needs of these audiences.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of this project is improvement in the quality of acupuncture treatment. This will be accomplished by developing a tool (the Acusensor) capable of tracking acupuncture needle movement and force interac\ntions. The Acusensor will be applied immediately to improve acupuncture training and research, which will lead to improvements in clinical practice. Our specific aims include: 1) Improve the Acusensor prototype which currently measures needle torque, to ad\nditionally measure angular displacement (degrees of rotation), axial displacement (amount of up and down movement), and axial force. 2) Develop a user-friendly software interface displaying Acusensor data in a visual real-time format. This will enable user\ns to instantly view needling profiles oriented to needle motion or tissue force response. 3) The Acusensor will be used to characterize types (e.g. tonifying, dispersing) and styles (e.g. Japanese, Chinese) of needle manipulation. By objectively characteri\nzing needling manipulation techniques, researchers will be able to design future clinical trials which can answer important questions that have thus far remained untested (e.g. - Was the intended manipulation successfully replicated throughout the trial? A\nre certain manipulations more effective than others for specific clinical conditions?). 4) The Acusensor will be used to teach needle manipulation. Acupuncture students will use the Acusensor to enhance their ability to accurately and reliably reproduce ta\nrget manipulations demonstrated by their instructors. Needling technique is a notoriously difficult skill to master. This is compounded by the lack of tools with which to evaluate needling activity. By providing profiles of needling via a real-time graphic\n interface, this technology will potentially transform the teaching of needling techniques. This technology will allow users, for the first time, to test assumptions and improve practices related to a fundamental component of acupuncture  needling. It will\n provide a needed tool to acupuncture researchers, educators and clinicians which will ultimately be translated into improvements in the quality of acupuncture treatments for the benefit of patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acupuncture has been used by an\n estimated 8.2 million US adults - 2.1 million in 2001 alone. Acupuncture needling techniques vary widely and are difficult to replicate. Efforts to evaluate acupuncture needling have been hampered by a lack of objective measurement tools. The new Acusenso\nr technology will provide a needed tool to identify best practices related to acupuncture needling. Data gathered by this tool will be translated into improvements in the quality of acupuncture treatments for the benefit of patients.",

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that these del\nicate instruments be heat- sterilized between patients to reduce the risk of disease transmission. While autoclaving is the most versatile of these methods, many materials and instruments suffer irreversible damage when exposed to moist heat at the tempera\ntures and for the times required for sterilization. After several sterilization cycles, moist heat shortens the useful life of most Dental tools. Moist heat sterilization rapidly corrodes metal instruments and dulls blades.

The air/gas stream containing free radicals produced in the source will even be able to penetrate and efficiently sterilize instruments such as han\ndpiece inner channels. The proposed sterilization technology is safe, will not require chemicals, and will be simple in operation and maintenance free. Its simplicity and affordability resulting from operating at low-temperature and with low energy require\nments make it very suitable for developing a sterilization device for use in many Dental offices. During Phase I tests, an air stream containing free radicals produced in the source system effectively inactivated 100% of highly concentrated microorganisms \nin spore form deposited inside the narrowest DH channel at the temperature of the sterilization process maintained below 30oC in time less than 10 minutes.

Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should eliminate one of the major hurdles that keeps the U.S. from capitalizing upon the potential offered by hydrogen, which offers highly efficient and environmentally friendly \u00c2\u00bflimitless\u00c2\u00bf energy and would allow the U.S. to substantially reduce its dependence on foreign oil.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The 1993 discovery of small regulatory RNA molecules has taught us that the central dogma of molecular biology is much more complicated that originally thought. Rather than simply acting as a middle messenger in the qu\nest to build proteins, it seemed that specialized RNA molecules could subtly mold a cellular phenotype through post- transcriptional regulation. Subsequent research has revealed that miRNA molecules are involved in critical regulatory networks such as diff\nerentiation, stress response, and oncogenesis. Known as microRNAs (miRNAs), these very small (approximately 17-26 nucleotides) molecules are difficult to manipulate from a molecular biology perspective. The work discussed herein will develop and commercial\nize a unique molecular biology technique that significantly simplifies the identification and quantitation of microRNAs. The method takes advantage of the fact that miRNAs are processed by RNaseIII enzymes, which leave a characteristic fingerprint on their\n cleavage products that can be recovered with the appropriate molecular  bait . Results of a previous Phase I study are reported, in which proof of principle and initial results were obtained. The Phase II proposal outlines the experimental methodology tha\nt will refine the techniques, expand the portfolio, and design products that will bring the technology directly to bench scientists that lack any prior miRNA experience. This research effort will impact public health by providing researches with a next gen\neration miRNA discovery tolls. Currently, there is a substantial effort in academic and industry laboratories to discovery miRNAs, as well as their specific functions. This research represents a tremendous opportunity to enhance our understanding of develo\npment, cell proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle, and disease (e.g., cancer and viral infections). The products developed under this SBIR will enable a broad class of life science researchers in miRNA discovery.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II research project is to develop a prototype and proof of concept for the tag and reader that uses an innovative low power Clock-on-Demand (CoD) and baseband/ media access controller (MAC) calibration algorithm to be used with ultra wideband communication systems. The new CoD and algorithm are motivated by application of ultra wideband to the RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) market. In this prototype, the CoD and the baseband/MAC layer algorithm are implemented in standard CMOS for tag and the UWB receiver and narrowband receiver with discrete components for reader. The low power requirement is achieved by the CoD and by dividing the time into epochs and epochs into slots. The CoD only runs until the tag transmits its impulse in the relevant slot, and the reader decodes the ID representations of all tags by the slot number. Therefore, if an epoch is divided into 210 slots, an impulse by tag represents 10 bits of the information. The robustness is achieved by having an UWB impulse transmitter in the tag and by repeating the impulse in different epochs.  RFID is an exponentially growing market. However, the technology that supports its expansion is not able to provide robust communication and signaling between a tag and a reader. Furthermore, today?s technology only supports a low tag density (10s of tags/sec), while the applications that will fuel the exponential expansion of the RFID market, like point-of-sale, inventory management, shelf management, etc.,\nrequire 100s and 1000s of tags/sec.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) interventions have been shown to decrease cancer-related distress, foster emotional growth and improve immune functioning during treatment for breast cancer. CBSM interventi\nons use well-validated cognitive behavioral techniques such as relaxation and meditation training, cognitive restructuring, and communication skills training to increase active, adaptive coping and are typically delivered in a group setting. The present pr\noject aims to develop an online version of a CBSM intervention for women undergoing adjuvant treatment for early stage breast cancer. Phase I achievements included developing the user interface and two prototype modules of the web-based intervention. These\n two modules ( Introduction to Relaxation  and  Communication with Healthcare Providers ) were created with Talaria's proprietary software, are highly interactive, and are presented in a multimedia format. Two usability studies, one in- person and one onli\nne, with 62 current and past cancer patients, demonstrated high levels of approval, satisfaction, and ease-of-use. In Phase II goals are to develop the entire intervention and examine its effectiveness in a randomized clinical trial. This 10-module interve\nntion will consist of cognitive behavioral techniques adapted for web-presentation by Talaria's experienced eLearning team of clinicians, researchers, writers, programmers and multimedia experts. Each module will include self- assessment and targeted feedb\nack, didactic psychoeducation, interactive exercises, and opportunities for self-monitoring-- all tailored to the needs of women with early stage breast cancer. In addition, guided written self-disclosure exercises will promote emotional expression and a d\niscussion board will encourage group support. The web-based intervention will be usability tested and the final product will be evaluated in a randomized clinical trial with a sample of 120 women in adjuvant treatment for breast cancer. Women will be rando\nmly assigned to use the 10-week intervention with biweekly telephone assessments or to the telephone assessments alone. Outcome measures include patients' confidence in their coping abilities, benefit finding, quality of life, and cancer-related distress. \nWe plan to market this product directly to cancer patients, as well as to cancer care providers, hospitals, clinics and pharmaceutical companies that manufacture cancer medications. Public Health Relevance: Nearly 200,000 American women are diagnosed with \nbreast cancer every year. As they go through cancer treatment, many patients experience a significant decline in their quality of life due to stress, treatment side effects, anxiety, depression, and relationship difficulties. We propose to develop a web-ba\nsed version of Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management, an empirically supported intervention for women with breast cancer. This web intervention will be convenient, private and available for low cost to women regardless of location or insurance coverage.",

The Phase I module, Healthcare Dis\nparities, provides instruction in the evidence and causes of disparities and examines the changing meaning of race in healthcare. In Phase II, the Race IAT (Implicit Associations Test) followed by a debriefing will be incorporated in a second module on unc\nonscious biases. The third module of the course will provide data on racial/ethnic perspectives on healthcare and will include instruction in skills for improving dimensions of the patient-provider relationship that have been linked to healthcare dispariti\nes. Version 2 of the Healthcare Disparities Knowledge Test and a Virtual Patient Assessment will be developed for use in the outcome evaluation and will be included in the final product. The goals of the completed course are to increase self awareness of r\nacial attitudes, improve knowledge of racial/ethnic disparities, and enhance skills for patient-provider communication in order to eliminate healthcare disparities that are attributable to the patient-provider relationship. The completed e-learning course \nwill be evaluated in an online study with resident physicians using a four group, pre-post randomized design with multiple measures. Study measures will include demographic information, the revised knowledge test piloted in Phase I, scores on the Roter Int\neraction Analysis System (RIAS) used for coding audio recorded interactions in the Virtual Patient Assessment, a Liking Scale, and user evaluations of the course. The completed course will be marketed to healthcare organizations and professional associatio\nns as well as schools of medicine and residency training programs as a resource in the national campaign to eliminate healthcare disparities. 7. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Following the Institute of Medicine's landmark report Unequal Treatment, the evidence \nbase on the nature and causes of healthcare disparities continues to grow, policy statements and program guidelines are published, and yet a large number of physicians remain disturbingly unaware of the disparities in their field of practice. The goal of t\nhe Healthcare Disparities: Patients and Providers e-learning course is to eliminate disparities that may be due to patient-provider interactions by improving knowledge about disparities, promoting reflection on providers' unconscious bias, and enhancing sk\nills for communication and relationship building with racial/ethnic minority patients. The course will be one resource in the multilevel campaign to eliminate racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare by 2010.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project will develop a patent-drafting software tool which addresses two critical problems currently preventing inventors from closely collaborating with patent attorneys: 1. Attorneys need tools to hold their comprehension of and manipulate the relations in the document while ensuring they're used correctly and 2. Inventors need an ability to share the attorney's comprehension of the relations, review the application at any time, and author parts of the specification without requiring extensive oversight or rework by the attorney.  The project will entail prototyping a set of collaborative knowledge representation methodologies, which are not currently available on any platform and which require cutting-edge, broadband-enabled infrastructure.  The U.S. economy relies heavily and increasingly upon intellectual property, and patents are the primary currency of this economy. 500,000 utility patent applications will be filed in 2008 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), a quantity that has been growing annually at 7.5% for a decade. As patents become more significant in the operations and outcome of U.S. businesses, it becomes increasingly important to assure that the system can be efficiently traversed by high-technology startups, which will provide the next-generation of innovations. A U.S. patent application typically costs $10,000 and requires either specialized knowledge or the time to learn how to navigate the process. The large expense and difficulty of patents leads companies to triage protection for their\ninnovations, leading to curtailment of promising activities due to the lack of a budget for patent protection.  They must decide whether to divert precious capital and engineering resources from product development to patenting. The proposed patent-drafting software tool will encourage greater participation in the intellectual property economy by reducing costs, increasing relevance, and allowing inventors to actively participate in drafting the application.",

The unintended consequence of this shift is that many young adults with mild and mode\nrate ID are at increased risk of falling through the cracks. Due to a lack of social competency, awareness, and social support, they are at increased risk of involvement in behaviors and activities that could result in harm (e.g., substance abuse, crime). \nSubstance abuse and crime prevention training has not been adequately addressed for this vulnerable population Phase II will expand on the work accomplished during development of the Phase I R-SAC prototype (i.e., Refuse-Substance, Alcohol, Crime), and cre\nate a series of three interactive DVD programs for young adults with mild and moderate intellectual disabilities (ID). Tailored by sex and content mastery, the repeat-visit programs will address issues and concerns faced by young adults with ID, who are de\nveloping into autonomous citizens, with the same rights and risks as you and I. The R-SAC program series, commercially titled 1) Staying Out of Harm's Way: Strategies for Avoiding Alcohol Misuse; 2) Staying Out of Harm's Way: Strategies for Avoiding Substa\nnce Abuse; and 3) Staying Out of Harm's Way: Strategies for Avoiding Crimes and the People who Commit Them, will 1) provide knowledge about legal aspects and potential harm related to alcohol abuse, illicit substances, and antisocial or criminal behavior; \n2) teach an observation strategy (i.e., Stop-Look-Listen) using examples specific to each program's focus (e.g., substances-program one; alcohol- program two; antisocial behavior-program three); 3) model an array of avoidance and refusal strategies using e\nxamples specific to that program's content, and finally, 4) provide practice scenarios, requiring program users to integrate knowledge and observation skills and successfully apply refusal strategies to real-time video-based on-screen simulations portrayin\ng peer pressure to engage in harmful activities.

        "abstract": "Future neutrino experiments will require neutrino beam intensities beyond the capabilities of today's sources. These experiments will require high-energy neutrinos from muon decay. The muons need to be cooled, and, in order to reduce costs, the number of cooling elements should minimized. However, breakdown of the accelerating cavities is expected to limit the performance of any proposed beam system. This project will help researchers use simulation to understand the breakdown of metallic structures planned for muon beam systems, enabling them to reduce the length and thereby the cost of future accelerators. It will implement new physics algorithms relevant to breakdown and add them to an existing library of routines developed to model plasma/material interactions. The project will also make existing codes easier to use for non-experts.The Phase I project successfully modeled breakdown with parameters relevant to present muon cooling systems using two well-known commercial particle-in-cell codes. It also improved the user interface to one of the codes by improving the parallel computing features, allowing users to get answers more quickly. The work demonstrated the utility of these code enhancements by successfully modeling breakdown near a micron-sized surface imperfection with applied magnetic field for conditions similar to copper cavities presently being tested by muon collider researchers. The Phase II project will extend the physics algorithms improvements and improvements to the code user interface. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Routines implemented here, such as plasma radiation effects and models of multiple ionization processes, are important to the Air Force community and to researchers developing more energy-efficient commercial lighting.",

        "abstract": "Gamma ray detectors are widely used devices in nuclear physics research. The GRETINA gamma ray detector signi\u00c2\u00bfcantly improves upon existing technologies like Gammasphere due to its novel segmentation design, however much work is needed in order to maximize its full capabilities. In particular, there are problematic regions on the detector that could strongly bene\u00c2\u00bft from high \u00c2\u00bfdelity computational modeling. This project will develop accurate bulk-and surface-transport models of charged carriers as well as codes for computing the electric \u00c2\u00bfelds in the GRETINA crystals. Moreover, we will focus our e\u00c2\u00bforts on poorly understood regions of the devices such as the passivated surface where the measured signals are highly pathological. These developments will yield a more accurate set of basis signals from which to e\u00c2\u00bfciently determine the location of gamma ray events. Ultimately, this will vastly improve the performance of these detectors.  Monte Carlo models of charged carrier bulk-transport were developed during Phase I. Re\u00c2\u00bfnements were also developed along with prototype codes for computing the electric \u00c2\u00bfeld in the entire crystal. The codes reproduce results from commercially available software. The Phase II project will extend the code to more accurately model transport in the crystal bulk, implement methods for computing surface carrier transport on problematic passivated surfaces, and extend \u00c2\u00bfeld calculation code to incorporate more realistic boundary conditions. The new computational infrastructure will then be used to understand the surface physics of the GRETINA detectors.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This project will enhance modeling both bulk-and surface-transport in semiconductors.

Most of this is disposed of by land spreading, but soil and water pollution issues make this an expensive operation for large animal producers. Terrenew is developing a series of products that use dairy manure to produce useful products. Among these are OilMaster 7x, a loose bagged dried manure material for oil and other spill pickup; this product is renewable and is expected to replace a material with a large carbon footprint, clay granules. We also are producing pads, sheets, booms and the like for oil removal from solid and water surfaces. This is expected to replace nonrenewable polypropylene sheets for the same uses. We also have a series of horticultural uses for pads. Terrenew expects to need to produce about 1 million pounds of dry manure for its various uses in the coming year, with rapid growth of its products nationwide.

        "abstract": "American forests have the potential to provide environmentally sustainable, carbon-neutral raw material for much of the nation\u00c2\u00bfs energy and chemical synthesis needs.  However, wood has not been used to produce chemicals and biofuels because current technology cannot efficiently separate cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin (the major components of wood) for downstream processing.  The major difficulty in fractionating wood is breaking the ether bonds between the lignin and hemicelluloses components.  Currently, pulp and paper mills rely primarily on chemical means to break these bonds, but chemical methods have many disadvantages:  damage to cellulose fibers; inability to cleanly separate the constituents; and serious environmental challenges.  In this project, a fluorogenic model compound based on hemicelluloses will be used to bioprospect for enzymes that cleave the ether bonds between lignin and hemicelluloses.  In Phase I, a microorganism designated B603 that secretes an enzyme capable of breaking ether bonds has been discovered.  The enzyme was isolated, and its activity on native lignin-hemicelluloses complexes was verified.  In Phase II, processes will be developed to (1) apply the enzyme to the pre-treatment of wood chips in pulp mills; and (2) more efficiently convert wood into chemicals, for use in integrated forest biorefineries.  Finally, molecular biology techniques will be used to facilitate the large scale production of the enzyme. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  As a pre-treatment for wood chips in a pulp mill, the new enzyme should allow previously wasted hemicelluloses to be recovered and added back to the pulp, thereby increasing yield.  Alternatively, the hemicellulose could be converted via fermentation into an array of fine chemicals and energy products, including ethanol.  Broadly speaking, the technology would allow wood, a renewable resource, to be used to meet a significant portion of America\u00c2\u00bfs energy and chemical needs.  As a consequence, the corn currently slated for ethanol production could again be directed to food products, and America\u00c2\u00bfs pulp and paper industry (and the rural towns where mills are located) would receive a much needed economic boost.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This SBIR Phase II proposal is a plan to further develop a new therapeutic approach that will save the lives of patients with sepsis (especially surgical sepsis), a condition that affects 750,000 people every year in th\ne United States alone and also causes high mortality worldwide. Although activated protein C [APC, Drotrecogin alpha (activated), Xigris. marketed by Eli Lilly] is the only FDA- approved specific treatment for sepsis, it cannot be used in surgical patients\n with sepsis due to its adverse effects on coagulation. Thus, there is an even greater need for an effective novel treatment for surgical sepsis. Successful development of a new anti-sepsis therapy will not only have a positive impact on health care, but i\nt will also have highly significant commercial benefits. The global market potential for sepsis treatment is estimated at over  30 billion annually. We have recently discovered that vascular responsiveness to adrenomedullin (AM), a newly-reported potent va\nsoactive peptide, decreases during sepsis in the rat and is markedly improved by its novel binding protein (i.e., AMBP-1). Treatment with rat AM combined with human AMBP-1 improved cardiovascular function, attenuated tissue injury and inflammatory response\ns, and reduced mortality in a rat cecal ligation and puncture (CLP, induced by surgery) model of sepsis, suggesting that AM/AMBP-1 may be an effective treatment for human sepsis. One obstacle hampering the development of AM/AMBP-1 as a therapeutic agent fo\nr sepsis is the potential immunogenicity of rat proteins in humans. In this regard, the primary objective of our Phase I proposal was to determine the effect of human AM/AMBP-1 on sepsis-induced organ injury, inflammation, and mortality. We have achieved t\nhese milestones using the rat CLP model of sepsis. In the Phase I project, we have clearly demonstrated the efficacy of human AM/AMBP-1 and thereby established the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed Phase II project. However, the extremely hig\nh cost of commercial human AMBP- 1 limits the further development of human AM/AMBP-1 as an anti-sepsis therapy. To overcome this difficulty, we have successfully isolated and purified AMBP-1 from normal human serum at a much lower cost. We therefore contin\nue to hypothesize that the administration of human AM/AMBP-1 late after the onset of sepsis attenuates tissue injury and improves survival. In this Phase II proposal, we will first, scale up the production of human AMBP-1 and, then, perform additional effi\ncacy studies in order to determine the optimal protective dosage of human AM/AMBP-1 in sepsis in the rat. Moreover, the pharmacokinetic characterization of human AM/AMBP-1 in sepsis will be assessed. To advance our technology to the clinical trials, the ef\nficacy of human AM/AMBP-1 will be investigated in a swine model of sepsis. These proposed studies should provide sufficient preclinical data that will allow us to file an IND application to the FDA to initiate clinical trials in order to obtain the commerc\nial utilization of human AM/AMBP-1 as a safe and effective therapy for patients with sepsis, especially those who develop sepsis after trauma or major surgery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death in most intensive care unit\ns. Over 210,000 people succumb to this overwhelming infection in the United States annually. A recent epidemiologic study estimated that about 750,000 people develop sepsis each year at a cost of  16.7 billion nationally. Given the intensive and prolonged \ncare necessary to treat patients with sepsis, the economic burden is profound. Thus, there is an urgent unmet medical need for an effective novel therapy for septic patients.",

        "abstract": "The recovery of heat currently wasted in exhaust gases can reduce fuel consumption in almost every commercial and industrial sector.  In the electricity generation sector alone, even modest improvements in energy recovery effectiveness would result in billions of dollars in savings annually.  New materials made from conductive graphite have created a significant opportunity to produce heat exchangers for energy recovery from exhausts.  This project seeks to advance this technology in preparation for the commercialization of energy recovery products, initially for microturbine generators and ultimately for thermal power generation by utilities.  In Phase I, new elements made from conductive graphite materials performed beyond their thermal engineering and reliability expectations, demonstrating that they are ideal for exhaust heat recovery.  Issues with bonding, sealing, pressure drop, thermal stresses, corrosion, and maintenance were overcome with solutions appropriate for commercial products.  Phase II will extend these results and culminate in full-scale field studies.  In particular, the conductive graphite materials will be optimized to maximize the recovery of energy from generator exhausts; robustness, reliability, and performance will be measured under practical operating conditions; and manufacturing tools will be advanced to optimize element fabrication.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The graphite heat exchangers should enable more energy to be removed from exhausts because graphite does not corrode in condensing combustion products.  Costs should be reduced because the graphite would significantly extend the lifespan of energy-recovery heat exchangers.  In addition to electricity generation, the technology should be applicable to energy recovery in residential, commercial, and industrial refrigeration and air conditioning; chemical, petroleum, and industrial plants; and automobiles, trucks, trains, and aircraft.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Phase II SBIR project is to develop and build an Engineering Demonstration version of a unique and innovative truly three-dimensional (3D) display for use with 3D Medical data and in Medical Telepresenc\ne applications. There are presently many pseudo-3D displays - generally stereoscopic/two-view, or projection of one plane at a time on to a volume display, or requiring glasses/goggles. These displays all suffer from various problems, and are generally not\n very satisfactory in use. A truly 3-D display (move your head - see something different) would tremendously improve remote (telepresence) robotic surgery, medical teaching, diagnosis, and sharing of three-dimensional kinds of medical data (CT scans, MRI s\ncans, PET scans, acoustic scans, . . .) either at the instrument or between networked sites. The proposed 3D display uses broadband illumination ( white light , not laser) so that there are no questions about eye-safety of the device. The proposed research\n has the goal of producing a compact, cost-effective, true 3D display projector. The Phase I SBIR feasibility project has successfully demonstrated two full-color angular-slice channels of such a 3D display. This device will in its many-channel version not\n only present a no-goggles high-resolution different view to each eye (stereopsis - one requirement for true 3D), but will also have parallax or look-around - when a viewer moves her head or moves to a different position she will see something different - \njust like the real world.         The state of the art in electro-optic components, illumination sources, and computational speed has advanced to the point that it is now feasible to create a truly 3D display. A Third Dimension Technologies Phase I project\n has shown both theoretically and experimentally that the concepts of holographic stereography (which uses film to simultaneously display many views of an object for static true 3D) can be translated into the electronic age. Digital components and a hologr\naphic optical element combine many Angular Slice channels into a true 3D view. This Phase II SBIR project will build on the theoretical and experimental results from the Phase I project to develop and construct the hardware and software for at least 20 cha\nnnels of an Angular Slice True 3D Display.",

Improving confinement and fueling in magnetic fusion devices can significantly improve the practicality of reactors by making them smaller, and easier to ignite and maintain.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Problematic peer relations, particularly when chronic, can have a tremendous impact on children's functioning and mental health. Decades of research indicate that peer rejection, isolation, and victimization negatively \nimpact adjustment and place children at increased risk for a myriad of later negative outcomes. Prevention and treatment research supports the use of social skills group therapy for improving children's peer relations, social behavior, and emotional adjust\nment. However, focusing exclusively on the child is not as effective as multi-component intervention efforts that extend beyond the group setting. This Competing Renewal project will continue the research and development of a parent-focused intervention, P\narent Guide to SSGRIN, which parallels an established child-focused intervention [Social Skills Group Intervention (S.S. GRIN); for children ages 5-12years], in order to teach and reinforce the same social skills and concepts within the home environment. P\nhase II objectives of creating the complete Parent Guide intervention product and conducting pilot efficacy research were successfully accomplished. However, the limited scope of the Phase II research project leaves critical questions unanswered regarding \nthe treatment's effectiveness, particularly its relative impact above and beyond the SSGRIN intervention alone. As 3-C ISD has moved the Parent Guide product into Phase III commercialization, it has become increasingly evident that further RandD is critica\nl to commercializing this product. Therefore, a primary goal of this Competing Renewal is to conduct a rigorous, large-scale, longitudinal research project that is adequately powered to address questions of relative impact, longer-term treatment benefits, \nand differential treatment effects across settings and populations. Another lesson learned during Phase II and subsequent commercialization efforts is that the Parent Guide's current design is impractical for the school setting. Though schools often strugg\nle with how to increase parent involvement in school-based programs, school officials report that it is infeasible for them to conduct the full series of in-person parent training groups as the Parent Guide's current curriculum demands. As a result, the co\nmmercial potential for the product is greatly restricted. Therefore, a second goal of this Competing Renewal is to incorporate Phase II findings, commercialization feedback, and stakeholder input into the creation of a Home-study version of the Parent Guid\ne, which would utilize 3-C's innovative web- and video- based technology to bridge training into the home environment. Once developed, the Home-study version of the Parent Guide will be included as a separate treatment condition within the effectiveness tr\nial and will also be evaluated for feasibility specifically within the school setting. The proposed Competing Renewal project will support further product development so that the Parent Guide can be successfully extended into the school setting, a primary \nmental health service sector for children, and will also ensure extensive, large-scale testing of this product to address key research questions that are imperative for achieving both scientific and commercial goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Problematic pe\ner relations, particularly when chronic, can have a tremendous impact on children's mental health as well as their behavioral and emotional functioning. Without intervention, social and behavioral problems tend to persist and escalate over time which, in t\nurn, has a tremendous impact on the development of psychopathology. Ultimately, socio-emotional deficits and the consequent emergence of a myriad of negative outcomes, including heightened risk for psychiatric disorders and use of mental health services ha\nve a negative impact not only on the individual, but also on the family and society as a whole, and are considered a serious public health issue.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Antisocial behavior and violence are a national crisis disproportionately affecting Black youth (Cicchetti and Lynch, 1993; Prothrow-Stith and Spivak,1992). A vast health disparity exists in which Black youth are signif\nicantly more likely to both be identified as exhibiting antisocial behavior and to be the victim of others' antisocial acts. For example, victimization rates for violent crimes are greater than 750% higher for Black adolescents compared to White adolescent\ns (Centers for Disease Control, 2004; Rachuba, Stanton, and Howard, 1995). The lack of culturally sensitive, evidence-based interventions for Black youth exacerbates the problem and hinders access to mental health services among Blacks (Mandersheid and Son\nnenschen, 1996). The goal of this Phase II project is to continue the research and development (RandD) of a child small group social-behavioral intervention curriculum, Celebrating the Strengths of Black Youth (CSBY), specifically designed to be culturally\n relevant and effective for Black youth. This Phase II project will build on Phase I findings to offer an innovative, much needed resource for preventing and decreasing existing behavioral health disparities in Black children (ages six to eight years old).\n CSBY will offer multi-media resources, including videos and interactive computer resources, and a skill-based curriculum specifically aimed at enhancing social and behavioral competencies. CSBY not only offers mental health (MH) professionals a significan\nt advancement over what is currently available for use with Black youth, but it also provides a unique means of bridging intervention settings with home efforts to promote cross-environment generalization in social and behavioral functioning. During Phase \nII, the complete CSBY product will be developed, revised, and extended through a series of Alpha and Beta tests. During the course of product development, the 3-C development team will draw on the Advisory Council forthis project, as well as relevant3-C Sc\nientific Advisory Board members to review product materials, provide feedback, and aid development through resources and contacts, as needed. The planned iterative development and feedback by diverse stakeholders will produce a product that will be widely \napplicable, usable, and acceptable, thereby increasing its commercial potential. Once completed, the CSBY Beta prototype will be scientifically evaluated. In addition to program engagement and product evaluation measures, the efficacy of CSBY for enhancing\n children's social and behavioral functioning will be empirically tested through randomized trials within both school- and community-based settings. It is expected that Black youth participating in CSBY will be more engaged in treatment and show greater im\nprovement on social- behavioral indices compared to Black youth participating in an established generally-applicable social skills program (i.e., S.S.GRIN; DeRosier, 2006). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antisocial behavior and violence among youth has become a \nnational health crisis for which Black youth are disproportionately at risk (Cicchetti and Lynch, 1993; Prothrow-Stith and Spivak,1992). However, existing research on the effectiveness of specific strategies to reduce and prevent youth violence remains cha\nllenged by increasing diversity and the need to provide services that are both developmentally and culturally appropriate. The proposed product is consistent with what has been identified by several legislative mandates as necessary in addressing the chall\nenges of providing health care to differing ethnicities and fostering the development of cultural competence in service providers. The proposed product is also consistent with priorities identified by NICHD to help reduce or eliminate health disparities am\nong racial and ethnic minority populations (NICHD, 2000) as well as recommendations by the Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health (U.S. DHHS, 2001) for  tailoring serv",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): National survey data suggest the prevalence of problem behaviors in young children is between 10-25 percent (Webster-Stratton and Hammond, 1997). As children enter preschool and begin to navigate social situations outsi\nde the home, problem behaviors interfere with social development, placing children at risk for problematic peer relations and delayed social skills. Without intervention, social and behavioral problems tend to persist and even escalate over time and, in tu\nrn, have a tremendous impact on the development of child psychopathology. Decades of research indicate social and behavioral deficits negatively affect adjustment and place children at increased risk for a myriad of later negative outcomes including depres\nsion, substance abuse, and delinquency (see Parker, Rubin, Price and DeRosier, 1995, for review). In contrast, positive social relationships serve as a protective factor promoting more positive developmental outcomes. Prevention and treatment research supp\norts the use of social skills training (SST) for improving children's peer relations, social behavior, and emotional adjustment (see Greenberg, Domitrovich, and Bumbarger, 2001, for review). In addition, intervening with problematic social behaviors before\n they become chronic and intractable has been repeatedly heralded as a key to preventing the development of more serious maladjustment (Greenberg, et al.; Parker et al.). Early intervention is critical in the prevention of severe social skill deficits and \nentrenched negative peer interaction patterns (Coie, 1990). The goal of this Phase II project is therefore to continue the research and development of a version of an existing evidence-based small group SST program in order to make it applicable for younge\nr children. This project will adapt 3-C ISD's SST program for 6-12 year old children, SSGRIN (Social Skills Group Intervention), to create a new intervention for young children (ages 4-6 years) titled  SSGRIN-EC  (SSGRIN for Early Childhood). SSGRIN-EC wil\nl build on SSGRIN's foundation, as well as Phase I findings, to offer a unique early intervention resource that represents a significant advancement over what is currently available for SST with young children. SSGRIN-EC will provide mental health professi\nonals with an innovative intervention program to enhance the emotional competencies and social relations of young children. SSGRIN-EC will offer multi-media resources, including video and interactive web resources, and a skill based curriculum specifically\n aimed at enhancing social skills competencies. It also provides a unique means of bridging intervention settings with home efforts to promote social and emotional functioning. The Phase I results provide substantial support for continued development, as w\nell as essential constructive feedback to inform the direction of that development. The proposed Phase II project will utilize the Phase I findings to revise, modify, and extend the SSGRIN-EC components in order to maximize quality and effectiveness. Once \nfinalized, a scientific evaluation of the efficacy of the intervention for mastery of social skills concepts and positive changes in social, emotional, and behavioral functioning will be conducted. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Problematic peer relations, particularl\ny when chronic, can have a tremendous impact on children's mental health as well as their academic, behavioral, and emotional functioning. Without intervention, social and behavioral problems tend to persist and escalate over time which, in turn, has a tre\nmendous impact on the development of psychopathology. Development of psychiatric disorders due to socio-emotional deficits is a public health concern with annual US economic, indirect cost of mental illnesses estimated at  79 billion. Cost-effectiveness an\nalyses of social skills training programs with even modest effect sizes estimated a monetary savings of more than  95,000 per participant and more than  8 r",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improved understanding of the role of growth factors as biochemical mediators of wound healing has paved the way for a new family of bioactive therapeutic products to expedite wound healing. Delivery of growth factors (\nrecombinant or as autologous platelets) has emerged as a possible commercial opportunity for improving the clinical outcomes of soft, bone, and connective tissue repair. However, wide acceptance of growth factors to accelerate wound healing has been hamper\ned because current recombinant and autologous platelet growth factor-based products are prohibitively expensive and current methods for procurement of autologous platelets are cumbersome and time consuming. Moreover, none of the current platelet harvesting\n devices has FDA approved claims for wound healing. The applicants have developed a simple and inexpensive technique to rapidly obtain autologous platelet concentrate from blood (lt10 min) without the need for expensive equipment. The process has been char\nacterized and optimized to achieve high yields of platelets with normal growth factor content, and the safety and efficacy of the resulting platelet concentrate in accelerating cell proliferation in vitro and improved wound healing in animal models in vivo\n has been demonstrated. The objectives of this Phase II continuation application are to: (i) design and manufacture an automated device that is fully disposable to improve the robustness of platelet recovery and to further minimize operator involvement, an\nd (ii) to establish clinical efficacy of the harvested platelet concentrate in promoting cutaneous wound healing. Product development activities will include computer aided design and manufacturing, rapid prototyping, molding, assembly, preclinical testing\n, and establishing a quality assurance program leading to Good Manufacturing Practices for limited production of the device. The clinical study will focus on treating acute skin wounds and venous ulcers with the obtained platelet concentrates using a proto\ncol based on FDA guidance documents for wound healing studies. Results of this study using a convenient and affordable device could indicate, for the first time, the clinical utility of autologous platelet concentrates in accelerating cutaneous wound closu\nre based on a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Successful outcome of this trial is expected to lead to the first autologous platelet concentrate with FDA approved wound healing claims, which could encourage widespread use of the applican\nts' device to augment wound healing. The affordability and convenience of the product being developed in this project will allow growth factor-mediated wound healing to reach diverse patient populations in a wide variety of situations from well-equipped op\nerating rooms to minimally equipped remote battlefield medical units.",

        "abstract": "The steam cycle process used in coal-fired plants requires about 38 gallons of water per kilo-watt hour of electricity produced.  The water is used mostly for steam cooling with a lesser quantity used for pollution control devices.  This project will develop a novel, low-cost, vapor distillation technology that will enable municipal wastewater and non-traditional waters to be used as process water for coal power plants.  An important feature the approach is the use of stack gas waste heat \u00c2\u00bf which otherwise would be discharged into the atmosphere \u00c2\u00bf for cleaning the contaminated water through a humidification/dehumidification process carried out at atmospheric pressure.  Access to this heat stream is relatively easy and would not require a major redesign of the plant or a major shutdown for installation, making this technology economically attractive.  Technical feasibility was demonstrated in Phase I.  Phase II will involve measuring the operating parameters of the vapor distillation concept in a 1000 gallon per day pilot plant,   producing a preliminary design for a representative plant, and using the design to estimate construction and operating costs.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should become suitable for retrofit to a large number of U.S. power plants.  If 500 power plants (at an average size of 600 MW) used the technology, the volume of water recovered would be one billion gallons per day.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  National guidelines (e. g., American Academy of Pediatrics, 2002; New Freedom Commission, 2003) call for primary care clinicians to screen for and triage problems related to mental health, development, and family functioning. However, most clinicians lack the time to adequately perform these services and have limited information regarding available and appropriate screening tools, treatments, and referral options. The Child Health and Development Interactive System for Infants and Toddlers (CHADIS 0-3) is a web-based tool designed to assist  pediatricians in better assessing and managing mental health and developmental problems among infants, toddlers, and their families, while also streamlining other requirements of the pediatric visit. Through CHADIS 0-3, parents complete questionnaires assessing child and family functioning online via a secure website. This information is summarized and translated to an electronic clinician worksheet for use by the pediatrician during the visit. This worksheet also provides the clinician with linked educational text for his/her use, as well as linking identified problems directly to a database of resources for parents, including educational text, recommended books and other products, and local specialists relevant to the problem(s).This proposal focuses on finalizing CHADIS 0-3 through consultation with national experts and through focus groups and pilot testing, and subsequently assessing its validity, acceptability, and feasibility in preparation for marketing the product. Phase I efforts will include: testing the system's technology; vetting of the system by national experts in infant/toddler mental health and pediatrics; focus groups and pilot testing by parents and pediatricians; and an assessment of test-retest reliability. Phase II efforts will be centered on the assessment of CHADIS' validity, acceptability, and feasibility. Four hundred fifty caregivers of infants and toddlers ages 4-36 months from two general and one NICU graduate clinics will complete CHADIS questionnaires prior to pediatric visits. Caregivers and their children will then attend their scheduled visits, in which participating physicians will use CHADIS data and tools. Caregivers will also complete comparison measures assessing infant/toddler and family functioning to evaluate validity. Measures of satisfaction will be completed by caregivers, as well as physicians and office staff. Once feasibility is proven, a number of possible marketing options can be explored. Child health professionals will want to use it to enhance their clinical work. EMR vendors will see value added by CHADIS. Other professionals such as home visitors and therapists can benefit from using CHADIS. Finally, online CHADIS data can be shared by all professionals involved with a family, forming a communication network and making CHADIS of potential value to systems of care. The proposed research has significant public health implications in that it focuses on the development of a web-based assessment tool called the Child Health and Development Interactive System (CHADIS) 0-3 that enables child health providers to fulfill the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics and Surgeon General for universal mental health screening. CHADIS 0-3 also comprises a point of contact clinician education and resource identification tool and communication mechanism to help users better address the problems identified. Should CHADIS 0-3 prove valid, acceptable, and feasible, as is expected to be determined in this proposal, and widely disseminated more positive mental health of children and families and improved functional long term outcomes may be obtained.",

Accurate measurement of CO would a\nllow for better assessment of therapies and thereby improve patient health care. Conventional methods used with adults for routine CO measurement are not suitable to be used with the subject population due to small sized vessels in these patients besides p\nrocedural complexities. Thus, overall objective of this project is to implement FDA recommendations into the First Minimally Invasive Cardiac Monitor for routine use with the neonatal and low weight pediatric ICU population, using extant catheters in ICU p\natients. This approach, which is based on the well-established indicator dilution principles, has several advantages including: needs no additional invasiveness, independent of patient size, uses innocuous isotonic saline as indicator, no contact with pati\nents blood, needs less than 5 minutes to establish the set up, no special training is needed to use HCP101 etc. HCP101 was developed and tested during the SBIR Phase II grant period (# 5 R44 HL61994-03), for its applicability during in vitro and in vivo st\nudies. Procedure for measurement of CO using HCP101 and the results from the studies conducted were presented to the FDA at a Pre-IDE meeting. FDA suggested specific safety and testing requirements for HCP101 at the Pre-IDE meeting before making the device\n commercially available. This formed the basis for this SBIR Phase II Continuation grant proposal and the objectives of this proposal are: (1) design the necessary hardware and software adjustments to implement the recommended safety features into HCP101; \n(2) conduct FDA recommended specific animal and human studies to test the robustness of the safety features incorporated and optimize the device features; (3) test the clinical ability of HCP101 to detect septal defects during animal and human studies; (4)\n validate HCP101 - CO measurements with those obtained from standard procedures (using perivascular probes/thermodilution method) and (5) finally proceed with the required IDE and 510(k) submissions. The above objectives will be achieved by studies at 2 an\nimal and 5 human study sites - in different sub-groups to achieve a wide range of data encompassing several conditions and physiological variants. Standard testing including: biocompatibility, electrical safety tests etc. would be conducted for the complet\ne HCP101 device and the extracorporeal AV disposable loop. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Measurement of Cardiac Output is vital and is routinely done in adult population. There currently exists no technique to measure CO in about 30,000 (in USA per year) neonate\ns (0.4-2.5Kg) and low weight pediatric (2.5Kg+) ICU patients due to small size vessels in these patients and procedural complexities. HCP101 will become the First Minimally Invasive System to measure CO in this vulnerable population.",

Unfortunately, their doctors currently cannot objectively determine when a child's heart and lungs are strong\n enough to safely wean from life support. Transonic proposes to meet this need by developing the first non-invasive device that can measure cardiac output at the end of the surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass, and at the conclusion of Veno-Arterial Ex\ntracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (VA ECMO). It will also be able to measure the catheter recirculation during Veno-Venous (VV) ECMO, which subsequently allows the calculation of mixed venous oxygen saturation. The proposed device relies on existing dispos\nable tubing connected to existing ECLS cannulas. The measurements are made by injecting small amounts of isotonic saline into the extracorporeal tubing. Ultrasonic flowsensors clamped onto the extracorporeal tubing measure flow and saline dilution over tim\ne. The resulting saline indicator dilution curves allow calculation of recirculation, mixed venous oxygen saturation, and cardiac output. This configuration eliminates the need for further surgical invasion and ensures that the measurement procedure is saf\ne, quick, accurate, and inexpensive. These measurements could improve the efficacy of therapy and could reduce the average US 120,800/patient cost of ECLS treatment. The Phase-I bench, animal, and clinical studies demonstrated the feasibility of this measu\nrement approach. The proposed Phase-II program will build from this success, and will design, build, and test improved clamp-on flowsensors, robust software, and a stand-alone touch-screen monitor. The improved devices will undergo bench and animal testing\n prior to clinical studies at four ECLS/ECMO centers. The Phase-II clinical studies will form the basis for a Phase-III FDA clearance and manufacturing authorization. The resulting pediatric ECLS monitor would reduce pediatric morbidity/mortality and the a\nssociated health care costs, and would be marketable worldwide in every pediatric hospital that performs heart surgery and/or that has an ECLS program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Each year nearly 30,000 children worldwide undergo Extra-Corporeal Life Support\n (ECLS) each year, at an average cost of US 120,800 per patient and total costs of US 3.6 Billion/year. While the treatments can save lives, doctors currently cannot objectively determine when a child's heart and lungs are strong enough to safely remove li\nfe support. The proposed technology will provide doctors with a new non-invasive device to measure a child's heart/lung function during and after ECLS, which may lead to better treatments, shorter hospital stays, and significantly reduced treatment costs.",

        "abstract": "Coal is used to generate more than half of the electricity in the United States.  However, coal has a range of mercury-related environmental disadvantages:  (1) emissions of mercury via the flue gas, and (2) environmental releases of mercury during subsequent processing and disposal of byproducts.  This project will address both concerns through the use of chemical additives in the power plant\u00c2\u00bfs flue gas desulfurization (FGD) system.  These additives will sequester mercury into the liquid phase, prevent mercury re-emissions into the flue gas, prevent precipitation and adsorption of mercury on primary FGD byproducts such as gypsum, and subsequently precipitate mercury from the FGD wastewater as a stable solid byproduct that is segregated from other FGD solid byproducts.  In Phase I, laboratory testing using a bench-scale scrubber test apparatus demonstrated that the technology can control re-emissions of mercury and that the mercury can be subsequently removed from the scrubber wastewater and concentrated into a stable solid waste product.  An engineering cost analysis demonstrated that the technology would be economical and competitive with other control strategies.  Phase II initially will involve additional laboratory testing to further refine the chemistry, and the selection of the additives and process conditions.  Then, a larger pilot-scale demonstration will be conducted at two host utility sites, using actual flue gas and the FGD scrubbing slurry from the utility.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The proposed technology should have extensive commercial applications in the electric utility industry at both new and existing coal-fired power plants equipped with wet FGD scrubbing systems.  The public would benefit through reduced exposure to mercury emitted from power plant stacks and through reduced exposure to the mercury-containing FGD byproducts during their disposal or re-use in gypsum wallboard products and agriculture applications.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Electrophysiological and mechanical interactions in the fetus are largely unstudied. There is an established need to enhance the current echocardiography/Doppler capabilities of recognizing the fetus at risk of life th\nreatening cardiac complications. Direct simultaneous comparison of fetal magnetocardiography using Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) magnetometry and Doppler will allow, for the first time, assessment of electromechanical disturbances ass\nociated with heart failure and severe arrhythmia. This instrument will directly address the fetal cardiac disorders that effect about 1-3% of all pregnancies. This proposal aims to develop an fMCG vector gradiometer instrument specifically designed for com\nbined use with echocardiography for the characterization of the intrauterine clinical condition of fetuses with life- threatening arrhythmias, acquired heart failure, and structural congenital heart disease. The system will have in addition a very small ta\nil and radial gap so the echo probe can be positioned very closely over the same area. Compared to existing conventional one-component magnetometers, the instrument will be inexpensive, lightweight and easily producible. The system can be either a stand-al\none or an add-on to existing MEG rooms. Neither of the existing MEG or MCG systems are designed for these types of measurements. In addition the system will make the use of at least one type of Echocardiac transducer reliable when positioned 2 cm from the \nbase of the system. This probe will be capable of being rigid adjacent to the system or adjustable in rotation and tilt remotely as desired. Several key technical issues were identified, which will be addressed in Phase II. Vector coils are needed to ensur\ne that the (arbitrarily positioned) fetal heart can be detected with reasonable signal strength. There is a need to stabilize the transducer, while permitting the required degree of maneuverability for ultrasound imaging. Third is the need to reduce the si\nze of the fMCG sensor array in order to provide greater access to the maternal surface for echo/Doppler imaging. Fourth is the development of optimal signal processing techniques for the new sensor configuration, particularly for reduction of non-stationar\ny low frequency interference. And fifth is the need to better study the relationship between the echo/Doppler transducer positioning (angle and orientation) and the sensor array positioning, in order to facilitate the recording of additional or more tradit\nional Doppler planes while not compromising, and perhaps even facilitating the quality of the fMCG signal. The findings on Phase I generated enough knowledge to develop, and assured the need of a suitable instrument capable of simultaneous ultrasound/fMCG \nrecordings. The successful completion of this program has the potential to lead to a significant ability to identify fetal arrhythmias. In addition, this product should enhance assessment of fetal well-being by identifying risk factors for sudden fetal dea\nth, including cardiac ischemia, QT prolongation, and electromechanical dysfunction.     This proposal aims to develop better methods of characterizing the intrauterine clinical condition of fetuses with life-threatening arrhythmias, acquired heart failure,\n and structural congenital heart disease by the development of an economical, noninvasive simultaneous fetal echocardiography and magnetocardiography system. Direct simultaneous comparison of fetal magnetocardiographic (fMCG) recordings in conjunction with\n Echocardiography and Doppler (echo/Doppler), will enhance current echo/Doppler capabilities of recognizing the fetus at risk of life-threatening cardiac complications. We are developing the first instrument specially designed for these dual measurements.",

The PI, who was both co-inventor and co-developer with Genzyme of wild type recombinant human (rh) TSH (Thyrogen) currently approved for stimulation of diagnostic radioiodine uptake \nand thyroglobulin secretion, now proposes to develop a more potent and more efficacious second generation superactive analog of rh TSH for the 15-20% of poorly responsive thyroid cancer patients in diagnostic imaging as well as for the majority of such pat\nients for radioiodine therapy. Our previous structure-function studies resulted in the discovery of the first analogs of TSH and other glycoprotein hormones with major increases in receptor binding affinity and bioactivity. During our highly scored and suc\ncessfully completed phase 1 SBIR study we have achieved all the aims including developing stable cell lines producing high levels of the final two candidate superactive analogs; optimization of large scale bioreactor production methods; development of a no\nvel, high capacity purification methods suitable for commercial scale-up; rigorous quantification and characterization of purified analogs by multiple physicochemical methods, and proof of increased potency and efficacy in the now classic in vivo mouse rh \nTSH in vivo bioassay first developed by the PI. In the current phase 2 proposal, for which we have provided extensive preliminary data well beyond the aims of the phase 1 proposal, we plan to produce and purify additional large amounts (gt200mg) of the fin\nal two TSH analog candidates TR1401 and 1402 in the fibrous bed bioreactor sufficient for all the phase two in vivo studies using the methods of production and purification optimized in the phase one study. We also plan to develop and validate a novel immu\nnoassay for the detection of TSH analogs in unpurified rodent plasma that quantifies accurately and identically to rigorous HPLC methods which will then be used to determine the IV metabolic clearance rate and the IP, SC and IM phamacokinetics in rodents. \nMost importantly, in this phase two proposal we will examine for the first time multiple clinically relevant diagnostic and therapeutic endpoints of TSH action comparing TSH analogs TR1401 and 1402 to wild type (Genzyme) recombinant TSH in normal mice and \nin those with Ret/PTC1 and other transgenic mouse models of thyroid cancer. Specifically we will examine detailed dose response curves for both wild type and analog TSH in thyroidal 125I uptake by direct organ counting, diagnostic thyroidal PET imaging wit\nh 124I and 18 Fluorodeoxyglucose as well as therapeutic 131I -induced tumor regression. Finally, we will determine the possible complementation of the diagnostic and therapeutic effects of TR1401 and 1402 with those of selected newly developed protein kina\nse inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy of endocrine tissues and most patients require lifelong surveillance with diagnostic thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-stimulated radio-iodine imagin\ng to detect recurrent tumor. The PI and Co- Investigator have developed a much improved form of TSH and propose a completely new method of thyroid cancer imaging that should greatly improve early detection and lead to improved cancer treatment and survival\n.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the critical problems of tracking and monitoring firefighters or other first responders inside structures. Whereas many available systems such as GPS fail indoors or require an overwhelming number of access points to obtain accurate information, our system requires only a base station that can be quickly set up at a command post outside (or inside) a building and small devices worn by the responders. Our system sets up a mesh network to communicate data amongst responders, as well as between the responders and the command post base station(s). The mesh network extends the range of the base station by allowing data to be relayed through another team member if a responder goes out of range. Our prototype system has been demonstrated to provide accurate tracking and location of personnel performing simple motions in complex structures from a base station outside of the structure. This project will focus on improving tracking algorithms such that complex motions can be recognized and accurately tracked. The expected outcome of the project is a much improved interface between the typical command center and the first responders.  The initial market impacted by this project development is firefighter location and monitoring. Firefighting is one of the most dangerous jobs in the US. An average of 95 firefighters have been lost every year over the past decade. Some of these deaths could have been prevented if only the firefighter's distressed condition and\nexact position were known. No commercial technology currently exists that pinpoints the location of a downed firefighter. Critical time can be wasted before a downed firefighter is even first detected. Subsequently, critical resources are often diverted in frantic searches in hazardous conditions and extremely poor visibility. The seconds saved by knowledge of firefighter alarms and their positions could mean the difference between minor and severe injuries or death.",

The chair \nis comprised of a synthetic resin-based, wheelchair chassis mated to newly developed, compliant seating that corrects, aligns, and supports the child's individual structural deviations. The proposal produces preproduction units based on the model plastic c\nhassis and dynamically compliant seating prototype demonstrated with SBIR Phase I support. This development is part of a larger effort to extend the freedom of wheelchair design and materials use that Turbo Wheelchair exhibited with the all plastic adult w\nheelchair, Merlexi Craft . This proposed children's wheelchair would support the NICHD mission to strive for healthy functioning of infants, children, youth and families and to support research to help persons with physical disabilities restore, replace, e\nnhance, and prevent decline in function. Experts specify unmet needs in wheelchairs for individuals with high tone. They require durability, light weight, adjustability, dynamic seating and modular components. These needs are especially critical for the wh\neelchair bound among the 100,000 children with cerebral palsy. Turbo Wheelchair will refine the plastic chassis components fabricated in Phase I to minimize the weight and redesign the caster assembly for greater durability. The air-supported seat concept \nintroduced in the Phase I model will be refined to idealize correction and alignment forces using expertise at CATEA (Ga. Tech) and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. Prototype chassis will be assembled from molded components after fabrication of molds (Car\no Polymers, Bessemer City, NC). Seating components will be developed with Folbot, Inc., North Charleston, SC. Mated components will undergo human studies testing and physical test and human studies data will be used for a redesign phase. Redesigned prototy\npes (24) will be fabricated for a second human studies evaluation, durability testing and functional review by a panel of scientific/medical experts. Pending successful review, the Company will file for FDA approval for sale and distribute a number of asse\nmbled chairs to children's medical center for internal use and comment prior to Phase III commercialization. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE. The need for a range of assistive devices that respond to the needs of a broad range of disabled individuals is a desirabl\ne public health goal.

Aluminized coatings developed over the last several years for tritium permeation barriers work well in the laboratory but fail in radiation environments. Because silicon carbide (SiC) applied via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) does not lose tritium permeability resistance under radiation, this project will develop a material system that uses fully dense CVD SiC as a tritium barrier bonded to ferritic steel, with a SiC foam or a ductile metallic foam layer serving as a compliant interlayer between the steel and the CVD SiC tritium barrier.  The composite structure offers significant advantages over current aluminized coatings, including high resistance to thermal- and radiation-induced stress, lower tritium diffusivity and solubility, and compatibility with the molten lead-lithium breeder/coolant.  In Phase I, the initial bonding of SiC foam/SiC-tritium-barrier specimens to ferritic steel substrates was demonstrated.  A matrix of dense SiC wafers was fabricated for deuterium permeation and tritium plasma testing.  Resistance to high temperature thermal cycling and thermal shock was demonstrated through furnace testing, and barrier component bond strength was established through shear testing.  The test results indicated that the concept has high potential for meeting the tritium barrier requirements of ITER test blanket modules.  In Phase II, the material system will be used in the fabrication of a tritium-barrier tube liner, and performance will be demonstrated by subjecting the component to deuterium permeation and deuterium/tritium plasma experiments. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Nuclear fusion is an ideal alternative to increasingly scarce and expensive fossil fuels and can provide a much greater quantity of environmentally sound energy than wind, solar, and geothermal sources.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop innovative high efficiency, low cost nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing technology from fly ash. Fly ash is a recycled material from coal power plants that may contain high concentrations of mercury and carbon. Traditional nitrogen fertilizer production uses natural gas as the primary feedstock and is very costly. The traditional fertilizers are water-soluble compounds, resulting in significant loss of fertilizer which in turn pollutes streams and ground water. America's coal power plants produce more than 71.1 million tons of fly ash per year, and most of it is disposed in landfills. The high mercury content in the fly ash makes the disposal more difficult and costly. The Phase II project will bring the viable fly ash nitrogen fertilizer production technology from a laboratory scale to a pilot scale, and will determine the optimal pilot plant operation conditions, produce fertilizer for farmland field testing, and demonstrate its commercial viability. The pilot plant data will be used to understand the importance of design parameters and operating conditions on plant performance, refine the manufacturing plant design, and reduce the risk associated with construction of manufacturing plants.  The broader impacts (commercial significance) if this project is successful will be a high volume and highly technical application for fly ash and a value-added high efficiency low cost nitrogen fertilizer. The production of\nthis fertilizer will not be affected by the availability of natural gas. Moreover, the projected production cost of this nitrogen fertilizer is much lower than that of the traditional nitrogen fertilizer. The use of this new nitrogen fertilizer on farms will increase crop production profitability and prevent fertilizer loss and water pollution. By avoiding the landfill disposal of the fly ash, the coal power plants will save millions of dollars. If all the fly ash produced at coal power plants in the US were used to produce nitrogen fertilizer, the amount of nitrogen fertilizer produced could meet the entire US market demand. The success of this new technology will bring a revolutionary change to the traditional nitrogen fertilizer production process and will have substantial environmental, economic, and technical benefits.",

        "abstract": "Although interest in biodiesel is rapidly increasing, the process by which biodiesel is synthesized has not changed much in the last two decades and is far from efficient.  Currently, most biodiesel is made by a homogeneous-catalyst-based transesterification process, wherein soybean oil is reacted with methanol in the presence of sodium methoxide.  After transesterification, the homogeneous alkaline catalyst is mixed-in with the biodiesel and the glycerol byproduct.  Purification of both the biodiesel and the glycerol, by removing the homogeneous alkaline catalyst, is an energy and labor-intensive operation that produces a waste stream.  In addition, the glycerol byproduct resulting from this process is of low quality.  This project will develop a catalytic reactor that uses a heterogeneous catalyst for the highly efficient, high throughput, and low cost production of biodiesel.  The reactor consists of thousands of microreactors coated with a highly-active, proprietary heterogeneous catalyst.  Phase I demonstrated technical feasibility by determining the optimal reactor configuration (including reactor geometry and catalyst loading) and the optimal reactor operating conditions (including reaction temperature, molar ratio of soybean oil to methanol, and space velocity).  Phase II will involve scaling the process from laboratory scale to pilot scale, producing a large-size honeycomb catalyst for pilot plant testing, and demonstrating commercial viability. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The application of the microreactor technology in biodiesel production should significantly increase biodiesel productivity, simplify product separation and purification, improve glycerin quality, eliminate the washing step and associated waste stream, and reduce plant size, and reduce capital and processing costs.

        "abstract": "In 2001, lighting was estimated to consume 8.2 quads (approximately 762 TWh), or about 22% of the total electricity generated in the U.S.  New, high-efficiency, solid-state light sources, such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), are needed to help reduce the ever increasing demand for energy.  Potentially, an OLED is an inexpensive and energy saving diffuse source that may compete with conventional incandescent and fluorescent light sources.  However, improvements in the overall efficiency and lifetime of these devices are required before they become commercially viable products.  This project will enable the demonstration of an efficient, novel OLED illumination system with 150 lm/W power efficacy.  Phase I demonstrated a warm, white, stacked OLED (SOLED) with an efficacy of 50 lm/W at a forward luminance of 1,000 cd/m2.   The device had a Color Rendering Index (CRI) of 72 and a lifetime of over 80,000 hrs from an initial luminance of 1,000 cd/m2.  Phase II will involve the design and fabrication of warm white SOLED prototypes that have a light output similar to conventional fluorescent lighting fixtures.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is an overwhelming problem in Western Society, as approximately 30% of the American adult population is overweight. Obesity is dangerous not only because of the increased metabolic costs associated with overall \nmotility, but also because it is a strong risk factor for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Two of the most important cell types involved in obesity are the fat cells, themselves (adipocytes), and, also, liver cells (hepatocytes). In\ncreased fat content of the liver is a harmful disease (fatty liver disease) that often accompanies obesity, and also, infection with the hepatitis C virus. Macrophages also accumulate fat during coronary artery disease and tuberculosis. Within adipocytes, \nhepatocytes, and macrophages, lipid droplets manifest as spherical  balls  of fat (triglyceride) which can be brightly stained utilizing fluorescent lipid-specific staining reagents. Furthermore, certain proteins (e.g., perilipin), associate closely with t\nhe lipid droplets and control metabolism of the triglyceride. The overall purpose of our proposed research is to develop reagents and analytical software to enable performance of microscopy assays for investigating the mechanisms that regulate lipid drople\nt metabolism. We are developing a software program (Vala Science's Thora) to quantify lipid droplets and the proteins that associate with the lipid droplets, in images obtained from adipocytes, hepatocytes, and macrophages. Secondly, we propose to develop \nnovel monoclonal antibodies to lipid-droplet proteins that will be particularly useful in analyzing the expression and cellular localization of the droplet-associated proteins. The phase I research demonstrated the feasibility of the approach. The research\n proposed in Phase II will refine the methodology to be used in the assays, improve the utility of our software program, and expand the scope of the project to include quantification of lipid droplets and associated proteins in hepatocytes and macrophages \nas well as adipocytes. The proposed project will generate products relevant to research in obesity, diabetes, fatty liver, hepatitis C, coronary artery disease and tuberculosis.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Our proposal is for funds to develop new methods to\n use to help discover new drugs and chemicals that may be beneficial in treating obesity. Our research will help develop a software program that automatically analyzes images of cells from human fat and human livers that are kept in culture and exposed to \npotential anti-obesity drugs. We are also proposing to develop new staining reagents (monoclonal antibodies) that will help us with these investigations.",

The specific aims of this study are to: (1) develop culturally and linguistically appropriate colorectal cancer screening and risk reduction information designed for low- income, low literacy Latinos, (2) d\nevelop digital multimedia touchscreen kiosks to deliver interactive colorectal cancer screening and risk reduction information to low-income, low literacy Latinos, (3) evaluate the efficacy of an interactive, multimedia kiosk intervention to increase knowl\nedge about colorectal cancer risk and promote screening and other risk reduction behaviors among low-income, low literacy Latinos, and (4) evaluate the acceptance of the interactive, multimedia kiosk by clinical providers and low-income, low literacy Latin\nos receiving the intervention. The HHS Initiative to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities calls attention to the gaps in access to preventive health services for low-income, medically underserved individuals. This study to develop and evaluate a \ncolorectal cancer screening promotion intervention for medically underserved Latinos responds to the National Cancer Institute's program on Interactive Media Technologies in Cancer Prevention, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control to promote the use of\n innovative media technology and/or communication approaches in cancer prevention and control applications used in medical and community settings.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year, over 100,000 patients in the United States need to have their diseased heart valves replaced with artificial devices. Although bioprostheses, valves made from animal tissues, are considered ideal for most pat\nients, they wear out in about 15 years. They are thus used primarily in the elderly patient who is not expected to outlive the valve. Younger patients receive mechanical valves that are more durable, but require chronic administration of blood thinners. Th\nis makes participation in most sports impossible and exposes the patient to increased risk for fatal bleeds and strokes. ValveXchange, Inc. ( VXI ) is a medical device company developing a two-part heart valve consisting of a surgically implanted base and \nan exchangeable bioprosthetic tissue leaflet set. The VXI device is a lifetime tissue valve replacement system that does not require anticoagulation. During the first surgery, the docking station is first sewn in place and the leaflets are snapped in. This\n allows the surgeon to place sutures more conveniently, without risk of damaging the leaflet core. As the leaflet set begins to show signs of wear it can be exchanged rapidly, using a minimally invasive surgical or percutaneous procedure. Rapid, minimally \ninvasive leaflet exchange dramatically reduces surgical time and eliminates the need the technically demanding and potentially dangerous re-excision of the initial prosthetic valve. As the leaflet set is exchanged, the docking station remains permanently i\nn place so there is no disruption of the sensitive tissue of the aortic root; a vital part of the conduction system of the heart and the origin of the coronary arteries.         VXI has successfully completed two Phase I projects. In the first, VXI develop\ned prototype exchangeable valves and demonstrated their technical feasibility in an animal model by exchanging a valve in 23 seconds. In the second, VXI investigated the ability of anti-adhesion coatings to abate fibrotic overgrowth in the hyper-fibrotic s\nheep model. In this Phase II application we propose to implement our novel anti-adhesion coatings in a chronic sheep model and investigate the long-term host response of the rapidly exchangeable valve.         We will fabricate 8 valves each from bare coba\nlt-chrome, cobalt-chrome treated with a stearate coating, and from pyrolitic carbon. Both stearate and pyrolitic carbon have been shown to repel fibrotic overgrowth in the Phase I study. A control group will make use of the  gold standard  Edwards pericard\nial valve. After 3 and 5 months of implantation, the leaflet sets will be exchanged using an open surgical procedure in which the reduced time on cardiac bypass will be documented, and the degree of fibrotic overgrowth measured. Detailed measurements of fi\nbrotic overgrowth and incidence of thromboembolism will be examined at necropsy. This revised resubmission now includes more specific criteria upon which to base a redesign of the valve and the anti-fibrotic coatings. Each year, over 100,000 patients in th\ne United States need to have their diseased heart valves replaced with artificial devices. Although artificial heart valves made from materials of animal origin are considered ideal for most patients, they wear out in about 15 years. They are thus used pri\nmarily in the elderly patient who is not expected to outlive the valve. Younger patients receive mechanical valves, made from metals and graphite-like materials. Although these types of valves will last the life of the patient, they require the patient to \nbe on blood thinners. This makes participation in most sports impossible and exposes the patient to increased risk for fatal bleeds and strokes. ValveXchange, Inc.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this proposal is to develop an effective and rapid method for disrupting the poultry-to-human transmission of avian influenza by in ovo injection of adenovirus-vectored avian influenza vaccines that can be ma\nss-produced in cultured cells and mass-administered with a mechanized injector. The hypothesis is that mass-vaccination of poultry against an outbreak of avian influenza reduces the dissemination of the virus to new flocks and consequently the risk to huma\nns. As avian influenza gets more and more deadly, it is increasingly urgent to produce vaccines rapidly in response to an unprecedented escalation in demand. We have demonstrated that chickens can be immunized against highly pathogenic avian influenza viru\nses by in ovo administration of non-replicating adenovirus vectors encoding an avian influenza virus hemagglutinin. In contrast to conventional avian influenza vaccines, this new class of avian influenza vaccine does not mask natural infections by an avian\n influenza virus. The recombinant adenovirus vector can be rapidly generated using Vaxin's proprietary AdHigh system without the requirement to propagate lethal avian influenza viruses. The Phase II studies will further explore the potential of an adenovir\nus-vectored in ovo vaccine in mobilizing the immune repertoire toward a beneficial immune protection against avian influenza in chickens. In this project, the potential for an adenovirus-vectored in ovo avian influenza vaccine to immunize breeder hens and \nprogeny chickens will be investigated; the fate of adenovirus vectors in chickens following in ovo administration will be determined; vaccination of chickens against multiple avian diseases by adenovirus-vectored in ovo vaccines will be developed; the comp\natibility between an adenovirus-vectored in ovo vaccine and the DIVA strategy for immunization of poultry will be defined; and the potency of adenovirus-vectored in ovo vaccines under field conditions will be analyzed. The overall goal of these experiments\n is to develop a new generation of avian influenza vaccine that can be rapidly manufactured and administered for mass-immunization of poultry in response to a crisis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Avian influenza represents a major impending threat to public he\nalth. Mass-vaccination of poultry flocks against this deadly disease will be a crucial tool for reducing the rapid spread of the anticipated human pandemic. Vaccinating eggs before they hatch is much faster, easier, and less expensive than vaccinating live\n birds. The aim of this proposal is to develop a safe and effective vaccine which can rapidly vaccinate eggs to stop or slow the spread of the avian influenza, thus protecting humans as well as a significant food source. A genetically modified adenovirus i\ns the basis of this new type of vaccine.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental toxicants are increasingly linked to adverse birth outcomes such as low birth weight, preterm birth, birth defects and developmental delays. Inner-city populations are at higher risk for adverse birth outc\nomes and also are more likely to be exposed to environmental toxicants. Obstetric providers are seeking clarification about the true risks of many environmental exposures and what message they should deliver to their patients. Patients in this population a\nre confused by the conflicting messages they receive from providers and peers about behaviors and exposures that could put their fetus at risk. The Institute of Medicine and the National Environmental Education and Training Foundation recommend the integra\ntion of environmental health concepts into all levels of medical and nursing education. In the proposed SBIR Phase II project called Managing Environmental Risks in Pregnancy, Vida Health Communications, Inc. will complete the development and evaluation of\n the web-based provider training and patient education multi-media prototyped in Phase I. The final products of this research will be (1) a cross disciplinary web-based training offering continuing education for obstetric providers serving urban population\ns, (2) an educational DVD in English and Spanish and group discussion guide for showing to patients in clinic and office waiting areas or in facilitated group discussions, (3) a library of colorful support materials in English and Spanish at appropriate le\nvels of literacy for providers to print and distribute to patients made available both as electronic documents (pdf) and in preprinted form. The interventions will be evaluated using focus groups representative of the target audiences. Evaluators will use \nwell-documented qualitative techniques to analyze focus group data. This project will advance the environmental health training of obstetric providers serving urban populations that may be at risk for exposure to substances that can harm their developing f\netus. It will also provide much needed education, at appropriate literacy levels, for at-risk women about ways that they can moderate fetal exposure to environmental risks in pregnancy. Narrative: We are beginning to recognize the scope of environmental to\nxicants that urban-living pregnant women may be exposed to. Given the rapid development of a fetus, especially in the early months of pregnancy, avoidance of exposure is at present the most effective way to mitigate potential harm. This research will contr\nibute to knowledge of how prenatal care providers can interest, inform and motivate pregnant women who likely bear the greatest risk of exposure, so they can protect the fetus and improve the chance of giving birth to a healthy, normal infant.",

ViewPlus has already created the hardware and software technologies required for all people to have excellent access to graphical information that is in well-structured annotated Scalable Vector Gra\nphic (SVG) format. This project will assure that several kinds of important quantitative graphical information can easily be exported in this fully accessible SVG form. Many experts believe that SVG will eventually become the most popular way of displaying\n graphics in electronic literature. This project increases the likelihood that mainstream authors and publishers will use accessible SVG instead of SVG that is only visually accessible. Much health-related information can immediately be made accessible as \na direct result of this project. In addition the SVG export applications are likely to stimulate other manufacturers to add accessible SVG export functionality to their software so that more and more graphical information can become fully accessible to all\n people. More accessible literature will enhance educational and professional opportunities and generally improve quality of life for people with print disabilities. Quality of life issues for blind people are part of the mission of the National Eye Instit\nute. Three SVG export utilities will be developed in this project. All will automatically produce well-structured annotated SVG files, requiring no more effort by authors than saving in any other format. The capabilities of the ViewPlus IVEO SVG Viewer wil\nl be enhanced to permit excellent access by all people to the rich information in such files. Feasibility of this enhanced access was proven in the Phase I project. One of these utilities is an accessible SVG export for GIS (Geographic Information System) \ninformation created using the popular software from Environmental Sciences Research Institute (ESRI). Another is a new accessible SVG export from the ViewPlus Audio Graphing Calculator. Finally a web server utility will be developed that permits web sites \nto make graphs accessible by sending an audio tone file to the client. The utility will also have an accessible SVG export capability similar to what is exported by the Audio Graphing Calculator, giving more complete audio access than is practical on-line \nwith internet applications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project can dramatically increase the amount and quality of information that can be accessed by people with severe print disabilities including a great deal of medical and health- related informatio\nn that is presently nearly impossible to make accessible.

The new TOF-TOF produces high-quality MS-MS spectra orders of magni\ntude faster than current MS-MS instruments. Essentially all of the spectra produced are interpreted with corresponding speed. A prototype TOF-TOF instrument for demonstrating feasibility of a high-performance MALDI instrument that provides the speed, sensi\ntivity, and dynamic range required for high-throughput proteomics was designed and constructed in phase I. The essential elements of this new instrument include a new simplified MALDI ion source designed to operate routinely 24/7 with 5 khz laser; a high-r\nesolution first stage MS that provides mono-isotopic precursor selection up to at least m/z 4000 with no measurable loss in ion transmission and less than 1% transmission of adjacent masses; a new TOF-TOF analyzer incorporating high-resolution precursor se\nlection and multiplex operation that allows multiple precursors to be selected and analyzed following each laser shot; and a high resolution second stage MS that incorporates automatic internal calibration of fragment spectra providing high mass accuracy o\nn all fragment masses. Design and performance of these elements are described in the progress report for phase I.        The goal of phase II of this project is to complete the development of a fully functional, commercially viable MS-MS system including a\nll of these elements and to demonstrate the performance in applications to biological samples. The remaining work requires not only finalizing the design and construction of the complete system, including electronics and automatic controls, but also demons\ntrating the long-term reliability and ruggedness of the resulting elements and system. Final testing of the prototypes developed in phase II will be carried out in laboratories of our collaborators on applications requiring rapid and reliable analysis of b\niological samples with high sensitivity and broad dynamic range.         In phase III a high-throughput, high-resolution, multiplexed MALDI TOF-TOF mass spectrometer with the attributes described above will be commercialized, rendering all previous MALDI M\nS-MS instruments obsolete. Addition of separations interfaces and automation developed in related projects provide integrated systems that may replace electrospray LC-MS-MS systems for many applications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is widely recogn\nized that a combination of tandem mass spectrometry with efficient separation is required to approach the sensitivity and dynamic range required for global analysis of biological fluids such as plasma, serum, urine, and CSF. Analysis of proximal fluids and\n tissue samples is somewhat less demanding in that the dynamic range required is substantially smaller, but the amount of total sample available may be more limited so that equal ultimate sensitivity is required. Multi-dimensional separation combined with \nmass spectrometry can provide the required dynamic range, but a large number of fractions are required and no current MS-MS technique comes within an order of magnitude of the required speed and sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The principal objective is to demonstrate clinically a commercially viable, low-cost, high-resolution fundus camera that: is easy to use, i.e., consistent with the operation of current fundus cameras; has a field of vie\nw (FOV) that is typical of current fundus cameras (15 to 30 degrees); has a factor of five or more improvement in resolution as compared to existing clinical instruments; and, will be priced below that of today's clinical devices. In Phase I, a low-cost me\nans for removing low-order aberrations, focus and astigmatism, was demonstrated. It was shown that removal of low-order aberrations would result in significantly better resolution images. In Phase II, the specific aims are to integrate the low-cost low-ord\ner aberrations compensator into a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO). This new SLO would produce retinal and optic disc images that have five times better resolution when compared to today's commercial cameras. Researchers have sought to gain greater insi\nght into the mechanisms of the retina and the optic disc at high spatial resolutions that would enable the visualization of structures (4 to 8 micrometers) such as capillaries and nerve fiber bundles. Major sources of retinal image quality degradation are \naberrations within the human eye. The presence of these ocular aberrations, many of them random and non deterministic, limits the achievable resolution and the contrast of small image details due to diffraction effects. To overcome these fundamental limita\ntions, researchers have been applying adaptive optics techniques to correct for the aberrations. Today, deformable mirror based adaptive optics devices have been developed to overcome the limitations of standard fundus cameras, but at prices in excess of  \n500,000. The device proposed by VisionQuest addresses the same goals as the above research grade adaptive optics instruments but does so in a manner which will ultimately be better suited for clinical use because of its similarity to current retinal photog\nraphic techniques and its lower cost technology. Our proposed device avoids the high costs, complexity, and limited FOV by adopting unique and notably less expensive wavefront measurement and aberration correction techniques. VisionQuest's goal is to demon\nstrate an advanced imaging technology that introduces an effective and low cost ( 10,000 or less) diagnostic tool to the healthcare system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Retinal imaging for the purposes of diagnosis of retinal diseases or for monitoring the tre\natment and/or progression of retinal diseases is standard of care. Greatly improved images of the retina, especially at costs that are lower than current fundus cameras, would have a significant impact on our ability to implement broad-scale screening thro\nughout the U.S. for retinal disease. A low-cost retinal camera would enable the early detection and care of individuals with any of the three major eye diseases, i.e., age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or glaucoma.",

The project will develop low-cost, small-diameter NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) instrumentation and software for direct subsurface measurement of groundwater and its hydraulic properties. This effort will leverage magnet/coil designs and NMR techniques pioneered for deep petroleum exploration, and implement them in miniaturized, low-cost form factors suitable for hydro-geological investigations in the top 200 meters of the subsurface. The Phase I project performed computer simulations and laboratory NMR experiments to establish the technical feasibility of using NMR sensors to derive hydro-geological properties in boreholes as small as 2 in. in diameter using structural design and analysis to establish the feasibility of NMR cone penetrometers. The Phase II project will design, assemble and field test a complete borehole NMR instrumentation and software system for characterizing hydro-geological processes in the top 200m of the subsurface. It will also design, assemble, and field-test a cone penetrometer NMR sonde, and integrate it with an existing DoE cone penetrometer system.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The results of this effort will be commercialized in the form of small-diameter NMR instruments and field services. Small-diameter down-hole NMR technology will bring the unique advantages of in-situ NMR measurements to a broad variety of subsurface hydrological investigations, at a fraction of the cost of existing borehole NMR instruments and services.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Child abuse is a common and unfortunate problem in the United States. Approximately one million children are physically or sexually abused each year. The actual number of children presenting to medical facilities for ab\nuse examinations is unknown, however, the number is anecdotally is increasing. Specialized clinics in hospitals, Children's Advocacy Centers (CACs) and Childrens' Justice Centers (CJCs) have been developed in every region to serve the investigative and med\nical needs of abused children. CACs and CJCs provide the same service, and both are members of the National Children's Alliance. Each clinic, or Center, must perform medical assessments to diagnose and treat the physical aftereffects of abuse, and also doc\nument forensic evidence necessary for child protection and possible prosecution. As the only children's hospital with a tertiary care trauma center in the Intermountain West, Utah's Primary Children's Medical Center (PCMC), within the Intermountain Health \nCare (IHC) system, annually receives and reviews about 1000 child abuse cases submitted from geographically remote locations. A significant amount expertise has developed in the field of child abuse medicine within the field of Pediatrics. The American Boa\nrd of Pediatrics is currently considering a proposal for Child Abuse Pediatrics to become the newest medical subspecialty of Pediatrics, recognizing the need for highly skilled physicians in this area. Recent studies have shown that in certain areas of chi\nld abuse, especially in the evaluation of sexual abuse, less experienced physicians and other medical providers may not provide accurate assessments of physical findings. While failing to recognize abuse has significant morbidity and mortality, over recogn\nition and over interpretation has negative child welfare and criminal repercussions that may be equally devastating. The existing process of child abuse detection and prevention can be improved by providing clinicians and practitioners with secure case com\nmunication and collaboration tools. These tools must fulfill the need to create and submit child abuse cases for expert consultation, integrate clinical coding standards (e.g, ICD-9, CPT), manipulate images form multiple sources (e.g., clinical photos, rad\niographs, histology), preserve archive quality images with non- destructive visual identifiers and protect all information from unauthorized access. 1. Clinical case consultation and collaboration (same-time/different-place, different-time/different-place)\n for geographically remote users, 2. Customized child abuse prevention workflow designed by Pediatric experts, 3. Secure methods for storing, processing and sharing, accumulated knowledge, 4. Built-in mechanisms for privatizing, accessing and auditing case\n information. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The overall aim for Phase 2 of this project is to develop, test and implement a web-based product that supports teleconsultation and peer review for diagnosing child abuse. The goal is to develop a web-based applicatio\nn that supports geographically distant providers by providing access to quality review and expertise in tertiary care centers. The web-based application, TeleCAM, is designed to augment existing telemedicine applications and imaging systems through the use\n of web services protocols. The approach for phase 2 will be to take the results of Phase 1 (feasibility) and usability resulting in a version 1.0 prototype into to a stable end user tested version 2.0. The solution will be a web-based, multi user image-ce\nntric collaboration application that supports the workflow requirements of providers (nurse, nurse practitioners and physicians) regardless of geographic location..

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency is a significant public health problem among the elderly. Deficiency can lead to a wide spectrum of hematological and neurological disorders (dementia) which are usually reversible by\n early diagnosis and prompt treatment. The primary cause of deficiency is malabsorption due to a lack of intrinsic factor (pernicious anemia, PA) or gastric atrophy. Accurate diagnostic tests for PA and other causes of B12 malabsorption are needed because \nsymptoms attributable to B12 deficiency, neurological dysfunction and dementia, are non-specific and difficult to diagnose. The currently used procedure for assessing B12 malabsorption is the Schilling Urinary Excretion Test, first introduced in 1953. Whil\ne this radioisotopic test led to great advances in understanding B12 related disease, it is imprecise and cumbersome and its manufacture was terminated in 2003 because of safety concerns regarding the test components. As a result, the underlying causes of \nB12 deficiency are frequently not addressed, despite important health implications and potential economic costs of establishing a cause of B12 deficiency. This proposal describes a new B12 absorption test made possible by two key technological innovations:\n an inexpensive biosynthetic system for production of isotopic (14C) B12 (Tracer B12), and ultra sensitive detection of the Tracer B12 by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry, a tool that achieves zeptomole (10-21) sensitivity for detection of 14C, the greatest s\nensitivity of any known analytical instrument. Using this approach, the absorption of an oral dose of Tracer B12 can be quantified in a single drop of blood using harmlessly small radioactive doses (25-50 nanoCuries). Our overarching objective is to develo\np a test that would replace the Schilling test to detect malabsorption of B12 and correctly identify the cause of the malabsorption. For Phase II of this project, our specific aims are: 1) To define and quantify the normal and abnormal ranges of plasma res\nponse to an oral dose of Tracer B12. To achieve this aim, we will carry out a kinetic study of Tracer B12 in 10 age- matched pairs of healthy controls and PA patients. 2) To confirm the cause of B12 malabsorption among PA patients by assessing the changes \nin plasma response to an oral dose of Tracer B12 combined with recombinant human intrinsic factor (rh-IF) in PA patients. To achieve this aim, the 10 PA patients from specific aim 1 will receive a second oral dose of Tracer B12 combined with rh-IF, and the\n time course and variability of Tracer B12 appearance and disappearance in plasma and whole blood will be re-assessed. We predict that rh-IF will correct the malabsorption in PA patients. This Phase II application follows upon the successful completion of \nPhase I in which we synthesized sufficient Tracer B12 to support the clinical component of the proposal. The work has significance as it should lead to a convenient, quantitative and most needed diagnostic test for clinical B12 malabsorption, and appropria\nte treatment for B12 deficiency disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposal describes a new test method made possible by two key technological innovations: an inexpensive biosynthetic system for production of isotopic (14C) Vitamin B12 (Tracer B12),\n and an ultra sensitive detection of the Tracer B12 by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry.

They are also difficult to thin. The goal of this project is to overcome the limitations of contemporary SOI (silicon-on-insulator) CMOS active pixel sensor (APS) technology, in a 3-dimensional stacked imager configuration, by establishing a new class of back-thinned, radiation-hard, stacked Silicon on Insulator/ SOI CMOS HEP imagers.

        "abstract": "Existing solid state detectors, such as charge coupled device (CCD) and complimentary metal oxide silicon (CMOS) imagers do not have adequate ultraviolet (UV) sensitivity for Cherenkov radiation detection. Therefore, a new type of UV-optimized, high-gain, low-noise, solid state avalanche photodiode (APD) is needed for low-level light detection of Cherenkov radiation.  In recent years, silicon, CMOS-compatible solid state photomultipliers (SiPM) detectors have been shown to be capable of registering low scintillating light, and consequently intensive studies have been carried out to qualify SiPM-like APDs as possible photosensors for scintillation detectors. The results of these studies have revealed encouraging performance characteristics. However, due to the SiPM circuit\u00c2\u00bfs architecture, the detector\u00c2\u00bfs sensitivity peaks in the `green\u00c2\u00bf part of the optical spectrum and is not very sensitive to the UV.  This project will develop a large area, pixilated SiPM detector architecture that is optimized for illumination from the backside, where, unencumbered by the individual detector\u00c2\u00bfs circuitry, high responsivity can be achieved over the entire spectral range of Cherenkov radiation. In Phase I, single photon sensitive APDs and two SiPM detector designs where characterized over a wide range of operating conditions.  Based on the identification and characterization of those device performance attributes critical for Cherenkov detection applications, the design of a large area, tiled, silicon-on-insulator (SOI) CMOS SiPM focal plane array (FPA) was developed and on-chip readout electronics circuits designed. During Phase II, the back-illuminated SOI CMOS SiPM arrays will be fabricated, optimized, integrated and their performance evaluated.

The ultimate goal is a software system that achieves less than 150 msec one-way end-to-end delay (the typical delay of telephone) for a 10-30 site meeting supporting wideband audio, full motion video, and application/desktop sharing over broadband networks.  The industry norm to achieve multiparty video/web conferencing is the client-server architecture.  Client-server architecture is expensive to deploy due to the number of servers required and the bandwidth required at the server nodes. Peer-to-peer approaches have been successfully used for large scale file sharing. However, peer-to-peer approaches have been relatively unexplored to scale the number of participants in a single meeting.  This research combines real-time network sensing and the domain knowledge of video and web conferencing to create a scalable and cost effective peer-to-peer streaming algorithm. The maximum number of sites in a multiparty videoconferencing is typically 4-6. Given the limited screen resolution of a laptop/desktop, methods for showing 10-30 full motion video and a shared application are relatively unexplored. Poor user experience from inadequate user interface is a major barrier to the adoption of previous video/web conferencing tools. This research combines recent human factor discoveries to create a novel user interface that intuitively supports multiparty communication.  Since AT&T invented videoconferencing in\n1927, videoconferencing has been one commercial failure after another. The PI's previous research suggests that such failures are rooted in inadequate knowledge of the human factor requirements of videoconferencing. Based on previous research, they are developing a commercial software system which will make substantial impact on telework, remote education, and humanitarian operations.  This project aims to create a low-cost peer-to-peer alternative to client-server architectures for large scale meetings. If successful, the architecture proposed in this effort could have significant commercial impact.",

        "abstract": "Wind energy has the potential of producing over 20% of the U.S. near-term electricity needs.  However, reaching this potential will require an expansion of wind-turbine sites from the currently-exploited high-wind sites to lower\u00c2\u00bfwind-speed sites.  In turn, this expansion will require the development of technologies and manufacturing methods that are effective for both types of sites.  A larger wind turbine rotor would provide a candidate solution, if reductions in weight and cost could be achieved.  This project will develop a composite engineered core that has the potential to dramatically reduce the weight and cost of large wind turbine blades, while improving key material properties such as shear and fatigue strength.  Phase I quantified and demonstrated the benefits of an engineered fiber-reinforced core for general application to large wind turbine blade construction.  The benefits compared favorably to currently popular core materials for large blade construction, namely, end-grain balsa and low-density PVC foam.  In Phase II, the advanced materials technologies will be applied to the design of new blades and to the replacement of materials in existing blade designs.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The improvements in core design should directly impact construction and maintenance costs associated with wind power generation.  Reductions in initial production cost would lower the overall cost of turbine installation and make adaptation to wind power generation more appealing.  Increased blade life due to improved mechanical and fatigue properties would lower downtime and maintenance costs for wind power generation facilities.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The culture and shipment of islets are an integral part of islet transplant research. Flasks, petri dishes, and bags are the devices used to perform that role. However, these devices have inherent design characteristics\n that make them poorly suited to the unique needs of islet culture and islet shipping. This results in the use of far too many devices to maintain an islet preparation, a high potential for contamination, severely limited process control, and islet damage \nduring shipping. Unfortunately, little effort has been undertaken to address the problems inherent to existing devices. We propose the creation of a superior device that is ideally suited to oxygenate islets and is tailored to the needs of the islet commun\nity. It will be the only device capable of culturing, shipping, and infusing an entire pancreatic islet isolation. This device is referred to as the single layer gas permeable device (SLD). Our investigation is expected to achieve five specific aims. Aim 1\n will define a high-density SLD islet culture protocol that provides islets of superior quality and less immunogenicity than possible with existing devices when an entire islet preparation is cultured in a single device for at least seven-days without feed\ning. Outcomes will be determined by a variety of techniques including oxygen consumption rate (OCR), OCR/DNA, and molecular profiling. Aim 2 will adapt the SLD from a culture to a shipping device. Aim 3 will create a novel gyroscopic shipping container (GS\nC) that functions as an incubator without need of electronic controls and maintains the SLD in a standing position independent of how its outer container is oriented during shipping. This essentially allows islets to be cultured during shipping. Aim 4 will\n verify that the SLD of Aim 2 and the GSC of Aim 3 deliver islet tissue with superior viable islet yield, quality, and reduced immunogenicity relative to existing methods. Aim 5 will modify the SLD for islet transfusion and verify the superiority of the SL\nD for islet culture, shipping, and infusion relative to existing methods.         Project Narrative: Islet transplants hold promise to provide a better quality of life for those afflicted with diabetes and reduce health care cost to society. There are no c\nell culture devices on the market that are designed with the attributes needed to efficiently oxygenate islets during culture and shipping. This grant is intended to create a gas permeable device (SLD) that can culture, ship, and infuse islets with maximum\n efficiency.",

        "abstract": "There is potential for a vast expansion of wind-power production in rural America. However, US sales of small wind turbines are still relatively limited, amounting to fewer than 7,000 units in 2006. The major reason for these limited sales is the high system cost and long payback period of current wind turbines. Other reasons include public objections to the visual appearance and noise of conventional wind turbines, and their perceived lethality to birds and bats. The proposed Wind Fin technology has been designed to overcome all of these major barriers to market acceptance of small wind systems. Phase I research on this system, called the Wind Fin, demonstrates that it is comparable in performance to state-of-the-art commercial wind turbines at substantially lower system cost. In fact, these results indicate that the capital cost of the Wind Fin system will be half of that of leading commercial wind turbines of comparable power output. This will be verified and validated in the proposed Phase II project. If successful, this new technology has the potential to greatly expand wind-power production at the local farm, ranch, and rural community level. Agricultural operations and rural industry can benefit directly from lower energy costs and potentially be able to generate significant additional income by selling power to utilities. Wind energy harvested at the local farm or community level can play a major role in fostering rural development.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and its sequelae, pulmonary embolism (PE), is a significant clinical problem, representing the leading cause of preventable in-hospital mortality in the USA and other developed coun\ntries. Indeed, anywhere from 60,000 to 200,000 people are dying each year in the United States because of DVT related pulmonary embolism. Therefore, reliable detection and diagnosis of DVT is of paramount importance. Once detected, acute clots must be diff\nerentiated from chronic DVT for appropriate treatment. However, there are no reliable, clinically available methods to stage DVT. Even the gold standard diagnostic technique, duplex venous ultrasound, can only detect but not age these clots. Therefore once\n a DVT is detected, highly potent, low-molecular weight heparin anticoagulation therapy, with its associated morbidity and mortality, is often given to over compensate for a PE risk from what might only be a chronic thrombus. Over time, as a clot ages and \nmatures, DVT consistently hardens. Previous studies demonstrated that elastography a technique to image elastic properties of tissue can be used to reliably differentiate the chronic and acute DVT. In addition to elasticity contrast, optical absorption of \nDVT changes with blood clot maturation the acute clots are associated with high concentration of red blood cells, and chronic composed of tangled mesh of platelets, fibrin, and degenerating leukocytes. Consequently, the photoacoustic imaging an ultrasound-\nbased imaging of optical absorption can be used to further characterize blood clots thus assisting the classification of detected DVT. Therefore, we propose to develop an integrated multifunctional imaging system to simultaneously detect and differentiate \nDVT based on grayscale and Doppler/color flow ultrasound imaging, photoacoustic imaging and elastography. The combined imaging will enhance DVT detection, diagnosis and staging without significant modification in current clinical protocol of ultrasound exa\nmination of DVT. The main objective of this fast-track SBIR program is to develop and test the integrated ultrasound, photoacoustic and elasticity imaging system to detect and age DVT. To achieve our objective, we will design and build an ultrasound imagin\ng system capable of simultaneous, real-time ultrasound, photoacoustic and strain imaging of blood clots in deep vein, and subsequent visualization of DVT elasticity. We will then test the developed system using tissue-mimicking models of DVT followed by cl\ninical studies of patients with known acute and chronic blood clots. Based on the results of these studies, it is the long-range goal of the overall program to develop, thoroughly test and commercialize a real-time ultrasound-based imaging system for DVT d\netection, diagnosis and aging. The central theme of this project is to design, develop and commercialize a real-time integrated multimodal ultrasound-based imaging system to detect and age deep vein thrombosis. Our research program is focused on developmen\nt of an advanced imaging tool that takes full advantage of the many synergistic features of three complementary imaging modalities   ultrasound, photoacoustics, and elastography. Integrated ultrasound, photoacoustic and elasticity imaging is a novel techno\nlogy capable of accurate visualization of both structural and functional properties of tissue and it may be useful far beyond DVT detection and diagnosis. The applications of multimodal imaging may be extended into cancer research, diagnostic imaging and t\nherapy monitoring, cellular imaging, small animal imaging, microsurgery, etc. The current study, however, is a part of a focused program to develop and commercialize much needed yet unavailable clinical tool for DVT detection, diagnosis and characterizatio\nn.",

        "abstract": "Several critical issues stand in the development path of a magnetized target fusion scheme to a working reactor. Important ones are the limit imposed by liner dwell time, and the requirement for symmetry in high convergences. The usual compression schemes tend to require a lot of energy and large chambers. During Phase I we completed computational and analytic studies of the compression and acceleration of compact tori.  We used advanced computations benchmarked against analytic theory to determine the best means for the acceleration and compression of a compact torus plasma. Our study included analysis of the stability of a compact torus under compression.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The Phase II project will use a new means for compressing and trapping a compact torus to maximize the burn time.  The new experiment will be supported by computational efforts and analytic modeling, and will be carried out in house by use of largely existing facilities.  In Phase II we will build a plasma piston to impact and compress a small compact torus generated in a flux-conserver shaped to preserve stability. In Phase III, we would seek industrial partners to build a high field, high temperature, compact torus compressor, with the ability to repeat.  The aim would be to skip the proof-of-principal stage and go straight to performance extension, based on existing results, and on our ability to accurately simulate plasma behavior with existing computational models.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy among women. Its awareness and screening have resulted in the majority of breast cancers being diagnosed in the early-stage, for which breast conservation therapy (BCT) has become the standard of care. BCT consists of a lumpectomy followed by 6-8 weeks of radiation therapy, mostly irradiating whole breast. Although the outcome of BCT is favorable, the invasive and geometrically inaccurate surgery and the lengthy radiotherapy significantly worsen the quality of life for a large population of patients. This Fast Track application aims to develop the key technologies for image-guided SRS of breast cancer, including a dedicated gamma irradiation unit (patent pending), a treatment planning system (TPS), and breast immobilization and localization devices and methods (patent pending). In Phase I of the development (6 months) are to answer one key question: can we reproducibly localize breast cancer for image-guided SRS? We will 1)Develop an MRI compatible couch top for a Siemens MR imager; 2) Develop a breast immobilization cup and stereotactic localization frame that locks on to the couch top; and 3) Study the reproducibility of the breast alignment and the accuracy of localization. The milestones for Phase 1 are the verified methods and devices for reproducibly localizing breast tissue with an accuracy of 1 mm or better. In Phase II (three years), we will complete the development of the other key components and perform system testing. Specifically, we will 1) Develop a dedicated gamma irradiation device and the treatment couch for delivering breast SRS; 2) Develop the treatment planning system (TPS) for gamma radiosurgery of breast cancer; 3) Perform system integration and radiation testing to verify geometric and dosimetric accuracy and safety; and 4) Perform Phase I clinical testing and apply for FDA 510(k) clearance. By the end of the Phase II development, we will have an FDA-cleared complete system that is ready for a Phase II clinical trail in a limited number of institutions. Successful completion of the developments will revolutionize breast cancer care and drastically improve the lives of millions of women inflicted with the disease. Patients with early stage breast cancer can be painlessly and cost-effectively cured by a non-invasive procedure, with unsurpassed cosmesis (no scars).This project aims to develop an image-guided radiation system for the treatment of breast cancer, which is the most prevalent malignancy among women.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hyperpolarized xenon-129 (HXe) MRI has been demonstrated to have exquisite sensitivity for functional diagnostic imaging of lungs, likely the most technically promising and commercially viable technique. Full characteri\nzation of pulmonary health may benefit from as many as eight different multi-liter protocols, which should ideally be completed in well under an hour. Three years ago our group identified an efficient method for polarization and developed an apparatus to e\nxploit the high flow, low pressure polarization regime, increasing output by more than a factor of ten to 1 L/hr at 50%. In our Phase 1 proposal we argued that assembling a polarizer with several heat-conducting channels operating in parallel would permit \na scale up by a factor of the number of channels, assuming similar conditions of temperature, pressure, laser illumination, and cell geometry. Furthermore, if the laser spectrum could be narrowed, then dropping the pressure by a factor of two could yield a\nnother two-fold improvement in production rate. During Phase 1 we developed new fabrication techniques, assembled a copper prototype, adapted our existing laser and magnetic infrastructure for its installation, and characterized its performance. We confirm\ned predictions, that the multi-channel polarizer column delivers HXe with gt50% polarization at a rate of two liters per hour per hundred watts of narrowed laser power, up to 250 watts, a six-fold improvement over our previous world's best production rate.\n We discovered that birefringence arising from thermal stresses in a few laser elements was compromising polarization demonstrations of our copper-column technology up to the full kilowatt of available laser power, a problem that can now be easily correcte\nd. In Phase 2 we propose full characterization of our new prototype polarizer, demonstrating twenty- fold scale up of xenon polarizer production output. We will characterize its performance over wide ranges of gas mixture, pressure, temperature, flow rates\n, and laser power. We will probe the low pressure limit, including a more complete characterization of the nitrogen partial pressure required for quenching. We will develop technology to monitor remaining rubidium and to sequester condensed rubidium, exten\nding the service lifetime. We will incorporate technology to recirculate the pure buffer gases, minimizing their consumption. We will assemble these technologies into a polarizer platform with expanded gas flow and freeze-out capabilities, and a more versa\ntile and efficient xenon delivery system. We will optimize a prototype high-flow polarizer capable of producing MagniXene  at 20 L/hr at 50% polarization, which meets the needs of clinical partners and pharmaceutical customers. After this Phase 2 project t\nhe polarizer technology will be completed, and ready for the detailed engineering and extensive documentation required for FDA approval as a Class 2 device.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hyperpolarized gas MRI offers unprecedented pulmonary functional diagnostic capability. Individual sufferers of COPD could benefit from improved diagnosis and treatment management, while pharmaceutical companies could h\nave more precise measures of the efficacies of their disease- modifying interventions. The US healthcare budget could benefit if the  35B spent on the 30 million Americans suffering from COPD could be directed towards effective treatments through accurate \nassessments. The primary obstacle to progress has been the availability of high quality hyperpolarization technology and services for both technical and logistical reasons. In Phase 1 we demonstrated a clear path to overcoming technical, regulatory, and co\nmmercial obstacles. We combined our core competencies in polarization process simulation, glass vessel development, and laser and magnet design; our installed infrastructure of gas flow, vacuum, thermal regulation, NMR, and computer control; with new engin\neering designs for pressure vessels and feed- throughs in order to demonstrate feasibility for a high-efficiency 3He polarizer. The technical capabilities of the polarizer will provide polarizations of 50Liters of 3He in 12 hours to levels exceeding 70%. W\ne initiated the regulatory approval process by submitting an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the US FDA for Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials with human subjects. On the commercial side, we have learned that the principal provider of commerci\nal 3He polarizing systems has abandoned 3He as a product, and is threatening productive researchers with possibly losing their polarizers. Our small business is the only commercial entity seeking to provide hyperpolarized 3He infrastructure and services, a\nnd actively pursuing FDA approval. FDA safe harbor laws eliminate any potential issues of patent infringement while pursuing research towards FDA approval. In Phase 2 we propose to demonstrate the prototype system and characterize its properties. We will i\nmplement an optimized laser with output power capability exceeding 2.5kW with spectral width of 2nm and angular divergence under 2mr. Our simulations showed that the benefits of spectrally narrowed laser power were outweighed by the loss in laser power for\n our optimal operating pressures of 6bar (cold). We will perform two measurements of scientific interest for which our apparatus is uniquely capable to clarify the murky X-factor that has limited maximum 3He polarization to 70%-80%. We will implement optim\nized components into a pre-production commercial prototype using Product Data Management and Quality Systems, now under development at Xemed. The polarizer completed under this project will be deployable as a platform for FDA clinical trials of MagniLium ,\n Xemed's candidate hyperpolarized 3He diagnostic pulmonary functional imaging agent. Helium-3 gas can be magnetized using lasers, and once breathed into the body can report detailed spatial information in MRI scanners regarding lung function and disease. T\nhis diagnostic information could help diagnose and manage the treatment of 30 million Americans suffering from COPD, the fourth leading cause of death in the US. Our Phase 1 project demonstrated feasibility for using conventional technology in novel ways t\no scale up by a factor of 200 the production capability for hyperpolarized 3He, and initiated the FDA Investigational New Drug process. We propose in Phase 2 to further optimize the system and implement these technologies in a compact, robust, automated, a\nnd affordable polarizer suitable for on-site polarization at multi-center clinical trials leading to FDA approval of our hyperpolarized 3He imaging agent under the trade name MagniLium .",

        "abstract": "U.S. national laboratories are developing microcalorimeters as very precise detectors of electromagnetic radiation from near infrared to gamma ray frequencies, with much better energy resolution than existing detectors.  Since microcalorimeters are small, they must be fabricated in large, 100-to-1000 channel arrays that, in turn, will require low-cost readout electronics with good energy resolution and high count rate capability.  This project will extend the high precision digital readout electronics and digital filter algorithms, previously developed for germanium gamma-ray detectors, to very large microcalorimeter arrays.  The objectives are to achieve (1) energy resolutions comparable to existing electronics, but with much higher count rates; (2) automated software for setup, calibration, and monitoring; and (3) a price of $100 per channel.  In Phase I, microcalorimeter data was acquired from several research laboratories, and then processed offline and occasionally online.  The resolution matched or exceeded the resolution from currently used \u00c2\u00bfoptimum\u00c2\u00bf filters:  ~0.07% resolution at low rates (versus 0.7-0.9% for optimum filters) and ~0.13% resolution at higher rates (versus 0.31%).  The maximum theoretical count rate with good resolution was 155-1100 counts/s (versus ~ 8 counts/s).  A preliminary design of a multi-channel prototype board was created that would meet the cost target.  Phase II will complete the multi channel electronics design,  build the hardware, and develop on-board firmware and software for multiplexed processing of slow microcalorimeter signals in high speed digital components. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The proposed instrument should have applications in various scientific experiments employing arrays of microcalorimeters for X-ray or gamma-ray spectroscopy.  A notable practical application is very precise isotope analysis of nuclear materials, which would make the instrument a valuable tool for nuclear non-proliferation.

In this version, we made significant modifications, including: change the two rings cathode design to three rings structure, addi\nng the synchronization gating control effort, and details of the processing and manufacturing of the carbon nanotube (CNT) cathodes and x-ray tubes. During this period, we achieved dramatic progress on the CNT x-ray technique, which makes us confident the \nsuccess of this development.     Substantial technological growth has spurred a new interest in imaging techniques, and their usage has grown considerably.

Thus, the development of a platform that allows automation, miniaturization and parallelization for obtaining crystals of optimal quality would be a significant step forward in crystallography and would accelerate structural studies.

In combination with r\necently available high brightness microfocus x-ray sources, it could increase the throughput of many x-ray techniques up to 10 times and reduce initial tool purchase cost and subsequent maintenance cost. For the proposing company, we plan to use it in our \nx-ray 3D imaging systems with sub-30 nm resolution, including a prototype 3D imaging system developed under a NIH phase II funding, which is optimized for imaging biological samples at 30nm resolution. The combination of this performance improvement and lo\nwer cost will help to make the tool widely deployed in biological laboratories. 3D x-ray imaging of cells, cell clusters and tissues at 30nm resolution has the potential to open new insights into the organization, evolution and connectivity of biological s\nystems and naturally complements the already available toolset for biological researchers. The Wolter capillary mirror will also substantially improve the performance of many other well established, relevant x-ray techniques, including protein crystallogra\nphy for determination of crystallographic structures of proteins and viruses, and small angle scattering for studying biological macromolecules in native solution both in vitro and in vivo, which are important tools for drug development and the understandi\nng of disease. Similar to that for x-ray microscopy, a throughput gain of 10X may be expected for some specific applications in these other x-ray techniques. During the phase II project, we plan to refine our fabrication processes and improve our metrology\n capability to allow the fabrication of Wolter capillary lenses with a point spread function better than 1 ltm. Project Narrative Successful development of the proposed Wolter mirror optic will make 3-D x-ray microscopy for biological applications more pow\nerful, affordable, and practical by reducing image acquisition times from several hours to tens of minutes (approximately 10X throughput gain). Exciting capabilities include in-situ 3D imaging of cell and tissue specimens with 30 nm resolution that have un\ndergone little morphological and functional change from their natural living state. In addition to 3-D x-ray imaging other x-ray techniques, such as x-ray diffraction and small angle scattering, critical to drug discovery and understanding of disease, can \nexpect a similar throughput increase from this development.",

Clinical studies have \nshown that these tumor types consistently produce an altered array of gangliosides that can predict their clinical progression. Genetic and pharmacological experiments demonstrate that gangliosides are essential for the progression of these cancers. Togeth\ner this validates gangliosides as a novel target for the treatment of neuroblastoma and melanoma. In our Phase I program, we not only developed the cell based high throughput discovery system that we proposed, but we also completed a screen of 74,000 drug-\nlike compounds.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The dramatic rise in obesity within the U.S. over the past two decades has led to an increase in Type 2 diabetes and related health disorders. The National Institutes of Health has responded by establishing a task force\n devoted to accelerating the progress in obesity research. In August of 2004 the task force established a strategic plan for obesity research including research targeted at breaking the link between obesity and its related health disorders. Increased abdom\ninal adiposity is correlated with a defect in glucose homeostasis and associated with decreased insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissue. Skeletal muscle is an important site of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and often the site of insulin resistance i\nn obesity. The molecular mechanisms of skeletal muscle insulin resistance remain to be uncovered and this gap is the basis of this proposal. We have established a human skeletal muscle cell system that responds to physiologic stimuli in vitro. Additionally\n, we have established and validated an adipocyte / myocyte co-culture system to investigate the interplay between these two cell types. Our preliminary studies show that adipocytes have a profound effect on skeletal myocyte metabolic activities. Based on t\nhe successful completion of Phase I, we are eager to extend our research in Phase II by focusing on making the co-culture system commercially available. We will continue the optimization and characterization of two skeletal muscle cell systems using the fo\nllowing aims. Aim 1 will continue the optimization and characterization of isolated human skeletal muscle cells, establish quality control criteria, and validate contract research services using this system. Aim 2 is focused on establishing and validating \nthe adipocyte/myocyte co-culture system for commercial availability. We will investigate the effects of donor demographics on each cell type in the co-culture, establish quality control criteria, and identify methods for shipping and customer co-culture ma\nintenance. Aim 3 is to establish a repository of donor-matched skeletal muscle, subcutaneous, and omental adipose tissue from patients of different demographics. These tissues and derived cells will be made available to researchers in the obesity and diabe\ntes research fields. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At the completion of this project, a commercially available, fully validated human skeletal myocyte system, skeletal myocyte / adipocyte co-culture system, and related assay kits will be offered to researchers.\n The availability of these systems will provide opportunities for new approaches in the investigation of metabolic disease and a unique methodology to examine the complex interaction between these two cell types.",

        "abstract": "When ethanol is produced from corn, only the starch is transformed, and a significant amount of byproducts is produced.  If these byproducts, which are rich in sugars, could be made into a valuable product, the cost-effectiveness of ethanol production will be enhanced.  One such potential product is xylitol, a five-carbon polyalcohol that has gained acceptance as a natural food sweetener that can replace sucrose on a weight-for-weight basis.  Although xylitol is in high demand by the food ingredient and confectionary industries, its use currently is constrained by the limited supply of raw materials.  This project will develop a bioprocess to transform waste sugars into xylitol, thereby improving the economics of ethanol production.  In Phase I, bacterial host strains were developed for the transformation of these waste sugars.  In addition, the various feedstocks that would feed the bioprocess were evaluated, several prototype bioconversion systems were assembled and tested, and some preliminary metabolic engineering was performed to demonstrate feasibility.  Phase II will involve further metabolic engineering, fine-tuning of the fermentation process, and scaling-up the process to commercial levels. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new bioprocess should significantly reduce the cost of commercial xylitol production, free xylitol production from the current raw-material-availability constraints, and have a positive impact on the economics of fuel ethanol production.  Moreover, domestic firms would be able to produce xylitol more cheaply, thereby avoiding the need to relocate manufacturing facilities to Southeast Asia.  Finally, the new bioprocess should be inherently cleaner and safer than the existing hydrogenation process for xylitol.",

Under the Phase I SBIR grant, Amethyst Research developed a software simulation tool called HazCommand. Our Phase II goal is\n to create a model platform for credentialing operational competency of initial company officers responding to HazMat incidents. The credential will reflect the responder's ability to demonstrate operational competency that meets local operating procedures\n and NIMS/ICS and NFPA standards. By creating such a HazMat Incident Command System credentialing component for the Philadelphia Fire Department, we will have produced a concrete roadmap for other organizations to create their own standards-based credentia\nling program. Amethyst Research will accomplish this goal by 1) creating a comprehensive set of HazMat incident scenarios, 2) developing reliable evaluation metrics and competency- assessment credentialing processes, 3) developing support for metrics captu\nre and reporting, and 4) evaluating the credentialing processes on representative sample. This project aims to mature a software simulation tool called HazCommand for training emergency responders in command and control, strategy, tactics, and communicatio\nn, into a full-fledged learning platform.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes unique column packings for the fast high-performance HPLC of biomacromolecules. Initial focus will be on developing techniques to modify the chemistry of silica surfaces using hydrothermal methods,\n so that biomolecular separations are optimized for efficiency, peak shape and compound yields. Second, three new particle types will be synthesized and tested, with two of the new particles optimized for the rapid separation of peptides and proteins, resp\nectively. The third new particle type is for the high-speed separation of larger biomolecular weight components by size-exclusion (gel filtration) liquid chromatography. In Phase 1 grant, 1R43GM077688-01, we developed unique  fused-core  silica microsphere\ns using new nanoparticle technology. These particles are prepared by a proprietary multi- multilayering method that permits the fabrication of strong porous outer shells on solid silica cores. The outer shells can be made with different thicknesses and por\ne sizes, depending on intended application. Narrow-pore fused-core particles recently were commercialized to produce HaloTM columns. These columns demonstrate very fast separations of pharmaceutical and small biological compounds because of unusually high \nchromatographic efficiency and excellent mass transfer (kinetic) properties. Because of an extremely narrow particle size distribution and higher particle density, packed columns of fused-core particles demonstrate superior efficiency and unusual stability\n at high mobile phase flow rates and column inlet pressures. The proposed program will synthesize new wide-pore particles that have the pore size, particle size, outer shell thickness and surface chemistry optimized for the rapid separation of peptides, pr\noteins, DNA fragments, and other higher molecular weight biomacromolecules. These new fused-core particles will be superior for proteomic and genetic studies, especially when multidimensional ( 2-D ) separations are needed, and are highly suited for HPLC/M\nS bioscience applications.        The new materials proposed in this project for rapid high-resolution liquid chromatographic separations will strongly enhance research efforts in proteomics, DNA-based studies and related bioscience applications. The incre\nased capability for rapid characterizations and measurements will assist in the search for defining the cause and cure of disease-related problems, help in developing new drugs and support projects to improve the environment and general health.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment of metastatic tumors is a major health challenge. Recently, antibody-based therapies have been developed that are more specific and have fewer side effects compared with conventional chemotherapy. However, the\n potency of most antibody therapeutics is limited by their inadequate ability to kill tumor cells. Consequently, there is an urgent, unmet need to develop therapeutics that combine the specificity of antibodies for tumor tissues with a potent cytotoxic fun\nction. The development of tumor-targeted toxins has yielded promising results and led to one approved product, Ontak (Denileukin). Most molecules however are immunogenic and aggregation prone, have limited stability and require complex manufacturing routes\n. To achieve clinical and commercial success it is critical for candidates to meet following criteria: 1) high potency; 2) low systemic toxicity; 3) low immunogenicity; 4) high protein stability, lack of aggregation; 5) robust manufacturing. This proposal \naims to develop tumor-targeted toxins by combining three elements that confer significant advantages over current approaches: microproteins for tumor binding/internalization; RNAse for cell killing; rPEG to optimize PK properties. In the successful Phase I\n of this project, we developed tumor-specific microproteins with the following properties: 1) efficient production in E. coli; 2) efficient phage display that enables rapid specificity optimization; 3) effective internalization of toxic payloads; 4) excell\nent serum stability. In a separate phase I SBIR project, we developed rPEGs, hydrophilic protein sequences that mimic the properties of chemical polyethylene glycol (PEG) but can be directly fused to other proteins. rPEGs optimize the pharmacokinetics of a\n product, reduce product immunogenicity, and greatly reduce protein aggregation. Our Phase II goal is to optimize the specificity of our lead microproteins to achieve a gt1000x ration of tumor/normal affinity. Subsequently, we will fuse these optimized mic\nroproteins to RNAse as toxic payload and rPEG to optimize PK, PD and protein manufacturing. The resulting fusion proteins will be thoroughly evaluated for in vitro and in vivo performance. In addition, we will develop an effective manufacturing process tha\nt can be transferred with minor modifications to a GMP manufacturer. We aim to generate two lead molecules that will be ready to enter preclinical followed by clinical development. In addition we will generate microprotein-rPEG fusions with defined conjuga\ntion sites that will be uniquely suitable for the chemical conjugation of toxic payloads.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of tumor-targeted toxins have yielded promising results and led to one approved product, Denileukin. However, existing\n molecules have significant limitations especially immunogenicity and complex manufacturing requirements. This project will use tumor-specific microproteins to address these limitations and develop targeted toxins with the following characteristics: 1) hig\nh potency; 2) low systemic toxicity; 3) low immunogenicity to allow repeat dosing; 4) good protein stability; 5) lack of aggregation; 6) robust manufacturing process.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The market for protein-based biopharmaceuticals is rapidly expanding. However, the clinical utility of many proteins is limited by their short serum half-life, requiring frequent injections. The most common approach to \nimprove serum half-life is PEGylation. The chemical conjugation of Polyethylene glycol (PEG) to therapeutic proteins typically results in product mixtures that include inactive isomers and reduce the overall potency of the product. The chemical PEGylation \nof proteins significantly increases manufacturing costs, requiring precise process control and analytical assays to ensure reproducibility of product composition. The current project describes polypeptide chains (called rPEGs) that mimic the physicochemica\nl properties of chemical PEG. rPEGs are hydrophilic and have very large hydrodynamic radii. Most importantly, rPEGs can be recombinantly fused to therapeutic proteins resulting in homogeneous products. The fusion of rPEGs to biopharmaceutical is expected t\no provide benefits that are similar to chemical PEGylation (long serum half-life, reduced immunogenicity) while offering improved product potency, homogeneity, and significantly reduced manufacturing costs. Phase I of this project was extremely successful \nand demonstrated the feasibility of the rPEG technology. rPEG sequences that closely mimic the properties of chemical PEG were developed. We demonstrated that a 20 kDa rPEG sequence has an apparent molecular weight of 180 kDa. Fusion of rPEG to the model p\nrotein GFP increased its serum half-life in rats from 1-3 h to approximately 10 h, similar to the effect of chemical PEGylation. Furthermore, this rPEG-GFP fusion elicited only a very weak immune response in rats. Our phase II goal is to apply rPEG technol\nogy to human growth hormone (hGH). hGH is currently used for the treatment of dwarfism in children. 2006 sales exceeded  3B. Due to its rapid plasma elimination, hGH treatment requires daily injections. No long-acting form of hGH has been approved and chem\nical PEGylation of hGH had limited success due to the formation of mixtures containing inactive isomers. We aim to develop methods for the production, purification, and formulation of rPEG-hGH. The resulting product will be thoroughly characterized in vitr\no and in vivo. The resulting data package will allow rPEG- hGH to enter clinical development. The methods and data developed during the project will validate rPEG technology and enable its broad application to other protein pharmaceuticals.        PUBLIC H\nEALTH RELEVANCE: The utility of many biopharmaceuticals is limited by their short serum half-life, which requires frequent injections. The goal of this project is to develop recombinant peptide chains (called rPEG) that mimic the properties of polyethylene\n glycol. These rPEGs can be directly fused to protein pharmaceuticals to increase their serum half-life. We will validate rPEG technology by developing a long-acting version of human growth hormone for the treatment of dwarfism in children.",

Particulate emissions from diesel engines are viewed as a significant health hazard. New diesel fuel and exhaust emission regulations to be phased in through 2010 require that diesel engine exhaust be extensively cleaned; current purification products are considered too large, too expensive and impose too great a fuel economy penalty on the diesel engine. A particulate filtration system that continuously oxidizes particulate matter using oxygen contained in the engine exhaust and does not require regeneration will be prepared, characterized and refined. The technology that will be developed has the capability to remove ultra-fine particulates with dimensions as small as 20 nm.  The broader impact/commercial potential from the technology will enhance the scientific understanding of the synthesis and stability of novel ceramic nanostructures as well as the interaction of soot with dispersed catalytic species. The successful application of this technology will lower the cost of purifying diesel engine exhaust, enabling wider application of highly fuel efficient diesel engines, which will in turn reduce the overall fuel consumption and pollutant emissions.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prematurely born infants and term infants with congenital heart disease often develop neurogenic dysphagia, a life-threatening condition characterized by difficulty in coordinating swallowing and breathing during breast\n and bottle feeding, resulting in a failure to gain weight and increased risk of pneumonia or death, due to taking fluid into the lungs.         During Phase I, Infoscitex successfully designed and built a prototype of a computer-controlled bottle feeding \nsystem for dispensing either thin-consistency or nectar-thick fluids to dysphagic infants on the basis of sucking and respiration sensor signals.         Phase II makes several major advances in the design and capabilities of the active bottle that have re\nsulted from the Phase I bench tests and Dr. Goldfield's ongoing research into swallowing by premature infants. The Active Bottle for infants with neurogenic dysphagia is evaluated during Phase II by means of a clinical trial consisting of tests involving d\nispensing of thin or thick fluids. At the same time, the Active Bottle is advanced towards a commercial home-care product.         Close collaboration between the engineering team at Infoscitex and the clinical teams at both Children's Hospital Boston and \nBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center throughout the project, will ensure that clinical trials with the Active Bottle are successful. Positive clinical results, along with the evolution of the Active Bottle towards a more ergonomic, less expensive, home car\ne system will allow infants with feeding problems caused by neurogenic dysphasia a safer and more effective means for feeding, while reducing development of aspiration-induced pneumonia, and hastening NICU discharge of infants with neurogenic dysphagia, re\nducing NICU cost and allowing infants to come home to their families sooner.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Premature infants born less than 33 weeks gestational age, or born at term with congenital heart disease, have a higher risk of brain injury than h\nealthy term infants. These two groups of infants are also more likely to experience swallowing and other coordination problems during bottle feedings. Swallowing disorder due to neurological abnormality is called neurogenic dysphagia. During care in the NI\nCU, and eventually during the long term home care after hospital discharge, infants with neurogenic dysphagia may require a feeding protocol that manipulates the properties of the fluids being fed to them. This research is aimed at the development of a com\nputer-controlled milk delivery system that would 1) encourage and maintain proper oral feeding behavior in infants with neurogenic dysphagia, 2) reduce development of aspiration-induced pneumonia, 3) hasten NICU discharge of infants with neurogenic dysphag\nia, reducing NICU cost, and allowing infants to come home to their families sooner.",

Current robotic technology, however, is unsuitable for neurosurgical microsurgery, because of the large working space that is required for the robots, an\nd the fact that the robots were not designed for the tasks that neurosurgeons normally need to do. This grant aims to develop a new class of  micro-robots  to bring the advantages of robotics and minimally-invasive techniques to neurosurgery.         Phase\n II will continue development of steerable micro-robots that could be accurately directed by the neurosurgeon to locations in the brain via a number of entry points. During Phase I, micro-robot prototypes were successfully tested, and requirements for neur\nosurgical micro-robots were identified. In Phase II, prototypes will be developed and tested with phantoms to address a critical subset of these requirements: (1) sufficient miniaturization and degrees of freedom to allow conformance to five envisioned neu\nrosurgical corridors, (2) safe levels of heat exposure to surrounding tissue, and (3) ability to advance or withdraw along neurosurgical corridors without colliding with surrounding tissue. The final study of the project will include animal studies, in whi\nch neurosurgeons on the project team will employ prototypes to navigate five pre-defined neurosurgical corridors. This is a necessary critical step to proving the value of the envisioned micro-robots in neurosurgery.

These geophones perform Vertical Seismic Profiling (VSP) and passive seismic monitoring. However, this geophone technology is currently very expensive to apply \u00c2\u00bf drilling a new well or taking a valuable well out of service is costly.  Consequently, the technology is seldom employed; making it is very difficult to determine whether the CO2 remains where it is intended.  This project will utilize a patented High Pressure Slurry Pump, proven coiled tubing, and a patent-pending supercritical abrasive slurry system to drill low-cost microholes (two inches in diameter) for the permanent installation of small, inexpensive VSP receivers.  Phase I demonstrated the drilling process and identified currently-available geophones that can fit inside the tubing at a depth of 2,000 feet.  Moreover, the geophones were shown to be capable of monitoring fluids in rock at 4-to-5 times that depth.  Phase II will assemble and field-test these combined components, drill up to three wells, equip them with geophones, and conduct a VSP quality-check survey within an existing CO2 flood.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In addition to reducing the cost of CO2 monitoring with VSP, the overall system should find use in conventional oil and gas drilling (vertical and directional), boring, and digging and trenching in hard rock areas; for utility installation of buried pipes and pipelines; and in mining, construction peering, geothermal sinks, and environmental well drilling.",

        "abstract": "Nuclear fusion has the potential to satisfy the prodigious power demands of the future.  It has yet to be harnessed as a practical energy source because of the challenge of finding an economical way to confine and heat the plasma fuel. The main reason for this is the complexity and size of the confinement systems. Essentially, the more massive the system required to confine and heat the fusion plasma, the higher the cost to develop and operate. A simpler path to fusion can be achieved by creating fusion conditions in a different regime at small scale (~ a few centimeters). This project uses developments in the very compact, high energy density regime of fusion commonly referred to as a Field Reversed Configuration (FRC). To make fusion practical at this smaller scale, an efficient method for compressing the FRC to fusion conditions is required. This project will use a plasma shell to compress and heat the FRC plasmoid. The closed magnetic field in the target plasmoid suppresses the thermal transport to the confining shell, lowering the imploding power needed to compress the target. With this configuration, many of the difficulties encountered with the implosion power technology are eliminated or minimized. This project will evaluate the feasibility of achieving fusion conditions from this comparatively simple and relatively low cost approach to fusion.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In Phase I, the FRC plasmoid accelerator demonstrated the dynamic formation of a FRC suitable for the plasma liner compression experiment. In phase II a high density FRC plasmoid will be formed and accelerated into a compression chamber. The FRC will then be rapidly compressed by a deuterium plasma liner to fusion temperatures and densities. Experimental success would establish the concept at the \u00c2\u00bfproof of principle\u00c2\u00bf level and the follow-on phase III effort would focus on the development of the concept into a fusion gain device.",

        "abstract": "Project Summary/Abstract Project Summary: Harmful concentrations of metals enter the environment in significant quantities via numerous industrial activities. They are not readily detoxified by natural processes and pose lasting environmental hazards. This\n project's long-term application enhances public health by lessening exposure to toxic metals by reducing their release into the environment. To accomplish this, a novel, versatile, and improved electrowinning technology to remove and reclaim a variety of \ntarget hazardous and persistent metal contaminants from dilute sources such as Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) is being developed. Phase I successfully demonstrated concept technical viability and experimentally verified the new technology. The technology exhibit\ns dramatically better performance than competing electrowinning technologies, allowing it to economically treat dilute metal streams that are currently impractical to address by existing methods. Objectives: Phase II will extend the Phase I work and seek t\no create a complete pilot-scale 10 gallon per minute (GPM) water treatment system incorporating the new technology, demonstrate its operation under service conditions, and position the technology for commercialization. Accomplishing these goals will provid\ne an example of the technology of sufficient size and technical maturity for commercial utility while also showing real-world practical utility. A metal removal business will be developed around this technology. Proposed Activity: The Phase II objectives w\nill be achieved by completing the following activities stepwise.  ? Create a 10 GPM electrowinning cell element as the fundamental technology building block.  ? Create a 10 GPM multi-stage treatment module using the cell elements.  ? Verify the multi-stage\n module performance and select preferred operation parameters.  ? Incorporate the multi-stage module into a portable pilot-scale prototype metal recovery system.  ? Design and implement a short-term field demonstration of the prototype metal recovery syste\nm.  ? Evaluate the field test results to refine the business model, pursue follow-on funding (private and  public), and prepare a marketing strategy. Methods Employed: The proposed activities will be accomplished using the following methods.  ? The cell de\nsign will be refined and scaled using performance trends determined in Phase I.  ? Laboratory batch and flow-through tests optimizing the electrowinning of selected contaminant  metals from synthetic and actual AMD using the technology will be utilized.  ?\n Plating efficiency, metal removal rate, system power consumption, plus physical and performance  stability will be determined as a function of selected module operating parameters.  ? The field-trial will mirror flow-through laboratory tests and employ re\nlevant protocols adapted from  the EPA Mine Waste Technology Program (MWTP) Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) 2006. Project Narrative The mature version of the new technology that was successfully proved under Phase I will enhance public health by less\nening the amounts of toxic metals entering the environment. The technology works with a variety of metals singly or in mixtures, can be used to treat a wide range of contaminant sources, and allows the practical removal and reclamation of low concentration\ns of metals in water that competing technologies can not address. The metal reclamation achieved provides an economic incentive to treat sources currently allowed to contaminate the environment.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the United States. In 2007, about 67,160 new cases of bladder cancer will be diagnosed and 13,750 patients will die of these diseases. Transitional cell carcinoma accou\nnts for more than 90% of bladder cancers. Approximately 70-80% of bladder cancer patients present with superficial tumors. Superficial bladder cancer is managed usually by transurethral resection of the tumor with or without fulguration, and adjuvant intra\nvesical chemotherapy. Between 40 to 80% of patients treated by transurethral resection develop recurrent tumors, and between 10 to 20% of recurrent disease present with grade and/or stage progression. Intravesical immunotherapy and chemotherapy reduces the\n disease recurrence rate. Through a series of preclinical and clinical studies, an important lesson learned is that the efficacy of intravesical mitomycin (MMC) or doxorubicin therapy is limited by two factors, i.e., inadequate drug delivery to tumor cells\n and low chemosensitivity of the more rapidly proliferating tumors. We subsequently identified an optimized method to enhance the delivery of MMC to superficial bladder tumors, and tested this method in a randomized, two-arm NCI-supported international pha\nse III trial in 14 academic centers. The results confirm our hypothesis that maximizing the MMC delivery significantly improves the recurrence-free rate, from 23% in the standard arm to 43% in the optimized arm. This substantial improvement highlights the \nimportance of adequate drug delivery in this treatment modality. The remaining challenge is to develop an effective treatment for the remaining patients (~60%) who cannot be managed by intravesical MMC. During the Phase I SBIR grant, we evaluated several d\nrug carriers and identified paclitaxel-loaded gelatin nanoparticles (PNP) as the candidate. The completed in vitro and in vivo studies showed favorable drug release and bladder tissue penetration properties, and significant antitumor activity. The goal of \nthe previous Phase I SBIR grant was to develop a formulation of paclitaxel suitable for intravesical treatment. An added advantage of selecting paclitaxel is due to (a) it has activity against bladder cancer, (b) it is lipophilic and therefore can readily \npartition across the urothelium, (c) it binds to tissues and therefore is retained beyond the 2-hr duration of the intravesical therapy, and (d) it can induce apoptosis through p53-dependent and -independent pathways and is therefore active in tumors with \nwild type p53 or mutated p53 activity against p53. The activity in p53-mutated tumors is desirable as 60% of bladder tumors has mutated p53 and because MMC induces apoptosis through p53-dependent pathways and is therefore not active against tumors with mut\nated p53. Studies conducted during the phase I R43 grant support the use of intravesical PNP for the treatment of superficial bladder cancer. The present phase II SBIR application is directed at advancing the development of PNP toward clinical evaluation. \nWe proposed to conduct cGMP manufacturing, analysis and testing to meet FDA requirement, GLP preclinical toxicology, pre-IND meeting with FDA, final IND filing, and design of clinical development strategy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:The current proposal is to\n develop a novel therapeutic approach to treat cancer, with a focus on bladder cancers in particular.",
